It lies in the wide valley of the River Gera, in the southern part of the Thuringian Basin, north of the Thuringian Forest, and in the middle of a line of the six largest Thuringian cities (\"\"), stretching from Eisenach in the west, via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar and Jena, to Gera in the east. Together with Kassel and G\u00f6ttingen, it is one of the cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants lying closest to the geographic centre of Germany. Erfurt is south-west of Leipzig, north-east of Frankfurt, south-west of Berlin and north of Munich.\nErfurt's old town is one of the best preserved medieval city centres in Germany. The Gera is spanned by the Merchants' Bridge (\"Kr\u00e4merbr\u00fccke\"), one of the rare bridges with houses built on it. On the Erfurt Cathedral Hill is the ensemble of Erfurt Cathedral\u2014which houses the world's largest free-swinging medieval bell\u2014and St Severus' Church. Petersberg Citadel is one of the largest and best preserved town fortresses in Central Europe. Erfurt's Old Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in Europe, and together with the Erfurt Mikveh, which was only rediscovered in 2007, and the Stone House, forms the UNESCO World Heritage Site Jewish-Medieval Heritage of Erfurt.\nThe city's economy is based on agriculture, horticulture and microelectronics. Its central location has made it a logistics hub for Germany and central Europe. Erfurt hosts the second-largest trade fair in eastern Germany (after Leipzig), as well as the public television children's channel KiKa. The city is on the Via Regia, a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network. Erfurt Main Station is the junction of the Nuremberg\u2013Erfurt and the Erfurt\u2013Leipzig/Halle high-speed lines with the Halle\u2013Bebra railway.\nErfurt was first mentioned in 742, as Saint Boniface founded the diocese. Although the town did not belong to any of the Thuringian states politically, it quickly became the economic centre of the region and was a member of the Hanseatic League. It was part of the Electorate of Mainz during the Holy Roman Empire, and became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802. From 1949 until 1990 Erfurt was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nThe University of Erfurt was founded in 1379, making it the first university to be established within the geographic area which constitutes modern Germany. It closed in 1816 and was re-established in 1994. Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) was its most famous student, studying there from 1501 before entering St Augustine's Monastery in 1505. Other noted Erfurters include the medieval philosopher and mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260\u20131328), the Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel (1653\u20131706) and the sociologist Max Weber (1864\u20131920).\nHistory.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nTo the west of Erfurt in Frienstedt existed, in the AD era, a big Germanic village, which was found during the construction of a highway. Where they also discovered the oldest Germanic word ever discovered in Central Germany written in runic script was found on a comb from a sacrificial shaft the word: \"kaba\". From Roman Times, however, they found 200 coins dating back to the third century, plus 150 Roman ceramic fragments and more than 200 fibulae. Also 11 inhumation graves of the Ha\u00dfleben-Leuna group, which is an archeological cultural group.\nThe Melchendorf dig in the southern city part showed a settlement from the Neolithic period. The Thuringii inhabited the Erfurt area in \"c.\"\u00a0480 and gave their name to Thuringia in \"c.\"\u00a0500.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe town is first mentioned in 742 under the name of \"Erphesfurt\": in that year, Saint Boniface wrote to Pope Zachary to inform him that he had established three dioceses in central Germany, one of them \"in a place called Erphesfurt, which for a long time has been inhabited by pagan natives.\" All three dioceses (the other two were W\u00fcrzburg and B\u00fcraburg) were confirmed by Zachary the next year, though in 755 Erfurt was brought into the diocese of Mainz. That the place was populous already is borne out by archeological evidence, which includes 23 graves and six horse burials from the sixth and seventh centuries.\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Erfurt was an important trading town because of its location, near a ford across the Gera river. Together with the other five Thuringian woad towns of Gotha, Tennstedt, Arnstadt and Langensalza it was the centre of the German woad trade, which made those cities very wealthy. Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the Via Regia was one of the most used east\u2013west roads between France and Russia (via Frankfurt, Erfurt, Leipzig and Wroc\u0142aw) and another route in the north\u2013south direction was the connection between the Baltic Sea ports (e. g. L\u00fcbeck) and the potent upper Italian city-states like Venice and Milan.\nDuring the tenth and eleventh centuries both the Emperor and the Electorate of Mainz held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual \"\" (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today's ). After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town (S\u00f6mmerda). Erfurt became an important regional power between the Landgraviate of Thuringia around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the Electorate of Saxony to the east. Between 1306 and 1481, Erfurt was allied with the two other major Thuringian cities (M\u00fchlhausen and Nordhausen) in the Thuringian City Alliance and the three cities joined the Hanseatic League together in 1430. A peak in economic development was reached in the 15th century, when the city had a population of 20,000 making it one of the largest in Germany. Between 1432 and 1446, a second and higher city wall was established. In 1483, a first city fortress was built on Cyriaksburg hill in the southwestern part of the town.\nIn the year 1184, Erfurt was the location of a notable accident called the \"Erfurter Latrinensturz\" ('Erfurt latrine fall'). King Henry VI held council in a building of the Erfurt Cathedral to negotiate peace between two of his vassals, Archbishop Konrad I of Mainz and Landgrave Ludwig III of Thuringia. The amassed weight of all the gathered men proved too heavy for the floor to bear, which collapsed. According to contemporary accounts, dozens of people fell to their death into the latrine pit below. Ludwig III, Konrad I and Henry VI survived the affair.\nThe Jewish community of Erfurt was founded in the 11th century. Together with the Jewish communities in Mainz, Worms and Speyer, it became one of the most influential in Germany. The Old Synagogue is still extant and is a museum today, as is the mikveh at Gera river near . In 1349, during the wave of Black Death Jewish persecutions across Europe, the Jews of Erfurt were rounded up, with more than 100 killed and the rest driven from the city. Before the persecution, a wealthy Jewish merchant buried his property in the basement of his house. In 1998, this treasure was found during construction works. The Erfurt Treasure with various gold and silver objects is shown in the exhibition in the synagogue today. Only a few years after 1349, the Jews moved back to Erfurt and founded a second community, which was disbanded by the city council in 1454. Because of their exceptional testimony to the life of a medieval Jewish community, the Jewish sites in Erfurt were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023.In 1379, the University of Erfurt was founded. Together with the University of Cologne it was one of the first city-owned universities in Germany, while they were usually owned by the \"\". Some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the \"Latin Quarter\" in the northern city centre (like , student dorms \"\" and others, the hospital and the church of the university). The university quickly became a hotspot of German cultural life in Renaissance humanism with scholars like Ulrich von Hutten, Helius Eobanus Hessus and Justus Jonas.\nEarly modern period.\nIn 1501 Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) moved to Erfurt and began his studies at the university. After 1505, he lived at St. Augustine's Monastery as a friar. In 1507 he was ordained as a priest in Erfurt Cathedral. He moved permanently to Wittenberg in 1511. Erfurt was an early adopter of the Protestant Reformation, in 1521.\nIn 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the Hammelburg Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrank, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city's independence was endangered. In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the Electorate of Mainz and the city lost its independence. The Electorate built a huge fortress on Petersberg hill between 1665 and 1726 to control the city and instituted a governor to rule Erfurt.\nIn 1682 and 1683 Erfurt experienced the worst plague years in its history. In 1683 more than half of the population died because of the deadly disease.\nIn Erfurt, witch-hunts are known to have taken place from 1526 to 1705. Trial records are incomplete. Twenty people were involved in witch trials, and at least eight people died.\nDuring the late 18th century, Erfurt saw another cultural peak. Governor Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg had close relations with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Johann Gottfried Herder, Christoph Martin Wieland and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who often visited him at his court in Erfurt.\nErfurt during the Napoleonic Wars.\nErfurt became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802, to compensate for territories Prussia lost to France on the Left Bank of the Rhine. In the Capitulation of Erfurt, the city, its 12,000 Prussian and Saxon defenders under William VI, Prince of Orange-Nassau, 65 artillery pieces, and the Petersberg Citadel and Cyriaksburg Citadel , were handed over to the French on 16 October 1806.&lt;ref name=\"Petre 1907/1993\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the capitulation, Joachim Murat, Marshal of France, had about 16,000 troops near Erfurt. With the attachment of the Saxe-Weimar territory of Blankenhain, the city became part of the First French Empire in 1806 as the Principality of Erfurt, directly subordinate to Napoleon as an \"imperial state domain\" (), separate from the Confederation of the Rhine, which the surrounding Thuringian states had joined. Erfurt was administered by a civilian and military Senate (\"\") under a French governor, based in the , previously the seat of the city's governor under the Electorate. Napoleon first visited the principality on 23 July 1807, inspecting the citadels and fortifications. In 1808, the Congress of Erfurt was held with Napoleon and Alexander I of Russia visiting the city.\nDuring their administration, the French introduced street lighting and a tax on foreign horses to pay for maintaining the road surface. The suffered under the French occupation, with its inventory being auctioned off to other local churches \u2013 including the organ, bells and even the tower of the chapel (\"\") \u2013 and the former monastery's library being donated to the University of Erfurt (and then to the Boineburg Library when the university closed in 1816). Similarly the Cyriaksburg Citadel was damaged by the French, with the city-side walls being partially dismantled in the hunt for imagined treasures from the convent, workers being paid from the sale of the building materials.\nIn 1811, to commemorate the birth of the Prince Imperial, a ceremonial column (') of wood and plaster was erected on the common. Similarly, the ' \u2013 a Greek-style temple topped by a winged victory with shield, sword and lance and containing a bust of Napoleon sculpted by Friedrich D\u00f6ll \u2013 was erected in the ' woods, including a grotto with fountain and flower beds, using a large pond (') from the , inaugurated with ceremony on 14 August 1811 after extravagant celebrations for Napoleon's birthday, which were repeated in 1812 with a concert in the conducted by Louis Spohr.\nWith the Sixth Coalition forming after French defeat in Russia, on 24 February 1813 Napoleon ordered the Petersburg Citadel to prepare for siege, visiting the city on 25 April to inspect the fortifications, in particular both Citadels. On 10 July 1813, Napoleon put Alexandre d'Alton, baron of the Empire, in charge of the defences of Erfurt. However, when the French decreed that 1000 men would be conscripted into the , the recruits were joined by other citizens in rioting on 19 July that led to 20 arrests, of whom 2 were sentenced to death by French court-martial; as a result, the French ordered the closure of all inns and alehouses.\nWithin a week of the Sixth Coalition's decisive victory at Leipzig (16\u201319 October 1813), however, Erfurt was besieged by Prussian, Austrian and Russian troops under the command of Prussian Lt Gen von Kleist. After a first capitulation signed by d'Alton on 20 December 1813 the French troops withdrew to the two fortresses of Petersberg and Cyriaksburg, allowing for the Coalition forces to march into Erfurt on 6 January 1814 to jubilant greetings; the ' ceremonial column was burned and destroyed as a symbol of the citizens' oppression under the French; similarly the ' was burned on 1 November 1813 and completely destroyed by Erfurters and their besiegers in 1814. After a call for volunteers 3 days later, 300 Erfurters joined the Coalition armies in France. Finally, in May 1814, the French capitulated fully, with 1,700 French troops vacating the Petersberg and Cyriaksburg fortresses. During the two and a half months of siege, the mortality rate rose in the city greatly; 1,564 Erfurt citizens died in 1813, around a thousand more than the previous year.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, Erfurt was restored to Prussia on 21 June 1815, becoming the capital of one of the three districts (\"\") of the new Province of Saxony, but some southern and eastern parts of Erfurter lands joined Blankenhain in being transferred to the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach the following September. Although enclosed by Thuringian territory in the west, south and east, the city remained part of the Prussian Province of Saxony until 1944.\nSince 1815.\nAfter the 1848 Revolution, many Germans desired to have a united national state. An attempt in this direction was the failed Erfurt Union of German states in 1850.\nThe Industrial Revolution reached Erfurt in the 1840s, when the Thuringian Railway connecting Berlin and Frankfurt was built. During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the \"Royal Gun Factory of Prussia\" in 1862. After the Unification of Germany in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed. The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (such as a tramway, hospitals, and schools) improved rapidly. The number of inhabitants grew from 40,000 around 1870 to 130,000 in 1914, and the city expanded in all directions.\nThe \"Erfurt Program\" was adopted by the Social Democratic Party of Germany during its congress at Erfurt in 1891.\nBetween the wars, the city kept growing. Housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the Weimar Republic. The Great Depression between 1929 and 1932 led to a disaster for Erfurt, nearly one out of three became unemployed. Conflicts between far-left and far-right-oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new Nazi government and Adolf Hitler. Others, especially some communist workers, put up resistance against the new administration. In 1938, the new synagogue was destroyed during the . Jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to Nazi concentration camps (together with many communists). In 1914, the company \"Topf and Sons\" began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry. Under the Nazis, \"JA Topf &amp; Sons\" supplied specially developed crematoria, ovens and associated plants to the Auschwitz-Birkenau, Buchenwald and Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camps. On 27 January 2011 a memorial and museum dedicated to the Holocaust victims was opened at the former company premises in Erfurt.\nDuring World War II, Erfurt experienced more than 27 British and American air raids, about 1600 civilians died. Bombed as a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, Erfurt suffered only limited damage and was captured on 12 April 1945, by the US 80th Infantry Division. On 3 July, American troops left the city, which then became part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation and eventually of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1948, Erfurt became the capital of Thuringia, replacing Weimar. In 1952, the in the GDR were dissolved in favour of centralization under the new socialist government. Erfurt then became the capital of a new \"\" (district). In 1953, the of education was founded, followed by the of medicine in 1954, the first academic institutions in Erfurt since the closing of the university in 1816.\nOn 19 March 1970, the East and West German heads of government Willi Stoph and Willy Brandt met in Erfurt, the first such meeting since the division of Germany. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the economic situation in GDR worsened, many old buildings in city centre decayed, while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large settlements in the periphery. The Peaceful Revolution of 1989/1990 led to German reunification.\nWith the re-formation of the state of Thuringia in 1990, the city became the state capital. After reunification, a deep economic crisis occurred in Eastern Germany. Many factories closed and many people lost their jobs and moved to the former West Germany. At the same time, many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively. In 1994, the new university was opened, as was the Fachhochschule in 1991. Between 2005 and 2008, the economic situation improved as the unemployment rate decreased and new enterprises developed. In addition, the population began to increase once again.\nA school shooting occurred on 26 April 2002 at the Gutenberg-Gymnasium.\nSince the 1990s, organized crime has gained a foothold in Erfurt, with several mafia groups, including the Armenian mafia present in the city. Among other events, there has been a robbery and an arson attack targeting the gastronomy sector and in 2014 there was a shoot-out in an open street.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nErfurt is situated in the south of the Thuringian basin, a fertile agricultural area between the Harz mountains to the north and the Thuringian Forest to the southwest. Whereas the northern parts of the city area are flat, the southern ones consist of hilly landscape up to 430 m of elevation. In this part lies the municipal forest of \"\" with beeches and oaks as main tree species. To the east and to the west are some non-forested hills so that the Gera river valley within the town forms a basin. North of the city are some gravel pits in operation, while others are abandoned, flooded and used as leisure areas.\nClimate.\nErfurt has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") bordering on a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of and lows of . Winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of and lows of . The city's topography creates a microclimate caused by the location inside a basin with sometimes inversion in winter (quite cold nights under ) and inadequate air circulation in summer. Annual precipitation is only with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.\nThe Erfurt (Erfurt\u2013Weimar Airport) weather station has recorded the following extreme values:\nAdministrative divisions.\nErfurt abuts the districts of S\u00f6mmerda (municipalities Witterda, Elxleben, Walschleben, Riethnordhausen, N\u00f6da, Alperstedt, Gro\u00dfrudestedt, Udestedt, Kleinm\u00f6lsen and Gro\u00dfm\u00f6lsen) in the north, Weimarer Land (municipalities Niederzimmern, Nohra, M\u00f6nchenholzhausen and Klettbach) in the east, Ilm-Kreis (municipalities Kirchheim, Rockhausen and Amt Wachsenburg) in the south and Gotha (municipalities Nesse-Apfelst\u00e4dt, Nottleben, Zimmernsupra and Bienst\u00e4dt) in the west.\nThe city itself is divided into 53 districts. The centre is formed by the district ' (old town) and the districts ' in the northwest, ' in the northeast, ' in the east, ' in the southeast, ' in the southwest and ' in the west. More former industrial districts are ' (incorporated in 1911), ' and ' in the north. Another group of districts is marked by Plattenbau settlements, constructed during the East Germany period: ', ', ', ' and ' in the northern as well as ', ' and ' in the southern city parts.\nEventually, there are many villages with an average population of approximately 1,000 which were incorporated during the 20th century; they have mostly retained a rural character to date, however:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nErfurt-Southeast.\nErfurt-Southeast () is the collective name for a series of prefabricated housing areas that emerged in the southeast of Erfurt in the last ten years of East Germany. After Erfurt-Nord, Erfurt-S\u00fcdost is the second-largest prefabricated building area in the city. The problems associated with large housing estates are not as pronounced in the southeast as in the north, but they are still present.\nThe districts of Melchendorf, Herrenberg and Wiesenh\u00fcgel belong to Erfurt-S\u00fcdost, all of which were formed from the former local area of Melchendorf. The village of Melchendorf with around 1,000 inhabitants lies between the prefabricated building areas. In addition to the old village, the district of Melchendorf also includes the prefab housing areas of Drosselberg and Buchenberg as well as several four-story apartment blocks from the 1950s and 1960s on . Around 24,000 people still live in the large settlement, which was once designed for almost 40,000 inhabitants.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAround the year 1500, the city had 18,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest cities in the Holy Roman Empire. The population then more or less stagnated until the 19th\u00a0century. The population of Erfurt was 21,000 in 1820, and increased to 32,000 in 1847, the year of rail connection as industrialization began. In the following decades Erfurt grew up to 130,000 at the beginning of World War I and 190,000 inhabitants in 1950. A maximum was reached in 1988 with 220,000 persons. In 1991, after the German reunification and when Erfurt became the capital of Thuringia state, it had a population of about 205,000. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 200,000 in 2002 before rising again to 206,000 in 2011. The average growth of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.68 % p.\u00a0a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Erfurt. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. Erfurt is also the 10th-largest city in Germany by area with area of .\nThe birth deficit was 200 in 2012, this is \u22121.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: \u22124.5; national average: \u22122.4). The net migration rate was +8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: \u22120.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Erfurt migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan and Hungary. Erfurt is today one of the popular cities in former East Germany due to its universities and broadcasting companies.\nLike other cities within the area of former East Germany, foreigners account only for a small share of Erfurt's population: c.\u00a03.0 % are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.9 % are migrants (according to the 2011 European Union census).\nDue to the official atheism of the former communist East German regime, most of the population is non-religious. 14.8 % are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 6.8 % are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census). The Jewish community consists of 500 members. Most of them migrated to Erfurt from Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s.\nCulture, sights and cityscape.\nResidents notable in cultural history.\nThe theologian, philosopher and mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260\u20131328) entered the Dominican monastery () in Erfurt when he was aged about 18 (around 1275). Eckhart was the Dominican prior at Erfurt from 1294 until 1298, and Vicar of Thuringia from 1298 to 1302. After a year in Paris, he returned to Erfurt in 1303 and administered his duties as Provincial of Saxony from there until 1311.\nMartin Luther (1483\u20131546) studied law and philosophy at the University of Erfurt from 1501. He lived in St\u00a0Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt, as a friar from 1505 to 1511.\nJohann Pachelbel (1653\u20131706) served as organist at the (Preachers Church) in Erfurt from June 1678 until August 1690. Pachelbel composed approximately seventy pieces for organ while in Erfurt.\nThe city is the birthplace of one of Johann Sebastian Bach's cousins, Johann Bernhard Bach, as well as Johann Sebastian Bach's father Johann Ambrosius Bach. Bach's parents were married in 1668 in the (Merchant's Church) that still exists on the main square of .\nMax Weber (1864\u20131920) was born in Erfurt. He was a sociologist, philosopher, lawyer, and political economist whose ideas have profoundly influenced modern social theory and social research.\nAfter 1906 the composer Richard Wetz (1875\u20131935) lived in Erfurt and became the leading person in the city's musical life. His major works were written here, including three symphonies, a Requiem and a Christmas Oratorio.\nThe textile designer Margaretha Reichardt (1907\u20131984) was born and died in Erfurt. She studied at the Bauhaus from 1926 to 1930, and while there worked with Marcel Breuer on his innovative chair designs. Her former home and weaving workshop in Erfurt, the \"Margaretha Reichardt Haus\", is now a museum, managed by the Angermuseum Erfurt.\nFamous contemporary musicians from Erfurt are Clueso, the Boogie Pimps and Yvonne Catterfeld.\nMuseums.\nErfurt has a great variety of museums:\nTheatre.\nSince 2003, the modern opera house is home to Theater Erfurt and its Philharmonic Orchestra. The \"grand stage\" section has 800 seats and the \"studio stage\" can hold 200 spectators. In September 2005, the opera \"Waiting for the Barbarians\" by Philip Glass premiered in the opera house. The Erfurt Theatre has been a source of controversy. In 2005, a performance of Engelbert Humperdinck's opera \"\" stirred up the local press since the performance contained suggestions of pedophilia and incest. The opera was advertised in the programme with the addition \"for adults only\".\nOn 12 April 2008, a version of Verdi's opera \" directed by Johann Kresnik opened at the Erfurt Theatre. The production stirred deep controversy by featuring nude performers in Mickey Mouse masks dancing on the ruins of the World Trade Center and a female singer with a painted on Hitler toothbrush moustache performing a straight arm Nazi salute, along with sinister portrayals of American soldiers, Uncle Sam, and Elvis Presley impersonators. The director described the production as a populist critique of modern American society, aimed at showing up the disparities between rich and poor. The controversy prompted one local politician to call for locals to boycott the performances, but this was largely ignored and the premi\u00e8re was sold out.\nSport.\nNotable types of sport in Erfurt are athletics, ice skating, cycling (with the oldest velodrome in use in the world, opened in 1885), swimming, handball, volleyball, tennis and football. The city's football club is a member of the and is based in the . The \" was the second indoor speed skating arena in Germany. It hosted the 2002 edition of the European Speed Skating Championships (German: Eisschnelllauf-Mehrkampfeuropameisterschaft).\nCityscape.\nErfurt's cityscape features a medieval core of narrow, curved alleys in the centre surrounded by a belt of \" architecture, created between 1873 and 1914. In 1873, the city's fortifications were demolished and it became possible to build houses in the area in front of the former city walls. In the following years, Erfurt saw a construction boom. In the northern area (districts Andreasvorstadt, Johannesvorstadt and Ilversgehofen) tenements for the factory workers were built whilst the eastern area (Kr\u00e4mpfervorstadt and Daberstedt) featured apartments for white-collar workers and clerks and the southwestern part (L\u00f6bervorstadt and Br\u00fchlervorstadt) with its beautiful valley landscape saw the construction of villas and mansions of rich factory owners and notables.\nDuring the interwar period, some settlements in Bauhaus style were realized, often as housing cooperatives.\nAfter World War II and over the whole GDR period, housing shortages remained a problem even though the government started a big apartment construction programme. Between 1970 and 1990 large settlements with high-rise blocks on the northern (for 50,000 inhabitants) and southeastern (for 40,000 inhabitants) periphery were constructed. After reunification the renovation of old houses in city centre and the \" areas was a big issue. The federal government granted substantial subsidies, so that many houses could be restored.\nCompared to many other German cities, little of Erfurt was destroyed in World War II. This is one reason why the centre today offers a mixture of medieval, Baroque and Neoclassical architecture as well as buildings from the last 150 years.\nPublic green spaces are located along Gera river and in several parks like the ', the ' and the \"\". The largest green area is the Egapark, a horticultural exhibition park and botanic garden established in 1961.\nSights and architectural heritage.\nChurches, monasteries and synagogues.\nThe city centre has about 25 churches and monasteries, most of them in Gothic style, some also in Romanesque style or a mixture of Romanesque and Gothic elements, and a few in later styles. The various steeples characterize the medieval centre and led to one of Erfurt's nicknames as the \"Thuringian Rome\".\nSynagogues.\nThe oldest parts of Erfurt's \"Alte Synagoge\" (Old Synagogue) date to the 11th century. It was used until 1349 when the Jewish community was destroyed in a pogrom known as the Erfurt Massacre. The building had many other uses since then. It was conserved in the 1990s and in 2009 it became a museum of Jewish history. A rare Mikveh, a ritual bath, dating from c.1250, was discovered by archeologists in 2007. It has been accessible to visitors on guided tours since September 2011. The Jewish heritage of Erfurt including the Old Synagogue and Mikveh became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in September 2023 and is the second Jewish heritage in Germany that is listed on UNESCO.\nAs religious freedom was granted in the 19th century, some Jews returned to Erfurt. They built their synagogue on the banks of the Gera river and used it from 1840 until 1884. The neoclassical building is known as the \"Kleine Synagoge\" (Small Synagogue). Today it is used an events centre. It is also open to visitors.\nA larger synagogue, the \"Gro\u00dfe Synagoge\" (Great Synagogue), was opened in 1884 because the community had become larger and wealthier. This moorish style building was destroyed during nationwide Nazi riots, known as on 9\u201310 November 1938.\nIn 1947 the land which the Great Synagogue had occupied was returned to the Jewish community and they built their current place of worship, the \"Neue Synagoge\" (New Synagogue) which opened in 1952. It was the only synagogue building erected under communist rule in East Germany.\nSecular architecture.\nBesides the religious buildings there is a lot of historic secular architecture in Erfurt, mostly concentrated in the city centre, but some 19th- and 20th-century buildings are located on the outskirts.\nFortifications.\nFrom 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries.\nAfter German Unification in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created German Empire. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today. A piece of inner wall can be found in a small park at the corner Juri-Gagarin-Ring and Johannesstra\u00dfe and another piece at the flood ditch (\"Flutgraben\") near Franckestra\u00dfe. There is also a small restored part of the wall in the Br\u00fchler Garten, behind the Catholic orphanage. Only one of the wall's fortified towers was left standing, on Boyneburgufer, but this was destroyed in an air raid in 1944.\nThe Petersberg Citadel is one of the largest and best preserved city fortresses in Europe, covering an area of 36 hectares in the north-west of the city centre. It was built from 1665 on Petersberg hill and was in military use until 1963. Since 1990, it has been significantly restored and is now open to the public as an historic site.\nThe Cyriaksburg Citadel is a smaller citadel south-west of the city centre, dating from 1480. Today, it houses the German horticulture museum.\n19th- and 20th-century architecture in the outskirts.\nBetween 1873 and 1914, a belt of ' architecture emerged around the city centre. The mansion district in the south-west around , and hosts some interesting ' and \"Art Nouveau\" buildings.\nThe \"M\u00fchlenviertel\" (\"mill quarter\"), is an area of beautiful Art Nouveau apartment buildings, cobblestone streets and street trees just to the north of the old city, in the vicinity of Nord Park, bordered by the Gera river on its east side. The Schmale Gera stream runs through the area. In the Middle Ages numerous small enterprises using the power of water mills occupied the area, hence the name \"M\u00fchlenviertel\", with street names such as Waidm\u00fchlenweg (woad, or indigo, mill way), Storchm\u00fchlenweg (stork mill way) and Papierm\u00fchlenweg (paper mill way).\nThe \"Bauhaus\" style is represented by some housing cooperative projects in the east around and and in the north around . Lutherkirke Church in (1927), is an Art Deco building.\nThe former malt factory \"Wolff\" at in the east of Erfurt is a large industrial complex built between 1880 and 1939, and in use until 2000. A new use has not been found yet, but the area is sometimes used as a location in movie productions because of its atmosphere.\nExamples of Nazi architecture include the buildings of the (Thuringian parliament) and (an event hall) in the south at . While the building (1930s) represents more the neo-Roman/fascist style, (1940s) is marked by some neo-Germanic \" style elements.\nThe Stalinist early-GDR style is manifested in the main building of the university at (1953) and the later more international modern GDR style is represented by the horticultural exhibition centre \" at , the housing complexes like Rieth or and the redevelopment of and area along in the city centre.\nThe current international glass and steel architecture is dominant among most larger new buildings like the Federal Labour Court of Germany (1999), the new opera house (2003), the new main station (2007), the university library, the Erfurt Messe (convention centre) and the ice rink.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nDuring recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 21% in 2005 to 9% in 2013. Nevertheless, some 14,000 households with 24,500 persons (12% of population) are dependent upon state social benefits (Hartz IV).\nAgriculture, industry and services.\nFarming has a great tradition in Erfurt: the cultivation of woad made the city rich during the Middle Ages. Today, horticulture and the production of flower seeds is still an important business in Erfurt. There is also growing of fruits (like apples, strawberries and sweet cherries), vegetables (e.g. cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage and sugar beets) and grain on more than 60% of the municipal territory.\nIndustrialization in Erfurt started around 1850. Until World War I, many factories were founded in different sectors like engine building, shoes, guns, malt and later electro-technics, so that there was no industrial monoculture in the city. After 1945, the companies were nationalized by the GDR government, which led to the decline of some of them. After reunification, nearly all factories were closed, either because they failed to successfully adopt to a free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises. However, in the early 1990s the federal government started to subsidize the foundation of new companies. It still took a long time before the economic situation stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment has decreased and overall, new jobs were created. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Erfurt with electro-technics, semiconductors and photovoltaics in focus. Engine production, food production, the Braugold brewery, and Born Feinkost, a producer of Thuringian mustard, remain important industries.\nErfurt is an \"\" (which means \"supra-centre\" according to Central place theory) in German regional planning. Such centres are always hubs of service businesses and public services like hospitals, universities, research, trade fairs, retail etc. Additionally, Erfurt is the capital of the federal state of Thuringia, so that there are many institutions of administration like all the Thuringian state ministries and some nationwide authorities. Typical for Erfurt are the logistic business with many distribution centres of big companies, the Erfurt Trade Fair and the media sector with KiKa and MDR as public broadcast stations. A growing industry is tourism, due to the various historical sights of Erfurt. There are 4,800 hotel beds and (in 2012) 450,000 overnight visitors spent a total of 700,000 nights in hotels. Nevertheless, most tourists are one-day visitors from Germany. The Christmas Market in December attracts some 2,000,000 visitors each year.\nTransport.\nBy rail.\nThe ICE railway network puts Erfurt 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 hours from Berlin, 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 hours from Frankfurt, 2 hours from Dresden, and 45 minutes from Leipzig. In 2017, the ICE line to Munich opened, making the trip to Erfurt main station only 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 hours.\nThere are regional trains from Erfurt to Weimar, Jena, Gotha, Eisenach, Bad Langensalza, Magdeburg, Nordhausen, G\u00f6ttingen, M\u00fchlhausen, W\u00fcrzburg, Meiningen, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, and Gera.\nIn freight transport there is an intermodal terminal in the district of Vieselbach \"()\" with connections to rail and the autobahn.\nBy road.\nThe two Autobahnen crossing each other nearby at \"Erfurter Kreuz\" are the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt\u2013Dresden) and the Bundesautobahn 71 (Schweinfurt\u2013Sangerhausen). Together with the east tangent both motorways form a circle road around the city and lead the interregional traffic around the centre. Whereas the A 4 was built in the 1930s, the A 71 came into being after the reunification in the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to both motorways there are two Bundesstra\u00dfen: the Bundesstra\u00dfe 7 connects Erfurt parallel to A 4 with Gotha in the west and Weimar in the east. The Bundesstra\u00dfe 4 is a connection between Erfurt and Nordhausen in the north. Its southern part to Coburg was annulled when A 71 was finished (in this section, the A 71 now effectively serves as B 4). Within the circle road, B 7 and B 4 are also annulled, so that the city government has to pay for maintenance instead of the German federal government. The access to the city is restricted as \" since 2012 for some vehicles. Large parts of the inner city are a pedestrian area which can not be reached by car (except for residents).\nBy light rail and bus.\nThe Erfurt public transport system is marked by the area-wide (light rail) network, established as a tram system in 1883, upgraded to a light rail (\") system in 1997, and continually expanded and upgraded through the 2000s. Today, there are six \"Stadtbahn\" lines running every ten minutes on every light rail route.\nAdditionally, Erfurt operates a bus system, which connects the sparsely populated outer districts of the region to the city center. Both systems are organized by \"SWE EVAG\", a transit company owned by the city administration. The public service, managed by SWE/EVAG, is guaranteed by buses and trams in service from morning until late evening, with a night service starting from midnight until 4AM.\nBy airplane.\nErfurt-Weimar Airport lies west of the city centre. It is linked to the central train station via Stadtbahn (tram). It was significantly extended in the 1990s, with flights mostly to Mediterranean holiday destinations and to London during the peak Christmas market tourist season. Connections to longer haul flights are easily accessible via Frankfurt Airport, which can be reached in 2 hours via a direct train from Frankfurt Airport to Erfurt, and from Leipzig/Halle Airport, which can be reached within half an hour.\nBy bike.\nBiking is becoming increasingly popular since construction of high quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. There are cycle lanes for general commuting within Erfurt city.\nLong-distance trails, such as the \"Gera track\" and the \"\" (Thuringian cities trail), connect points of tourist interest. The former runs along the Gera river valley from the Thuringian Forest to the river Unstrut; the latter follows the medieval Via Regia from Eisenach to Altenburg via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, and Jena.\nThe Rennsteig Cycle Way was opened in 2000. This designated high-grade hiking and bike trail runs along the ridge of the Thuringian Central Uplands. The bike trail, about long, occasionally departs from the course of the historic Rennsteig hiking trail, which dates back to the 1300s, to avoid steep inclines. It is therefore about longer than the hiking trail.\nThe Rennsteig is connected to the E3 European long distance path, which goes from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, and the E6 European long distance path, running from Arctic Finland to Turkey.\nEducation.\nAfter reunification, the educational system was reorganized. The University of Erfurt, founded in 1379 and closed in 1816, was refounded in 1994 with a focus on social sciences, modern languages, humanities and teacher training. Today there are approximately 6,000 students working within four faculties, the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, and three academic research institutes. The university has an international reputation and participates in international student exchange programmes.\nThe \"Fachhochschule Erfurt\", is a university of applied sciences, founded in 1991, which offers a combination of academic training and practical experience in subjects such as social work and social pedagogy, business studies, and engineering. There are nearly 5,000 students in six faculties, of which the faculty of landscaping and horticulture has a national reputation.\nThe International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef \u2013 Bonn (IUBH), is a privately run university with a focus on business and economics. It merged with the former Adam-Ries-Fachhochschule in 2013.\nThe world renowned Bauhaus design school was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar, approximately from Erfurt, 12 minutes by train. The buildings are now part of a World Heritage Site and are today used by the Bauhaus-Universit\u00e4t Weimar, which teaches design, arts, media and technology-related subjects.\nHigher secondary education is provided at eight ', of which six are state-owned, one is Catholic (\"Edith-Stein-Schule\") and one Protestant (\"Evangelisches Ratsgymnasium Erfurt\"). Among the state-owned schools are a ', a boarding school for students highly talented in athletics, swimming, ice skating or football, and the \"Albert-Schweitzer-Gymnasium\" featuring boarding-school classes with additional focus on mathematics, natural sciences and computer science, in addition to the common curriculum.\nMedia.\nThe German national public television children's channel \"KiKa\" is based in Erfurt.\nMDR, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, a radio and television company, has a broadcast centre and studios in Erfurt.\nThe \"Th\u00fcringer Allgemeine\" is a statewide newspaper that is headquartered in the city.\nPolitics.\nMayor and city council.\nThe first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Manfred Ruge of the Christian Democratic Union, who served from 1990 to 2006. From 2006 to 2024, Andreas Bausewein of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) was mayor. Andreas Horn (CDU) was elected in 2024. The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2024, with a runoff held on 9 June, and the results were as follows:\nThe most recent city council election was held on 9 June 2024, and the results were as follows:\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nErfurt is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9482", "revid": "50983476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9482", "title": "Enya", "text": "Irish singer (born 1961)\nEithne P\u00e1draig\u00edn N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in () (born 17 May 1961; anglicised as \"Enya Patricia Brennan\"), known mononymously as Enya, is an Irish singer and composer. With an estimated equivalent of over 80 million albums sold worldwide, Enya is one of the world's best-selling music artists. In addition to being the best-selling Irish solo artist, she is the second-best-selling music act from Ireland overall, after the band U2. Enya's music has been widely recognised for its use of multi-layers of her own vocals and instrumentation, lengthened reverb, and interwoven elements of Celtic music.\nRaised in the Irish-speaking region of Gweedore, Enya began her musical career in 1980 playing alongside her family's Irish folk band, Clannad. She left Clannad in 1982 to pursue a solo career, working with the former Clannad manager and producer, Nicky Ryan, and his wife Roma, as their lyricist. Over the following four years, Enya further developed her sound by combining multi-tracked vocals and keyboards with elements from a variety of musical genres, such as Celtic, classical, Gregorian chant, church, jazz, hip-hop, ambient, world, and Irish folk. Her earliest solo releases were two piano/synthesiser instrumentals for the \"Touch Travel\" T4 cassette compilation (1984) composed around 1982\u201383. The majority of the soundtrack for \"The Frog Prince\" (1985) was composed by Enya, and she sang two songs with lyrics for the project. Enya also composed a body of work for a documentary series by the BBC named \"The Celts.\" A selection of Enya's pieces for \"The Celts\" was released as her self-titled debut album in 1986, with the documentary and BBC Records releases in 1987.\nThe chairman of Warner Music at the time, Rob Dickins, enjoyed listening to Enya's music for \"The Celts\" and signed her with Warner Music UK. The initial record deal granted her considerable artistic freedom and minimal interference. The success of her second studio album, \"Watermark\" (1988), propelled Enya to worldwide fame, primarily through her international hit single \"Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)\". In the following decade and up to the new millennium, she released the multi-million-selling albums \"Shepherd Moons\" (1991), \"The Memory of Trees\" (1995), and \"A Day Without Rain\" (2000). Sales of \"A Day Without Rain\" and its lead single, \"Only Time\", surged in the United States following its use in media coverage of the September 11 attacks. Her subsequent releases included \"Amarantine\" (2005), \"And Winter Came...\" (2008) and \"Dark Sky Island\" (2015).\n\"Boadicea\", a track from her eponymous album, appeared in the soundtrack of Stephen King's 1992 horror film \"Sleepwalkers\" and has since been sampled in several hit songs, including \"Ready or Not\" (1996) by Fugees and \"I Don't Wanna Know\" (2004) featuring Mario Winans, which became the second Number 1 single featuring Enya, in the UK charts. The song, featuring both the synthesiser and Enya humming the melody, continues to be sampled almost 4 decades since its initial 1986 release.\nEnya's accolades include four Grammy Awards, six World Music Awards, and she holds the record as the most-nominated female Irish artist at the BRIT Awards, with four nominations. \"May It Be\", her composition from the soundtrack of \"\" (2001), received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 2025, Enya received the RT\u00c9 Choice Music Prize's Classic Irish Album award for her 1988 breakthrough album \"Watermark\".\nEarly life.\nEithne P\u00e1draig\u00edn N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in was born in the Dore area of Gaoth Dobhair (Gweedore) in County Donegal on 17 May 1961. She is the sixth of nine children in the Brennan family of musicians, born to M\u00e1ire \"Baba\" and Leopold \"Leo\" Brennan. In 1968, the couple took ownership of a pub in Meenaleck, Co. Donegal, naming it Leo's Tavern. Enya's father, Leo Brennan was the leader of an Irish showband named the Slieve Foy Band, before performing solo. Enya's mother, Baba Brennan (n\u00e9e Duggan) is said to have Spanish roots with ancestors who settled on Tory Island, and she was an amateur musician who played with the Slieve Foy Band and also taught music at Gweedore Community School.\nEnya talked about the prevalence of the sea in her music, influencing her since childhood. 'The sea has been in my heart since I was a little girl. I grew up in Gaoth Dobhair, an Irish-speaking parish on the Atlantic coast of County Donegal, in the northwest corner of Ireland. The area is known for its rugged cliffs and windswept beaches, and the sea\u2019s moods and spirit still find their way into my music.'\nGweedore is a Gaeltacht region, where the Irish language, also known as Gaelic, is primarily spoken. Eithne P\u00e1draig\u00edn N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in, her name, is anglicised as Enya Patricia Brennan, with \"Enya\" being the phonetic spelling of how \"Eithne\" is pronounced in the Donegal Ulster dialect.\nThe name Brennan was accidentally added to Leo's name at his birth registration in 1925; his family name was Hardin (also spelled as Harden). Leo used Brennan for the surname of his children. In Irish, the surname is \"\u00d3 Braon\u00e1in\"/\"N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in\" corresponding to \"son of\"/\"daughter of Brennan\". Leo's father Harry Hardin was a pianist, and he died performing on stage. Enya's paternal grandmother Minna Lenehan played the drums. They are both believed to have been born in England. Regarding Baba's parents, Enya's maternal grandfather, Aodh Duggan (anglicised as Hugh; affectionately addressed as Hughie or \"Gog\") was the headmaster of the primary school in Dore; her grandmother, Mh\u00e1ire Duggan (anglicised as Mary; n\u00e9e Gillespie) was a teacher. Aodh was also the founder of the Gweedore Theatre company, Aisteoir\u00ed Ghaoth Dobhair.\nEnya has described her upbringing as 'very quiet and happy'. She mentioned that 'the house I grew up in was on my grandparents\u2019 property, behind their house. Ours was built in the 1950s and wasn\u2019t very big.' Regarding her position in the family, Enya said 'it was difficult to be heard, but I was very comfortable with that because I was able to be myself, able to be let alone.' She also acknowledged that there was 'continual hustle and bustle and crying and chaos' amongst the nine siblings. Their maternal grandparents and aunt were quite involved with the siblings' upbringing at home, as Baba and Leo were travelling with the showband; Enya recalled 'they toured a great deal, mostly in Ireland and Scotland. When they did, my grandmother and my mother\u2019s sister took care of us.' Enya's songs \"On Your Shore\" and \"Smaointe\" (first released as the Orinoco Flow B-side track \"Smaoit\u00edm\") are dedicated to both her maternal grandmother and grandfather.\nAlong with the siblings' enjoyment of their childhood spent in Gweedore, they also grew up amid the Troubles. Enya recalls that when her family visited shops in Derry for instance, 'you\u2019d be checked by people standing with guns', and even speaking in Irish in Derry was 'pinpointing where you came from, and it was too political at the time. Whereas for us [Enya and her siblings] it was our first language, and we didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it.'\nEnya took part in her first singing competitions at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival between the ages of three and five years old. She also participated in pantomimes at the Gweedore Theatre, as seen in an early group picture where Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh was also present https:// Enya often recalls that at three-and-a-half years of age, she played the character Little Red Riding Hood on stage, singing a song. At the age of four, Enya began piano lessons and was learning English throughout primary school. In 2008, Enya described her early studies, having 'to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. I remember my brothers and sisters playing outside and I would be inside playing the piano, this one big book of scales, practising them over and over.'\nOne particular memory of a very early public performance of singing at age five was recounted by Enya in her 2016 Wall Street Journal article. At the theatre, contestants would 'perform two songs, starting with a slow one and finishing with a fast one [...] songs we were taught in primary school.' Enya's mother was the pianist, and provided the starting notes for each person performing. By mistake, Enya 'began with the fast song. I didn\u2019t realize my error until I saw my mother\u2019s frown. I stopped singing and covered my mouth. There was silence, followed by laughter.' Enya then 'sang the right song. When I finished, there was a pause and I sang the fast song again. I won the contest [...] determined to get it right, and the audience\u2019s laughter didn\u2019t deter me.'\nA large part of Enya's early musical background involved singing choral music alongside siblings in their mother's choir (C\u00f3r Mhuire) at the since destroyed St Mary's church in Derrybeg. The siblings' father played the accordion and big band style on the saxophone, particularly Glenn Miller-type songs. Beyond the music she grew up around, Enya was aware of many artists of the 1960s and early '70s, and enjoyed watching musical films. In a radio interview with Elaine Page in November 2008, Enya shared a selection of favourite songs from musicals. She said of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", 'it was such an original piece of music in 1970 [...] played in my house every single day, and myself and my sisters would sing word for word.'\nEnya's brother Ciar\u00e1n also mentioned that when the siblings were younger, before having a tape recorder, as Moya and Enya sang, he would play piano, 'give them two-part harmonies and say, \"You go into the kitchen, you go into the bathroom\" and they were fascinated by this because musically it was very melodic, even though they wouldn't finally hear their parts until they sang together.'\nIn addition to her musical endeavours, Enya also took part in local cultural events, including the inaugural Gaeltacht Festival in Gweedore. At the age of nine, Enya participated in the Cail\u00edn Gaelach (Irish Girl) competition within the festival, in which contestants were judged on 'their fluency of spoken Irish, involvement in social and cultural activities in their parish and community, and appearance and deportment.' The competition was filmed live in June 1970, and published in the RT\u00c9 Archives in 2020.\nFrom the age of 11, Enya attended a convent boarding school in Milford, Milford College, run by the Sisters of Loreto; Enya's education there was paid for by her grandfather. The boarding school, now Loreto Community School, was where Enya developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin, and watercolour painting. She said, 'It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family but it was good for my music.' Enya finished boarding school at age 17, towards the end of the 1970s, and she spent a year at college studying classical music. She previously saw herself becoming a piano teacher, as both her mother and grandmother had done, and gave piano lessons for a brief time in the early 1980s. This later evolved into composing and performing her own music. Enya states that 'music was never far from my mind but contrary to popular belief my ambitions were in no way connected to those of my family, as I knew I wanted to have my own career and make my own mark.'\nEnya has noted that she 'was always quiet, even as a child, so there has always been an air of mystery around me' also mentioning that 'at school, they\u2019d always say, \"oh, we never know what Eithne\u2019s thinking or what she\u2019ll say next\".'\nCareer.\n1980\u20131982: Clannad.\nIn 1970, several members of Enya's family formed Clannad, a Celtic folk band. Clannad hired Nicky Ryan as their manager, sound engineer, and producer, and Ryan's girlfriend (later his wife) Roma as tour manager and administrator. In 1980, after a year at college, Enya decided not to go to university and pursue a music degree, and instead accepted Nicky Ryan's invitation to play alongside the band Clannad, with him having wanted to expand their sound with keyboards and an additional vocalist. Enya performed an uncredited role on their sixth studio album, \"Crann \u00dall\" (1980), with a line-up of her eldest siblings Moya, P\u00f3l, and Ciar\u00e1n Brennan, and twin uncles Noel and P\u00e1draig Duggan. She features in their follow-up, \"Fuaim\" (1982), singing lead vocals on the song \"An T\u00fall\" (Irish Gaelic for \"The Apple\"). The band toured Europe, seeing Enya join the band for performances in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.\nThe membership status of Enya in Clannad is a matter of some dispute. In a 2007 interview, Ciar\u00e1n mentioned that Enya was a 'hired hand' and not a full member, commenting that 'she was 18, 19 and we were paying her \u00a3500 sterling a week.' In a BBC Radio Ulster interview with Moya in late 2023, she also noted that Enya was considered a hired hand with Clannad. Nicky Ryan also said it was not his intention to make Enya a permanent member, as she was 'fiercely independent [...] intent on playing her own music. She was just not sure of how to go about it.'\nIn a 1991 interview, Enya herself said that she 'wouldn't call what happened a \"split\" and that she 'wasn't really a full member of Clannad.' Enya added 'I always felt I was just passing through [...] I was 18 and had studied music and was really feeling my way, trying to see what I could do.'\nNicky discussed the idea of layering vocals to create a \"choir of one\" with Enya, a concept inspired by Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique that had interested them both.\nDuring a Clannad tour in Switzerland, 1982, Nicky called for a band meeting to address internal issues that had arisen, which he put down to the excessive drinking of one or two members. He recalled: 'It was short and only required a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to stand back and say nothing.' Enya chose to leave with the Ryans and pursue a solo career, having felt confined in the group and disliking being 'somebody in the background'. In an extended interview from 1989 https:// Enya said that 'I wasn't composing it [the music], I was just \"there\", you know.' The split caused some friction between the parties but, in time, they settled their differences. Enya's brother Ciar\u00e1n also spoke to Nicky Ryan around 2006, interested in recording in their studio with his sister, but Ryan suggested that this was unlikely to occur. Moya often praises Enya for what she has gone on to achieve in her solo career, and supposes that there were some musical foundations that Enya had built from her short time with the band.\n1982\u20131986: Early solo career.\nEnya stated, following her departure from Clannad, 'the fact is that I had become very friendly with Nicky and Roma. I trusted them [...] basically, I felt there was more there for me career-wise.'\nNicky suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore 'with no particular definite future', or live with him and Roma in suburban Artane, Dublin 'and see what happens, musically', the latter of which Enya decided was best for her career. After their bank denied them a loan, Enya reportedly sold her saxophone, which she had been learning to play at the time, and also gave piano lessons as a source of income. Nicky Ryan used what they could afford to build a recording facility in the Ryans' garden shed, formerly a Scout hut, which they named \"Aigle Studio\", after the French word for eagle.\nA visitor to the house in the early 1980s described access as having to 'walk through the house to get to the studio [...] the kids [Nicky and Roma's daughters] were young then so the place was strewn with toys but the set-up suited everyone. They'd have breakfast and Enya would head off to the studio.'\nShortly after leaving Clannad and thus the family home in Gweedore, Enya lived with the Ryans from 1982, until 1989, when she was able to buy a penthouse apartment in Killineyhttps://\nEnya and the Ryans rented out the original Aigle Studio out to other musicians to help recoup the costs. The trio formed a musical and business partnership, with Nicky as Enya's producer and arranger and Roma as her lyricist. They called their company, of which each owns a third, Aigle Music. In the following two years, Enya developed her technique and composition by listening to recordings of her reciting pieces of classical music and repeated this process until she started to improvise sections and develop her own arrangements. Her first composition was \"An Taibhse Uaigneach\", Irish Gaelic for \"The Lonely Ghost\".\nFollowing her departure from Clannad in 1982, Enya (as Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in) featured on tracks alongside a few artists, often on keyboards or backing vocals, with Nicky Ryan as producer. She played the Prophet-5 synthesiser on the group Altan's \"Ceol Aduaidh,\" led by Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh and the late Frankie Kennedy. That year, Enya had the original offer from Mike Oldfield to sing on a new song of his, likely to have been \"Moonlight Shadow\". Supposedly due to existing contract clashes, she had to decline, so Oldfield later approached Scottish singer Maggie Reilly who sang on the record for Oldfield. An Irish folk-type song named \"Bailieboro and Me\", penned by Charlie McGettigan, features Enya singing backing vocals on a 1982 recording, primarily credited as Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in playing the grand piano for the song.\nEnya's first solo endeavours began around 1982-83, when she began to compose two piano instrumentals, \"An Ghaoth \u00d3n Ghrian\" (Irish for \"The Solar Wind\") and \"Miss Clare Remembers\". Both were recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin and released on \"Touch Travel\" (1984), a limited-release cassette compilation of music from various artists on the UK \"Touch\" label. She is credited as Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in in the liner notes.\nAfter several months of preparation, Enya's first live solo performance took place at the National Stadium in Dublin on 23 September 1983, and was televised for RT\u00c9's music show \"Festival Folk\". Niall Morris, a musician who worked with her during this time, recalled she 'was so nervous she could barely get on stage, and she cowered behind the piano until the gig was over.' Morris assisted Enya in the production of a demo tape, adding additional keyboards to her compositions.\nRoma thought the music would suit accompanying visuals and sent it to various film producers. Among them was David Puttnam, after Roma had read an interview where he stated a particular interest in strong melodies. Puttnam liked the tape and offered Enya to compose the soundtrack to the upcoming romantic comedy film, \"The Frog Prince\" (1984), directed by Brian Gilbert. Enya scored nine pieces for the soundtrack. However, Enya's instrumental pieces for the film were rearranged and orchestrated by Richard Myhill. The film editor Jim Clark said the rearrangements were necessary as Enya found it difficult to compose to picture. Enya's two songs with vocals were not in the film, but on the soundtrack album, those being \"The Frog Prince\" and \"Dreams\", but the melodies are present throughout the film soundtrack. The words to \"Dreams\" were penned by Charlie McGettigan.\nReleased in 1985, the album is the first commercial release that credits her as \"Enya\". The spelling as \"Enya\" for her began in 1983. Nicky Ryan suggested this phonetic spelling of her name, with the likeliness that Eithne would be mispronounced by non-Irish speakers. Enya looked back at her composition work on the film as a good career move, but a disappointing one as 'we weren't part of it at the end.' Also in 1985, she sang on three tracks on the album \"Ordinary Man\" (1985) by Christy Moore.\nEnya's earliest interviews in English as a solo artist began in 1986. Whatever direction her music would take, she believed in being 'a true Celt at heart' and stated that 'any music I write, whether it be a pop song or a classical piece, would be Celtic music.'\n1985\u20131989: \"The Celts\" and \"Watermark\".\nIn 1985, producer Tony McAuley asked Enya to contribute a track for the six-part BBC television documentary series \"The Celts\". She had already written a Celtic-influenced song called \"March of the Celts\", and Nicky Ryan submitted it to the project. Each episode was to feature a different composer at first, but director David Richardson liked her track so much that he had Enya score the entire series. Enya recorded 72 minutes of music at Aigle Studio and the BBC studios in Wood Lane, London, without recording to the picture. She was required to portray certain themes and ideas that the producers wanted; however, in contrast with \"The Frog Prince\", she worked with little interference, which granted her freedom to establish the sound that she would adopt throughout her future career, signified by layered vocals, keyboard-oriented music, and percussion with elements of Celtic, classical, church, and folk music.\nIn March 1987, two months before \"The Celts\" aired, a 40-minute selection of Enya's score was released as her debut solo album, \"Enya\", by BBC Records in the United Kingdom, with the Atlantic Records release in the United States in 1986. The latter promoted it with a new-age imprint on the packaging, which Nicky thought was 'a cowardly thing for them to do'. The album gained enough public attention to reach number 8 on the Irish Albums Chart and number 69 on the UK Albums Chart. \"I Want Tomorrow\" was released as Enya's first single. \"Boadicea\" was later sampled by the Fugees on their 1996 song \"Ready or Not\"; the group neither sought permission nor gave credit. Enya took legal action and the group subsequently gave her credit; they paid a fee of approximately $3 million. Later in 1987, Enya appeared on Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor's debut album \"The Lion and the Cobra\", reciting Psalm 91 in Irish on the track \"Never Get Old\" - Enya posted the words of the psalm as her tribute message to O'Connor following the latter's death in July 2023.\nSeveral weeks after the release of \"Enya\", Enya secured a recording contract with Warner Music UK after Rob Dickins, the label's chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to \"Enya\" and found himself playing it 'every night before I went to bed.' He later met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the Irish Recorded Music Association award ceremony in Dublin, where he learned that Enya had entered negotiations with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her, in doing so granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums. Dickins said: 'Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was the latter... I just wanted to be involved with this music.' Enya left Atlantic and signed with the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle her American distribution.\nWhen asked about whether women in pop have a hard time, she responded 'yes, they do. Definitely.' However, Enya has considered her position as a composer rather than just a vocalist to be an advantage 'because I write and perform much of the music, I'm taken more seriously than the girls who just walk into a studio, do a vocal and that's it. I can't even \"imagine\" what that would be like.'\nWith the green light to produce a new album, Enya recorded \"Watermark\" from June 1987 to April 1988. It was initially recorded in analogue at Aigle before Dickins requested to have it re-recorded digitally at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London.\n\"Watermark\" was released in September 1988 and became an unexpected hit, reaching number 5 in the United Kingdom and number 25 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States following its release there in January 1989. Its lead single, \"Orinoco Flow\", was the last song written for the album. It was not intended to be a single at first, but Enya and the Ryans chose it after Dickins jokingly asked for a single; he knew that Enya's music was not made for the Top 40 chart. Dickins and engineer Ross Cullum are referenced in the song's lyrics. \"Orinoco Flow\" became an international top 10 hit and was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks, and is credited with bringing new-age music to the mainstream market in America. The new-found success propelled Enya to international fame and she received endorsement deals and offers to use her music in television commercials She spent a year traveling worldwide to promote the album which increased her exposure through interviews, appearances, and live performances.\n1989\u20131998: \"Shepherd Moons\", \"The Memory of Trees\" and \"Paint the Sky with Stars\".\nAfter promoting \"Watermark\", Enya purchased new recording equipment and started work on her next album, \"Shepherd Moons\". She found that the success of \"Watermark\" added a considerable amount of pressure when it came to writing new songs, stating, 'I kept thinking, \"Would this have gone on \"Watermark\"? Is it as good?\" Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with what felt right.'\nRoma Ryan wrote songs based on several ideas, including diary entries from Enya, the Blitz in London, and her grandparents. \"Shepherd Moons\" was released in November 1991, her first album released under Warner-led Reprise Records in the United States. It became a greater commercial success than \"Watermark\", reaching number one in the UK for one week and number 17 in the United States. \"Caribbean Blue\", its lead single, charted at number 13 in the United Kingdom.\nIn 1991, Warner Music released a collection of five Enya music videos as \"Moonshadows\" for home video. In 1993 Enya won her first Grammy Award in the Best New Age Album category for \"Shepherd Moons\". Soon after, Enya and Nicky entered discussions with Industrial Light &amp; Magic, founded by George Lucas, regarding an elaborate stage lighting system for a proposed concert tour, but nothing resulted from those discussions. In November 1992, Warner obtained the rights to \"Enya\" and re-released the album as \"The Celts\" with new artwork. It surpassed its initial sale performance, reaching number 10 in the UK.\nAfter travelling worldwide to promote \"Shepherd Moons\", Enya started to write and record her fourth album, \"The Memory of Trees\". By this time, the Ryans had moved to the southern Dublin suburb of Killiney, and a new Aigle Studio had been built alongside their home, with new recording facilities which eliminated the need to go to London to finish recording for the album. The new album was released in November 1995 and peaked at number 5 in the UK and number 9 in the US, where it sold over 3 million copies. Its lead single, \"Anywhere Is\", reached number 7 in the UK. The second, \"On My Way Home\", reached number 26 in the UK. In late 1994, Enya put out an extended play of Christmas music titled \"The Christmas EP\". Enya was offered the opportunity to compose the film score for \"Titanic\" but declined as it would be a collaboration, rather than solely her composition and singing. A recording of her singing \"O\u00edche Chi\u00fain\", an Irish-language version of \"Silent Night\", appeared on the charity album \"A Very Special Christmas 3\", released in benefit of the Special Olympics in October 1997.\nIn early 1997, Enya began to select tracks for her first compilation album, 'trying to select the obvious ones, the hits, and others.' She chose to work on the collection following the promotional tour for \"The Memory of Trees\" as she felt it was the right time in her career, and that her contract with WEA required her to release a \"best of\" album. The set, named \"Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya\", features two new tracks, \"Paint the Sky with Stars\" and \"Only If...\". Released in November 1997, the album was a worldwide commercial success, reaching number 4 in the UK and number 30 in the US, where it went on to sell over 4 million copies.\n\"Only If...\" was released as a single in 1997. Enya described the album as 'like a musical diary... each melody has a little story and I live through that whole story from the beginning... your mind goes back to that day and what you were thinking.'\n1998\u20132007: \"A Day Without Rain\" and \"Amarantine\".\nIn 1998, Enya, Roma and Nicky Ryan received the Ivor Novello award for International Achievement. That year, Enya started work on her fifth studio album, titled \"A Day Without Rain.\" In a departure from her previous albums, Enya incorporated greater use of a synthesised string section into her compositions, something that was not a conscious decision at first, but Enya and Nicky Ryan agreed that it complemented the songs that were being written. The album was released in November 2000 and reached number 6 in the UK and an initial peak of number 17 in the US.\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, US sales of the album and its lead single \"Only Time\" surged after the song was widely used during radio and television coverage of the events, leading to its description as 'a post-September 11 anthem'. The exposure caused \"A Day Without Rain\" to outperform its original chart performance to peak at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and the release of a maxi-single containing the original and a pop remix of \"Only Time\" in November 2001. Enya donated its proceeds in aid of the International Association of Firefighters. The song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and went to number 10 on the Hot 100 singles, Enya's highest charting US single to date.\nIn 2001, Enya agreed to write and perform on two tracks for the of \"\" (2001) at the request of director Peter Jackson. Composer Howard Shore 'imagined her voice' as he wrote the film's score, making an uncommon exception to include another artist in one of his soundtracks. After flying to New Zealand to observe the filming and to watch a rough cut of the film, Enya returned to Ireland and composed \"An\u00edron\" (the theme for Aragorn and Arwen), with lyrics by Roma in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional Elvish language Sindarin, and \"May It Be\", sung in English and another Tolkien language, Quenya. Shore then based his orchestrations around Enya's recorded vocals and themes to create \"a seamless sound\".\nIn 2002, Enya released \"May It Be\" as a single which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. She performed the song live with an orchestra at the 74th Academy Awards ceremony in March 2002, and later cited the moment as a career highlight. Her two songs for the film were recorded at Abbey Road Studios.\nEnya undertook additional studio projects in 2001 and 2002. The first was work on the soundtrack of the Japanese romantic film \"Calmi Cuori Appassionati\" (2001), which was subsequently released as \"Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati\" (2001).\nThis release is formed of tracks spanning her career from \"Enya\" to \"A Day Without Rain\" with two B-sides. The album went to number 2 in Japan and became Enya's second album to sell one million copies in the country.\nIn 2004, Enya had another significant \"Boadicea\" sampling request from Diddy, for the song \"I Don't Wanna Know\" performed by Mario Winans. She said that the producer 'phoned the studio we were working in and Nicky took the call and he [Diddy] just said he had this fantastic singer that he was working with and it was Mario Winans. Immediately we said \u201csend the song\u201d and it was a great song.'\nIn September 2003, Enya returned to Aigle Studio to start work on her sixth studio album, \"Amarantine\". Roma said the title means \"everlasting\". The album marks the first instance of Enya singing in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma that came about when Enya was working on \"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\". After numerous attempts to sing the song in English, Irish, and Latin, Roma suggested a new language based on some of the sounds Enya would sing along to when developing her songs. It was a success, and Enya sang \"Less Than a Pearl\" and \"The River Sings\" in the same way. Roma worked on the language further, creating a 'culture and history' behind it surrounding the Loxian people who are on another planet, questioning the existence of life outside of Earth. \"Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)\" is sung in Japanese. \"Amarantine\" was a global success, reaching number 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 8 in the UK. It has sold over 1 million certified copies in the US, a considerable drop in sales in comparison to her previous albums. Enya dedicated the album to BBC producer Tony McAuley who had commissioned Enya to write the soundtrack to \"The Celts\", following his death in 2003. The lead single, \"Amarantine\", was released in December 2005.\n2008\u20132017: \"And Winter Came...\" and \"Dark Sky Island\".\nEnya wrote music with a winter and Christmas theme for her seventh studio album, \"And Winter Came...\" Initially, she intended to make an album of seasonal songs and hymns, set for a release in late 2007, but the trio decided to produce a winter-themed album instead. The second promotional single of the album \"My! My! Time Flies!\", is a tribute to the late Irish guitarist Jimmy Faulkner, incorporates a guitar solo performed by Pat Farrell, the first guitar solo on an Enya album since \"I Want Tomorrow\" from \"Enya\". The lyrics also include some musical pop-culture references, such as The Beatles' famous photo shoot for the cover of \"Abbey Road,\" and the lyric \"a rap on a rhapsody\" possibly referring to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. Upon its release in November 2008, \"And Winter Came...\" reached number 6 in the UK, number 8 in the US and sold almost 3.5 million copies worldwide by 2011.\nAfter promoting \"And Winter Came\", Enya took an extended break from writing and recording music. She spent her time resting, visiting family in Australia, and renovating her new home in the south of France. In March 2009, her first four studio albums were reissued in Japan in the Super High Material CD format with bonus tracks. Her second compilation album, \"The Very Best of Enya\", was released in November 2009 and featured songs from 1987 to 2008, including a previously unreleased version of \"An\u00edron\" and a DVD compiling most of her music videos to date. In 2012, Enya returned to the studio to record her eighth album, \"Dark Sky Island\". Its name refers to the island of Sark, which became the first island to be designated a dark-sky preserve, and a series of poems on islands by Roma Ryan.\nIn 2013, \"Only Time\" was used in the \"Epic Split\" advertisement by Volvo Trucks starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, who does the splits while suspended between two lorries. As a result, Enya's song \"Only Time\" re-entered both the US Billboard 100 and UK Official Charts in November 2013. \"Dark Sky Island\" was announced on Enya's website on 15 September 2015. Prior to this, guest musician Eddie Lee shared a post in August 2015, which indicated that new music by Enya was in progress.\nUpon the album's streaming release on 20 November 2015, a week before physical release, \"Dark Sky Island\" went to number 4 in the UK album charts, Enya's highest charting studio album since \"Shepherd Moons\" went to number 1. The album went to number 8 in the US. A deluxe edition features three additional songs. Enya completed a promotional tour of the UK, across Europe, the US, and Japan. During her visit to Japan, Enya performed \"Orinoco Flow\" and \"Echoes in Rain\" at the Universal Studios Japan Christmas show in Osaka. In Japan, in addition to performances of her music, she made several TV appearances featuring her partaking in Japanese culture, including wearing a kimono, walking through Maruyama Park in Kyoto, and visiting the top floor of the Tokyo Skytree.\nOn 22 July 2016, Bosnian-Swedish DJ Salvatore Ganacci released the single \"Dive\", which heavily samples \"Boadicea\" and features vocals from Alex Aris. The single peaked number 14 on the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Songs Sales chart.\nIn December 2016, Enya appeared on the Irish television show \"Christmas Carols from Cork\", marking her first Irish television appearance in over seven years, and her final public performance of the Dark Sky Island era. She sang \"Adeste Fideles\", \"O\u00edche Chi\u00fain\", and \"The Spirit of Christmas Past\".\n2019\u20132024: Musical anniversaries and re-releases.\nFrom late 2019 to late-2021, there was a significant increase in activity from Enya's official online presences. There were more official Enya posts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, updates to Enya tracks and playlists on Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music, as well as YouTube channel updates and new content.\nSeveral music videos on Enya's official YouTube channel have undergone 4K/HD conversions since 2020. Numerous YouTube \"watch party\" videos and vinyl re-releases marking anniversaries of Enya's music albums and compilations have been released since. The first of these videos was in November 2020, posted on Enya's official YouTube channel to commemorate the 20th anniversary of \"A Day Without Rain.\" In addition to the individual tracks from the album, it included handwritten introductory messages from Enya and Roma Ryan, plus a closing message from late producer Nicky Ryan. Some behind-the-scenes clips from the making-of the music videos for \"Only Time\" and \"Wild Child\", both directed by Graham Fink, were also included. For the \"Shepherd Moons 30th Anniversary Watch Party video\" in November 2021, Nicky Ryan's introductory message noted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Aigle Studio underwent some renovations, with new recording equipment and instruments installed, and that with this done, Enya and the Ryans were eager to start working on new music.\nRegarding a new studio album, there had been several mentions from close sources about Enya recording new music. In 2019, Enya's sister Moya Brennan had mentioned that Enya was recording music. In mid-2023, Enya's younger brother Bartley Brennan also spoke at Leo's Tavern saying that Enya was in the studio recording for another album.\nIn late 2021, a 20th-anniversary vinyl picture disc re-release of the \"May It Be\" single was released. Enya's music continues to be sampled or interpolated by many modern-day producers, particularly her 1986 humming song \"Boadicea\", in songs within the R&amp;B or hip-hop genres. Enya had previously noted for her 2015 album Dark Sky Island, that 'several songs here have a stronger beat, and even a little hip-hop influence.'\nIn 2022, for Metro Boomin and The Weeknd's song \"Creepin'\" featuring samples from her 1987 song \"Boadicea\", Enya didn't approve of the song to be released under the working title \"IDWK\" (referring to the song I Don't Wanna Know). Metro reportedly asked Enya to select song titles that she would be happy with, which included \"Undecided,\" \"Creepin'\", \"Don't Come Back to Me\", \"Better Off That Way\" and \"Wanna Let You Know\". Metro said '\"Creepin'\" was the one [...] It ended up being a blessing because it's the best name for it.' In early December 2024, \"Creepin'\" won the BMI London Song of the Year, with composition credits and awards including both Enya and Nick [sic] Ryan.\nIn June 2023, Enya's 1997 limited compilation \"A Box of Dreams\" was re-issued on 6 vinyl LPs, featuring new liner notes. Nicky Ryan also mentioned \"the new album\" as well as the possibility of a book based on the trio's thoughts regarding the \"Oceans\" tracks. Enya's note, in Irish, read 'Beidh muid ag teacht le ch\u00e9ile gan mhoile', which roughly translates to 'We will meet again soon.' Roma Ryan also updated the liner notes with several newer thoughts about the songs, constellations, and poetry. On 19 September 2023, a watch party video for the 35th anniversary of \"Watermark\" was also presented. Alongside this, vinyl LPs of \"Watermark\" and a Dolby Atmos upmixed audio for \"Orinoco Flow\" were also released.\nSince the anniversary of Watermark in 2023, Enya's social media pages and official website have lain dormant.\n2025\u2013present: Later projects and acclaim.\nOn 20 February 2025, it was announced on the RT\u00c9 Gold Breakfast Show that Enya was the winner of the RT\u00c9 Choice Music Prize Classic Irish Album, namely for her 1988 album \"Watermark.\" The ceremony for this took place on 6 March 2025. Despite Enya not being in attendance, she had written a speechhttps:// which was read on her behalf by Priscilla Kotey, managing director of Warner Music Ireland.\nOn 15 March 2025, the BBC first broadcast \"Enya at the BBC\", a compilation of her performances and music videos from the beginning of her solo career in 1986, to her latest BBC interview in 2016.\nOn 10 September 2025, Enya's producer Nicky Ryan died, at the age of 79. Throughout the first half of this decade, he had reassured that new Enya music was in progress.\nThe 2015-released song \"Dark Sky Island\", which is the title track of the trio's final album together, was played at the funeral of Nicky Ryan. \"Nicky\u2019s Song\" by Midnight Well and \"Avalon\" by Roxy Music were played. There were choral renditions of the Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\", and Enya's iconic songs \"Only Time\" and \"May It Be\". The Enya tracks \"Watermark, \"Stars and Midnight Blue\", and \"The Humming\" were also played in memory of Nicky Ryan.\nAs of 8 October 2025, the status of Aigle Studio, which had been listed as \"strike-off\" in previous years\", has been changed to an active status https:// potentially indicating further happenings in regards to the future of Enya's music.\nOn 15 November 2025, racing drivers Th\u00e9ophile Na\u00ebl and Mari Boya scored a 1-2 win at the 72nd Macau Grand Prix for the KCMG Enya group by Pinnacle Motorsport, which Enya is an official sponsor for. Two blue Aston Martin racing cars with Enya's logo had raced on the track, having made their debut in 2024. Boya had raced under the sponsorship last year. Formula Regional winner Na\u00ebl mentioned the sponsoring team, and his honour to join big names including Ayrton Senna, who was also a fan of listening to Enya before races.\nThe TG4 television documentary, \"Glacaim Leat\", reflecting on the legalisation of gay marriage in Ireland was first broadcast on 19 November 2025. Enya makes an appearance, as she embraces co-star Se\u00e1n Mac Ruair\u00ed, whose marriage took place on 16 May 2025, where Enya was notably in attendance.\nArtistry.\nMusical style.\nEnya has cited her musical foundations as 'the classics\", church music, and \"Irish reels and jigs' with a particular interest in Sergei Rachmaninoff, a favourite composer of hers. Enya tentatively mentioned in 1986 that her roots could be Stravinsky, but quickly followed with the notion that silence is what she listened to most besides her music https://\nAs well as piano, Enya quickly adapted to playing the synthesiser, a skilled synth player since the early 1980s, equalling the significance of her singing, especially on her breakthrough album \"Watermark\". Since 1982, Enya has recorded music with Nicky Ryan as her producer and arranger, and his wife Roma Ryan as lyricist. During her time with Clannad, Enya chose to work with Nicky as the two shared an interest in vocal harmonies, and Ryan, influenced by The Beach Boys and the \"Wall of Sound\" technique that Phil Spector pioneered, wanted to explore the idea of \"the multi-vocals\" for which her music became known. According to Enya, \"Angeles\" from \"Shepherd Moons\" has roughly 500 vocals recorded individually and layered. Enya performs all vocals and the majority of instruments in her songs, apart from guest musicians (some percussion, guitar, violin, uilleann pipes, cornet, and double bass). Her early works, including \"Enya\" and \"Watermark,\" feature numerous keyboard synthesisers including the Yamaha KX88 Master, Yamaha DX7, Oberheim Matrix, Kurzweil K250, Fairlight III, E-mu Emulator II, Akai S900, PPG Wave Computer 360, Roland D-50 (with the \"Pizzagogo\" patch, famously used in \"Orinoco Flow\"), and the Roland Juno-60, the latter a particular favourite of hers. Her vast vocal range has been classified as mezzo-soprano.\nNumerous critics and reviewers classify Enya's albums as new-age music and she has won four Grammy Awards for Best New Age Album. However, Enya does not consider her music as part of the genre; 'the only way I can describe it [...] it's \"Enya\" music.' Nicky Ryan commented on the new age designation: 'Initially it was fine, but it's really not new age. Enya plays a whole lot of instruments, not just keyboards. Her melodies are strong and she sings a lot. So I can't see a comparison.' In 1988, Enya is believed to have said about New Age music 'it's air, thin air. It's a musical drug' and noted its often spineless nature, dissimilar to the approach taken in her own music. In an interview first published in 2017, Enya said that she 'felt that title [New-Age] was given to any musician whom critics didn't know how to pigeonhole.'\nThe inspirations behind several of the visuals accompanying Enya's music originate from old artwork. The 1991 music video for \"Caribbean Blue\", and the 1995 album cover artwork for \"The Memory of Trees\" both feature adapted works from artist Maxfield Parrish. In the 1996 music video for \"On My Way Home\", scenes of girls lighting paper lanterns to hang in flowery foliage were inspired by John Singer Sargent's painting \"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose\".\nIn addition to her native Irish, Enya has recorded songs in languages including English, French, Latin, Spanish, and Welsh. She has recorded music influenced by works from fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, including the instrumental \"Lothl\u00f3rien\" from \"Shepherd Moons\". For \"\", she sang \"May It Be\" in English and Tolkien's fictional language Quenya, and she sang \"An\u00edron\" in another of Tolkien's fictional languages, Sindarin. \"Amarantine\" and \"Dark Sky Island\" include songs sung in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma Ryan, that has no official syntax. Its vocabulary was formed by Enya singing the song's notes to which Roma wrote their phonetic spelling.\nEnya adopted a composing and songwriting method that has deviated little throughout her career. At the start of the recording process for an album, she enters the studio, forgetting about her previous success, fame, and songs of hers that became hits. 'If I did that,' she said, 'I'd have to call it a day.' She then develops ideas on the piano, keeping note of any arrangement that can be worked on further. During her time writing the music, Enya works a five-day week, takes weekends off, and does not work on her music at home. With Irish as her first language, Enya initially records her songs in Irish as she can express 'feeling much more directly' in Irish than in English. After some time, Enya presents her ideas to Nicky to discuss what pieces work best, while Roma works in parallel to devise lyrics for the songs. Enya considered \"Fallen Embers\" from \"A Day Without Rain\" a perfect example of the lyrics exactly reflecting the feeling. In 2008, she realised her tendency to write 'two or three songs' during the winter months, work on the arrangements and lyrics the following spring and summer, and then work on the next couple of songs when autumn arrives.\nLive performances.\nEnya says that Warner Music and she 'did not see eye to eye' initially as the label imagined her performing on stage 'with a piano... maybe two or three synthesizer players and that's it.' Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums caused her to 'run overtime', leaving little time to plan for other such projects. She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Nicky Ryan said Enya had received and turned down an offer worth almost \u00a3500,000 to perform one concert in Japan. In 2016, Enya spoke about the prospect of a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after \"And Winter Came...\" (2008) to perform a show at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City that would be simulcast to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enter a studio and record \"all the hits\" live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.\nEnya has performed with live and lip-syncing vocals on various talk and music shows, events, and ceremonies throughout her career, most often during her worldwide press tours for each album. In December 1995, she performed \"Anywhere Is\" at a Christmas concert at Vatican City with Pope John Paul II in attendance; he later met and thanked her for performing. In April 1996, Enya performed the same song during a surprise appearance at the fiftieth birthday celebration for Carl XVI Gustaf, the king of Sweden and a fan of Enya's. In 1997, Enya participated in a live Christmas Eve broadcast in London and flew to County Donegal afterward to join her family for their annual midnight Mass choral performance, in which she participates each year.\nIn March 2002, Enya performed \"May It Be\" with an orchestra at the year's Academy Awards/Oscars ceremony. Enya and her sisters performed as part of the local choir C\u00f3r Mhuire in July 2005 at St. Mary's church in Derrybeg during the annual Earagail Arts Festival.\nEnya's latest live performances took place in 2016. In the US, where Enya performed with her live (non-lip-syncing) vocal, these instances were \"Even In The Shadows\" at Good Day New Yorkhttps:// and \"Echoes In Rain\" at Live! with Kelly and Michaelhttps://\nFor the UK and Ireland leg, in addition to the official music videos being filmed in Harrow, Enya performed \"Echoes in Rain\"https:// \"The Humming\"https:// and Orinoco Flow https:// where the piano was adorned with roses, much like her Top of the Pops performances in the late 1980s https:// and 1995 https:// Enya performed \"So I Could Find My Way\" on the BBC's Songs of Praise in 2016 https:// filmed at All Hallows College in Dublin.\nSeveral of these were also broadcast on Japanese TV, along with numerous 2015 and early 2016 performances. Enya's final performance in Japan was for the Support Our Kids charity event held on 22 March 2016, where she performed \"So I Could Find My Way\" and donated her dress and two disc awards for \"Amarantine\" and \"And Winter Came...\" for the charity auction. Enya performed a selection of Christmas carols from previous albums for an Irish-language Christmas show in Cork, Ireland https://\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nPersonal life.\nKnown for her private lifestyle alongside the music, Enya said in the mid-1990s, 'The music is what sells. Not me, or what I stand for... that's the way I've always wanted it.' In a German interview from 2005, Enya stated 'I have always been shy. In former times, I wasn\u2019t happy with that, but today I accept it and live my life after it. And I dare to express something private like emotions in my music and make it visible for the public.' She later mentioned in 2008 that 'it\u2019s more important to have my private life and freedom than come out and argue about how I\u2019m seen', regarding it as 'a small disadvantage in trying to retain my privacy. I can live with it.'\nEnya has never married or had children, but has many nieces and nephews and is considered an aunt to the Ryans' two daughters, having shared their Artane home for almost a decade. In 1991, she said, 'I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me... I wouldn't go rushing into anything unexpected, but I do think a great deal about this.' Press often alluded to a relationship ending for Enya in 1997, and that around this time she was considering taking time out of music to have a family. Enya found she was putting pressure on herself over the matter and has 'gone the route [she] wanted to go' after all.\nEnya has identified herself as 'more spiritual than religious' and has said that she sometimes prays, but prefers 'going into churches when they're empty'. Though her political stances are rarely disclosed, in 1988 she stated that 'there is money in Ireland but it's not fairly divided. Generations-old and politicians have reduced the whole nation to beggary.'\nAs a result of injury from a car crash in Dublin in July 1997, Enya recalled that 'it took a lot of work to get my body back to singing. It was traumatic and shocking, but as a result I became more aware of my health and stronger as a person.' This occurred several weeks before the fatal car crash in Paris that took the life of Princess Diana. In November 1997, Enya mentioned upon news of her contributing to Diana's tribute album, 'I met Lady Diana twice and the second time we met she told me that my composition \"Watermark\" was a favourite melody of hers.' Enya's track \"Watermark\" was included on the end-of-year artist compilation album, \"\".\nAt an auction in 1997, Enya spent \u00a32.5 million on a 157-year-old Victorian listed castellated mansion in Killiney. Formerly known as \"Victoria Castle\" and \"Ayesha Castle\", the house was renamed by Enya as Manderley Castle after the house featured in Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel \"Rebecca\". Prior to moving into the castle, Enya was believed to have resided in London, and spent time there throughout the 2000s. She spent several years renovating the castle, and installing considerable security measures because of threats from stalkers. The improvements covered gaps in the house's outer wall, installed new solid timber entrance gates and iron railings, and brought the surrounding of stone wall up to a new height of . In late 2005, the property had two security breaches; during one incident, two people attacked and tied up one of her housekeepers before stealing several items. Enya alerted police by raising an alarm from her safe room. Enya oversaw most of the interior design (decorations and furnishings of her castle) as she was 'not going to trust that to anyone else.' Enya also has an autographed picture of Sergei Rachmaninoff in her home. Enya later bought a home in the south of France, also close in location to the home of U2 singer Bono, near \u00c8ze. She spent time renovating it to a more contemporary style than the Victorian style of her castle home.\nEnya recalled reading books in her youth such as \"The Lord of the Rings\", and the Malory Towers series by Enid Blyton, prior to going to boarding school herself. Enya mentioned her favourite books being \"Rebecca\" by Daphne du Maurier and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde. Enya has shown admiration for the literary works of both Wilde and J. R. R. Tolkien. She has also stated that she collects first editions of books.\nEnya has mentioned watching operas, such as \"Madame Butterfly\" at the Sydney Opera House, especially as she frequently travels to Australia to visit her sister and other relatives, occasionally getting noticed 'at the most obscure places' she added in 2008. She also likes watching classic black-and-white films, especially those directed by Alfred Hitchcock. She is also drawn to watching crime dramas or period drama series, such as \"Breaking Bad,\" and \"Mad Men,\" saying 'myself, Nicky, and Roma are huge fans of \"Breaking Bad\". We just didn't miss an episode.'\nEnya met Sting at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. Enya is a fan of The Police, and their 1983 single Every Breath You Take is one of Enya's favourite songs. The first album she got was the band's 1979 album \"Reggatta de Blanc\".\nAs well as music, Enya has expressed interest in happenings of other areas of the arts, such as dancing, and painting. As of 2000, Enya had collected artwork by Irish artists in particular, including Jack Butler Yeats, Louis le Brocquy and the British artist Albert Goodwin. She also likes to paint, excelling in watercolours and landscape painting from a young age. However, Enya has been reluctant to share her artwork publicly: 'it shows too much of myself. If it is included in a song, it\u2019s less a problem for me' as mentioned in 2005. In a Spanish interview in 2016, Enya mentioned that her painting is 'something very personal. I share my thoughts when composing music but I prefer painting to stay private, at least for a few years.'\nRecognition and legacy.\nEnya is the best-selling Irish solo artist and one of the most influential vocalists of all time. At the family pub Leo's Tavern, memorabilia that celebrate musical achievements of Enya and her siblings, notably those in Clannad, are displayed across the walls inside. Enya is admired by, and has influenced a number of artists from several genres, including Aurora, Weyes Blood, FKA Twigs, Grimes, Adam Young, Cynthia Erivo, and Nicki Minaj, who declared in a television interview: 'One of my biggest [musical influences] is Enya.' In 2016, \"Sunday Times Rich List\" estimated her fortune at \u00a391 million, making her part of their Top 50 millionaire musicians in Britain and Ireland. According to \"Billboard\", Enya is one of the all-time highest-charted Irish acts on U.S charts, and is one of the highest-certified music artists by album units in the U.S. \"Billboard\"'s Mark Dezzani commented in 1997, that she popularized conventional pop melodies and ethereal ethnic music, while \"Audio\" magazine credited her for helping popularize the \"New Celtic\" sound. Enya was described by National Geographic's \"Ireland\" (2022) book, as the 'Queen of ambient Celtic lullabies.'\nIn Lonely Planet's 2024 description of Donegal, the county from which Enya comes, it was described by the Destination Editor as the 'wild child of Ireland', a likely reference to the single \"Wild Child\" by Enya in 2000. Two of Enya's albums, \"Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya\" (1997) and \"Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati\" (2001) have sold over a million copies in Japan, the latter a soundtrack of Enya's hits from 1986 to 2000 that was included in the Japanese film \"Calmi Cuori Appassionati\".\nEnya receiving the RT\u00c9 Choice Music Prize for Classic Album in 2025 is testament to her lasting significance in Irish music and beyond.\nThe BBC produced a compilation of archive footage, which first aired in March 2025. It recognises Enya as an artist with a noteworthy music repertoire and legacy.\nIn early 2025, Enya was announced as the winner of the 2025 RT\u00c9 Choice Music Prize's Classic Irish Album award, for her 1988 album \"Watermark\". The announcement was soon followed by a statement from the artist: 'I am delighted to win the RT\u00c9 Choice Music Classic Album Prize. \"Watermark\" has a special place in my heart - it was my second album and really launched my career internationally. It is wonderful that people are still discovering it today and it's an honour to be chosen for this prize recognising Irish music.' In Enya's winner's speech, read out on her behalf, she expressed her excitement to have been able to make \"Watermark\", and that she was 'so delighted that it has stood the test of time' still resonating with so many people around the world.\nHonorary degrees and namings.\nIn 1991, a minor planet first discovered in 1978, 6433 Enya, was named after her. In June 2007, she received an honorary PhD doctorate from the University of Galway, for her contributions to music. A month later, she also received another honorary doctorate, a DLitt from Ulster University. In 2017, a newly discovered species of fish, \"Leporinus enyae\", found in the Orinoco River drainage area, was named after Enya, in reference to her song, \"Orinoco Flow\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

From 1945, it was the Soviet occupation sector of Berlin. The American, British, and French sectors were known as West Berlin. From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989, East Berlin was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall. The Western Allied powers did not recognize East Berlin as the GDR's capital, nor the GDR's authority to govern East Berlin. For most of its administrative existence, East Berlin was officially known as Berlin, capital of the GDR () by the GDR government. On 3 October 1990, the day Germany was officially reunified, East and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin.\nOverview.\nWith the London Protocol of 1944 and subsequent Potsdam Conference in 1945, the Allied powers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union decided to divide Germany into three occupation zones and to establish a special area of Berlin, which was occupied by the three Allied Forces together. In May 1945, the Soviet Union installed a city government for the whole city that was called \"Magistrate of Greater Berlin\", which existed until 1947. After the war, the Allied Forces initially administered the city together within the Allied Kommandatura, which served as the governing body of the city. However, in 1948 the Soviet representative left the Kommandatura and the common administration broke apart during the following months. In the Soviet sector, a separate city government was established, which continued to call itself the \"Magistrate of Greater Berlin\".\nWhen the German Democratic Republic was established in 1949, it immediately claimed East Berlin as its capital\u2014a claim that was recognized by all communist countries. Nevertheless, East Berlin representation in the initially only consisted of non-voting delegates, indirectly elected by the Magistrate, until an amendment to the electoral law providing for direct elections was passed on June 28, 1979, taking effect on June 14, 1981.\nIn June 1948, all railways and roads leading to West Berlin were blocked, and East Berliners were not allowed to emigrate. Nevertheless, more than 1,000 East Germans were escaping to West Berlin each day by 1960, caused by the strains on the East German economy from war reparations owed to the Soviet Union, massive destruction of industry, and lack of assistance from the Marshall Plan. In August 1961, the East German Government tried to stop the population exodus by separating West Berlin by the Berlin Wall. It was very dangerous for fleeing residents to cross because armed soldiers were trained to shoot illegal emigrants.\nEast Germany was a socialist republic. Eventually, Christian churches were allowed to operate without restraint after years of harassment by authorities. In the 1970s, the wages of East Berliners rose and working hours fell.\nThe Soviet Union and the Communist Bloc recognized East Berlin as the GDR's capital. However, Western Allies (the United States, United Kingdom, and France) never formally acknowledged the authority of the East German government to govern East Berlin. Official Allied protocol recognized only the authority of the Soviet Union in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole. The United States Command Berlin, for example, published detailed instructions for U.S. military and civilian personnel wishing to visit East Berlin. In fact, the three Western commandants regularly protested against the presence of the East German National People's Army in East Berlin, particularly on the occasion of military parades. Nevertheless, the three Western Allies eventually established embassies in East Berlin in the 1970s, although they never recognized it as the capital of East Germany. Treaties instead used terms such as \"seat of government\".\nOn 3 October 1990, East and West Germany and East and West Berlin were reunited, thus formally ending the existence of East Berlin. Citywide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first \"all-Berlin\" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring at the time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.\nHistorical population.\nEast Berlin reached its highest population in 1988 with 1.28\u00a0million. The lowest value was in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall was built, with under 1.06\u00a0million registered. The figures in the following table, unless otherwise indicated, are from the official central statistical office of East Germany. \nPost-reunification.\nSince reunification, the German government has spent vast amounts of money on reintegrating the two halves of the city and bringing services and infrastructure in the former East Berlin up to the standard established in West Berlin.\nAfter reunification, the East German economy suffered significantly. Under the adopted policy of privatization of state-owned firms under the auspices of the , many East German factories were shut down\u2014which also led to mass unemployment\u2014due to gaps in productivity with and investment compared to West German companies, as well as an inability to comply with West German pollution and safety standards in a way that was deemed cost-effective. Because of this, a massive amount of West German economic aid was poured into East Germany to revitalize it. This stimulus was part-funded through a 7.5% tax on income for individuals and companies (in addition to normal income tax or company tax) known as the \"\" (SolZG) or \"solidarity surcharge\", which though only in effect for 1991\u20131992 (later reintroduced in 1995 at 7.5 and then dropped down to 5.5% in 1998 and continues to be levied to this day) led to a great deal of resentment toward the East Germans.\nDespite the large sums of economic aid poured into East Berlin, there still remain obvious differences between the former East and West Berlins. East Berlin has a distinct visual style; this is partly due to the greater survival of prewar fa\u00e7ades and streetscapes, with some still showing signs of wartime damage. The unique look of Socialist Classicism that was used in East Berlin (along with the rest of the former GDR) also contrasts markedly with the urban development styles employed in the former West Berlin. Additionally, the former East Berlin (along with the rest of the former GDR) retains a small number of its GDR-era street and place names commemorating German socialist heroes, such as Karl-Marx-Allee, Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, and Karl-Liebknecht-Stra\u00dfe. Many such names, however, were deemed inappropriate (for various reasons) and, through decommunization, changed after a long process of review (so, for instance, Leninallee reverted to Landsberger Allee in 1991, and Dimitroffstra\u00dfe reverted to Danziger Stra\u00dfe in 1995).\nAnother symbolic icon of the former East Berlin (and of East Germany as a whole) is the (tr. \"little traffic light men\"), a stylized version of a fedora-wearing man crossing the street, which is found on traffic lights at many pedestrian crosswalks throughout the former East. Following a civic debate about whether the should be abolished or disseminated more widely (due to concerns of consistency), several crosswalks in some parts of the former West Berlin began to employ the .\nTwenty-five years after the two cities were reunified, the people of East and West Berlin still had noticeable differences between them, and these differences became more apparent among the older generations. The two groups also had sometimes-derogatory slang terms to refer to each other. A former East Berliner (or East German) was known as an \"'\" (from the German word for east, '), and a former West Berliner (or West German) was known as a \"'\" (from the German word for west, '). Both sides also engaged in stereotyping the other. A stereotypical ' had little ambition or poor work ethic and was chronically bitter, while a stereotypical ' was arrogant, selfish, impatient and pushy.\nBoroughs.\nAt the time of German reunification, East Berlin comprised the boroughs of\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9487", "revid": "40800862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9487", "title": "Epsilon", "text": "Fifth letter of the Greek alphabet\nEpsilon (, uppercase ', lowercase ' or ; ) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a or . In the system of Greek numerals it also has the value five. It was derived from the Phoenician letter He . Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, \u00cb and \u0190, and Cyrillic \u0415, \u00c8, \u0401, \u0404 and \u042d. The name of the letter was originally ( ), but it was later changed to ( 'simple e') in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph \u27e8\u27e9, a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced , and because the digraph \u27e8\u27e9 had become unsuitable due to its own shift to . In Modern Greek, its name has fused into ().\nThe uppercase form of epsilon is identical to Latin \u27e8E\u27e9 but has its own code point in Unicode: . The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed number \"3\" and is encoded . The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing, looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar: it is encoded . While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols: computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them. In TeX, codice_1 ( formula_1 ) denotes the lunate form, while codice_2 ( formula_2 ) denotes the epsilon number. Unicode versions 2.0.0 and onwards use \u025b as the lowercase Greek epsilon letter, but in version 1.0.0, \u03f5 was used. The lunate or uncial epsilon provided inspiration for the euro sign, \u20ac.\nThere is also a 'Latin epsilon', \u27e8\u025b\u27e9 or \"open e\", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. It is encoded in Unicode as and and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. This Latin uppercase epsilon, \u0190, is not to be confused with the Greek uppercase \u03a3 (sigma)\nThe lunate epsilon, \u27e8\u03f5\u27e9, is not to be confused with the set membership symbol \u2208. The symbol formula_3, first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership (\"belongs to\"), evolved from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word . In addition, mathematicians often read the symbol \u2208 as \"element of\", as in \"1 is an element of the natural numbers\" for formula_4, for example. As late as 1960, \u025b itself was used for set membership, while its negation \"does not belong to\" (now \u2209) was denoted by \u03b5' (epsilon prime). Only gradually did a fully separate, stylized symbol take the place of epsilon in this role. In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon, \u03f6, for the phrase \"such that\", although the abbreviation \"s.t.\" is occasionally used in place of \u03f6 in informal cardinals.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe letter \u27e8\u0395\u27e9 was adopted from the Phoenician letter He () when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing. In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter. Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward (), depending on the current writing direction, but, just as in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing. Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar. In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current \u27e8E\u27e9 glyph.\nSound value.\nWhile the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter \"He\" was , the earliest Greek sound value of \u0395 was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an sound. Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short phoneme, it could initially also be used for other -like sounds. For instance, in early Attic before c.\u2009500 BC, it was used also both for the long, open , and for the long close . In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by Eta (\u27e8\u0397\u27e9), which was taken over from eastern Ionic alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the digraph \u27e8\u0395\u0399\u27e9.\nEpichoric alphabets.\nSome dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.\nIn Corinth, the normal function of \u27e8\u0395\u27e9 to denote and was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B (), while \u27e8\u0395\u27e9 was used only for long close . The letter Beta, in turn, took the deviant shape .\nIn Sicyon, a variant glyph resembling an \u27e8X\u27e9 () was used in the same function as Corinthian .\nIn Thespiai (Boeotia), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar () was used for what was probably a raised variant of in pre-vocalic environments. This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of \"Heta\", i.e. for the sound .\nGlyph variants.\nAfter the establishment of the canonical Ionian (Euclidean) Greek alphabet, new glyph variants for \u0395 were introduced through handwriting. In the uncial script (used for literary papyrus manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval vellum codices), the \"lunate\" shape () became predominant. In cursive handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways. Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin \"e\", some a \"6\" with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small \"c\"-like curves. Several of these shapes were later taken over into minuscule book hand. Of the various minuscule letter shapes, the inverted-3 form became the basis for lower-case Epsilon in Greek typography during the modern era.\nUses.\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet.\nDespite its pronunciation as , in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Latin epsilon represents open-mid front unrounded vowel, as in the English word \"pet\" .\nSymbol.\nThe uppercase Epsilon is not commonly used outside of the Greek language because of its similarity to the Latin letter E. However, it is commonly used in structural mechanics with Young's Modulus equations for calculating tensile, compressive and areal strain.\nThe Greek lowercase epsilon , the lunate epsilon symbol , and the Latin lowercase epsilon (see above) are used in a variety of places:\nUnicode.\nFor accented Greek characters, see Greek diacritics: Computer encoding.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This also gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter H.\nOther regional variants of the Greek alphabet (epichoric alphabets), in dialects that still preserved the sound , employed various glyph shapes for consonantal \"heta\" side by side with the new vocalic \"eta\" for some time. In the southern Italian colonies of Heraclea and Tarentum, the letter shape was reduced to a \"half-heta\" lacking the right vertical stem (\u0370). From this sign later developed the sign for rough breathing or \"spiritus asper\", which brought back the marking of the sound into the standardized post-classical (polytonic) orthography. Dionysius Thrax in the second century BC records that the letter name was still pronounced \"heta\" (\u1f25\u03c4\u03b1), correctly explaining this irregularity by stating \"in the old days the letter \u0397 served to stand for the rough breathing, as it still does with the Romans.\"\nLong e.\nIn the East Ionic dialect, however, the sound disappeared by the sixth century BC, and the letter was re-used initially to represent a development of a long open front unrounded vowel, , which later merged in East Ionic with the long open-mid front unrounded vowel, instead. In 403 BC, Athens took over the Ionian spelling system and with it the vocalic use of H (even though it still also had the sound itself at that time). This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.\nItacism.\nDuring the time of post-classical Koine Greek, the sound represented by eta was raised and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels, a phenomenon called \"iotacism\" or \"itacism\", after the new pronunciation of the letter name as \"ita\" instead of \"eta\".\nItacism is continued into Modern Greek, where the letter name is pronounced and represents the close front unrounded vowel, . It shares this function with several other letters (\u03b9, \u03c5) and digraphs (\u03b5\u03b9, \u03bf\u03b9, \u03c5\u03b9), which are all pronounced alike.\nCyrillic script.\nEta was also borrowed with the sound value of into the Cyrillic script, where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter \u0418.\nUses.\nLetter.\nIn Modern Greek, due to iotacism, the letter (pronounced ) represents a close front unrounded vowel, . In Classical Greek, it represented the long open-mid front unrounded vowel, .\nSymbol.\nUpper case.\nThe uppercase letter \u0397 is used as a symbol in textual criticism for the Alexandrian text-type (from Hesychius, its once-supposed editor).\nIn chemistry, the letter H as symbol of enthalpy sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from \u1f10\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin H for 'heat'.\nIn information theory the uppercase Greek letter \u0397 is used to represent the concept of entropy of a discrete random variable.\nLower case.\nThe lowercase letter \u03b7 is used as a symbol in:\nUnicode.\nThese characters are used only as mathematical symbols. Stylized Greek text should be encoded using the normal Greek letters, with markup and formatting to indicate text style:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A related third group, Aleuts, who inhabit the Aleutian Islands, are generally excluded from the definition of \"Eskimo\". The three groups share a relatively recent common ancestor, and speak related languages belonging to the family of Eskaleut languages. These circumpolar peoples have traditionally inhabited the Arctic and subarctic regions from eastern Siberia (Russia) to Alaska (United States), Northern Canada, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut, and Greenland.\nSome Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and other individuals consider the term \"Eskimo\", which is of a disputed etymology, to be pejorative or even offensive. \"Eskimo\" continues to be used within a historical, linguistic, archaeological, and cultural context. The governments in Canada and the United States have made moves to cease using the term \"Eskimo\" in official documents, but it has not been eliminated, as the word is in some places written into tribal, and therefore national, legal terminology. Canada officially uses the term \"Inuit\" to describe the indigenous Canadian people who are living in the country's northern sectors and who are not First Nations or M\u00e9tis. The United States government legally uses \"Alaska Native\" for enrolled Yupik and Inuit tribal members, and also for non-Eskimos including Aleut, Tlingit, Haida, Eyak, and Tsimshian, in addition to at least nine northern Athabaskan/Dene peoples. Other non-enrolled individuals also claim Eskimo/Aleut descent, making it the world's \"most widespread aboriginal group\". \nThere are between 171,000 and 187,000 Inuit and Yupik, the majority of whom live in or near their traditional circumpolar homeland. Of these, 53,785 (2010) live in the United States, 70,545 (2021) in Canada, 51,730 (2021) in Greenland and 1,657 (2021) in Russia. In addition, 16,730 people living in Denmark were born in Greenland. The Inuit Circumpolar Council, a non-governmental organization (NGO), claims to represent 180,000 people.\nIn the Eskaleut language family, the Eskimo or Eskimoan branch has an Inuit language sub-branch, and a sub-branch of four Yupik languages. Two Yupik languages are used in the Russian Far East as well as on St. Lawrence Island, and two in western Alaska, southwestern Alaska, and western Southcentral Alaska. The extinct Sirenik language also belongs to the Eskimoan branch.\nNomenclature.\nEtymology.\nA variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origin of the word \"Eskimo\". According to Smithsonian linguist Ives Goddard, etymologically the word derives from the Innu-aimun (Montagnais) word , meaning 'a person who laces a snowshoe', and is related to \"husky\" (a breed of dog). The word means 'she laces a snowshoe' in Innu, and Innu language speakers refer to the neighbouring Mi'kmaq people using words that sound like \"eskimo\". This interpretation is generally confirmed by more recent academic sources.\nIn 1978, Jos\u00e9 Mailhot, a Quebec anthropologist who speaks Innu-aimun (Montagnais), published a paper suggesting that \"Eskimo\" meant 'people who speak a different language'. French traders who encountered the Innu (Montagnais) in the eastern areas adopted their word for the more western peoples and spelled it as or in a transliteration.\nSome people consider \"Eskimo\" offensive, because it is popularly perceived to mean 'eaters of raw meat' in Algonquian languages common to people along the Atlantic coast. An unnamed Cree speaker suggested the original word that became corrupted to Eskimo might have been (meaning 'he eats it raw'); Inuit are referred to in some Cree texts as (meaning 'eats something raw'). Regardless, the term still carries a derogatory connotation for many Inuit and Yupik.\nOne of the first printed uses of the French word comes from Samuel Hearne's \"A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in the Years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772\" first published in 1795.\nUsage.\nThe term \"Eskimo\" is still used by people to encompass Inuit and Yupik, as well as other Indigenous or Alaska Native and Siberian peoples. In the 21st century, usage in North America has declined. Linguistic, ethnic, and cultural differences exist between Yupik and Inuit.\nIn Canada and Greenland, and to a certain extent in Alaska, the term \"Eskimo\" is predominantly seen as offensive and has been widely replaced by the term \"Inuit\"\u200a or terms specific to a particular group or community. This has resulted in a trend whereby some non-Indigenous people believe that they should use \"Inuit\" even for Yupik who are non-Inuit.\nGreenlandic Inuit generally refer to themselves as Greenlanders ( or ) and speak the Greenlandic language and Danish. Greenlandic Inuit belong to three groups: the Kalaallit of west Greenland, who speak Kalaallisut; the Tunumiit of Tunu (east Greenland), who speak Tunumiit oraasiat (\"East Greenlandic\"); and the Inughuit of north Greenland, who speak Inuktun.\nThe word \"Eskimo\" is a racially charged term in Canada. In Canada's Central Arctic, is the preferred term, and in the eastern Canadian Arctic . The language is often called \"Inuktitut\", though other local designations are also used.\nSection 25 of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" and section 35 of the \"Constitution Act\" of 1982 recognized Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Although \"Inuit\" can be applied to all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia. In Alaska, the term \"Eskimo\" is still used because it includes both I\u00f1upiat (singular: I\u00f1upiaq), who are Inuit, and Yupik, who are not.\nThe term \"Alaska Native\" is inclusive of (and under U.S. and Alaskan law, as well as the linguistic and cultural legacy of Alaska, refers to) all Indigenous peoples of Alaska, including not only the I\u00f1upiat (Alaskan Inuit) and the Yupik, but also groups such as the Aleut, who share a recent ancestor, as well as the largely unrelated indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and the Alaskan Athabaskans, such as the Eyak people. The term \"Alaska Native\" has important legal usage in Alaska and the rest of the United States as a result of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. It does not apply to Inuit or Yupik originating outside the state. As a result, the term Eskimo is still in use in Alaska. Alternative terms, such as \"Inuit-Yupik\", have been proposed, but none has gained widespread acceptance. Early 21st century population estimates registered more than 135,000 individuals of Eskimo descent, with approximately 85,000 living in North America, 50,000 in Greenland, and the rest residing in Siberia.\nInuit Circumpolar Council.\nIn 1977, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) meeting in Barrow, Alaska (now Utqia\u0121vik, Alaska), officially adopted \"Inuit\" as a designation for all circumpolar Native peoples, regardless of their local view on an appropriate term. They voted to replace the word \"Eskimo\" with \"Inuit\". Even at that time, such a designation was not accepted by all. As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the term \"Eskimo\" with ( in singular).\nThe ICC charter defines \"Inuit\" as including \"the Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, Inuvialuit (Canada), Kalaallit (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia)\". Despite the ICC's 1977 decision to adopt the term \"Inuit\", this has not been accepted by all or even most Yupik people.\nIn 2010, the ICC passed a resolution in which they implored scientists to use \"Inuit\" and \"Paleo-Inuit\" instead of \"Eskimo\" or \"Paleo-Eskimo\".\nAcademic response.\nIn a 2015 commentary in the journal \"Arctic\", Canadian archaeologist Max Friesen argued fellow Arctic archaeologists should follow the ICC and use \"Paleo-Inuit\" instead of \"Paleo-Eskimo\". In 2016, Lisa Hodgetts and \"Arctic\" editor Patricia Wells wrote: \"In the Canadian context, continued use of any term that incorporates \"Eskimo\" is potentially harmful to the relationships between archaeologists and the Inuit and Inuvialuit communities who are our hosts and increasingly our research partners.\"\nHodgetts and Wells suggested using more specific terms when possible (e.g., Dorset and Groswater) and agreed with Frieson in using the \"Inuit tradition\" to replace \"Neo-Eskimo\", although they noted replacement for \"Palaeoeskimo\" was still an open question and discussed \"Paleo-Inuit\", \"Arctic Small Tool Tradition\", and \"pre-Inuit\", as well as Inuktitut loanwords like and , as possibilities.\nIn 2020, Katelyn Braymer-Hayes and colleagues argued in the \"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology\" that there is a \"clear need\" to replace the terms \"Neo-Eskimo\" and \"Paleo-Eskimo\", citing the ICC resolution, but finding a consensus within the Alaskan context particularly is difficult, since Alaska Natives do not use the word \"Inuit\" to describe themselves nor is the term legally applicable only to I\u00f1upiat and Yupik in Alaska, and as such, terms used in Canada like \"Paleo Inuit\" and \"Ancestral Inuit\" would not be acceptable.\nAmerican linguist Lenore Grenoble has also explicitly deferred to the ICC resolution and used \"Inuit\u2013Yupik\" instead of \"Eskimo\" with regards to the language branch.\nHistory.\nGenetic evidence suggests that the Americas were populated from northeastern Asia in multiple waves. While the great majority of indigenous American peoples can be traced to a single early migration of Paleo-Indians, the Na-Den\u00e9, Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit admixture from distinct populations that migrated into America at a later date and are closely linked to the peoples of far northeastern Asia (e.g. Chukchi), and only more remotely to the majority indigenous American type. For modern Eskimo\u2013Aleut speakers, this later ancestral component makes up almost half of their genomes. The ancient Paleo-Eskimo population was genetically distinct from the modern circumpolar populations, but eventually derives from the same far northeastern Asian cluster. It is understood that some or all of these ancient people migrated across the Chukchi Sea to North America during the pre-neolithic era, somewhere around 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. It is believed that ancestors of the Aleut people inhabited the Aleutian Chain 10,000 years ago.\nThe earliest positively identified Paleo-Eskimo cultures (Early Paleo-Eskimo) date to 5,000 years ago. Several earlier indigenous peoples existed in the northern circumpolar regions of eastern Siberia, Alaska, and Canada (although probably not in Greenland). The Paleo-Eskimo peoples appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the Arctic small tool tradition in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier.\nThe Yupik languages and cultures in Alaska evolved in place, beginning with the original pre-Dorset Indigenous culture developed in Alaska. At least 4,000 years ago, the Unangan culture of the Aleut became distinct. It is not generally considered an Eskimo culture. However, there is some possibility of an Aleutian origin of the Dorset people, who in turn are a likely ancestor of today's Inuit and Yupik.\nApproximately 1,500 to 2,000 years ago, apparently in northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across northern Alaska, through Canada, and into Greenland. The distinct culture of the Thule people (drawing strongly from the Birnirk culture) developed in northwestern Alaska. It very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo peoples, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.\nLanguages.\nLanguage family.\nThe Eskimo\u2013Aleut (also known as Eskaleut or Inuit\u2013Yupik\u2013Unangan) family of languages includes two cognate branches: the Aleut (Unangan) branch and the Inuit\u2013Yupik branch.\nThe number of cases varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to those of the Inuit\u2013Yupik subfamily. Inuit\u2013Yupik\u2013Unangan languages possess voiceless plosives at the bilabial, coronal, velar and uvular positions in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops but retained the nasal. In the Inuit\u2013Yupik subfamily a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is also present.\nThe Inuit\u2013Yupik sub-family consists of the Inuit and Yupik language sub-groups. The Sirenik language, which is virtually extinct, is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Inuit\u2013Yupik language family. Other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.\nInuit languages comprise a dialect continuum, or dialect chain, that stretches from Unalakleet and Norton Sound in Alaska, across northern Alaska and Canada, and east to Greenland. Changes from western (I\u00f1upiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., \"kumlu\", meaning \"thumb\", changes to \"kuvlu\", changes to \"kublu\", changes to \"kulluk\", changes to \"kulluq\",) and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to understand one another, but speakers from dialects distant from each other on the dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another. Seward Peninsula dialects in western Alaska, where much of the I\u00f1upiat culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages. Eastern Greenlandic, at the opposite end of Inuit range, has had significant word replacement due to a unique form of ritual name avoidance.\nEthnographically, Greenlandic Inuit belong to three groups: the Kalaallit of west Greenland, who speak Kalaallisut; the Tunumiit of Tunu (east Greenland), who speak Tunumiit oraasiat (\"East Greenlandic\"), and the Inughuit of north Greenland, who speak Inuktun.\nThe four Yupik languages, by contrast, including Alutiiq (Sugpiaq), Central Alaskan Yup'ik, Naukan (Naukanski), and Siberian Yupik, are distinct languages with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences. They demonstrate limited mutual intelligibility. Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup'ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages \u2013 Siberian Yupik and Naukan Yupik \u2013 are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, which is the southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically. Differences of vocabulary between Inuit and any one of the Yupik languages are greater than between any two Yupik languages. Even the dialectal differences within Alutiiq and Central Alaskan Yup'ik sometimes are relatively great for locations that are relatively close geographically.\nDespite the relatively small population of Naukan speakers, documentation of the language dates back to 1732. While Naukan is only spoken in Siberia, the language acts as an intermediate between two Alaskan languages: Siberian Yupik and Central Yup'ik.\nAn overview of the Inuit\u2013Yupik\u2013Unangan languages family is given below:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAmerican linguist Lenore Grenoble has explicitly deferred to the ICC resolution and used \"Inuit\u2013Yupik\" instead of \"Eskimo\" with regards to the language branch.\nWords for \"snow\".\nThere has been a long-running linguistic debate about whether or not the speakers of the Inuit\u2013Yupik\u2013Unangan language group have an unusually large number of words for snow. The general modern consensus is that, in multiple Inuit\u2013Yupik languages, there are, or have been in simultaneous usage, indeed fifty plus words for snow.\nInuit.\nInuit inhabit the Arctic and northern Bering Sea coasts of Alaska in the United States, and Arctic coasts of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador in Canada, and Greenland (associated with Denmark). Until fairly recent times, there has been a remarkable homogeneity in the culture throughout this area, which traditionally relied on fish, marine mammals, and land animals for food, heat, light, clothing, and tools. Their food sources primarily relied on seals, whales, whale blubber, walrus, and fish, all of which they hunted using harpoons on the ice. Clothing consisted of robes made of wolfskin and reindeer skin to acclimate to the low temperatures. They maintain a unique Inuit culture.\nGreenland's Inuit.\nGreenlandic Inuit make up 90% of Greenland's population. They belong to three major groups:\nCanadian Inuit.\nCanadian Inuit live primarily in Inuit Nunangat (lit. \"lands, waters and ices of the [Inuit]\"), their traditional homeland although some people live in southern parts of Canada. Inuit Nunangat ranges from the Yukon\u2013Alaska border in the west across the Arctic to northern Labrador.\nThe Inuvialuit live in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, the northern part of Yukon and the Northwest Territories, which stretches to the Amundsen Gulf and the Nunavut border and includes the western Canadian Arctic Islands. The land was demarked in 1984 by the Inuvialuit Final Agreement.\nThe majority of Inuit live in Nunavut (a territory of Canada), Nunavik (the northern part of Quebec) and in Nunatsiavut (Inuit settlement region in Labrador).\nAlaska's I\u00f1upiat.\nThe I\u00f1upiat are Inuit of Alaska's Northwest Arctic and North Slope boroughs and the Bering Straits region, including the Seward Peninsula. Utqia\u0121vik, the northernmost city in the United States, is above the Arctic Circle and in the I\u00f1upiat region. Their language is known as I\u00f1upiaq. Their current communities include 34 villages across \"I\u00f1upiat Nuna\u014bat\" (I\u00f1upiaq lands) including seven Alaskan villages in the North Slope Borough, affiliated with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation; eleven villages in Northwest Arctic Borough; and sixteen villages affiliated with the Bering Straits Regional Corporation.\nYupik.\nThe Yupik are indigenous or aboriginal peoples who live along the coast of western Alaska, especially on the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta and along the Kuskokwim River (Central Alaskan Yup'ik); in southern Alaska (the Alutiiq); and along the eastern coast of Chukotka in the Russian Far East and St. Lawrence Island in western Alaska (the Siberian Yupik). The Yupik economy has traditionally been strongly dominated by the harvest of marine mammals, especially seals, walrus, and whales.\nAlutiiq.\nThe Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the Yupik in the Bethel, Alaska area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the Alaska Peninsula and on Kodiak Island, and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern Kenai Peninsula and in Prince William Sound. Residents of Nanwalek, located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near Seldovia, speak what they call Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the hundreds, Alutiiq communities are working to revitalize their language.\nCentral Alaskan Yup'ik.\n\"Yup'ik\", with an apostrophe, denotes the speakers of the Central Alaskan Yup'ik language, who live in western Alaska and southwestern Alaska from southern Norton Sound to the north side of Bristol Bay, on the Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta, and on Nelson Island. The use of the apostrophe in the name \"Yup'ik\" is a written convention to denote the long pronunciation of the \"p\" sound; but it is spoken the same in other Yupik languages. Of all the Alaska Native languages, Central Alaskan Yup'ik has the most speakers, with about 10,000 of a total Yup'ik population of 21,000 still speaking the language. The five dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik include General Central Yup'ik, and the Egegik, Norton Sound, Hooper Bay-Chevak, and Nunivak dialects. In the latter two dialects, both the language and the people are called \"Cup'ik\".\nSiberian Yupik.\nSiberian Yupik reside along the Bering Sea coast of the Chukchi Peninsula in Siberia in the Russian Far East and in the villages of Gambell and Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island in Alaska. The Central Siberian Yupik spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula and on St. Lawrence Island is nearly identical. About 1,050 of a total Alaska population of 1,100 Siberian Yupik people in Alaska speak the language. It is the first language of the home for most St. Lawrence Island children. In Siberia, about 300 of a total of 900 Siberian Yupik people still learn and study the language, though it is no longer learned as a first language by children.\nNaukan.\nAbout 70 of 400 Naukan people still speak Naukanski. The Naukan originate on the Chukot Peninsula in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in Siberia. Despite the relatively small population of Naukan speakers, documentation of the language dates back to 1732. While Naukan is only spoken in Siberia, the language acts as an intermediate between two Alaskan languages: Siberian Yupik Eskimo and Central Yup'ik Eskimo.\nSireniki.\nSome speakers of Siberian Yupik languages used to speak a divergent Inuit\u2013Yupik variant in the past, before they underwent a language shift. These former speakers of the Sirenik language inhabited the settlements of Sireniki, Imtuk, and some small villages stretching to the west from Sireniki along south-eastern coasts of Chukchi Peninsula. They lived in neighborhoods with Siberian Yupik and Chukchi peoples.\nAs early as in 1895, Imtuk was a settlement with a mixed population of Sireniki and Ungazigmit (the latter belonging to Siberian Yupik). Sirenik culture has been influenced by that of Chukchi, and the language shows Chukchi language influences. Folktale motifs also show the influence of Chuckchi culture.\nThe above peculiarities of this (already extinct) Inuit\u2013Yupik language amounted to mutual unintelligibility even with its nearest language relatives: in the past, Sireniki had to use the unrelated Chukchi language as a lingua franca for communicating with Siberian Yupik.\nMany words are formed from entirely different roots from in Siberian Yupik, but even the grammar has several peculiarities distinct not only among Inuit\u2013Yupik languages, but even compared to Aleut. For example, dual number is not known in Sirenik, while most Inuit\u2013Yupik\u2013Unangan languages have dual, including its neighboring Siberian Yupikax relatives.\nLittle is known about the origin of this diversity. The peculiarities of this language may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Inuit and Yupik groups, and being in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries. The influence of the Chukchi language is clear.\nBecause of all these factors, the classification of the Sirenik language is not settled yet: Sireniki language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of Inuit\u2013Yupik (at least, its possibility is mentioned). Sometimes it is regarded rather as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9496", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9496", "title": "Epiphenomenalism", "text": "Position on the mind\u2013body problem\nEpiphenomenalism is a philosophical theory on the mind\u2013body problem in philosophy of mind. It holds that subjective mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body, but do not themselves influence physical events. According to epiphenomenalism, the appearance that subjective mental states (such as thoughts and intentions) are causally effective themselves and directly influence physical events is an illusion generated by brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, with consciousness itself being a by-product of physical states of the world. For instance, the emotion of fear seems to make the heart beat faster, but according to epiphenomenalism the biochemical secretions of the brain and nervous system (such as the stress hormone adrenaline)\u2014not the subjective experience of fear itself\u2014is what causes the rapid rise in heartbeat. Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism has traditionally been viewed as a form of property dualism. In contemporary thought, there are a number of epiphenomenalistic questions that arise within a broadly materialist monism.\nDevelopment.\nDuring the 17th century, Ren\u00e9 Descartes argued that animals are subject to mechanical laws of nature. He defended the idea of automatic behavior, or the performance of actions without conscious thought. Descartes questioned how the immaterial mind and the material body can interact causally. His interactionist model (1649) held that the body relates to the mind through the pineal gland. La Mettrie, Leibniz, and Spinoza all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Thomas Henry Huxley (1874).\nHuxley agreed with Descartes that behavior is determined solely by physical mechanisms, but he also believed that humans enjoy an intelligent life. In 1874, Huxley argued, in the Presidential Address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, that animals are conscious automata based on his experiments showing that movement was still possible without certain parts of the central nervous system being intact. Based on these results, Huxley proposed that consciousness itself was not in control of an animal's behavior, concluding that psychical changes are collateral products of physical changes. Like the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time, consciousness has no role in determining behavior.\nHuxley defended automatism by testing reflex actions, originally supported by Descartes. Huxley hypothesized that frogs that undergo lobotomy would swim when thrown into water, despite being unable to initiate actions. He argued that the ability to swim was solely dependent on the molecular change in the brain, concluding that consciousness is not necessary for reflex actions. According to epiphenomenalism, animals experience pain only as a result of neurophysiology.\nIn 1870, Huxley conducted a case study on a French soldier who had sustained a shot in the Franco-Prussian War that fractured his left parietal bone. Every few weeks the soldier would enter a trance-like state, smoking, dressing himself, and aiming his cane like a rifle all while being insensitive to pins, electric shocks, odorous substances, vinegar, noise, and certain light conditions. Huxley used this study to show that consciousness was not necessary to execute these purposeful actions, justifying the assumption that humans are insensible machines. Huxley's mechanistic attitude towards the body convinced him that the brain alone causes behavior.\nIn the early 1900s, scientific behaviorists such as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of eliminativism or mental fictionalism, positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. George Santayana (1905) believed that all motion has physical causes. Because consciousness is accessory to life and not essential to it, natural selection is responsible for ingraining tendencies to avoid certain contingencies without any conscious achievement involved. By the 1960s, scientific behaviorism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the cognitive revolution. Participants in that revolution, such as Jerry Fodor, reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of \"epiphobia\"\u2014fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.\nHowever, since the cognitive revolution, there have been several who have argued for a version of epiphenomenalism. In 1970, Keith Campbell proposed his \"new epiphenomenalism\", which states that the body produces a spiritual mind that does not act on the body. How the brain causes a spiritual mind, according to Campbell, is destined to remain beyond our understanding forever. In 2001, David Chalmers and Frank Cameron Jackson argued that claims about conscious states should be deduced a priori from claims about physical states alone. They offered that epiphenomenalism bridges, but does not close, the explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal realms. These more recent versions maintain that only the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental states are epiphenomenal. Imagine both Pierre and a robot eating a cupcake. Unlike the robot, Pierre is conscious of eating the cupcake while the behavior is under way. This subjective experience is often called a \"quale\" (plural qualia), and it describes the private \"raw feel\" or the subjective \"what-it-is-like\" that is the inner accompaniment of many mental states. Thus, while Pierre and the robot are both doing the same thing, only Pierre has the inner conscious experience.\nFrank Cameron Jackson (1982), for example, once espoused the following view:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am what is sometimes known as a \"qualia freak\". I think that there are certain features of bodily sensations especially, but also of certain perceptual experiences, which no amount of purely physical information includes. Tell me everything physical there is to tell about what is going on in a living brain... you won't have told me about the hurtfulness of pains, the itchiness of itches, pangs of jealousy...\nSome thinkers draw distinctions between different varieties of epiphenomenalism. In \"Consciousness Explained\", Daniel Dennett distinguishes between a purely metaphysical sense of epiphenomenalism, in which the epiphenomenon has no causal impact at all, and Huxley's \"steam whistle\" epiphenomenalism, in which effects exist but are not functionally relevant.\nArguments for.\nSome neurophysiological data has been proffered in support of epiphenomenalism, suggesting that at least some choices and actions appear to be actually controlled by subconscious brain processes for which the conscious mind later takes credit. Some of the oldest such data is the Bereitschaftspotential or \"readiness potential\" in which electrical activity related to voluntary actions can be recorded up to two seconds before the subject is aware of making a decision to perform the action. More recently Benjamin Libet, et al. (1979) have shown that it can take 0.5 seconds before a stimulus becomes part of conscious experience even though subjects can respond to the stimulus in reaction time tests within 200 milliseconds. The methods and conclusions of this experiment have received much criticism (e.g., see the many critical commentaries in Libet's (1985) target article), including fairly recently by neuroscientists such as Peter Tse, who claim to show that the readiness potential has nothing to do with consciousness at all.\nArguments against.\nOne argument against epiphenomenalism is that it is self-contradictory: if we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then our brains know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then our brains should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.\nHowever, some philosophers do not accept this as a rigorous refutation. For example, philosopher Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that the personal mind is not the only source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a philosophical zombie) could have knowledge about the mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge. The information about the mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia and the hard problem of consciousness) could have been, in principle, implicitly \"written\" in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created an immaterial mind and a detailed \"program\" of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind\u2013body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but it cannot be excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, epiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness can be found in the human brain, and it is proven that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.\nSome philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, reject both epiphenomenalism and the existence of qualia with the same charge that Gilbert Ryle leveled against a Cartesian \"ghost in the machine\", that they too are category mistakes. A quale or conscious experience would not belong to the category of objects of reference on this account, but rather to the category of ways of doing things.\nFunctionalists assert that mental states are well described by their overall role, their activity in relation to the organism as a whole. \"This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a 'calculating machine', but it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century.\" In so far as it mediates stimulus and response, a mental function is analogous to a program that processes input/output in automata theory. In principle, multiple realisability would guarantee platform dependencies can be avoided, whether in terms of hardware and operating system or, \"ex hypothesi\", biology and philosophy. Because a high-level language is a practical requirement for developing the most complex programs, functionalism implies that a non-reductive physicalism would offer a similar advantage over a strictly eliminative materialism.\nEliminative materialists often state that folk psychology is so unscientific that, ultimately, it will be better to eliminate primitive concepts such as \"mind,\" \"desire\" and \"belief,\" in favor of a future neuroscientific account. A more moderate position such as J. L. Mackie's \"error theory\" suggests that false beliefs should be stripped away from a mental concept without eliminating the concept itself, the legitimate core meaning being left intact.\nBenjamin Libet's results are quoted in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a \"conscious veto\", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In \"Freedom Evolves\", Daniel Dennett argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. Similar criticism of Libet-style research has been made by neuroscientist Adina Roskies and cognitive theorists Tim Bayne and Alfred Mele.\nOthers have argued that data such as the Bereitschaftspotential undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience and a conscious decision occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is \"completely without any power\u2026 as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery\". Mind\u2013body dualists reject epiphenomenalism on the same grounds. Some philosophers have also pointed out how strange it is that the brain expends copious amounts of energy and glucose maintaining the state of consciousness, but the conscious mind may not have any role to play in making the final decision. It remains difficult to provide a coherent mechanistic explanation of how a non-physical mind could actually influence any part of the physical body or the physical world at large.\nAdrian G. Guggisberg and Anna\u00efs Mottaz have also challenged those findings.\nA study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself (and the \"pre-movement buildup\" of neural activity in general), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet's and Fried's.\nIn favor of interactionism, Celia Green (2003) argues that epiphenomenalism does not even provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of interaction posed by substance dualism. Although it does not entail substance dualism, according to Green, epiphenomenalism implies a one-way form of interactionism that is just as hard to conceive of as the two-way form embodied in substance dualism. Green suggests the assumption that it is less of a problem may arise from the unexamined belief that physical events have some sort of primacy over mental ones.\nA number of scientists and philosophers, including William James, Karl Popper, John C. Eccles and Donald Symons, dismiss epiphenomenalism from an evolutionary perspective. They point out that the view that mind is an epiphenomenon of brain activity is not consistent with evolutionary theory, because if mind were functionless, it would have disappeared long ago, as it would not have been favoured by evolution.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9498", "revid": "4842600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9498", "title": "Esperantujo", "text": "Esperantujo () or Esperantio () is the community of speakers of the Esperanto language and their culture, as well as the places and institutions where the language is used. The term is used \"as if it were a country.\"\nAlthough it does not occupy its own area of Earth's surface, it can be said to constitute the 120 countries which have their own national Esperanto association.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word is formed analogously to country names. In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix \"-ujo\". For example, \"France\" was , from (a Frenchman).\nThe term analogous to \"Francujo\" would be \"Esperantistujo\" (Esperantist-nation). However, that would convey the idea of a physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere.\nCurrently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix \"-io\" (traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. instead of ), and recently the form \"Esperantio\" has been used, among others, in the Pasporta Servo and the Esperanto Citizens' Community.\nHistory.\nIn 1908, Dr. Wilhelm Molly attempted to create an Esperanto state in the Prussian-Belgian condominium of Neutral Moresnet, known as \"Amikejo\" (place of friendship). What became of it is unclear, and Neutral Moresnet was annexed to Belgium in the Treaty of Versailles, 1919.\nDuring the 1960s came a new effort of creating an Esperanto state, which this time was called the Republic of Rose Island. The state island stood in the Adriatic Sea near Italy.\nIn Europe, on 2 June 2001, a number of organizations (they prefer to call themselves establishments) founded the \"Esperanta Civito\", which \"aims to be a subject of international law\" and \"aims to consolidate the relations between the Esperantists who feel themselves belonging to the diaspora language group which does not belong to any country\". \"Esperanto Civito\" always uses the name Esperantujo (introduced by Hector Hodler in 1908), which itself is defined according to their interpretation of \"raumism\", and the meaning, therefore, may differ from the traditional Esperanto understanding of the word \"Esperantujo\".\nA language learning partner application called Amikumu was launched in 2017, allowing Esperanto speakers to find each other.\nGeography.\nEsperantujo includes any physical place where Esperanto speakers meet, such as Esperanto gatherings or virtual networks. Sometimes it is said that it is everywhere where Esperanto speakers are connected.\nAlthough Esperantujo does not have its own official territory, a number of places around the world are owned by Esperanto organizations or are otherwise permanently connected to the Esperanto language and its community:\nThe countries with the most members of the World Esperanto Association are (in descending order): Brazil, Germany, Japan, France, the United States, China, Italy.\nPolitics.\nAssociations.\nThere is no governmental system in Esperantujo because it is not a true state. However, there is a social hierarchy of associations:\nAlso there are thematic associations worldwide, which are concerned with spirituality, hobbies, science or bringing together Esperantists who share common interests.\nThere is also a number of global organizations, such as Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT), or the World Esperanto Youth Organization (TEJO), which has 46 national sections.\nForeign relations.\nUniversal Esperanto Association is not a governmental system; however, the association represents Esperanto worldwide. In addition to the United Nations and UNESCO, the UEA has consultative relationships with UNICEF and the Council of Europe and general cooperative relations with the Organization of American States. UEA officially collaborates with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) by means of an active connection to the ISO Committee on terminology (ISO/TC 37). The association is active for information on the European Union and other interstate and international organizations and conferences. UEA is a member of European Language Council, a joint forum of universities and linguistic associations to promote the knowledge of languages and cultures within and outside the European Union. Moreover, on 10 May 2011, the UEA and the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm) signed an Agreement on Cooperation, its objectives are inter exchange information, support each other and help out for projects, meetings, publications in the field of terminology and by which the UEA become Associate Member of Infoterm.\nPolitical movement.\nIn 2003 there was a European political movement called Europe\u2013Democracy\u2013Esperanto created. Within it is found a European federation that brings together local associations whose statutes depends on the countries. The working language of the movement is Esperanto. The goal is \"to provide the European Union with the necessary tools to set up member rights democracy\". The international language is a tool to enable cross-border political and social dialogue and actively contribute to peace and understanding between peoples. The original idea in the first ballot was mainly to spread the existence and the use of Esperanto to the general public. However, in France voices have grown steadily: 25067 (2004) 28944 (2009) and 33115 (2014). In this country there are a number of movements which support the issue: France \u00c9quit\u00e9, Europe-Libert\u00e9, and Politicat.\nSymbols.\nThe flag of Esperanto is called \"Verda Flago\" (Green Flag). It consists of:\nThe anthem is called \"La Espero\" since 1891: it is a poem written by L. L. Zamenhof. The song is usually sung to the triumphal march composed by F\u00e9licien Menu de M\u00e9nil in 1909.\nThe Jubilee symbol represents the language internally, while the flag represents the Esperanto movement. It contains the Latin letter E (Esperanto) and the Cyrillic letter \u042d (\u042d\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e) symbolizing the unification of West and East. The Jubilee symbol has been controversial, with some Esperantists derisively calling it \"the melon.\"\nIn addition, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, the initiator of the language, is often used as a symbol. Sometimes he is even called \"Uncle Zam\", referring to the cartoon incarnation of American Uncle Sam.\nPopulation.\nEducation.\nIn addition to textbooks, including the \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" by Zamenhof, the Assimil-methods and the video-methods such as Muzzy in Gondoland of the BBC and \"Pasporto al la tuta mondo\", there are many courses for learning online. Moreover, some universities teach Esperanto, and the Higher Foreign Language training (University E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd) delivers certificates in accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). More than 1600 people have such a certificate around the world: in 2014 around 470 at the level of B1, 510 at the level of B2 and 700 for C1. The International League of Esperanto Teachers (ILEI) is also working to publish learning materials for teachers.\nThe University of Esperanto offers video lectures in Esperanto, for specialties like Confronting War, Informational Technologies and Astronomy. Courses are also held during the World Esperanto Congress in the framework of the Internacia Kongresa Universitato (IKU). After that, UEA uploads the related documents on its website.\nScience is an appropriate department for works in Esperanto. For example, the Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology (KAEST) occurs in November every year since 1998 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Personal initiatives are also common: Doctor of mathematics Ulrich Matthias created a document about the foundations of Linear Algebra and the American group of Maine (USA) wrote a guidebook to learn the programming language Python.\nIn general, Esperanto is used as a lingua franca in some websites aiming teaching of other languages, such as German, Slovak, Swahili, Wolof or Toki Pona.\nMedia.\nSince 1889 when \"La Esperantisto\" appeared, and soon other magazines in Esperanto throughout many countries in the world. Some of them are information media of Esperanto associations (\"Esperanto\", \"Sennaciulo\" and \"Kontakto\"). Online Esperanto magazines like \"Libera Folio\", launched in 2003, offer independent view of the Esperanto movement, aiming to soberly and critically shed light on current development. Most of the magazines deal with current events; one of such magazines is \"Monato\", which is read in more than 60 countries. Its articles are written by correspondents from 40 countries, which know the local situation very well. Other most popular Esperanto newspapers are \"La Ondo de Esperanto\", \"Beletra Almanako\", \"Literatura Foiro\", and \"Heroldo de Esperanto\". Often national associations magazines are also published in order to inform about the movement in the country, such as \"Le Monde de l'esp\u00e9ranto\" of Esp\u00e9ranto-France. There are also scientific journals, such as \"Scienca Revuo\" of Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista (ISAE).\n\"Muzaiko\" is a radio that has broadcast an all-day international program of songs, interviews and current events in Esperanto since 2011. The latest two can be downloaded as podcasts. Besides Muzaiko, these other stations offer an hour of Esperanto-language broadcasting of various topics: \"Radio Libertaire\", \"Polskie Radio\", \"Vatican Radio\", \"Varsovia Vento, \"Radio Verda and \"Kern.punkto\".\nInternet.\nSpread of the Internet has enabled more efficient communication among Esperanto speakers and slightly replaced slower media such as mail. Many massively used websites such as Facebook or Google offer Esperanto interface. On 15 December 2009, on the occasion of the jubilee of 150th birthday of L. L. Zamenhof, Google additionally made visible the Esperanto flag as a part of their Google Doodles. Media as Twitter, Telegram, Reddit or Ipernity also contain a significant number of people in this community. In addition, content-providers such as WordPress and YouTube also enable bloggers write in Esperanto. Esperanto versions of programs such as the office suite LibreOffice and Mozilla Firefox browser, or the educational program about programming Scratch are also available. Additionally, games like Minecraft offer complete Esperanto interface.\nMonero, an anonymous cryptocurrency, was named after the Esperanto word for \"coin\" and its official wallet is available in Esperanto. The same applies to Monerujo (\"Monero container\").\nSport.\nAlthough Esperantujo is not a country, there is an Esperanto football team, which has existed since 2014 and participates in matches during World Esperanto Congresses. The team is part of the N.F.-Board and not of FIFA, and have played against the teams of Armenian-originating Argentine Community in 2014 and the team from Western Sahara in 2015.\nEsperanto speakers and Esperantists.\nInitially, Esperanto speakers learned the language as it was described by L. L. Zamenhof. In 1905, the \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" put together the first Esperanto textbook, an exercise book and a universal dictionary.\nThe \"Declaration about the essence of Esperantism\" (1905) defines an \"Esperantist\" to be anyone who speaks and uses Esperanto. \"Esperantism\" was defined to be a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to mother tongues in international and inter-ethnic contexts. As the word \"esperantist\" is linked with this \"esperantism\" (the Esperanto movement) and as -ists and -isms are linked with ideologies, today many people who speak Esperanto prefer to be called \"Esperanto speaker\".\nThe monthly magazine \"La Ondo de Esperanto\" every year since 1998 proclaims an 'Esperantist of the year', who remarkably contributed to the spreading of the language during the year.\nEconomy.\nBusinesses.\nPublishing and selling books, the so-called book services, is the main market and is often the first expenditure of many Esperanto associations. Some companies are already well known: for example Vinilkosmo, which publishes and makes popular Esperanto music since 1990. Then there are initiatives such as the job-seeking website \"Eklaboru\", created by Chuck Smith, for job offers and candidates within Esperanto associations or Esperanto meetings.\nCurrency.\nIn 1907, Ren\u00e9 de Saussure proposed the spesmilo \u27e8\u20b7\u27e9 as an international currency. It had some use before the First World War.\nIn 1942 a currency called the \"stelo\" (\"star\"; plural, \"steloj\") was created. It was used at meetings of the \"Universala Ligo\" and in Esperanto environments such as the annual Universal Congress. Over the years it slowly became unusable and at the official closing of the Universala Ligo in the 1990s, the remaining \"steloj\" coins were handed over to the UEA. They can be bought at the UEA's book service as souvenirs.\nThe current \"steloj\" are made of plastic; they are used in a number of meetings, especially among young people. The currency is maintained by Stelaro, which calculates the rates, keeps the stock, and opened branches in various e-meetings. Currently, there are \"stelo\"-coins of 1 \u2605, 3 \u2605 and 10 \u2605. The exchange rate at 31 December 2014 was 1 EUR = 4.189 \u2605.\nCulture.\nArchitectural heritage.\nThere exist Zamenhof-Esperanto objects (ZEOs), scattered in numerous countries around the world, which are the things named in honor of L. L. Zamenhof or Esperanto: monuments, street names, places and so on. There also exists a UEA-committee for ZEOs.\nIn addition, in several countries there are also sites dedicated to Esperanto: meetup places, workshops, seminars, festivals, Esperanto houses. These places provide attractions for Esperantists. Here are two: the Castle of Gr\u00e9silion in France and the Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum in Vienna (Austria).\nCultural heritage.\nEsperanto literary heritage is the richest and the most diverse of any constructed language. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed Esperanto magazines.\nThere are also a number of movies which have been published in Esperanto. Moreover, Esperanto itself was used in numerous movies.\nCelebrations.\nMany public holidays recognized by Esperanto speakers are celebrated internationally, having gained full acceptance by organizations such as UN and UNESCO, and are also publicly observed in select countries that are UN members. This is largely a byproduct of the influence the Esperanto community once had on organizations that worked in the field of international relations (including the United Nations) in the mid-20th century. Here are the celebrations proposed as international holidays by the UEA since 2010:\nCultural events.\nEvery year numerous meetings of Esperanto speakers in different topics around the world take place. They mobilize Esperanto-speakers which share the same will about a specific topic. The main example is the Universal Congress of Esperanto (UK), a week-long summer conference organized annually by the UEA. Other events:\nNext to these globally comprising meetings there are also local events such as New Year's Gathering (NR) or Esperanto Youth Week (JES), which occur during the last days of December and first days of January. These meetings seem to have been successful during the last 20 years.\nDue to the fact that there are a lot of Esperanto meetings around the globe, there are websites which aim to list and share them. Eventa Servo provides an up-to-date list of online meetings and in-person events happening each week. Eventoj.hu describes events with a list and dates, and contains an archive until 1996.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9499", "revid": "4556355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9499", "title": "Ethernet", "text": "Computer networking technology\nEthernet ( ) is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has since been refined to support higher bit rates, a greater number of nodes, and longer link distances, but retains much backward compatibility. Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as Token Ring, FDDI and ARCNET.\nThe original 10BASE5 Ethernet uses a thick coaxial cable as a shared medium. This was largely superseded by 10BASE2, which used a thinner and more flexible cable that was both less expensive and easier to use. More modern Ethernet variants use twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with switches. Over the course of its history, Ethernet data transfer rates have been increased from the original to the latest , with rates up to under development. The include several wiring and signaling variants of the OSI physical layer.\nSystems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames. Each frame contains source and destination addresses, and error-checking data so that damaged frames can be detected and discarded; most often, higher-layer protocols trigger retransmission of lost frames. Per the OSI model, Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer. The 48-bit MAC address was adopted by other IEEE 802 networking standards, including IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), as well as by FDDI. EtherType values are also used in Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers.\nEthernet is widely used in homes and industry, and interworks well with wireless Wi-Fi technologies. The Internet Protocol is commonly carried over Ethernet and so it is considered one of the key technologies that make up the Internet.\nHistory.\nThe original forms of Ethernet used a shared communications channel. This concept originated in ALOHAnet, designed in the late 1960s by Norman Abramson. ALOHANet was a 4800 bps radio network used by the University of Hawaii. When a sender detected that its message hadn't been received, it would resend the message after waiting for a randomly selected period of time. \nIn 1972, Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs adapted the ALOHAnet approach to transmission over a shared coaxial cable in the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). This network connected ALTO computers using a coaxial cable. It first ran on May 22, 1973 with a bit rate of 2.94 Mbps. In a memo written at that time, Metcalfe named the concept \u201cEthernet.\u201d The name was inspired by the former idea that the universe was filled with a \"luminiferous aether\" that carried electromagnetic waves, and calling it Ethernet emphasized its ability to run over any transmission medium. Ethernet improved the original ALOHANet design because a sender would first listen to the channel to determine if it was already in use. The combination of the new idea of \"Carrier Sense\" with \"Multiple Access\" and \"Collision Detection\" from ALOHANet became Carrier-Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection, or CSMA/CD.\nIn 1975, Metcalfe, Boggs and their colleagues Charles Thacker and Butler Lampson filed for a patent on Ethernet, which was granted in 1977. By 1976, 100 ALTOs at Xerox PARC were connected using Ethernet. In July 1976, Metcalfe and Boggs published the seminal paper \"Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\" in Communications of the ACM (CACM). Subsequently between 1976-1978 Ron Crane, Bob Garner, Hal Murray, and Roy Ogus designed a 10Mbps version of Ethernet running over coaxial cable. \nThere were multiple local area network technologies in the 1970s. These included IBM's token ring, Network Systems Corporation's HYPERchannel and Datapoint's ARCnet. All were proprietary at the time. Metcalfe and David Liddle developed a strategy of standardizing Ethernet rather than keeping it vendor-specific, and convinced Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox to work together on a standard, subsequently known as the DIX standard, based on the 10Mbps version of Ethernet and published in 1980 as the Ethernet Blue Book. Version 2 was published in November 1982. \nIn June 1981, the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) Project 802 (for local area network standards) created an 802.3 subcommittee to produce an Ethernet standard based on DIX. In 1983, a standard was published for 10 Mbps Ethernet over a coaxial cable of up to 500 meters (10BASE5). It differed only in some details from the DIX standard. As part of the standardization process, Xerox turned over all its Ethernet patents to the IEEE, and anyone can implement 802.3. IEEE 802.3 is now considered the same as Ethernet.\nIn June 1979, Metcalfe left Xerox to found the Computer, Communication, and Compatibility Corporation, better known as 3Com, along with Howard Charney, Ron Crane, Greg Shaw, and Bill Kraus. Metcalfe's vision was to sell Ethernet adapters for all personal computers. Apple quickly agreed, but IBM was committed to their own LAN protocol, the Token Ring. Nonetheless, 3Com developed the EtherLink ISA adapter and started shipping it with DOS driver software, making it usable on IBM PCs.\nThe EtherLink adapter had several advantages over competitors. It was the first network interface card (NIC) to use VLSI semiconductor technology (developed in partnership with Seeq Technologies). This meant most of the functions, including the transceiver, could be contained on a single chip, so the price for Etherlink ($950) was significantly lower than of its competitors. 3Com introduced a new, thinner coaxial cable for the card, called Thin Ethernet, making it more convenient to install and use. Finally, Etherlink was the first Ethernet adapter for the IBM PC.\nBecause both businesses and home users adopted the IBM PC, its market expanded rapidly, and by 1982, IBM was shipping 200,000 units a month. Since IBM hadn't realized that businesses would want the computers connected by a network, Etherlink sales filled the vacuum and in 1984 3Com was able to file for a public stock offering. The Etherlink approach was standardized by IEEE as 10BASE2 in 1984.\nAlso in the early 1980s, Novell began selling Network Interface Cards (NICs) to go with its NetWare operating system. These NE2000 NICs were all Ethernet, and because NetWare became an important application for businesses, this increased the demand for Ethernet adapters. Then in 1989, Novell sold its NIC business and licensed the NE2000 card, creating a highly competitive market and driving the price of Ethernet cards down, while cards for other technologies such as IBM\u2019s token ring remained high. \nStarting in late 1983, AT&amp;T and NCR promoted a star configuration using unshielded twisted pair cabling (UTP), or regular telephone wire. This became StarLAN, running at 1Mbps over cables up to 500 meters, and was standardized as 1BASE5 by IEEE 802.3, but on August 17, 1987, SynOptics introduced LATTISNET with 10Mbps Ethernet also over regular telephone wire (UTP). In the fall of 1990, the IEEE issued the 802.3i standard for 10BASE-T, Ethernet over twisted pairs, and the following year, Ethernet sales nearly doubled. By 1992, Ethernet was the de facto standard for LANS.\nStandardization.\nIn February 1980, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) started project 802 to standardize local area networks (LAN). The DIX group with Gary Robinson (DEC), Phil Arst (Intel), and Bob Printis (Xerox) submitted the so-called \"Blue Book\" CSMA/CD specification as a candidate for the LAN specification. In addition to CSMA/CD, Token Ring (supported by IBM) and Token Bus (selected and henceforward supported by General Motors) were also considered as candidates for a LAN standard. Competing proposals and broad interest in the initiative led to strong disagreement over which technology to standardize. In December 1980, the group was split into three subgroups, and standardization proceeded separately for each proposal.\nSome members of the DIX group became impatient with the IEEE 802 group's standardization process and concerned that the CSMA/CD standard would differ significantly from their \u201cBlue Book\u201d de facto standard. They turned instead to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), where Friedrich R\u00f6scheisen of Siemens helped to introduce the Blue Book as a candidate standard to a newly-created \u201cLocal Networks\u201d Task Group (TC24). Gary Robinson later claimed to have instigated the effort to convince ECMA to standardize CSMA/CD. ECMA approved a standard in June 1982 that was very close to the DIX de facto standard. Because the DIX proposal was most technically complete and because of the speedy action taken by ECMA which decisively contributed to the conciliation of opinions within IEEE, the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard was approved in December 1982. IEEE published the 802.3 standard as a draft in 1983 and as a standard in 1985.\nApproval of Ethernet on the international level was achieved by a similar, cross-partisan action with Fromm as the liaison officer working to integrate with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 83 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee 97 Sub Committee 6. The ISO 8802-3 standard was published in 1989.\nEvolution.\nEthernet has evolved to include higher bandwidth, improved medium access control methods, and different physical media. The multidrop coaxial cable was replaced with physical point-to-point links connected by Ethernet repeaters or switches.\nEthernet stations communicate by sending each other data packets: blocks of data individually sent and delivered. As with other IEEE 802 LANs, adapters come programmed with globally unique 48-bit MAC address so that each Ethernet station has a unique address. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations.\nAn EtherType field in each frame is used by the operating system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an Internet Protocol version such as IPv4). Ethernet frames are said to be \"self-identifying\", because of the EtherType field. Self-identifying frames make it possible to intermix multiple protocols on the same physical network and allow a single computer to use multiple protocols together. Despite the evolution of Ethernet technology, all generations of Ethernet (excluding early experimental versions) use the same frame formats. Mixed-speed networks can be built using Ethernet switches and repeaters supporting the desired Ethernet variants.\nDue to the ubiquity of Ethernet, and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, by 2004 most manufacturers built Ethernet interfaces directly into PC motherboards, eliminating the need for a separate network card.\nShared medium.\nEthernet was originally based on the idea of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable acting as a broadcast transmission medium. The method used was similar to those used in radio systems, with the common cable providing the communication channel likened to the \"Luminiferous aether\" in 19th-century physics, and it was from this reference that the name \"Ethernet\" was derived.\nThe original Ethernet's shared coaxial cable (the shared medium) traversed a building or campus to connect every attached machine. A scheme known as carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing Token Ring or Token Bus technologies. Computers are connected to an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) transceiver, which is in turn connected to the cable (with thin Ethernet the transceiver is usually integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.\nThrough the first half of the 1980s, Ethernet's 10BASE5 implementation utilised a coaxial cable in diameter, later referred to as \"thick Ethernet\" or \"thicknet\". Its successor, 10BASE2, called \"thin Ethernet\" or \"thinnet\", used the RG-58 coaxial cable. The emphasis was on making installation of the cable easier and less costly.\nSince all communication happens on the same wire, any information sent by one computer is received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination. The network interface card interrupts the CPU only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it. Use of a single cable also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are simultaneously active.\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The loss of data and retransmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. However, a Xerox report in 1980, published in Communications of the ACM, studied the performance of an existing Ethernet installation under both normal and artificially generated heavy load. The report claimed that 98% throughput on the LAN was observed. This is in contrast with token passing LANs (Token Ring, Token Bus), all of which suffer throughput degradation as each new node comes into the LAN, due to token waits. This report was controversial, as modeling showed that collision-based networks theoretically became unstable under loads as low as 37% of nominal capacity. Many early researchers failed to understand these results. Performance on real networks is significantly better.\nIn a modern Ethernet, the stations do not all share one channel through a shared cable or a simple repeater hub; instead, each station communicates with a switch, which in turn forwards that traffic to the destination station. In this topology, collisions are only possible if the station and switch attempt to communicate with each other at the same time, and collisions are limited to this link. Furthermore, the 10BASE-T standard introduced a full duplex mode of operation, which became familiar with Fast Ethernet and the de facto standard with Gigabit Ethernet. In full duplex, a switch and a station can send and receive simultaneously, and therefore modern Ethernet networks are completely collision-free.\nRepeaters and hubs.\nFor signal degradation and timing reasons, coaxial Ethernet segments have a restricted size. Somewhat larger networks can be built by using an Ethernet repeater. Early repeaters had only two ports, allowing, at most, a doubling of network size. Once repeaters with more than two ports became available, it was possible to wire the network in a star topology. Early experiments with star topologies (called \"Fibernet\") using optical fiber were published by 1978.\nShared cable Ethernet is always hard to install in offices because its bus topology is in conflict with the star topology cable plans designed into buildings for telephony. Modifying Ethernet to conform to twisted-pair telephone wiring already installed in commercial buildings provided another opportunity to lower costs, expand the installed base, and leverage building design, and, thus, twisted-pair Ethernet was the next logical development in the mid-1980s.\nEthernet on unshielded twisted-pair cables (UTP) began with StarLAN at 1\u00a0Mbit/s in the mid-1980s.12-13 In 1987 SynOptics introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10\u00a0Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology with a central hub, later called LattisNet. These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.\nDespite the physical star topology and the presence of separate transmit and receive channels in the twisted pair and fiber media, repeater-based Ethernet networks still use half-duplex and CSMA/CD, with only minimal activity by the repeater, primarily the generation of the jam signal in dealing with packet collisions. Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.\nBridging and switching.\nWhile repeaters can isolate some aspects of Ethernet segments, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. The entire network is one collision domain, and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes and creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.\nTo alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. Broadcast traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to the incremental deployment of faster Ethernet variants.\nIn 1989, Motorola Codex introduced their 6310 EtherSpan, and Kalpana introduced their EtherSwitch; these were examples of the first commercial Ethernet switches. Early switches such as this used cut-through switching where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment. This reduces the forwarding latency. One drawback of this method is that it does not readily allow a mixture of different link speeds. Another is that packets that have been corrupted are still propagated through the network. The eventual remedy for this was a return to the original store and forward approach of bridging, where the packet is read into a buffer on the switch in its entirety, its frame check sequence verified and only then the packet is forwarded. In modern network equipment, this process is typically done using application-specific integrated circuits allowing packets to be forwarded at wire speed.\nWhen a twisted pair or fiber link segment is used and neither end is connected to a repeater, full-duplex Ethernet becomes possible over that segment. In full-duplex mode, both devices can transmit and receive to and from each other at the same time, and there is no collision domain. This doubles the aggregate bandwidth of the link and is sometimes advertised as double the link speed (for example, 200\u00a0Mbit/s for Fast Ethernet). The elimination of the collision domain for these connections also means that all the link's bandwidth can be used by the two devices on that segment and that segment length is not limited by the constraints of collision detection.\nSince packets are typically delivered only to the port they are intended for, traffic on a switched Ethernet is less public than on shared-medium Ethernet. Despite this, switched Ethernet should still be regarded as an insecure network technology, because it is easy to subvert switched Ethernet systems by means such as ARP spoofing and MAC flooding.\nThe bandwidth advantages, the improved isolation of devices from each other, the ability to easily mix different speeds of devices and the elimination of the chaining limits inherent in non-switched Ethernet have made switched Ethernet the dominant network technology.\nAdvanced networking.\nSimple switched Ethernet networks, while a great improvement over repeater-based Ethernet, suffer from single points of failure, attacks that trick switches or hosts into sending data to a machine even if it is not intended for it, scalability and security issues with regard to switching loops, broadcast radiation, and multicast traffic.\nAdvanced networking features in switches use Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) or the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to maintain a loop-free, meshed network, allowing physical loops for redundancy (STP) or load-balancing (SPB). Shortest Path Bridging includes the use of the link-state routing protocol IS-IS to allow larger networks with shortest path routes between devices.\nAdvanced networking features also ensure port security, provide protection features such as MAC lockdown and broadcast radiation filtering, use VLANs to keep different classes of users separate while using the same physical infrastructure, and use link aggregation to add bandwidth to overloaded links and to provide some redundancy.\nIn 2016, Ethernet replaced InfiniBand as the most popular system interconnect of TOP500 supercomputers.\nVarieties.\nThe Ethernet physical layer evolved over a considerable time span and encompasses coaxial, twisted pair and fiber-optic physical media interfaces, with speeds from 1 Mbit/s to 400 Gbit/s. The first introduction of twisted-pair CSMA/CD was StarLAN, standardized as 802.3 1BASE5. While 1BASE5 had little market penetration, it defined the physical apparatus (wire, plug/jack, pin-out, and wiring plan) that would be carried over to 10BASE-T through 10GBASE-T.\nThe most common forms used are 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T. All three use twisted-pair cables and 8P8C modular connectors. They run at 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, and 1 Gbit/s, respectively.\nFiber optic variants of Ethernet (that commonly use SFP modules) are also very popular in larger networks, offering high performance, better electrical isolation and longer distance (tens of kilometers with some versions). In general, network protocol stack software will work similarly on all varieties.\nFrame structure.\nIn IEEE 802.3, a datagram is called a \"packet\" or \"frame\". \"Packet\" is used to describe the overall transmission unit and includes the preamble, start frame delimiter (SFD) and carrier extension (if present). The \"frame\" begins after the start frame delimiter with a frame header featuring source and destination MAC addresses and the EtherType field giving either the protocol type for the payload protocol or the length of the payload. The middle section of the frame consists of payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check, which is used to detect corruption of data in transit. Notably, Ethernet packets have no time-to-live field, leading to possible problems in the presence of a switching loop.\nAutonegotiation.\nAutonegotiation is the procedure by which two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, e.g. speed and duplex mode. Autonegotiation was initially an optional feature, first introduced with 100BASE-TX (1995 IEEE 802.3u Fast Ethernet standard), and is backward compatible with 10BASE-T. The specification was improved in the 1998 release of IEEE 802.3. Autonegotiation is mandatory for 1000BASE-T and faster.\nError conditions.\nSwitching loop.\nA switching loop or bridge loop occurs in computer networks when there is more than one Layer 2 (OSI model) path between two endpoints (e.g. multiple connections between two network switches or two ports on the same switch connected to each other). The loop creates broadcast storms as broadcasts and multicasts are forwarded by switches out every port, the switch or switches will repeatedly rebroadcast the broadcast messages flooding the network. Since the Layer 2 header does not support a \"time to live\" (TTL) value, if a frame is sent into a looped topology, it can loop forever.\nA physical topology that contains switching or bridge loops is attractive for redundancy reasons, yet a switched network must not have loops. The solution is to allow physical loops, but create a loop-free logical topology using the SPB protocol or the older STP on the network switches.\nJabber.\nA node that is sending longer than the maximum transmission window for an Ethernet packet is considered to be \"jabbering\". Depending on the physical topology, jabber detection and remedy differ somewhat.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born in Ruse, Bulgaria, to a Sephardic Jewish family, he later lived in England, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. He won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is noted for his nonfiction book \"Crowds and Power\", among other works.\nEarly life.\nBorn in 1905 to businessman Jacques Canetti and Mathilde \"n\u00e9e\" Arditti in Ruse, a city on the Danube in Bulgaria, Canetti was the eldest of three sons. His ancestors were Sephardic Jews. His paternal ancestors settled in Ruse from Ottoman Adrianople. The original family name was \"Ca\u00f1ete\", named after Ca\u00f1ete, Cuenca, a village in Spain.\nIn Ruse, Canetti's father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building, which they had built in 1898. Canetti's mother descended from the Arditti family, one of the oldest Sephardic families in Bulgaria, who were among the founders of the Ruse Jewish colony in the late 18th century. The Ardittis can be traced to the 14th century, when they were court physicians and astronomers to the Aragonese royal court of Alfonso IV and Pedro IV. Before settling in Ruse, they had migrated to Italy and lived in Livorno in the 17th century.\nCanetti spent his childhood years, from 1905 to 1911, in Ruse until the family moved to Manchester, England, where Canetti's father joined a business established by his wife's brothers. In 1912, his father suddenly died, and his mother moved with their children first to Lausanne, and later in the same year, when Canetti was seven, to Vienna. His mother insisted that he learn and speak German. By this time, Canetti already spoke Ladino (his native language), Bulgarian, English, and some French; the last two he studied in the year he spent in Britain. Subsequently, the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to Z\u00fcrich and then (until 1924) to Frankfurt, where Canetti graduated from high school.\nCanetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature.\nCareer.\nIntroduced into the literary circles of First Republic Vienna, he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the July Revolt of 1927, came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings) and left the place quickly with his bicycle. He received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Vienna in 1929 but never worked as a chemist.\nHe published two works in Vienna, \"Kom\u00f6die der Eitelkeit\" 1934 (The Comedy of Vanity) and \"Die Blendung\" 1935 (\"Auto-da-F\u00e9\", 1935), before escaping to Great Britain. He reflected on the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in the novel \"Die Blendung\" and in the non-fiction \"Crowds and Power\" (1960). He wrote several volumes of memoirs, contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1934 in Vienna he married Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon (1897\u20131963), who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant. Canetti remained open to relationships with other women. He had a short affair with the sculptor Anna Mahler, the daughter of the composer Gustav Mahler. In 1938, after the \"Anschluss\" with Germany, the Canettis moved to London. He became closely involved with the painter Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, who was to remain a close companion for many years. He also had a close relationship with the writer Frieda Benedikt (1916\u20131953) (pseudonym Anna Sebastian), whom Canetti had already met in Vienna in 1936. He was one of Iris Murdoch's lovers. Her husband John Bayley's memoir refers to him variously as 'the Dichter', 'sage', and 'the monster of Hampstead'. Canetti, who demanded submission from women, later mercilessly skewered Murdoch in his posthumous memoir \"Party im Blitz\" (2003).\nAfter Veza died in 1963, Canetti married Hera Buschor (1933\u20131988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972. Canetti's brother Jacques Canetti settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French chanson. Despite being a German-language writer, Canetti settled in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, Canetti lived mostly in Z\u00fcrich.\nAwards.\nA writer in German, Canetti won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss Vienna: \"Die Gerettete Zunge\" (\"The Tongue Set Free\"); \"Die Fackel im Ohr\" (\"The Torch in My Ear\"), and \"Das Augenspiel\" (\"The Play of the Eyes\"); for his modernist novel \"Auto-da-F\u00e9\" (\"Die Blendung\"); and for \"Crowds and Power\", a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations.\nDeath.\nIn the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years. He died in Z\u00fcrich in 1994.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9506", "revid": "5839510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9506", "title": "Edward Jenner", "text": "English physician and pioneer of vaccines (1749\u20131823)\nEdward Jenner (17 May 1749 \u2013 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who pioneered the concept of vaccines and created the smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine. The terms \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination\" are derived from \"Variolae vaccinae\" ('pustules of the cow'), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the title of his \"Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox\", in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.\nJenner is often called \"the father of immunology\", and his work is said to have saved \"more lives than any other man\".100 In Jenner's time, smallpox killed around 10% of the global population, with the number as high as 20% in towns and cities where infection spread more easily. In 1821, he was appointed physician to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. He was a member of the Royal Society. In the field of zoology, he was among the first modern scholars to describe the brood parasitism of the cuckoo (Aristotle also noted this behaviour in his \"History of Animals\"). In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the \"100 Greatest Britons\".\nEarly life.\nEdward Jenner was born on 17 May 1749 in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the vicar of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.\nEducation and training.\nWhen Jenner was young, he went to school in Wotton-under-Edge at Katherine Lady Berkeley's School and in Cirencester. During this time, Jenner was inoculated (by variolation) for smallpox, which had a lifelong effect upon his general health. At age 13, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon of Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire, gaining most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.\nIn 1770, at age 21, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon John Hunter and others at St George's Hospital, London. William Osler records that Hunter gave Jenner William Harvey's advice, well known in medical circles (and characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment), \"Don't think; try.\" Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over natural history and proposed him for the Royal Society. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful family doctor and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley. In 1792, \"with twenty years' experience of general practice and surgery, Jenner obtained the degree of MD from the University of St Andrews\".\nLater life.\nJenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, Rodborough, Gloucestershire. Members dined together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on angina pectoris, ophthalmia, and cardiac valvular disease and commented on cowpox. He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.\nJenner became a master mason on 30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449. From 1812 to 1813, he served as worshipful master of Royal Berkeley Lodge of Faith and Friendship.\nZoology.\nJenner was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1788, following his publication of a careful study of the previously misunderstood life of the nested cuckoo, a study that combined observation, experiment, and dissection.\nJenner described how the newly hatched cuckoo pushed its host's eggs and fledgling chicks out of the nest (contrary to existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it). Having observed this behaviour, Jenner demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for it\u00a0\u2013 the baby cuckoo has a depression in its back, not present after 12 days of life, that enables it to cup eggs and other chicks. The adult does not remain long enough in the area to perform this task. Jenner's findings were published in \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" in 1788.\n\"The singularity of its shape is well adapted to these purposes; for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the scapula downwards is very broad, with a considerable depression in the middle. This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist Jemima Blackburn, a keen observer of birdlife, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Blackburn's description and illustration were enough to convince Charles Darwin to revise a later edition of \"On the Origin of Species\".\nJenner's interest in zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation. Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission. At the time, there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations. We see this connection now; many present-day vaccinations include animal parts from cows, rabbits, and chicken eggs, which can be attributed to the work of Jenner and his cowpox/smallpox vaccination.\nMarriage and human medicine.\nJenner married Catherine Kingscote (who died in 1815 from tuberculosis) in March 1788. He might have met her while he and other fellows were experimenting with balloons. Jenner's trial balloon descended into Kingscote Park, Gloucestershire, owned by Catherine's father Anthony Kingscote. They had three children together: Edward Robert (1789\u20131810), Catherine Fitzhardinge (1794\u20131833) and Robert Fitzhardinge (1797\u20131854), who was 11 months old when Edward Jenner inoculated him with his cow-pox vaccine.\nJenner earned his MD from the University of St Andrews in 1792. He is credited with advancing the understanding of angina pectoris. In his correspondence with Heberden, Jenner wrote: \"How much the heart must suffer from the coronary arteries not being able to perform their functions\".\nInvention of the vaccine.\nInoculation was already a standard practice in Asian and African medicine but involved serious risks, including the possibility that those inoculated would become contagious and spread the disease to others. In 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had imported variolation to Britain after having observed it in Constantinople. While Johnnie Notions had great success with his self-devised inoculation (and was reputed not to have lost a single patient), his method's practice was limited to the Shetland Islands. Voltaire wrote that at this time 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died from it. He also stated that the Circassians used the inoculation from time immemorial, and that the Turks may have borrowed the custom from them. In 1766, Daniel Bernoulli analysed smallpox morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of inoculation.\nBy 1768, English physician John Fewster had realised that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox. In the years following 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine against smallpox in humans. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated with cowpox and presumably induced immunity in his wife and two children during the 1774 smallpox epidemic, though it was not until Jenner's work that the procedure became widely understood. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success. In 1780, Jacques Antoine Rabaut-Pommier made similar observations in France.\nJenner postulated that the pus in blisters from sufferers of cowpox (a disease similar to smallpox but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox. On May 14,1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom (whose hide now hangs on the wall of the St. George's Medical School library, now in Tooting, London). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on vaccination.\nJenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day; this led to a fever and some uneasiness but no full-blown infection. Later, Jenner injected Phipps with variolous material, the routine method of immunization at that time and again no disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection. There were no unexpected side effects, and neither Phipps nor any other recipients underwent any future 'breakthrough' cases.\nJenner's biographer John Baron later speculated that it was Jenner's observation of the unblemished complexion of milkmaids that led to his understanding that it was possible to be inoculated against smallpox by being exposed to cowpox, that is he did not build on the work of his predecessors. The milkmaid story is still widely repeated even though it appears to be a myth.\nUS physician Donald Hopkins has written, \"Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.\" Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.\nJenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, though the initial paper was not published. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases, including his 11-month-old son Robert. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolation\u00a0\u2013 the use of smallpox to induce immunity\u00a0\u2013 and provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge (\"see\" Vaccination Act).\nThe success of Jenner's discovery soon spread around Europe and was used \"en masse\" in the Spanish Balmis Expedition (1803\u20131806), a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao and China led by Francisco Javier de Balmis with the aim of giving the smallpox vaccine to thousands. The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote: \"I don't imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this\". Napoleon, who at the time was at war with Britain, had all his French troops vaccinated, awarded Jenner a medal, and at Jenner's request, released two English prisoners of war, allowing them to return home. Napoleon remarked he could not \"refuse anything to one of the greatest benefactors of mankind\".\nJenner's continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice. He was supported by his colleagues and King George III in petitioning Parliament, and was granted \u00a310,000 for his work on vaccination in 1802. In 1807, Jenner was granted another \u00a320,000 after the Royal College of Physicians confirmed the widespread efficacy of vaccination.\nLater life.\nJenner was later elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1802, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1804, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806. In 1803, he became president of the Jennerian Society in London, concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate smallpox. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the Royal Society of Medicine) and presented several papers there. In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.\nReturning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, Jenner was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV and was also made mayor of Berkeley and magistrate303 (justice of the peace). Jenner continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his \"Observations on the Migration of Birds\" to the Royal Society.\nJenner was a Freemason.\nDeath.\nJenner was found in a state of apoplexy on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed.314 He did not recover and died the next day of an apparent stroke, his second. Jenner was 73 years old. He was buried in the family vault at the Church of St Mary, Berkeley.\nReligious views.\nNeither fanatic nor lax, Jenner was a Christian who in his personal correspondence showed himself quite spiritual.141 Some days before his death, Jenner stated to a friend: \"I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; but I wonder that they are not grateful to God for the good which He has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures\".295\nLegacy.\nIn 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox an eradicated disease. This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.\nJenner's vaccine laid the foundation for contemporary discoveries in immunology. In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. Commemorated on postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail, he featured in their World Changers issue along with Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday and Alan Turing in 1999. The lunar crater Jenner is named in his honour.\nIn 2025 POX, a new play by Janet Bolam, was performed by the Cotswold Players in the garden of Dr Jenner's House.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been published since 1768, and after several ownership changes is currently owned by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32\u00a0volumes and 32,640\u00a0pages, was the last printed edition. Since 2016, it has been published exclusively as an online encyclopaedia at the website Britannica.com.\nPrinted for 245\u00a0years, the \"Britannica\" was the longest-running in-print encyclopaedia in the English language. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, Scotland, in weekly instalments that came together to form three volumes. At first, the encyclopaedia, from edition to edition, grew quickly in size. The second edition was extended to 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801\u20131810), the \"Britannica\" had expanded to 20 volumes. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, its size (at least in terms of total word length) has remained roughly steady, at about 40\u00a0million words.\nThe \"Britannica\"'s rising stature as an authoritative and scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875\u20131889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Starting with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the \"Britannica\" shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. Though published in the United States since 1901, the \"Britannica\" has for the most part maintained British English spelling.\nIn 1932, the \"Britannica\" adopted a policy of \"continuous revision,\" in which the encyclopaedia is continually revised and reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. The publishers of \"Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia\" had already pioneered such a policy.\nThe 15th edition (1974\u20132010) has a three-part structure: a 12-volume of short articles (generally fewer than 750\u00a0words), a 17-volume of long articles (two to 310\u00a0pages), and a single volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. The was meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the ; readers are advised to study the outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. \nIn the 21st century, the \"Britannica\" faced strong competition: in particular from the digital and multimedia encyclopaedia Microsoft \"Encarta\", and later from the online peer-produced encyclopaedia Wikipedia. Despite (or perhaps because of) such competition, Britannica retained its reputation for authoritative, comprehensive, structured, and scholarly treatments of included subjects. While it continued to score well in assessments of its overall quality, as compared to its competitors, it could not (as an expert-authored compilation of a limited number of articles on only important subjects), match their breadth of coverage and continuous updating. \nIn March 2012, it announced it would no longer publish printed editions and would focus instead on the online version.\nHistory.\nPast owners have included, in chronological order, the Scottish printers Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, the Scottish bookseller Archibald Constable, the Scottish publisher A. &amp; C. Black, Horace Everett Hooper, Sears Roebuck, William Benton, and Jacqui Safra, a Swiss billionaire residing in New York.\nRecent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, \"Encarta\" and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias. To remain competitive, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the \"Britannica\", reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD, and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has also promoted spin-off reference works.\nEditions.\nThe \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd edition and to the 4th, 5th, and 6th editions as a group (see the Table below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, and the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. For the 15th edition (1974), the \"Britannica\" underwent a massive reorganization and became the \"New Encyclopaedia Britannica\". The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were quite different from early ones.\nThroughout its history, the \"Britannica\" has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material. In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge.\nThe history of the \"Britannica\" can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management or reorganization of the encyclopaedia.\n1768\u20131824.\nIn the first era (1st\u20136th editions, 1768\u20131824), the \"Britannica\" was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others.\nThe \"Britannica\" was first published in serial instalments between December 1768 and about August 1771 in Edinburgh as the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan\". The new plan in question was an organizational one, namely to include two kinds of typographically distinct entries (articles and longer \"treatises\") in a single alphabetical sequence. In principle, \"treatises\" were to cover the arts and sciences, leaving articles to deal with their subordinate objects. The idea may have been inspired by Dennis de Coetlogon's \"Universal History of Arts and Sciences\", an alphabetical encyclopaedia that contained only treatises. Regardless, the \"Britannica\" continued to intermix formally distinguished articles and treatises through the 10th edition.\nAccording to Arthur Herman's book \"How the Scots Invented the Modern World\", the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment. It is important to be more specific, however, about how the early \"Britannica\" was and was not Scottish and a monument to the Scottish Enlightenment. The two publishers and William Smellie, whom they engaged to compile the work, were all Scots. Much of the first edition was compiled by Smellie from Scottish sources. At the same time, despite working in Edinburgh, the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment, neither Smellie nor James Tytler, the editor of the second edition, arranged for contributions from any local luminaries. Nor does the work seem to have been much noticed by participants in the Scottish Enlightenment before its third edition. Likewise, it is significant that the title chosen was the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" (and not the \"Encyclopaedia Scotorum\", or 'Scottish Encyclopaedia'). Indeed, by the time of the third edition, the \"Britannica\" was starting to evolve into a symbol of Britishness.\nIn this era, the \"Britannica\" grew significantly in size, sales, and reputation. Just as important were changes to the way it was compiled and edited. On his tombstone, Smellie was characterized as the editor of the first edition of the \"Britannica\", but he was not an editor in anything like the sense in which Macvey Napier, who edited the \"Supplement to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Editions\", was. Smellie compiled nearly all the articles in the first edition himself, although we know he had minor help from at least one contributor, James Anderson, who wrote the articles \"Dictionary, \"Pneumatics,\" and \"Smoke.\" For the third edition and its \"Supplement\", editors still compiled the bulk of the articles, but they were assisted by dozens of collaborators. We know of thirty-five who wrote for the third edition, for example, some of them named in the preface, including the chemist Joseph Black and the natural philosopher John Robison. Then, by the time of the \"Supplement\", Napier had become mostly a managing editor. He still wrote some articles, but his main job was recruiting collaborators, for the prospectus stipulated that \"the various articles, in the Supplement, shall be written by the most Eminent Men, in the different departments of Science.\"\nSeveral other encyclopaedias competed with the \"Britannica\" throughout this period, among them editions of Ephraim Chambers' and Abraham Rees's \"Cyclop\u00e6dia\", Coleridge's \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana\", and David Brewster's \"Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia\".\n1827\u20131901.\nDuring the second era (7th\u20139th editions, 1827\u20131901), the \"Britannica\" was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm A &amp; C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the \"Britannica\"'s reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.\nProduction of the 9th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes, the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the \"Scholar's Edition\", the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all \"Britannicas\". After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith. No biographies of living persons were included. James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science. However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the \"Britannica\" faced financial difficulties.\n1901\u20131973.\nIn the third era (10th\u201314th editions, 1901\u20131973), the \"Britannica\" was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was an eleven-volume supplement (including one each of maps and an index) to the 9th, numbered as volumes 25\u201335, but the 11th edition was a completely new work; its owner, Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on the project.\nWhen Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the \"Britannica\" was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920\u20131923, 1928\u20131943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, assumed presidency of the \"Britannica\"; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions. Powell developed new educational products that built upon the \"Britannica\"'s reputation.\nIn 1943, Sears donated the to the University of Chicago. William Benton, then a vice president of the university, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the university, with the university holding an option on the stock. Benton became chairman of the board and managed the \"Britannica\" until his death in 1973. Benton set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the \"Britannica\" until 1996, and whose sole beneficiary was the University of Chicago. In 1968, the \"Britannica\" celebrated its bicentennial.\n1974\u20131994.\nIn the fourth era (1974\u20131994), the \"Britannica\" introduced its 15th edition, which was reorganized into three parts: the , the , and the . Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of \"Britannica\" from 1965), the \"Britannica\" sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the and ) provoked a \"firestorm of criticism\" of the initial 15th edition. In response, the 15th edition was completely reorganized and indexed for a re-release in 1985. This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised through the release of the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the \"New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", although it has also been promoted as \"Britannica 3\".\nOn 9 March 1976 the US Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.\n1994\u2013present.\nIn the fifth era (1994\u2013present), digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online.\nIn 1996, the \"Britannica\" was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Incorporated, developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the \"Britannica\" name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.\n\"Britannica\"'s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set. \"Britannica Global Edition\" was also printed in 2010, containing 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller \"compact\" volumes, as well as over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain and sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up through the 14th had. The following is \"Britannica\"'s description of the work:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The editors of , the world standard in reference since 1768, present the \"Britannica Global Edition\". Developed specifically to provide comprehensive and global coverage of the world around us, this unique product contains thousands of timely, relevant, and essential articles drawn from the itself, as well as from the \"Britannica Concise Encyclopedia\", the \"Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions\", and Compton's by Britannica. Written by international experts and scholars, the articles in this collection reflect the standards that have been the hallmark of the leading English-language encyclopedia for over 240 years.\nIn 2020, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. released the \"Britannica All New Children's Encyclopedia: What We Know and What We Don't\", an encyclopaedia aimed primarily at younger readers, covering major topics. The encyclopaedia was widely praised for bringing back the print format. It was \"Britannica\"'s first encyclopaedia for children since 1984.\nDedications.\nThe \"Britannica\" was dedicated to the reigning British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States. Thus, the 11th edition is \"dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George the Fifth, King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to William Howard Taft, President of the United States of America.\" The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is \"Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight David Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second.\"\nPrint version.\nFrom 1985, the \"Britannica\" consisted of four parts: the , the , the , and a two-volume index. The \"Britannica\"'s articles are contained in the and , which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from two pages to 310 pages, with references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors. The articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the . The articles are meant as authoritative, well-written commentaries on their subjects, as well as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere. The longest article (310 pages) is on the subject of the United States, and it resulted from merging separate articles on the individual US states. A 2013 \"Global Edition\" of \"Britannica\" contained approximately 40,000 articles.\nInformation can be found in the \"Britannica\" by following the cross-references in the and ; these are sparse, however, averaging one cross-reference per page. Readers are instead recommended to consult the alphabetical index or the , which organizes the \"Britannica\"'s contents by topic.\nThe core of the is its \"Outline of Knowledge\", which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge. Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the \"Britannica\"'s editors to decide which articles should be included in the and . The Outline can also be used as a study guide, as it puts subjects in their proper perspective and suggests a series of \"Britannica\" articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth. However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used for this purpose, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia. The contains colour transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the \"Britannica\".\nTaken together, the and comprise roughly 40\u00a0million words and 24,000 images. The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the \"Britannica\", together with 474,675 subentries under those topics. The \"Britannica\" generally prefers British spelling over American; for example, it uses \"colour\" (not \"color\"), \"centre\" (not \"center\"), and \"encyclopaedia\" (not \"encyclopedia\"). There are some exceptions to this rule, such as \"defense\" rather than \"defence\". Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as \"Color: \"see\" Colour.\"\nSince 1936, the contents (articles) of \"Britannica\" have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of the articles considered for revision each year. According to one Britannica website, 46% of the articles in the 2007 edition were revised over the preceding three years; however, according to another Britannica website, only 35% of the articles were revised over the same period.\nThe alphabetization of articles in the and follows strict rules. Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as \"1812, War of\" are alphabetized as if the number had been written out (\"Eighteen-twelve, War of\"). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England, listed in \"Britannica\" as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were \"Charles, France, 3\" and \"Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1\".) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.\nIn March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was part of a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution. The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was 1990, when 120,000 sets were sold, but sales had dropped to 40,000 per annum by 1996. There were 12,000 sets of the 2010 edition printed, of which 8,000 had been sold by March 2012. By late April 2012, the remaining copies of the 2010 edition had sold out at Britannica's online store. As of 2016[ [update]], a replica of Britannica's 1768 first edition is available via the online store.\nRelated printed material.\n\"Britannica Junior\" was first published in 1934 as 12 volumes. It was expanded to 15 volumes in 1947, and renamed \"Britannica Junior Encyclop\u00e6dia\" in 1963. It was taken off the market after the 1984 printing.\nA British \"Children's Britannica\" edited by John Armitage was issued in London in 1960. Its contents were determined largely by the eleven-plus standardized tests given in Britain. Britannica introduced the \"Children's Britannica\" to the US market in 1988, aimed at ages seven to 14.\nIn 1961, a 16-volume \"Young Children's Encyclopaedia\" was issued for children just learning to read. \"My First Britannica\" is aimed at children ages six to 12, and the \"Britannica Discovery Library\" is for children aged three to six (issued 1974 to 1991). \"Compton's by Britannica\", first published in 2007, incorporating the former \"Compton's Encyclopedia\", is aimed at 10- to 17-year-olds and consists of 26 volumes and 11,000 pages.\nThere have been, and are, several abridged \"Britannica\" encyclopaedias. The single-volume \"Britannica Concise Encyclop\u00e6dia\" has 28,000 short articles condensing the larger 32-volume \"Britannica\"; there are authorized translations in languages such as Chinese created by Encyclopedia of China Publishing House and Vietnamese.\nSince 1938, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. has also published an annual \"Book of the Year\" to 'update' the encyclopaedia proper: this covers the past year's events and presents a variety of updated statistics (eg as to national populations, Nobel Prize winners, and the like). A given edition of the \"Book of the Year\" is named in terms of the year of its publication, though the volume actually covers the events and statistics of the previous year. \nThe company also publishes several specialized reference works, such as \"Shakespeare: The Essential Guide to the Life and Works of the Bard\" (2006).\nOptical disc, online, and mobile versions.\nThe \"Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2012 DVD\" contains over 100,000 articles. This includes regular \"Britannica\" articles, as well as others drawn from the \"Britannica Student Encyclop\u00e6dia\", and the \"Britannica Elementary Encyclop\u00e6dia.\" The package includes a range of supplementary content including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also offers study tools and dictionary and thesaurus entries from Merriam-Webster.\n\"Britannica\" Online is a website with more than 120,000 articles and is updated regularly. It has daily features, updates and links to news reports from \"The New York Times\" and the BBC. As of 2009[ [update]], roughly 60% of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's revenue came from online operations, of which around 15% came from subscriptions to the consumer version of the websites. As of 2006[ [update]], subscriptions were available on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis. Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries; such institutional subscribers constitute an important part of Britannica's business. Beginning in early 2007, the \"Britannica\" made articles freely available if they are hyperlinked from an external site. Non-subscribers are served pop-ups and advertising.\nOn 20 February 2007, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. announced that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to launch a mobile encyclopaedia. Users would be able to send a question via text message, and AskMeNow would search \"Britannica\"'s 28,000-article concise encyclopaedia to return an answer to the query. Daily topical features sent directly to users' mobile phones were also planned.\nOn 3 June 2008, an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannica's online content (in the spirit of a wiki), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff, was announced. Approved contributions would be credited, though contributing automatically grants Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. perpetual, irrevocable licence to those contributions.\nOn 22 January 2009, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that the company would be accepting edits and additions to the online \"Britannica\" website from the public. The published edition of the encyclopaedia would not be affected by the changes. Individuals wishing to edit the \"Britannica\" website would have to register under their real name and address prior to editing or submitting their content. All edits submitted would be reviewed and checked and will have to be approved by the encyclopaedia's professional staff. Contributions from non-academic users would sit in a separate section from the expert-generated \"Britannica\" content, as would content submitted by non-\"Britannica\" scholars. Articles written by users, if vetted and approved, would also only be available in a special section of the website, separate from the professional articles. Official \"Britannica\" material would carry a \"Britannica Checked\" stamp, to distinguish it from the user-generated content.\nOn 14 September 2010, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. announced a partnership with mobile phone development company Concentric Sky to launch a series of iPhone products aimed at the K\u201312 market. On 20\u00a0July 2011, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. announced that Concentric Sky had ported the Britannica Kids product line to Intel's Intel Atom-based Netbooks and on 26\u00a0October 2011 that it had launched its encyclopaedia as an iPad app. In 2010, Britannica released Britannica ImageQuest, a database of images.\nIn March 2012, it was announced that the company would cease printing the encyclopaedia set, and that it would focus on its online version.\nOn 7 June 2018, Britannica released a Google Chrome extension, \"Britannica Insights\", which shows snippets of information from Britannica Online whenever the user performs a Google Search, in a box to the right of Google's results. Britannica Insights was also available as a Firefox extension but this was taken down due to a code review issue.\nPersonnel and management.\nContributors.\nThe print version of the \"Britannica\" has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, astronomer Carl Sagan, and surgeon Michael DeBakey. Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 (Alfred North Whitehead), while another quarter are retired or emeritus. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on particle physics.\nWhile \"Britannica\"'s authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Leon Trotsky, as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov, some have been criticized for lack of expertise. In 1911, the historian George L. Burr wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With a temerity almost appalling, [the \"Britannica\" contributor, Mr. Philips] ranges over nearly the whole field of European history, political, social, ecclesiastical... The grievance is that [this work] lacks authority. This, too\u2014this reliance on editorial energy instead of on ripe special learning\u2014may, alas, be also counted an \"Americanizing\": for certainly nothing has so cheapened the scholarship of our American encyclopaedias.\nStaff.\nAs of 2007[ [update]], in the 15th edition of \"Britannica\", Dale Hoiberg, a sinologist, was listed as \"Britannica\"'s Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief. Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were Hugh Chisholm (1902\u20131924), James Louis Garvin (1926\u20131932), Franklin Henry Hooper (1932\u20131938), Walter Yust (1938\u20131960), Harry Ashmore (1960\u20131963), Warren E. Preece (1964\u20131968, 1969\u20131975), Sir William Haley (1968\u20131969), Philip W. Goetz (1979\u20131991), and Robert McHenry (1992\u20131997). \nAs of 2007[ [update]] Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor. Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950\u20131964) and Philip W. Goetz.\nPaul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of treasurer, vice president, and chief financial officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.\nThe 2007 editorial staff of the \"Britannica\" included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the and some sections of the .\nEditorial advisors.\nAs of 2012, \"Britannica\" had an editorial board of advisors, which included a number of distinguished figures, primarily scholars from a variety of disciplines.\nThe \"Prop\u00e6dia\" and its \"Outline of Knowledge\" were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of Mortimer J. Adler. Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects \u2013 Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001). The also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned articles.\nCorporate structure.\nDuring much of the 20th century, the \"Britannica\" had a significant ownership stake from the University of Chicago, with many people associated with the university serving senior positions in the organization.331-332 During the mid-20th century, managers and executives at the \"Britannica\" company were lavishly rewarded due to the healthy profit encyclopaedia sales generated, with division managers at the top of the sales organization earning an average salary of $125,000 in 1958 (adjusting for inflation, some $ in current USD).329\nFrom 1974, the company was controlled by the Benton Foundation, of which the University of Chicago was the sole beneficiary. In January 1996, the \"Britannica\" was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra, who serves as its current chair of the board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nIn 1999, a new subsidiary company, Britannica.com Incorporated, was created to develop digital versions of the \"Britannica\"; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Incorporated was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses. In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, who reunited the leadership of the two companies. Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc's Board of Directors.\nIn 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the \"Britannica\"'s Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the \"Britannica\" brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s.\nSales and marketing.\nAlthough prior to 1920 the \"Britannica\" was primarily sold by mail-order, after that time the \"Britannica\" was almost exclusively sold by door-to-door salesmen, who often used high-pressure sales tactics or outright deception in order to secure purchases of the expensive work,317-330 from which they gained a significant commission. This commission in the United States in 1971 was $120\u2013200 (around $-$ adjusted for inflation) per sale. These high-pressure sales tactics resulted in high levels of turnover among \"Britannica\" salesmen, with the company often exaggerating the ease of making a sale to employees, as well as engaging in deceptive job advertising in order to entice people to become salesmen.317-330 The \"Britannica\" was sued several times by the American Federal Trade Commission for deceptive practices.317-330 These practices were common among American encyclopaedia companies.317-330 The development of the significant sales force began in 1932, with most senior leadership of the company by the late 20th century coming from the sales division.\nWhile early on the \"Britannica\" was marketed to adults and in particular during the 19th and early 20th centuries, to an elite educated audience,152-153 by the mid 20th century, the \"Britannica\" (as well as other American encyclopaedias) were primarily marketed to middle-class parents who wished to seek a good education for their children, despite the text not being aimed at a child's reading level.317-330 During the 20th century, the \"Britannica\" differentiated itself from other encyclopaedias by using its long pedigree to present itself as a premium brand. Once the encyclopaedia was purchased, it was typically only opened a few times a year by an average owner.\nCompetition.\nAs the \"Britannica\" is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the \"Encyclopaedia of Mathematics\" or the \"Dictionary of the Middle Ages\", which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the \"Britannica\"'s main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, \"Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia\" and Coleridge's \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana\". In the 20th century, successful competitors included \"Collier's Encyclopedia\", the \"Encyclopedia Americana\", and the \"World Book Encyclopedia\". Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the \"Britannica\" was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English-language encyclopaedia, especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. The print version of the \"Britannica\" was also thus significantly more expensive than its competitors.\nSince the early 1990s, the \"Britannica\" has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books, MIT's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine.\nThe Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated and then made available to users. In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the \"Britannica\" has struggled to stay up to date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust. Eventually, the \"Britannica\" turned to focus more on its online edition.\nPrint encyclopaedias.\nThe has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the 1993 \"Britannica\" with two comparable encyclopaedias, \"Collier's Encyclopedia\" and the \"Encyclopedia Americana\". For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random\u2014circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan\u2014and letter grades of A\u2013D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B\u2212 and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the \"Britannica\" received one \"D\" and seven \"A\"s, \"Encyclopedia Americana\" received eight \"A\"s, and \"Collier's\" received one \"D\" and seven \"A\"s; thus, \"Britannica\" received an average score of 92% for accuracy to \"Americana\"'s 95% and \"Collier's\" 92%. In the timeliness category, \"Britannica\" averaged an 86% to \"Americana\"'s 90% and \"Collier's\" 85%.\nDigital encyclopaedias on optical media.\nThe most notable competitor of the \"Britannica\" among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was \"Encarta\", now discontinued, a modern multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: \"Funk &amp; Wagnalls\", \"Collier's,\" and the \"New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia\". \"Encarta\" was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006. Both occupied the same price range, with the \"2007 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate\" CD or DVD costing US$40\u201350 and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.\nThe \"Britannica\" disc contains 100,000 articles and \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus\" (US only) and offers primary and secondary school editions. \"Encarta\" contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language, and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition. Like \"Encarta\", the digital \"Britannica\" has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary. Like the \"Britannica\", \"Encarta\" was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed for free.\nWikipedia.\nThe main online alternative to \"Britannica\" is Wikipedia. The key differences between the two lie in accessibility; the model of participation they bring to an encyclopaedic project; their respective style sheets and editorial policies; relative ages; the number of subjects treated; the number of languages in which articles are written and made available; and their underlying economic models: unlike \"Britannica\", Wikipedia is not-for-profit, does not carry advertising on its site, and is not connected with traditional profit- and contract-based publishing distribution networks.\n\"Britannica\"'s articles either have known authorship or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most \"Britannica\"'s contributors are experts in their field\u2014some are Nobel laureates. By contrast, the articles on Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise; most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials. It is for this lack of institutional vetting or certification that former \"Britannica\" editor-in-chief Robert McHenry noted his belief in 2004 that Wikipedia could not hope to rival the \"Britannica\" in accuracy.\nIn 2005, the journal \"Nature\" chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called \"relevant\" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles\u2014one from each site on a given topic\u2014side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. \"Nature\" got back 42 usable reviews. The journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in \"Britannica\", an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for \"Britannica\".\nAlthough \"Britannica \"was revealed as the more accurate encyclopaedia, with fewer errors, in its rebuttal, it called \"Nature\"'s study flawed and misleading and called for a \"prompt\" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a \"Britannica\" yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from \"Compton's Encyclopedia\" (called the \"Britannica Student Encyclopedia\" on the company's website).\n\"Nature\" defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of \"Britannica\", it used whatever relevant material was available on \"Britannica\"'s website. Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of \"Britannica UK\" said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wikipedia is a fun site to use and has a lot of interesting entries on there, but their approach wouldn't work for . My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind. They're a chisel, we're a drill, and you need to have the correct tool for the job.\nFor the 15th anniversary of Wikipedia, the \"Telegraph\" published two opinion pieces which compared Wikipedia to \"Britannica\" and falsely claimed that \"Britannica\" had gone bankrupt in 1996. In a January 2016 press release, \"Britannica\" responded by calling Wikipedia \"an impressive achievement\" but argued that critics should avoid \"false comparisons\" to \"Britannica\" in terms of differing models and purposes.\nCritical and popular assessments.\nReputation.\nSince the 3rd edition, the \"Britannica\" has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence, though this reputation has not been without its critics. The 3rd and 9th editions were pirated for sale in the United States, beginning with \"Dobson's Encyclop\u00e6dia\". On the release of the 14th edition, \"Time\" magazine dubbed the \"Britannica\" the \"Patriarch of the Library\". In a related advertisement, naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the \"Britannica\" was \"beyond comparison because there is no competitor\". References to the \"Britannica\" can be found throughout English literature, most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, \"The Red-Headed League\". The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London, Gilbert Inglefield, at the bicentennial of the \"Britannica\".\nThe \"Britannica\" has a reputation for summarizing knowledge. To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire \"Britannica\", taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so. When Fat'h Ali became the Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the \"Britannica\"'s 3rd edition; after reading the complete set, he extended his royal title to include \"Most Formidable Lord and Master of the \".\nWriter George Bernard Shaw has claimed to have read the complete 9th edition, except for the science articles; Richard Evelyn Byrd took the \"Britannica\" as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934; and Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A. J. Jacobs, an editor at \"Esquire\" magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book \"\". Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester and Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.\nAwards.\nThe CD/DVD-ROM version of the \"Britannica\", \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite\", received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers. On 15\u00a0July 2009, was awarded a spot as one of \"Top Ten Superbrands in the UK\" by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.\nCoverage of topics.\nTopics are chosen in part by reference to the \"Outline of Knowledge\". The bulk of the 15th edition of the \"Britannica\" is devoted to geography (26% of the ), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%). A complementary study of the found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%. Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the \"range, depth, and catholicity of coverage [of the \"Britannica\"] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia.\"\nThe \"Britannica\" does not cover topics in equal detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles. The \"Britannica\" covers 50,479 biographies, 5,999 of them about women, with 11.87% being British citizens and 25.51% US citizens. However, the \"Britannica\" has been lauded as the \"least\" biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It can be stated without fear of contradiction that the 15th edition of the \"Britannica\" accords non-Western cultural, social, and scientific developments more notice than any general English-language encyclopedia currently on the market.\u2014\u200a\nCriticism of editorial decisions.\nHarvey Einbinder in the \"Myth of the Britannica\" criticized the 11th edition for the inaccessibility of the text for laymen, saying that many of its articles were too technical for people unfamiliar to the subject to understand.152-153 He made similar criticisms of many of the mathematics and science articles of the then-current 14th edition.236-250\nOn rare occasions, the \"Britannica\" has been criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974\u20131985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, military decorations, and the French poet Joachim du Bellay; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies. Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the and . Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a \"qualified failure ... [that] cares more for juggling its format than for preserving.\" More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 , along with the article on psychology. Harvey Einbinder in \"The Myth of the Britannica\" criticized the practice of condensing entries in the 14th edition, which usually involved simply removing large amounts of the text rather than attempting to condense it by rewriting, resulting in what he considered to be considerable reduction in the quality of the articles.151-168\nSome very few \"Britannica\"-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the \"Britannica\"'s early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788\u20131797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire. The \"Britannica\" has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).\nOther criticisms.\nThe \"Britannica\" has received criticism, particularly as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the \"Britannica\", and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).\nFor example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929\u20131964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, \"The Myth of the Britannica\", the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work. Editors have struggled at times to keep the \"Britannica\" current: one 1994 critic writes, \"It is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision\", noting that the longer articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter articles. Information in the is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other. The bibliographies of the articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.\nIn 2005, a 12-year-old schoolboy in Britain found several inaccuracies in the \"Britannica\"'s entries on Poland and wildlife in Eastern Europe. In 2010, an entry about the Irish Civil War, which incorrectly described it as having been fought between the north and south of Ireland, was discussed in the Irish press following a decision by the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access.\nWriting about the 3rd edition (1788\u20131797), \"Britannica\"'s chief editor George Gleig observed that \"perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan and embracing such a variety of subjects.\" In March 2006, the \"Britannica\" wrote, \"we in no way mean to imply that \"Britannica\" is error-free; we have never made such a claim\". However, the \"Britannica\" sales department had previously made a well-known claim in 1962 regarding the 14th edition that \"[i]t is truth. It is unquestionable fact.\" The sentiment of the 2006 statement was also reflected in the introduction to the first edition of the \"Britannica\", written by its original editor William Smellie:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With regard to errors in general, whether falling under the denomination of mental, typographical or accidental, we are conscious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever. Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties attending the execution of a work of such an extensive nature will make proper allowances. To these we appeal, and shall rest satisfied with the judgment they pronounce.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9509", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9509", "title": "Endometrium", "text": "Inner mucous membrane of the mammalian uterus\nThe endometrium is the inner epithelial layer, along with its mucous membrane, of the mammalian uterus. It has a basal layer and a functional layer: the basal layer contains stem cells which regenerate the functional layer. The functional layer thickens and then is shed during menstruation in humans and some other mammals, including other apes, Old World monkeys, some species of bat, the elephant shrew and the Cairo spiny mouse. In most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed in the estrous cycle. During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus. The speculated presence of an endometrial microbiota\nhas been argued against.\nStructure.\nThe endometrium consists of a single layer of columnar epithelium plus the stroma on which it rests. The stroma is a layer of connective tissue that varies in thickness according to hormonal influences. In the uterus, simple tubular glands reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply provided by the spiral arteries. In women of reproductive age, two layers of endometrium can be distinguished. These two layers occur only in the endometrium lining the cavity of the uterus, and not in the lining of the fallopian tubes where a potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancy may occur nearby.\nIn the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become ischaemic and die, leading to menstruation.\nIt is possible to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle by reference to either the ovarian cycle or the uterine cycle by observing microscopic differences at each phase\u2014for example in the ovarian cycle:\nGene and protein expression.\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and some 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal endometrium. Just over 100 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the endometrium with only a handful genes being highly endometrium specific. The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in the glandular and stromal cells of the endometrial mucosa. The expression of many of these proteins vary depending on the menstrual cycle, for example the progesterone receptor and thyrotropin-releasing hormone both expressed in the proliferative phase, and PAEP expressed in the secretory phase. Other proteins such as the HOX11 protein that is required for female fertility, is expressed in endometrial stroma cells throughout the menstrual cycle. Certain specific proteins such as the estrogen receptor are also expressed in other types of female tissue types, such as the cervix, fallopian tubes, ovaries and breast.\nMicrobiome speculation.\nThe uterus and endometrium was for a long time thought to be sterile. The cervical plug of mucosa was seen to prevent the entry of any microorganisms ascending from the vagina. In the 1980s this view was challenged when it was shown that uterine infections could arise from weaknesses in the barrier of the cervical plug. Organisms from the vaginal microbiota could enter the uterus during uterine contractions in the menstrual cycle. Further studies sought to identify microbiota specific to the uterus which would be of help in identifying cases of unsuccessful IVF and miscarriages. Their findings were seen to be unreliable due to the possibility of cross-contamination in the sampling procedures used. The well-documented presence of \"Lactobacillus\" species, for example, was easily explained by an increase in the vaginal population being able to seep into the cervical mucous. Another study highlighted the flaws of the earlier studies including cross-contamination. It was also argued that the evidence from studies using germ-free offspring of axenic animals (germ-free) clearly showed the sterility of the uterus. The authors concluded that in light of these findings there was no existence of a microbiome.\nThe normal dominance of Lactobacilli in the vagina is seen as a marker for vaginal health. However, in the uterus this much lower population is seen as invasive in a closed environment that is highly regulated by female sex hormones, and that could have unwanted consequences. In studies of endometriosis \"Lactobacillus\" is not the dominant type and there are higher levels of \"Streptococcus\" and \"Staphylococcus\" species. Half of the cases of bacterial vaginitis showed a polymicrobial biofilm attached to the endometrium.\nFunction.\nThe endometrium is the innermost lining layer of the uterus, and functions to prevent adhesions between the opposed walls of the myometrium, thereby maintaining the patency of the uterine cavity. During the menstrual cycle or estrous cycle, the endometrium grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. This represents an optimal environment for the implantation of a blastocyst upon its arrival in the uterus. The endometrium is central, echogenic (detectable using ultrasound scanners), and has an average thickness of 6.7\u00a0mm.\nDuring pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.\nCycle.\nThe functional layer of the endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration from stem cells in the basal layer. Humans, apes, and some other species display the menstrual cycle, whereas most other mammals are subject to an estrous cycle. In both cases, the endometrium initially proliferates under the influence of estrogen. However, once ovulation occurs, the ovary (specifically the corpus luteum) will produce much larger amounts of progesterone. This changes the proliferative pattern of the endometrium to a secretory lining. Eventually, the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment for one or more blastocysts.\nUpon fertilization, the egg may implant into the uterine wall and provide feedback to the body with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG provides continued feedback throughout pregnancy by maintaining the corpus luteum, which will continue its role of releasing progesterone and estrogen. In case of implantation, the endometrial lining remains as \"decidua\". The decidua becomes part of the placenta; it provides support and protection for the gestation.\nWithout implantation of a fertilized egg, the endometrial lining is either reabsorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). In the latter case, the process of shedding involves the breaking down of the lining, the tearing of small connective blood vessels, and the loss of the tissue and blood that had constituted it through the vagina. The entire process occurs over a period of several days. Menstruation may be accompanied by a series of uterine contractions; these help expel the menstrual endometrium.\nIf there is inadequate stimulation of the lining, due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans, this will result in amenorrhea, or the absence of a menstrual period. After menopause, the lining is often described as being atrophic. In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become hyperplastic. Long-term use of oral contraceptives with highly potent progestins can also induce endometrial atrophy.\nIn humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining lasts an average of 28 days. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Various factors including the seasons, climate, and stress can affect its development. The endometrium itself produces certain hormones at different stages of the cycle and this affects other parts of the reproductive system.\nDiseases related with endometrium.\nChorionic tissue can result in marked endometrial changes, known as an Arias-Stella reaction, that have an appearance similar to cancer. Historically, this change was diagnosed as endometrial cancer and it is important only in so far as it should not be misdiagnosed as cancer.\nThin endometrium may be defined as an endometrial thickness of less than 8\u00a0mm. It usually occurs after menopause. Treatments that can improve endometrial thickness include Vitamin E, L-arginine and sildenafil citrate.\nGene expression profiling using cDNA microarray can be used for the diagnosis of endometrial disorders.\nThe European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS) released Guidelines with detailed information to assess the endometrium.\nEmbryo transfer.\nAn endometrial thickness (EMT) of less than 7\u00a0mm decreases the pregnancy rate in in vitro fertilization by an odds ratio of approximately 0.4 compared to an EMT of over 7\u00a0mm. However, such low thickness rarely occurs, and any routine use of this parameter is regarded as not justified. The optimal endometrial thickness is 10mm. Nevertheless, in human a perfect synchrony is not necessary; if the endometrium is not ready to receive the embryo an ectopic pregnancy may occur. This consist of the implantation of the blast outside the uterus, which can be extremely dangerous.\nObservation of the endometrium by transvaginal ultrasonography is used when administering fertility medication, such as in in vitro fertilization. At the time of embryo transfer, it is favorable to have an endometrium of a thickness of between 7 and 14 mm with a \"triple-line\" configuration, which means that the endometrium contains a hyperechoic (usually displayed as light) line in the middle surrounded by two more hypoechoic (darker) lines. A \"triple-line\" endometrium reflects the separation of the basal layer and the functional layer, and is also observed in the periovulatory period secondary to rising estradiol levels, and disappears after ovulation.\nEndometrial thickness is also associated with live births in IVF. The live birth rate in a normal endometrium is halved when the thickness is &lt;5mm.\nEndometrial protection.\nEstrogens stimulate endometrial proliferation and carcinogenesis. Conversely, progestogens inhibit endometrial proliferation and carcinogenesis caused by estrogens and stimulate differentiation of the endometrium into decidua, which is termed endometrial transformation or decidualization. This is mediated by the progestogenic and functional antiestrogenic effects of progestogens in this tissue. These effects of progestogens and their protection against endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer caused by estrogens is referred to as \"endometrial protection\". As a result of endometrial protection, endometrial cells can undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition and be detected in menstrual fluid.\nEndometrial receptivity.\nEndometrial receptivity is a crucial factor in achieving successful embryo implantation in assisted reproduction treatments. It refers to the ability of the endometrium to accept an embryo during a specific time window, known as the \"implantation window.\" The synchronization between endometrial development and the embryo is essential to ensure a successful pregnancy.\nCurrently, there are three main tests that help evaluate endometrial receptivity and optimize fertility treatments:\nERA (Endometrial Receptivity Analysis): \nThis genetic test analyzes the expression of specific genes in the endometrium to identify whether it is in a receptive, pre-receptive or post-receptive phase, allowing the ideal moment for embryo transfer to be personalized.\nEMMA (Endometrial Microbiome Metagenomic Analysis) and ALICE (Analysis of Infectious Chronic Endometritis): \nPerform a test on the intrauterine microflora, using a small sample of the endometrium, in order to determine the presence of microorganisms that may promote or harm embryo implantation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9510", "revid": "42677165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9510", "title": "Electronic music", "text": "Music genre that uses electronic instruments\nElectronic music broadly is a group of music genres that employ electronic musical instruments, circuitry-based music technology and software, or general-purpose electronics (such as personal computers) in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depend entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer: no acoustic waves need to be previously generated by mechanical means and then converted into electrical signals. On the other hand, electromechanical instruments have mechanical parts such as strings or hammers that generate the sound waves, together with electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers that convert the acoustic waves into electrical signals, process them and convert them back into sound waves. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and electric guitar.\nThe first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s in Egypt and France. Musique concr\u00e8te, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.\nDuring the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop and electronic dance music (EDM). In the early 1980s, mass-produced digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 became popular which saw development of the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1\u00a0million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.\nContemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music. In recent years, electronic music has gained popularity in the Middle East, with artists from Iran and Turkey blending traditional instruments with ambient and techno influences. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.\nOrigins: late 19th century to early 20th century.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, experimentation with emerging electronics led to the first electronic musical instruments. These initial inventions were not sold, but were instead used in demonstrations and public performances. The audiences were presented with reproductions of existing music instead of new compositions for the instruments. While some were considered novelties and produced simple tones, the Telharmonium synthesized the sound of several orchestral instruments with reasonable precision. It achieved viable public interest and made commercial progress into streaming music through telephone networks.\nCritics of musical conventions at the time saw promise in these developments. Ferruccio Busoni encouraged the composition of microtonal music allowed for by electronic instruments. He predicted the use of machines in future music, writing the influential \"Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music\" (1907). Futurists such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo began composing music with acoustic noise to evoke the sound of machinery. They predicted expansions in timbre allowed for by electronics in the influential manifesto \"The Art of Noises\" (1913).\nEarly compositions.\nDevelopments of the vacuum tube led to electronic instruments that were smaller, amplified, and more practical for performance. In particular, the theremin, ondes Martenot and trautonium were commercially produced by the early 1930s.\nFrom the late 1920s, the increased practicality of electronic instruments influenced composers such as Joseph Schillinger and Maria Schuppel to adopt them. They were typically used within orchestras, and most composers wrote parts for the theremin that could otherwise be performed with string instruments.\nAvant-garde composers criticized the predominant use of electronic instruments for conventional purposes. The instruments offered expansions in pitch resources that were exploited by advocates of microtonal music such as Charles Ives, Dimitrios Levidis, Olivier Messiaen and Edgard Var\u00e8se. Further, Percy Grainger used the theremin to abandon fixed tonation entirely, while Russian composers such as Gavriil Popov treated it as a source of noise in otherwise-acoustic noise music.\nRecording experiments.\nDevelopments in early recording technology paralleled that of electronic instruments. The first means of recording and reproducing audio was invented in the late 19th century with the mechanical phonograph. Record players became a common household item, and by the 1920s composers were using them to play short recordings in performances.\nThe introduction of electrical recording in 1925 was followed by increased experimentation with record players. Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch composed several pieces in 1930 by layering recordings of instruments and vocals at adjusted speeds. Influenced by these techniques, John Cage composed \"Imaginary Landscape No. 1\" in 1939 by adjusting the speeds of recorded tones.\nComposers began to experiment with newly developed sound-on-film technology. Recordings could be spliced together to create sound collages, such as those by Tristan Tzara, Kurt Schwitters, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Walter Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov. Further, the technology allowed sound to be graphically created and modified. These techniques were used to compose soundtracks for several films in Germany and Russia, in addition to the popular \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in the United States. Experiments with graphical sound were continued by Norman McLaren from the late 1930s.\nDevelopment: 1940s to 1950s.\nElectroacoustic tape music.\nThe first practical audio tape recorder was unveiled in 1935. Improvements to the technology were made using the AC biasing technique, which significantly improved recording fidelity. As early as 1942, test recordings were being made in stereo. Although these developments were initially confined to Germany, recorders and tapes were brought to the United States following the end of World War II. These were the basis for the first commercially produced tape recorder in 1948.\nIn 1944, before the use of magnetic tape for compositional purposes, Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh, while still a student in Cairo, used a cumbersome wire recorder to record sounds of an ancient \"zaar\" ceremony. Using facilities at the Middle East Radio studios El-Dabh processed the recorded material using reverberation, echo, voltage controls and re-recording. What resulted is believed to be the earliest tape music composition. The resulting work was entitled \"The Expression of Zaar\" and it was presented in 1944 at an art gallery event in Cairo. While his initial experiments in tape-based composition were not widely known outside of Egypt at the time, El-Dabh is also known for his later work in electronic music at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the late 1950s.\nMusique concr\u00e8te.\nFollowing his work with Studio d'Essai at Radiodiffusion Fran\u00e7aise (RDF), during the early 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer is credited with originating the theory and practice of musique concr\u00e8te. In the late 1940s, experiments in sound-based composition using shellac record players were first conducted by Schaeffer. In 1950, the techniques of musique concrete were expanded when magnetic tape machines were used to explore sound manipulation practices such as speed variation (pitch shift) and tape splicing.\nOn 5 October 1948, RDF broadcast Schaeffer's \"Etude aux chemins de fer\". This was the first \"movement\" of \"Cinq \u00e9tudes de bruits\", and marked the beginning of studio realizations and musique concr\u00e8te (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disc cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Pierre Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Var\u00e8se, began work on \"D\u00e9serts\", a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio and were later revised at Columbia University.\nIn 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concr\u00e8te at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris. \"Schaeffer used a PA system, several turntables, and mixers. The performance did not go well, as creating live montages with turntables had never been done before.\" Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on \"Symphonie pour un homme seul\" (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, \"Orpheus\", for concrete sounds and voices.\nBy 1951 the work of Schaeffer, composer-percussionist Pierre Henry, and sound engineer Jacques Poullin had received official recognition and The Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concr\u00e8te, Club d 'Essai de la Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise was established at RTF in Paris, the ancestor of the ORTF.\nElektronische Musik, Germany.\nKarlheinz Stockhausen worked briefly in Schaeffer's studio in 1952, and afterward for many years at the WDR Cologne's Studio for Electronic Music.\n1954 saw the advent of what would now be considered authentic electric plus acoustic compositions\u2014acoustic instrumentation augmented/accompanied by recordings of manipulated or electronically generated sound. Three major works were premiered that year: Var\u00e8se's \"D\u00e9serts\", for chamber ensemble and tape sounds, and two works by Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky: \"Rhapsodic Variations for the Louisville Symphony\" and \"A Poem in Cycles and Bells\", both for orchestra and tape. Because he had been working at Schaeffer's studio, the tape part for Var\u00e8se's work contains much more concrete sounds than electronic. \"A group made up of wind instruments, percussion and piano alternate with the mutated sounds of factory noises and ship sirens and motors, coming from two loudspeakers.\"\nAt the German premiere of \"D\u00e9serts\" in Hamburg, which was conducted by Bruno Maderna, the tape controls were operated by Karlheinz Stockhausen. The title \"D\u00e9serts\" suggested to Var\u00e8se not only \"all physical deserts (of sand, sea, snow, of outer space, of empty streets), but also the deserts in the mind of man; not only those stripped aspects of nature that suggest bareness, aloofness, timelessness, but also that remote inner space no telescope can reach, where man is alone, a world of mystery and essential loneliness.\"\nIn Cologne, what would become the most famous electronic music studio in the world, was officially opened at the radio studios of the NWDR in 1953, though it had been in the planning stages as early as 1950 and early compositions were made and broadcast in 1951. The brainchild of Werner Meyer-Eppler, Robert Beyer, and Herbert Eimert (who became its first director), the studio was soon joined by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig. In his 1949 thesis \"Elektronische Klangerzeugung: Elektronische Musik und Synthetische Sprache\", Meyer-Eppler conceived the idea to synthesize music entirely from electronically produced signals; in this way, \"elektronische Musik\" was sharply differentiated from French \"musique concr\u00e8te\", which used sounds recorded from acoustical sources.\nIn 1953, Stockhausen composed his \"Studie I\", followed in 1954 by \"Elektronische Studie II\"\u2014the first electronic piece to be published as a score. In 1955, more experimental and electronic studios began to appear. Notable were the creation of the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano, a studio at the NHK in Tokyo founded by Toshiro Mayuzumi, and the Philips studio at Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which moved to the University of Utrecht as the Institute of Sonology in 1960.\n\"With Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel in residence, [Cologne] became a year-round hive of charismatic avant-gardism.\" on two occasions combining electronically generated sounds with relatively conventional orchestras\u2014in \"Mixtur\" (1964) and \"Hymnen, dritte Region mit Orchester\" (1967). Stockhausen stated that his listeners had told him his electronic music gave them an experience of \"outer space\", sensations of flying, or being in a \"fantastic dream world\".\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, electronic music was being created as early as 1939, when John Cage published \"Imaginary Landscape, No. 1\", using two variable-speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano, and cymbal, but no electronic means of production. Cage composed five more \"Imaginary Landscapes\" between 1942 and 1952 (one withdrawn), mostly for percussion ensemble, though No. 4 is for twelve radios and No. 5, written in 1952, uses 42 recordings and is to be realized as a magnetic tape. According to Otto Luening, Cage also performed \"Williams Mix\" at Donaueschingen in 1954, using eight loudspeakers, three years after his alleged collaboration. \"Williams Mix\" was a success at the Donaueschingen Festival, where it made a \"strong impression\".\nThe Music for Magnetic Tape Project was formed by members of the New York School (John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, David Tudor, and Morton Feldman), and lasted three years until 1954. Cage wrote of this collaboration: \"In this social darkness, therefore, the work of Earle Brown, Morton Feldman, and Christian Wolff continues to present a brilliant light, for the reason that at the several points of notation, performance, and audition, action is provocative.\"\nCage completed \"Williams Mix\" in 1953 while working with the Music for Magnetic Tape Project. The group had no permanent facility, and had to rely on borrowed time in commercial sound studios, including the studio of Bebe and Louis Barron.\nColumbia-Princeton Center.\nIn the same year Columbia University purchased its first tape recorder\u2014a professional Ampex machine\u2014to record concerts. Vladimir Ussachevsky, who was on the music faculty of Columbia University, was placed in charge of the device, and almost immediately began experimenting with it.\nHerbert Russcol writes: \"Soon he was intrigued with the new sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another.\" Ussachevsky said later: \"I suddenly realized that the tape recorder could be treated as an instrument of sound transformation.\" On Thursday, 8 May 1952, Ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music/effects that he created at his Composers Forum, in the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University. These included \"Transposition, Reverberation, Experiment, Composition\", and \"Underwater Valse\". In an interview, he stated: \"I presented a few examples of my discovery in a public concert in New York together with other compositions I had written for conventional instruments.\"\nOtto Luening, who had attended this concert, remarked: \"The equipment at his disposal consisted of an Ampex tape recorder . . . and a simple box-like device designed by the brilliant young engineer, Peter Mauzey, to create feedback, a form of mechanical reverberation. Other equipment was borrowed or purchased with personal funds.\"\nJust three months later, in August 1952, Ussachevsky traveled to Bennington, Vermont, at Luening's invitation to present his experiments. There, the two collaborated on various pieces. Luening described the event: \"Equipped with earphones and a flute, I began developing my first tape-recorder composition. Both of us were fluent improvisors and the medium fired our imaginations.\" They played some early pieces informally at a party, where \"a number of composers almost solemnly congratulated us saying, 'This is it' ('it' meaning the music of the future).\"\nWord quickly reached New York City. Oliver Daniel telephoned and invited the pair to \"produce a group of short compositions for the October concert sponsored by the American Composers Alliance and Broadcast Music, Inc., under the direction of Leopold Stokowski at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After some hesitation, we agreed. . . . Henry Cowell placed his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, at our disposal. With the borrowed equipment in the back of Ussachevsky's car, we left Bennington for Woodstock and stayed two weeks. . . . In late September 1952, the travelling laboratory reached Ussachevsky's living room in New York, where we eventually completed the compositions.\"\nTwo months later, on 28 October, Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening presented the first Tape Music concert in the United States. The concert included Luening's \"Fantasy in Space\" (1952)\u2014\"an impressionistic virtuoso piece\" using manipulated recordings of flute\u2014and \"Low Speed\" (1952), an \"exotic composition that took the flute far below its natural range.\" Both pieces were created at the home of Henry Cowell in Woodstock, New York. After several concerts caused a sensation in New York City, Ussachevsky and Luening were invited onto a live broadcast of NBC's Today Show to do an interview demonstration\u2014the first televised electroacoustic performance. Luening described the event: \"I improvised some [flute] sequences for the tape recorder. Ussachevsky then and there put them through electronic transformations.\"\nThe score for \"Forbidden Planet\", by Louis and Bebe Barron, was entirely composed using custom-built electronic circuits and tape recorders in 1956 (but no synthesizers in the modern sense of the word).\nUSSR.\nIn 1929, Nikolai Obukhov invented the \"sounding cross\" (la croix sonore), comparable to the principle of the theremin. In the 1930s, Nikolai Ananyev invented \"sonar\", and engineer Alexander Gurov \u2014 neoviolena, I. Ilsarov \u2014 ilston., A. Rimsky-Korsakov and A. Ivanov \u2014 emiriton. Composer and inventor Arseny Avraamov was engaged in scientific work on sound synthesis and conducted a number of experiments that would later form the basis of Soviet electro-musical instruments.\nIn 1956 Vyacheslav Mescherin created the Ensemble of electro-musical instruments, which used theremins, electric harps, electric organs, the first synthesizer in the USSR \"Ekvodin\", and also created the first Soviet reverb machine. The style in which Meshcherin's ensemble played is known as \"Space age pop\". In 1957, engineer Igor Simonov assembled a working model of a noise recorder (electroeoliphone), with the help of which it was possible to extract various timbres and consonances of a noise nature. In 1958, Evgeny Murzin designed ANS synthesizer, one of the world's first polyphonic musical synthesizers.\nFounded by Murzin in 1966, the Moscow Experimental Electronic Music Studio became the base for a new generation of experimenters \u2013 Eduard Artemyev, Alexander Nemtin, S\u00e1ndor Kall\u00f3s, Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke, and Vladimir Martynov. By the end of the 1960s, musical groups playing light electronic music appeared in the USSR. At the state level, this music began to be used to attract foreign tourists to the country and for broadcasting to foreign countries. In the mid-1970s, composer Alexander Zatsepin designed an \"orchestrolla\" \u2013 a modification of the mellotron.\nThe Baltic Soviet Republics also had their own pioneers: in Estonian SSR \u2014 Sven Grunberg, in Lithuanian SSR \u2014 Gedrus Kupriavicius, in Latvian SSR \u2014 Opus and Zodiac.\nAustralia.\nThe world's first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist, only the accurate reconstruction. However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, but the music played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Baby Machine from the University of Manchester in the autumn of 1951. The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.\nJapan.\nAmong the earliest group of electric musical instruments in Japan was the Yamaha Magna Organ, an electroacoustic instrument built in 1935. After World War II, Japanese composers such as Minao Shibata began to learn of the development of electronic musical instruments in other countries. By the late 1940s, Japanese composers began experimenting with electronic music, and institutional sponsorship enabled them to experiment with advanced equipment. Their infusion of Asian music into the emerging genre would eventually support Japan's popularity in the development of music technology several decades later.\nFollowing the foundation of electronics company Sony in 1946, composers Toru Takemitsu and Minao Shibata independently explored possible uses for electronic technology to produce music. Takemitsu had ideas similar to musique concr\u00e8te, which he was unaware of, while Shibata foresaw the development of synthesizers and predicted a drastic change in music. Sony began producing popular magnetic tape recorders for government and public use.\nThe avant-garde collective Jikken K\u014db\u014d (Experimental Workshop), founded in 1950, was offered access to emerging audio technology by Sony. The company hired Toru Takemitsu to demonstrate their tape recorders with compositions and performances of electronic tape music. The first electronic tape pieces by the group were \"Toraware no Onna\" (\"Imprisoned Woman\") and \"Piece B\", composed in 1951 by Kuniharu Akiyama. Many of the electroacoustic tape pieces they produced were used as incidental music for radio, film, and theatre. They also held concerts employing a slide show synchronized with a recorded soundtrack. Composers outside of the Jikken K\u014db\u014d, such as Yasushi Akutagawa, Saburo Tominaga, and Shir\u014d Fukai, were also experimenting with radiophonic tape music between 1952 and 1953.\nMusique concr\u00e8te was introduced to Japan by Toshiro Mayuzumi, who was influenced by a Pierre Schaeffer concert. From 1952, he composed tape music pieces for a comedy film, a radio broadcast, and a radio drama. However, Schaeffer's concept of \"sound object\" was not influential among Japanese composers, who were mainly interested in overcoming the restrictions of human performance. This led to several Japanese electroacoustic musicians making use of serialism and twelve-tone techniques, evident in Yoshir\u014d Irino's 1951 dodecaphonic piece \"Concerto da\nCamera\", in the organization of electronic sounds in Mayuzumi's \"X, Y, Z for Musique Concr\u00e8te\", and later in Shibata's electronic music by 1956.\nModelling the NWDR studio in Cologne, an NHK electronic music studio was established by Mayuzumi in Tokyo in 1954, which became one of the world's leading electronic music facilities. The studio was equipped with technologies such as tone-generating and audio processing equipment, recording and radiophonic equipment, ondes Martenots, Monochords and Melochords, sine-wave oscillators, tape recorders, ring modulators, band-pass filters, and four- and eight-channel mixers. Musicians associated with the studio included Toshiro Mayuzumi, Minao Shibata, Joji Yuasa, Toshi Ichiyanagi, and Toru Takemitsu. The studio's first electronic compositions were completed in 1955, including Mayuzumi's five-minute pieces \"Studie I: Music for Sine Wave by Proportion of Prime Number\", \"Music for Modulated Wave by Proportion of Prime Number\" and \"Invention for Square Wave and Sawtooth Wave\" produced using the studio's various tone-generating capabilities, and Shibata's 20-minute stereo piece \"Musique Concr\u00e8te for Stereophonic Broadcast\".\nMid-to-late 1950s.\nThe impact of computers continued in 1956. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed \"Illiac Suite\" for string quartet, the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using algorithmic composition. \"... Hiller postulated that a computer could be taught the rules of a particular style and then called on to compose accordingly.\" Later developments included the work of Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories, who developed the influential MUSIC I program in 1957, one of the first computer programs to play electronic music. Vocoder technology was also a major development in this early era. In 1956, Stockhausen composed \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\", the first major work of the Cologne studio, based on a text from the \"Book of Daniel\". An important technological development of that year was the invention of the Clavivox synthesizer by Raymond Scott with subassembly by Robert Moog.\nIn 1957, Kid Baltan (Dick Raaymakers) and Tom Dissevelt released their debut album, \"Song Of The Second Moon\", recorded at the Philips studio in the Netherlands. The public remained interested in the new sounds being created around the world, as can be deduced by the inclusion of Var\u00e8se's \"Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique\", which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 Brussels World Fair. That same year, Mauricio Kagel, an Argentine composer, composed \"Transici\u00f3n II\". The work was realized at the WDR studio in Cologne. Two musicians performed on the piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings, frame, and case. Two other performers used tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.\nIn 1958, Columbia-Princeton developed the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, the first programmable synthesizer. Prominent composers such as Vladimir Ussachevsky, Otto Luening, Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen, Halim El-Dabh, B\u00fclent Arel and Mario Davidovsky used the RCA Synthesizer extensively in various compositions. One of the most influential composers associated with the early years of the studio was Egypt's Halim El-Dabh who, after having developed the earliest known electronic tape music in 1944, became more famous for \"Leiyla and the Poet\", a 1959 series of electronic compositions that stood out for its immersion and fusion of electronic and folk music, in contrast to the more mathematical approach used by serial composers of the time such as Babbitt. El-Dabh's \"Leiyla and the Poet\", released as part of the album \"Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center\" in 1961, would be cited as a strong influence by a number of musicians, ranging from Neil Rolnick, Charles Amirkhanian and Alice Shields to rock musicians Frank Zappa and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band.\nFollowing the emergence of differences within the GRMC (Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concr\u00e8te) Pierre Henry, Philippe Arthuys, and several of their colleagues, resigned in April 1958. Schaeffer created a new collective, called Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) and set about recruiting new members including Luc Ferrari, Beatriz Ferreyra, Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che, Iannis Xenakis, Bernard Parmegiani, and Mireille Chamass-Kyrou. Later arrivals included Ivo Malec, Philippe Carson, Romuald Vandelle, Edgardo Canton and Fran\u00e7ois Bayle.\nExpansion: 1960s.\nThese were fertile years for electronic music\u2014not just for academia, but for independent artists as synthesizer technology became more accessible. By this time, a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing. 1960 witnessed the composition of Otto Luening's \"Gargoyles\" for violin and tape as well as the premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Kontakte\" for electronic sounds, piano, and percussion. This piece existed in two versions\u2014one for 4-channel tape, and the other for tape with human performers. \"In \"Kontakte\", Stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax. This new approach, which he termed 'moment form', resembles the 'cinematic splice' techniques in early twentieth-century film.\"\nThe theremin had been in use since the 1920s but it attained a degree of popular recognition through its use in science-fiction film soundtrack music in the 1950s (e.g., Bernard Herrmann's classic score for \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\").\nIn the UK in this period, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (established in 1958) came to prominence, thanks in large measure to their work on the BBC science-fiction series \"Doctor Who\". One of the most influential British electronic artists in this period was Workshop staffer Delia Derbyshire, who is now famous for her 1963 electronic realisation of the iconic \"Doctor Who\" theme, composed by Ron Grainer. Other composers of electronic music active in the UK included Ernest Berk (who established his first studio in 1955), Tristram Cary, Hugh Davies, Brian Dennis, George Newson, Daphne Oram and Peter Zinovieff.\nDuring the time of the UNESCO fellowship for studies in electronic music (1958) Israeli composer Josef Tal went on a study tour in the US and Canada. He summarized his conclusions in two articles that he submitted to UNESCO. In 1961, he established the \"Centre for Electronic Music in Israel\" at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1962, Canadian composer Hugh Le Caine arrived in Jerusalem to install his \"Creative Tape Recorder\" in the centre. In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr. Shlomo Markel, in cooperation with the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology and the Volkswagen Foundation, a research project ('Talmark') aimed at the development of a novel musical notation system for electronic music.\nMilton Babbitt composed his first electronic work using the synthesizer\u2014his \"Composition for Synthesizer\" (1961)\u2014which he created using the RCA synthesizer at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For Babbitt, the RCA synthesizer was a dream come true for three reasons. First, the ability to pinpoint and control every musical element precisely. Second, the time needed to realize his elaborate serial structures were brought within practical reach. Third, the question was no longer \"What are the limits of the human performer?\" but rather \"What are the limits of human hearing?\"\nCollaborations also occurred across oceans and continents. In 1961, American composer Vladimir Ussachevsky invited Edgar Var\u00e8se from France to the Columbia-Princeton Studio (CPEMC). Upon arrival, Var\u00e8se embarked upon a revision of his work \"D\u00e9serts\". He was assisted by Mario Davidovsky and B\u00fclent Arel.\nThe intense activity occurring at CPEMC and elsewhere inspired the establishment of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1963 by Morton Subotnick, with additional members Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender, Anthony Martin, and Terry Riley.\nLater, the Center moved to Mills College, directed by Pauline Oliveros, and has since been renamed Center for Contemporary Music.\nPietro Grossi was an Italian pioneer of computer composition and tape music, who first experimented with electronic techniques in the early sixties. Grossi was a cellist and composer, born in Venice in 1917. He founded the S 2F M (Studio de Fonologia Musicale di Firenze) in 1963 to experiment with electronic sound and composition.\nSimultaneously in San Francisco, composer Stan Shaff and equipment designer Doug McEachern, presented the first \"Audium\" concert at San Francisco State College (1962), followed by work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA, 1963), conceived of as in time, controlled movement of sound in space. Twelve speakers surrounded the audience, and four speakers were mounted on a rotating, mobile-like construction above. In an SFMOMA performance the following year (1964), the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" music critic Alfred Frankenstein commented, \"the possibilities of the space-sound continuum have seldom been so extensively explored\". In 1967, the first Audium, a \"sound-space continuum\" opened, holding weekly performances through 1970. In 1975, enabled by seed money from the National Endowment for the Arts, a new Audium opened, designed floor to ceiling for spatial sound composition and performance. \"In contrast, there are composers who manipulated sound space by locating multiple speakers at various locations in a performance space and then switching or panning the sound between the sources. In this approach, the composition of spatial manipulation is dependent on the location of the speakers and usually exploits the acoustical properties of the enclosure. Examples include Varese's \"Poeme Electronique\" (tape music performed in the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 World Fair, Brussels) and Stan Schaff's \"Audium\" installation, currently active in San Francisco.\" Through weekly programs (over 4,500 in 40 years), Shaff \"sculpts\" sound, performing now-digitized spatial works live through 176 speakers.\nJean-Jacques Perrey experimented with Pierre Schaeffer's techniques on tape loops and was among the first to use the recently released Moog synthesizer developed by Robert Moog. With this instrument he composed some works with Gershon Kingsley and solo. A well-known example of the use of Moog's full-sized Moog modular synthesizer is the 1968 \"Switched-On Bach\" album by Wendy Carlos, which triggered a craze for synthesizer music. In 1969 David Tudor brought a Moog modular synthesizer and Ampex tape machines to the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad with the support of the Sarabhai family, forming the foundation of India's first electronic music studio. Here a group of composers Jinraj Joshipura, Gita Sarabhai, SC Sharma, IS Mathur and Atul Desai developed experimental sound compositions between 1969 and 1973.\nComputer music.\nMusical melodies were first generated by the computer CSIRAC in Australia in 1950. There were newspaper reports from America and England (early and recently) that computers may have played music earlier, but thorough research has debunked these stories as there is no evidence to support the newspaper reports (some of which were obviously speculative). Research has shown that people \"speculated\" about computers playing music, possibly because computers would make noises, but there is no evidence that they actually did it.\nThe world's first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard in the 1950s. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the \"Colonel Bogey March\" of which no known recordings exist.\nHowever, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer-music practice.\nThe first music to be performed in England was a performance of the British National Anthem that was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Ferranti Mark I, late in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: the National Anthem, \"Ba, Ba Black Sheep\", and \"In the Mood\" and this is recognised as the earliest recording of a computer to play music. This recording can be heard at http://. Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch declicked and restored this recording in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.\nThe late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s also saw the development of large mainframe computer synthesis. Starting in 1957, Max Mathews of Bell Labs developed the MUSIC programs, culminating in MUSIC V, a direct digital synthesis language. Laurie Spiegel developed the algorithmic musical composition software \"Music Mouse\" (1986) for Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari computers.\nStochastic music.\nAn important new development was the advent of computers to compose music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. Iannis Xenakis began what is called \"musique stochastique\", or \"stochastic music\", which is a composing method that uses mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used computers to compose pieces like \"ST/4\" for string quartet and \"ST/48\" for orchestra (both 1962), \"Morsima-Amorsima\", \"ST/10\", and \"Atr\u00e9es\". He developed the computer system UPIC for translating graphical images into musical results and composed \"Myc\u00e8nes Alpha\" (1978) with it.\nLive electronics.\nIn Europe in 1964, Karlheinz Stockhausen composed \"Mikrophonie I\" for tam-tam, hand-held microphones, filters, and potentiometers, and \"Mixtur\" for orchestra, four sine-wave generators, and four ring modulators. In 1965 he composed \"Mikrophonie II\" for choir, Hammond organ, and ring modulators.\nIn 1966\u20131967, Reed Ghazala discovered and began to teach \"circuit bending\"\u2014the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by John Cage's aleatoric music [\"sic\"] concept.\nCosey Fanni Tutti's performance art and musical career explored the concept of 'acceptable' music and she went on to explore the use of sound as a means of desire or discomfort.\nWendy Carlos performed selections from her album \"Switched-On Bach\" on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra; another live performance was with Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for \"Bach at the Beacon\" in 1997. In June 2018, Suzanne Ciani released \"LIVE Quadraphonic\", a live album documenting her first solo performance on a Buchla synthesizer in 40 years. It was one of the first quadraphonic vinyl releases in over 30 years.\nJorge Antunes (composer) In Brazil in 1975, Jorge Antunes composed Source for acoustical instruments processed in real time by the analogic sintethizer Sinthi A.\nJapanese instruments.\nIn the 1950s, Japanese electronic musical instruments began influencing the international music industry. Ikutaro Kakehashi, who founded Ace Tone in 1960, developed his own version of electronic percussion that had been already popular on the overseas electronic organ. At the 1964 NAMM Show, he revealed it as the R-1 Rhythm Ace, a hand-operated percussion device that played electronic drum sounds manually as the user pushed buttons, in a similar fashion to modern electronic drum pads.\nIn 1963, Korg released the Donca-Matic DA-20, an electro-mechanical drum machine. In 1965, Nippon Columbia patented a fully electronic drum machine. Korg released the Donca-Matic DC-11 electronic drum machine in 1966, which they followed with the Korg Mini Pops, which was developed as an option for the Yamaha Electone electric organ. Korg's Stageman and Mini Pops series were notable for \"natural metallic percussion\" sounds and incorporating controls for drum \"breaks and fill-ins.\"\nIn 1967, Ace Tone founder Ikutaro Kakehashi patented a preset rhythm-pattern generator using diode matrix circuit similar to the Seeburg's prior https:// filed in 1964 (See Drum machine#History), which he released as the FR-1 Rhythm Ace drum machine the same year. It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound (cymbal, claves, cowbell and bass drum). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred. Ace Tone's Rhythm Ace drum machines found their way into popular music from the late 1960s, followed by Korg drum machines in the 1970s. Kakehashi later left Ace Tone and founded Roland Corporation in 1972, with and becoming highly influential for the next several decades. The company would go on to have a big impact on popular music, and do more to shape popular electronic music than any other company.\nTurntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspin or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables. It was succeeded by the Technics SL-1100 and SL-1200 in the early 1970s, and they were widely adopted by hip hop musicians, with the SL-1200 remaining the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for several decades.\nJamaican dub music.\nIn Jamaica, a form of popular electronic music emerged in the 1960s, dub music, rooted in sound system culture. Dub music was pioneered by studio engineers, such as Sylvan Morris, King Tubby, Errol Thompson, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, and Scientist, producing reggae-influenced experimental music with electronic sound technology, in recording studios and at sound system parties. Their experiments included forms of tape-based composition comparable to aspects of \"musique concr\u00e8te\", an emphasis on repetitive rhythmic structures (often stripped of their harmonic elements) comparable to minimalism, the electronic manipulation of spatiality, the sonic electronic manipulation of pre-recorded musical materials from mass media, deejays toasting over pre-recorded music comparable to live electronic music, remixing music, turntablism, and the mixing and scratching of vinyl.\nDespite the limited electronic equipment available to dub pioneers such as King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, their experiments in remix culture were musically cutting-edge. King Tubby, for example, was a sound system proprietor and electronics technician, whose small front-room studio in the Waterhouse ghetto of western Kingston was a key site of dub music creation.\nLate 1960s to early 1980s.\nRise of popular electronic music.\nIn the late 1960s, pop and rock musicians, including the Beach Boys and the Beatles, began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound. The first bands to utilize the Moog synthesizer would be the Doors on their 1967 song \"Strange Days\" and the Monkees on their album \"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.\", also in 1967. In his book \"Electronic and Experimental Music\", Thom Holmes recognises the Beatles' 1966 psychedelic song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as the song that \"ushered in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music\" due to the band's incorporation of tape loops and reversed and speed-manipulated tape sounds.\nAlso in the late 1960s, the music duos Silver Apples, Beaver and Krause, and psychedelic rock bands like The United States of America, Fifty Foot Hose, White Noise and Gong are regarded as pioneers in the electronic rock and electronica genres for their work in melding psychedelic rock with oscillators and synthesizers. The 1969 instrumental \"Popcorn\" written by Gershon Kingsley for \"Music To Moog By\" became a worldwide success due to the 1972 version made by Hot Butter.\nThe Moog synthesizer was brought to the mainstream in 1968 by \"Switched-On Bach\", a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by American composer Wendy Carlos. The album achieved critical and commercial success, winning the 1970 Grammy Awards for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance \u2013 Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording.\nIn 1969, David Borden formed the world's first synthesizer ensemble called the Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company in Ithaca, New York.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock with bands including Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and Genesis making them part of their sound. Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Can, Neu!, and Faust to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy \"krautrock\", along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent electronic rock.\nAmbient dub was pioneered by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists, using DJ-inspired ambient electronics, complete with drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It featured layering techniques and incorporated elements of world music, deep basslines and harmonic sounds. Techniques such as a long echo delay were also used. Other notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, The Orb, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground.\nDub music influenced electronic musical techniques later adopted by hip-hop music when Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc in the early 1970s introduced Jamaica's sound system culture and dub music techniques to America. One such technique that became popular in hip-hop culture was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation, extending the b-dancers' favorite section. The turntable eventually went on to become the most visible electronic musical instrument, and occasionally the most virtuosic, in the 1980s and 1990s.\nElectronic rock was also produced by several Japanese musicians, including Isao Tomita's \"Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock\" (1972), which featured Moog synthesizer renditions of contemporary pop and rock songs, and Osamu Kitajima's progressive rock album \"Benzaiten\" (1974). The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art music musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Tomita and Klaus Schulze who were significant influences on the development of new-age music. The \"hi-tech\" appeal of these works created for some years the trend of listing the electronic musical equipment employed in the album sleeves, as a distinctive feature. Electronic music began to enter regularly in radio programming and top-sellers charts, as the French band Space with their debut studio album \"Magic Fly\" or Jarre with \"Oxyg\u00e8ne\". Between 1977 and 1981, Kraftwerk released albums such as \"Trans-Europe Express\", \"The Man-Machine\" and \"Computer World\", which influenced subgenres of electronic music.\nIn this era, the sound of rock musicians like Mike Oldfield and The Alan Parsons Project (who is credited the first rock song to feature a digital vocoder in 1975, \"The Raven\") used to be arranged and blended with electronic effects and/or music as well, which became much more prominent in the mid-1980s. Jeff Wayne achieved a long-lasting success with his 1978 electronic rock musical version of \"The War of the Worlds\".\nFilm scores also benefit from the electronic sound. During the 1970s and 1980s, Wendy Carlos composed the score for \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"The Shining\" and \"Tron\". In 1977, Gene Page recorded a disco version of the hit theme by John Williams from Steven Spielberg film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Page's version peaked on the R&amp;B chart at #30. The score of 1978 film \"Midnight Express\" composed by Italian synth-pioneer Giorgio Moroder won the Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1979, as did it again in 1981 the score by Vangelis for \"Chariots of Fire\". After the arrival of punk rock, a form of basic electronic rock emerged, increasingly using new digital technology to replace other instruments. The American duo Suicide, who arose from the punk scene in New York, utilized drum machines and synthesizers in a hybrid between electronics and punk on their eponymous 1977 album.\nSynth-pop pioneering bands which enjoyed success for years included Ultravox with their 1977 track \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" on \"Ha!-Ha!-Ha!\", Yellow Magic Orchestra with their self-titled album (1978), The Buggles with their prominent 1979 debut single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", Gary Numan with his solo debut album \"The Pleasure Principle\" and single \"Cars\" in 1979, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark with their 1979 single \"Electricity\" featured on their eponymous debut album, Depeche Mode with their first single \"Dreaming of Me\" in 1980 and debut album \"Speak &amp; Spell\" in 1981, A Flock of Seagulls with their 1981 single \"Talking\", New Order with \"Ceremony\" in 1981, and The Human League with their 1981 hit \"Don't You Want Me\" from their third album \"Dare\".\nThe definition of MIDI and the development of digital audio made the development of purely electronic sounds much easier, with audio engineers, producers and composers exploring frequently the possibilities of virtually every new model of electronic sound equipment launched by manufacturers. Synth-pop sometimes used synthesizers to replace all other instruments, but it was more common that bands had one or more keyboardists in their line-ups along with guitarists, bassists, and/or drummers. These developments led to the growth of synth-pop, which after it was adopted by the New Romantic movement, allowed synthesizers to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 1980s until the style began to fall from popularity in the mid-to-end of the decade. Along with the aforementioned successful pioneers, key acts included Yazoo, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Talk Talk, Japan, and Eurythmics.\nSynth-pop was taken up across the world, with international hits for acts including Men Without Hats, Trans-X and Lime from Canada, Telex from Belgium, Peter Schilling, Sandra, Modern Talking, Propaganda and Alphaville from Germany, Yello from Switzerland and Azul y Negro from Spain. Also, the synth sound is a key feature of Italo-disco.\nSome synth-pop bands created futuristic visual styles of themselves to reinforce the idea of electronic sounds were linked primarily with technology, as Americans Devo and Spaniards Aviador Dro.\nKeyboard synthesizers became so common that even heavy metal rock bands, a genre often regarded as the \"opposite\" in aesthetics, sound and lifestyle from that of electronic pop artists by fans of both sides, achieved worldwide success with themes as 1983 \"Jump\" by Van Halen and 1986 \"The Final Countdown\" by Europe, which feature synths prominently.\nProliferation of electronic music research institutions.\nElektronmusikstudion (EMS), formerly known as Electroacoustic Music in Sweden, is the Swedish national centre for electronic music and sound art. The research organisation started in 1964 and is based in Stockholm.\nSTEIM (1969\u20132021) was a center for research and development of new musical instruments in the electronic performing arts, located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was founded by Misha Mengelberg, Louis Andriessen, Peter Schat, Dick Raaymakers, Jan van Vlijmen, Reinbert de Leeuw, and Konrad Boehmer. This group of Dutch composers had fought for the reformation of Amsterdam's feudal music structures; they insisted on Bruno Maderna's appointment as musical director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and enforced the first public fundings for experimental and improvised electronic music in the Netherlands. From 1981\u20132008, Michel Waisvisz was artistic director, and his live-electronic instruments like the Cracklebox or The Hands inspired international artists to work at STEIM which entertained a residency program since 1992.\nIRCAM in Paris became a major center for computer music research and realization and development of the Sogitec 4X computer system, featuring then revolutionary real-time digital signal processing. Pierre Boulez's \"R\u00e9pons\" (1981) for 24 musicians and 6 soloists used the 4X to transform and route soloists to a loudspeaker system.\nBarry Vercoe describes one of his experiences with early computer sounds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At IRCAM in Paris in 1982, flutist Larry Beauregard had connected his flute to DiGiugno's 4X audio processor, enabling real-time pitch-following. On a Guggenheim at the time, I extended this concept to real-time score-following with automatic synchronized accompaniment, and over the next two years Larry and I gave numerous demonstrations of the computer as a chamber musician, playing Handel flute sonatas, Boulez's \"Sonatine\" for flute and piano and by 1984 my own \"Synapse II\" for flute and computer\u2014the first piece ever composed expressly for such a setup. A major challenge was finding the right software constructs to support highly sensitive and responsive accompaniment. All of this was pre-MIDI, but the results were impressive even though heavy doses of tempo rubato would continually surprise my Synthetic Performer. In 1985 we solved the tempo rubato problem by incorporating \"learning from rehearsals\" (each time you played this way the machine would get better). We were also now tracking violin, since our brilliant, young flautist had contracted a fatal cancer. Moreover, this version used a new standard called MIDI, and here I was ably assisted by former student Miller Puckette, whose initial concepts for this task he later expanded into a program called MAX.\nKeyboard synthesizers.\nReleased in 1970 by Moog Music, the Mini-Moog was among the first widely available, portable, and relatively affordable synthesizers. It became once the most widely used synthesizer at that time in both popular and electronic art music.\nPatrick Gleeson, playing live with Herbie Hancock at the beginning of the 1970s, pioneered the use of synthesizers in a touring context, where they were subject to stresses the early machines were not designed for.\nIn 1974, the WDR studio in Cologne acquired an EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer, which many composers used to produce notable electronic works\u2014including Rolf Gehlhaar's \"F\u00fcnf deutsche T\u00e4nze\" (1975), Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Sirius\" (1975\u20131976), and John McGuire's \"Pulse Music III\" (1978).\nThanks to miniaturization of electronics in the 1970s, by the start of the 1980s keyboard synthesizers, became lighter and affordable, integrating into a single slim unit all the necessary audio synthesis electronics and the piano-style keyboard itself, in sharp contrast with the bulky machinery and \"cable spaghetti\" employed along with the 1960s and 1970s. First, with analog synthesizers, the trend followed with digital synthesizers and samplers as well (see below).\nDigital synthesizers.\nIn 1975, the Japanese company Yamaha licensed the algorithms for frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis) from John Chowning, who had experimented with it at Stanford University since 1971. Yamaha's engineers began adapting Chowning's algorithm for use in a digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the \"key scaling\" method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation.\nIn 1980, Yamaha eventually released the first FM digital synthesizer, the Yamaha GS-1, but at an expensive price. In 1983, Yamaha introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the DX7, which also used FM synthesis and would become one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time. The DX7 was known for its recognizable bright tonalities that was partly due to an overachieving sampling rate of 57\u00a0kHz.\nThe Korg Poly-800 is a synthesizer released by Korg in 1983. Its initial list price of $795 made it the first fully programmable synthesizer that sold for less than $1000. It had 8-voice polyphony with one Digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) per voice.\nThe Casio CZ-101 was the first and best-selling phase distortion synthesizer in the Casio CZ line. Released in November 1984, it was one of the first (if not the first) fully programmable polyphonic synthesizers that was available for under $500.\nThe Roland D-50 is a digital synthesizer produced by Roland and released in April 1987. Its features include subtractive synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987\u20131990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds.\nSamplers.\nA sampler is an electronic or digital musical instrument which uses sound recordings (or \"samples\") of real instrument sounds (e.g., a piano, violin or trumpet), excerpts from recorded songs (e.g., a five-second bass guitar riff from a funk song) or found sounds (e.g., sirens and ocean waves). The samples are loaded or recorded by the user or by a manufacturer. These sounds are then played back using the sampler program itself, a MIDI keyboard, sequencer or another triggering device (e.g., electronic drums) to perform or compose music. Because these samples are usually stored in digital memory, the information can be quickly accessed. A single sample may often be pitch-shifted to different pitches to produce musical scales and chords.\nBefore computer memory-based samplers, musicians used tape replay keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron was the most notable model, used by many groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical.\nThe earliest digital sampling was done on the EMS Musys system, developed by Peter Grogono (software), David Cockerell (hardware and interfacing), and Peter Zinovieff (system design and operation) at their London (Putney) Studio c. 1969.\nThe first commercially available sampling synthesizer was the Computer Music Melodian by Harry Mendell (1976).\nFirst released in 1977\u20131978, the Synclavier I using FM synthesis, re-licensed from Yamaha, and sold mostly to universities, proved to be highly influential among both electronic music composers and music producers, including Mike Thorne, an early adopter from the commercial world, due to its versatility, its cutting-edge technology, and distinctive sounds.\nThe first polyphonic digital sampling synthesizer was the Australian-produced Fairlight CMI, first available in 1979. These early sampling synthesizers used wavetable sample-based synthesis.\nBirth of MIDI.\nIn 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, Roland\u2014and later, other participants that included Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. A paper was authored by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.\nMIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.\nMIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via sampling and sampled-ROM-based instruments.\nMiller Puckette developed graphic signal-processing software for 4X called Max (after Max Mathews) and later ported it to Macintosh (with Dave Zicarelli extending it for Opcode) for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.\nSequencers and drum machines.\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of bass synthesizers, the most influential being the Roland TB-303, a bass synthesizer and sequencer released in late 1981 that later became a fixture in electronic dance music, particularly acid house. One of the first to use it was Charanjit Singh in 1982, though it would not be popularized until Phuture's \"Acid Tracks\" in 1987. Music sequencers began being used around the mid 20th century, and Tomita's albums in mid-1970s being later examples. In 1978, Yellow Magic Orchestra were using computer-based technology in conjunction with a synthesiser to produce popular music, making their early use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer.\nDrum machines, also known as rhythm machines, also began being used around the late-1950s, with a later example being Osamu Kitajima's progressive rock album \"Benzaiten\" (1974), which used a rhythm machine along with electronic drums and a synthesizer. In 1977, Ultravox's \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" was one of the first singles to use the metronome-like percussion of a Roland TR-77 drum machine. In 1980, Roland Corporation released the TR-808, one of the first and most popular programmable drum machines. The first band to use it was Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1980, and it would later gain widespread popularity with the release of Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\" and Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" in 1982. The TR-808 was a fundamental tool in the later Detroit techno scene of the late 1980s, and was the drum machine of choice for Derrick May and Juan Atkins.\nChiptunes.\nThe characteristic lo-fi sound of chip music was initially the result of early computer's sound chips and sound cards' technical limitations; however, the sound has since become sought after in its own right.\nCommon cheap popular sound chips of the first home computers of the 1980s include the SID of the Commodore 64 and General Instrument AY series and clones (like the Yamaha YM2149) used in the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX compatibles and Atari ST models, among others.\nLate 1980s to 1990s.\nRise of dance music.\nSynth-pop continued into the late 1980s, with a format that moved closer to dance music, including the work of acts such as British duos Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and The Communards, achieving success along much of the 1990s.\nThe trend has continued to the present day with modern nightclubs worldwide regularly playing electronic dance music (EDM). Today, electronic dance music has radio stations, websites, and publications like \"Mixmag\" dedicated solely to the genre. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, electro, and trance, as well as their respective subgenres. Moreover, the genre has found commercial and cultural significance in the United States and North America, thanks to the wildly popular big room house/EDM sound that has been incorporated into the U.S. pop music and the rise of large-scale commercial raves such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival.\nElectronica.\nOn the other hand, a broad group of electronic-based music styles intended for listening rather than strictly for dancing became known under the \"electronica\" umbrella which was also a music scene in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. According to a 1997 \"Billboard\" article, \"the union of the club community and independent labels\" provided the experimental and trend-setting environment in which electronica acts developed and eventually reached the mainstream, citing American labels such as Astralwerks (the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, the Future Sound of London, Fluke), Moonshine (DJ Keoki), and City of Angels (the Crystal Method) for popularizing the latest version of electronic music.\nIndie electronic.\nThe category \"indie electronic\" (or \"indietronica\") has been used to refer to a wave of groups with roots in independent rock who embraced electronic elements (such as synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and computer programs) and influences such as early electronic composition, krautrock, synth-pop, and dance music. Recordings are commonly made on laptops using digital audio workstations.\nThe first wave of indie electronic artists began in the 1990s with acts such as Stereolab (who used vintage gear) and Disco Inferno (who embraced modern sampling technology), and the genre expanded in the 2000s as home recording and software synthesizers came into common use. Other acts included Broadcast, Lali Puna, M\u00fam, the Postal Service, Skeletons, and School of Seven Bells. Independent labels associated with the style include Warp, Morr Music, Sub Pop, and Ghostly International.\n2000s and 2010s.\nAs computer technology has become more accessible and music software has advanced, interacting with music production technology is now possible using means that bear no relationship to traditional musical performance practices: for instance, laptop performance (\"laptronica\"), live coding and Algorave. In general, the term Live PA refers to any live performance of electronic music, whether with laptops, synthesizers, or other devices.\nBeginning around the year 2000, some software-based virtual studio environments emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. Such tools provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, it is now possible to create high-quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances have democratized music creation, leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet. Software-based instruments and effect units (so-called \"plugins\") can be incorporated in a computer-based studio using the VST platform. Some of these instruments are more or less exact replicas of existing hardware (such as the Roland D-50, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha DX7, or Korg M1).\nCircuit bending.\nCircuit bending is the modification of battery-powered toys and synthesizers to create new unintended sound effects. It was pioneered by Reed Ghazala in the 1960s and Reed coined the name \"circuit bending\" in 1992.\nModular synth revival.\nFollowing the circuit bending culture, musicians also began to build their own modular synthesizers, causing a renewed interest in the early 1960s designs.

He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to fame, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius did in Finland and Bed\u0159ich Smetana in Bohemia.\nGrieg is the most celebrated person from the city of Bergen, with numerous statues that depict his image and many cultural entities named after him: the city's largest concert building (Grieg Hall), its most advanced music school (Grieg Academy) and its professional choir (Edvard Grieg Kor). The Edvard Grieg Museum at Grieg's former home, Troldhaugen, is dedicated to his legacy.\nBackground.\nEdvard Hagerup Grieg was born in Bergen, Norway. His parents were Alexander Grieg (1806\u20131875), a merchant and the British Vice-Consul in Bergen, and Gesine Judithe Hagerup (1814\u20131875), a music teacher and daughter of solicitor and politician Edvard Hagerup. The family name, originally spelled Greig, is associated with the Scottish Clann Ghriogair (Clan Gregor). After the Battle of Culloden in Scotland in 1746, Grieg's great-grandfather, Alexander Greig (1739\u20131803), travelled widely before settling in Norway about 1770 and establishing business interests in Bergen. Grieg's paternal great-great-grandparents, John (1702\u20131774) and Anne (1704\u20131784), are buried in the abandoned churchyard of the ruined Church of St Ethernan in Rathen, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nEdvard Grieg was raised in a musical family. His mother was his first piano teacher and taught him to play when he was age six. He studied in several schools, including Tanks Upper Secondary School.\nIn the summer of 1858, Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bull, who was a family friend; Bull's brother was married to Grieg's aunt. Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the Leipzig Conservatory, the piano department of which was directed by Ignaz Moscheles.\nGrieg enrolled in the conservatory, concentrating on piano, and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in Leipzig. He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the organ, which was mandatory for piano students. About his study in the conservatory, he wrote to his biographer, Aimar Gr\u00f8nvold, in 1881: \"I must admit, unlike Svendsen, that I left Leipzig Conservatory just as stupid as I entered it. Naturally, I did learn something there, but my individuality was still a closed book to me.\"\nIn the spring of 1860, he survived two life-threatening lung diseases, pleurisy and tuberculosis. Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure. Grieg was admitted many times to spas and sanatoria both in Norway and abroad. Several of his doctors became his friends.\nPianist.\nIn 1861, Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in Karlshamn, Sweden. In 1862, he finished his studies in Leipzig and had his first concert in his hometown, where his program included Beethoven's \"Path\u00e9tique\" sonata.\nIn 1863, Grieg went to Copenhagen, Denmark, and stayed there for three years. He met the Danish composers J. P. E. Hartmann and Niels Gade. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak (composer of the Norwegian national anthem), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a funeral march in his honor.\nMarriage.\nOn 11 June 1867, Grieg married his first cousin, Nina Hagerup (1845\u20131935), a lyric soprano. \nThe following year, they had a daughter, Alexandra, who died in 1869 from meningitis. They had no more children.\nComposer.\nIn the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his Piano Concerto in A minor while on holiday in Denmark. Edmund Neupert gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3 April 1869 at the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in Christiania (now Oslo).\nIn 1868, Franz Liszt, who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which resulted in Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in Rome in 1870. During Grieg's first visit, they examined Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg said gently to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on orchestration (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet, which Grieg himself chose not to accept).\nIn the 1870s, he became friends with poet Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, who shared his interests in Norwegian self-government. Grieg set several of his poems to music, including \"Landkjenning\" and \"Sigurd Jorsalfar\". Eventually, they decided on an opera based on King Olav Trygvason, but a dispute as to whether the music or lyrics should be created first led to Grieg's being diverted to working on incidental music for Henrik Ibsen's play \"Peer Gynt\", which naturally offended Bj\u00f8rnson. Eventually, their friendship resumed.\nThe incidental music composed for \"Peer Gynt\" at the request of the author contributed to its success and separately became some of the composer's most familiar music arranged as orchestral suites.\nGrieg had close ties with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra (Harmonien), and later became music director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882. In 1888, Grieg met Tchaikovsky in Leipzig. Grieg was impressed by Tchaikovsky, who thought very highly of Grieg's music, praising its beauty, originality and warmth.\nOn 6 December 1897, Grieg and his wife performed some of his music at a private concert at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria and her court.\nGrieg was awarded two honorary doctorates, first by the University of Cambridge in 1894 and the next from the University of Oxford in 1906.\nLater years.\nThe Norwegian government provided Grieg with a pension as he reached retirement age. In the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm gramophone recordings of his piano music in Paris. All of these discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg recorded player piano music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and Welte-Mignon reproducing system, all of which survive and can be heard today. He also worked with the Aeolian Company for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.\nIn 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in France in protest of the Dreyfus affair, an antisemitic scandal that was roiling French politics at the time. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might \"Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights.\" As a result of his statements concerning the affair, he became the target of much French hate mail that day.\nIn 1906, he met the composer and pianist Percy Grainger in London. Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: \"I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\"\nEdvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway, on 4 September 1907 at age 64 from heart failure. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were \"Well, if it must be so.\"\nThe funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Obeying his wish, his own \"Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak\" was played with orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen, who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the \"Funeral March\" movement from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played. Grieg was cremated in the first Norwegian crematorium opened in Bergen just that year, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, Troldhaugen. After the death of his wife, her ashes were placed alongside his.\nEdvard Grieg and his wife were Unitarians and Nina attended the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death.\nA century after his death, Grieg's legacy extends beyond the field of music. There is a large sculpture of Grieg in Seattle, while one of the largest hotels in Bergen (his hometown) is named Quality Hotel Edvard Grieg and a large crater on the planet Mercury is named after Grieg.\nMusic.\nSome of Grieg's early works include a symphony (which he later suppressed) and a piano sonata. He wrote three violin sonatas and a cello sonata.\nGrieg composed the incidental music for Henrik Ibsen's play \"Peer Gynt\", which includes the excerpts \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" and \"Morning Mood.\" In an 1874 letter to his friend Frants Beyer, Grieg expressed his unhappiness with \"In the Hall of the Mountain King,\" one of the movements in the \"Peer Gynt\" incidental music, writing \"I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King \u2013 something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible.\"\nGrieg's \"Holberg Suite\" was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets Heinrich Heine, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henrik Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, Rudyard Kipling and others. Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer's complete piano music on 13 LPs for BIS Records from 1977 to 1980. The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs, also on BIS Records. Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907. Pianist Bertha Tapper edited Grieg's piano works for publication in America by Oliver Ditson.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

The Proclamation changed the legal status of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the secessionist Confederate states from enslaved to free. As soon as slaves escaped the control of their enslavers, either by fleeing to Union lines or through the advance of federal troops, they were permanently free. In addition, the Proclamation allowed for former slaves to \"be received into the armed service of the United States\". The Emancipation Proclamation played a significant part in the end of slavery in the United States.\nOn September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Its third paragraph begins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Final Emancipation Proclamation. It stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLincoln then listed the ten states \u2014 of the eleven that had seceded \u2014 still in rebellion, Tennessee then being under Union control, and continued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free... And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States... And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.\nThe Proclamation applied to more than 3.5\u00a0million of the 4\u00a0million enslaved people in the country, though it excluded states not in rebellion, as well as parts of Virginia under Union control and Louisiana parishes thought to be pro-Union. Around 25,000 to 75,000 were immediately emancipated in those regions of the Confederacy where the US Army was already in place. It could not be enforced in the areas still in rebellion, but, as the Union army took control of Confederate regions, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for the liberation of more than three and a half million enslaved people in those regions by the end of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation outraged white Southerners and their sympathizers, who saw it as the beginning of a race war. It energized abolitionists, and undermined those Europeans who wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy. The Proclamation lifted the spirits of African Americans, both free and enslaved. It encouraged many to escape from slavery and flee toward Union lines, where many joined the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation became a historic document because it \"would redefine the Civil War, turning it from a struggle to preserve the Union to one focused on ending slavery, and set a decisive course for how the nation would be reshaped after that historic conflict.\"\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U.S., Lincoln also mandated that Reconstruction plans for Southern states require them to enact laws abolishing slavery (which occurred during the war in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana); Lincoln encouraged border states to adopt abolition (which occurred during the war in Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia) and pushed for passage of the 13th Amendment. The Senate passed the 13th Amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote on April 8, 1864; the House of Representatives did so on January 31, 1865; and the required three-fourths of the states ratified it on December 6, 1865. The amendment made slavery and involuntary servitude unconstitutional, \"except as a punishment for crime...\".\nAuthority.\nThe United States Constitution of 1787 did not use the word \"slavery\" but included several provisions about unfree persons. The Three-Fifths Compromise (in Article I, Section 2) allocated congressional representation, and therefore the number of each states' votes in the Electoral College, based \"on the whole Number of free Persons\" and \"three-fifths of all other Persons\". Under the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2), \"No person held to Service or Labour in one State\" would become legally free by escaping to another. Article I, Section 9 allowed Congress to pass legislation to outlaw the \"Importation of Persons\", but not until 1808. However, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment\u2014which states, \"No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\"\u2014slaves were understood to be property. Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it was made part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property by \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857). Slavery was also supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of white supremacy. Nonetheless, between 1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery. No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost four million people at the beginning of the Civil War, when most slave states sought to break away from the United States.\nLincoln accepted the conventional interpretation of the Constitution before 1865 as not allowing the federal government in peacetime to end slavery in the states where it existed, as opposed to in U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. During the Civil War, however, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation under his authority as \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy\" under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. As such, in the Emancipation Proclamation he claimed to have the authority to free persons held as slaves in those states that were in rebellion \"as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion\". In the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln said \"attention is hereby called\" to two 1862 statutes, namely \"An Act to Make an Additional Article of War\" and the Confiscation Act of 1862, but he didn't mention any statute in the Final Emancipation Proclamation and, in any event, the source of his authority to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and the Final Emancipation Proclamation was his \"joint capacity as President and Commander-in-Chief\". Lincoln therefore did not have such authority over the four border slave-holding states that were not in rebellion\u2014Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware\u2014so those states were not named in the Proclamation. The fifth border jurisdiction, West Virginia, where slavery remained legal but was being abolished, was, in January 1863, still part of the legally recognized \"reorganized\" state of Virginia, based in Alexandria, which was in the Union (as opposed to the Confederate state of Virginia, based in Richmond).\nCoverage.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applied only in the ten states that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, namely South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina. The Proclamation did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slaveholding border states of Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. Also not named was the state of Tennessee, in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for other areas under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become West Virginia, seven other named counties of Virginia including Berkeley county, which was soon added to West Virginia, New Orleans and 13 named parishes nearby. Exemptions were also made for certain areas that were deemed no longer in rebellion and areas Lincoln considered loyal to the Union. Enslaved people in those areas would be freed by later state and federal actions. The areas covered were, as the Proclamation stated, \"Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the Parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans), Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth).\"\nAlso, six additional counties and two independent cities were exempted in the Union-controlled Tidewater region of Virginia. And, in Louisiana, the city of New Orleans and the 13 named parishes were exempted because Lincoln regarded them as loyal to the Union. These exemptions left unemancipated an additional 300,000 slaves.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation resulted in the emancipation of a substantial percentage of the slaves in the Confederate states as the Union armies advanced through the South and slaves escaped to Union lines, or slave owners fled, leaving slaves behind. The Emancipation Proclamation also committed the Union to ending slavery in addition to preserving the Union.\nAlthough the Emancipation Proclamation resulted in the gradual freeing of most slaves, it did not make slavery illegal. Of the states that were exempted from the Emancipation Proclamation, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia prohibited slavery before the war ended. In 1863, President Lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the Reconstruction of the captured Confederate State of Louisiana. Only 10 percent of the state's electorate had to take the loyalty oath. The state was also required to accept the Emancipation Proclamation and abolish slavery in its new constitution. By December 1864, the Lincoln plan abolishing slavery had been enacted not only in Louisiana, but also in Arkansas and Tennessee. In Kentucky, Union Army commanders relied on the Proclamation's offer of freedom to slaves who enrolled in the Army and provided freedom for an enrollee's entire family; for this and other reasons, the number of slaves in the state fell by more than 70 percent during the war. However, in Delaware and Kentucky, slavery continued to be legal until December 18, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment took effect.\nBackground.\nMilitary action prior to emancipation.\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners. During the war, in May 1861, Union general Benjamin Butler declared that three slaves who escaped to Union lines were contraband of war, and accordingly he refused to return them, saying to a man who sought their return, \"I am under no constitutional obligations to a foreign country, which Virginia now claims to be\". On May 30, after a cabinet meeting called by President Lincoln, \"Simon Cameron, the secretary of war, telegraphed Butler to inform him that his contraband policy 'is approved.'\" This decision was controversial because it could have been taken to imply recognition of the Confederacy as a separate, independent sovereign state under international law, a notion that Lincoln steadfastly denied. In addition, as contraband, these people were legally designated as \"property\" when they crossed Union lines and their ultimate status was uncertain.\nGovernmental action toward emancipation.\nIn December 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message to Congress (the State of the Union Address, but then typically given in writing and not referred to as such). In it he praised the free labor system for respecting human rights over property rights; he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states, possibly through buying their freedom with federal money; and he endorsed federal funding of voluntary colonization. In January 1862, Thaddeus Stevens, the Republican leader in the House, called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves, arguing that emancipation, by forcing the loss of enslaved labor, would ruin the rebel economy. On March 13, 1862, Congress approved an Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves, which prohibited \"All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the United States\" from returning fugitive slaves to their owners. Pursuant to a law signed by Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia on April 16, 1862, and owners were compensated. Compensated owners included free black people who had purchased the freedom of family members. \nOn June 9, 1862, Congress passed a bill that prohibited slavery in all current and future United States territories (though not in the states), and, on June 19, President Lincoln signed it into law. This act effectively repudiated the 1857 opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the \"Dred Scott\" case that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories. It also rejected the notion of popular sovereignty that had been advanced by Stephen A. Douglas as a solution to the slavery controversy, while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1784 to confine slavery within the borders of existing states.\nOn August 6, 1861, the First Confiscation Act freed the slaves who were employed \"against the Government and lawful authority of the United States.\" On July 17, 1862, the Second Confiscation Act freed the slaves \"within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by forces of the United States.\" The Second Confiscation Act, unlike the First Confiscation Act, explicitly provided that all slaves covered by it would be permanently freed, stating in section 10 that \"all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the United States; and all slaves of such person found on [or] being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.\" However, Lincoln's position continued to be that, although Congress lacked the power to free the slaves in rebel-held states, he, as commander in chief, could do so if he deemed it a proper military measure. By this time, in the summer of 1862, Lincoln had drafted the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he issued on September 22, 1862. It declared that, on January 1, 1863, he would free the slaves in states still in rebellion.\nPublic opinion of emancipation.\nAbolitionists had long been urging Lincoln to free all slaves. In the summer of 1862, Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential \"New-York Tribune\" wrote a famous editorial entitled \"The Prayer of Twenty Millions\" demanding a more aggressive attack on the Confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves: \"On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one ... intelligent champion of the Union cause who does not feel ... that the rebellion, if crushed tomorrow, would be renewed if slavery were left in full vigor and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.\" Lincoln responded in his open of August 22, 1862:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time \"save\" slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time \"destroy\" slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle \"is\" to save the Union, and is \"not\" either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing \"any\" slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing \"all\" the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do \"not\" believe it would help to save the Union... I have here stated my purpose according to my view of \"official\" duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed \"personal\" wish that all men everywhere could be free.\nLincoln scholar Harold Holzer wrote about Lincoln's letter: \"Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.\" Historian Richard Striner argues that \"for years\" Lincoln's letter has been misread as \"Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.\" However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time. In effect, then, Lincoln may have already chosen the third option he mentioned to Greeley: \"freeing some and leaving others alone\"; that is, freeing slaves in the states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, but leaving enslaved those in the border states and Union-occupied areas.\nNevertheless, in the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation itself, Lincoln said that he would recommend to Congress that it compensate states that \"adopt, immediate, or gradual abolishment of slavery\". In addition, during the hundred days between September 22, 1862, when he issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, and January 1, 1863, when he issued the Final Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln took actions that suggest that he continued to consider the first option he mentioned to Greeley \u2014 saving the Union without freeing any slave \u2014 a possibility. Historian William W. Freehling wrote, \"From mid-October to mid-November 1862, he sent personal envoys to Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas\". Each of these envoys carried with him a letter from Lincoln stating that if the people of their state desired \"to avoid the unsatisfactory\" terms of the Final Emancipation Proclamation \"and to have peace again upon the old terms\" (\"i.e.\", with slavery intact), they should rally \"the largest number of the people possible\" to vote in \"elections of members to the Congress of the United States ... friendly to their object\". Later, in his Annual Message to Congress of December 1, 1862, Lincoln proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution providing that any state that abolished slavery before January 1, 1900, would receive compensation from the United States in the form of interest-bearing U.S. bonds. Adoption of this amendment, in theory, could have ended the war without ever permanently ending slavery, because the amendment provided, \"Any State having received bonds ... and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon\".\nIn his 2014 book, \"Lincoln's Gamble\", journalist and historian Todd Brewster asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was, in fact, crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war\u2014not for its own sake. But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, Edward Bates, for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the \"Dred Scott\" decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.\nConflicting advice as to whether to free the slaves was presented to Lincoln in public and private. Thomas Nast, a cartoon artist during the Civil War and the late 1800s considered \"Father of the American Cartoon\", composed many works, including a two-sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after President Lincoln signed the Proclamation. Nast believed in equal opportunity and equality for all people, including enslaved Africans or free blacks. A mass rally in Chicago on September 7, 1862, demanded immediate and universal emancipation of slaves. A delegation headed by William W. Patton met the president at the White House on September 13. Lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves. Even used as a war power, emancipation was a risky political act. Public opinion as a whole was against it. There would be strong opposition among Copperhead Democrats and an uncertain reaction from loyal border states. Delaware and Maryland already had a high percentage of free blacks: 91.2% and 49.7%, respectively, in 1860.\nDrafting and issuance of the Proclamation.\nLincoln first discussed the Proclamation with his cabinet in July 1862. He drafted his Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and read it to Secretary of State William Seward and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, on July 13. Seward and Welles were at first speechless, then Seward referred to possible anarchy throughout the South and resulting foreign intervention; Welles apparently said nothing. On July 22, Lincoln presented it to his entire cabinet as something he had determined to do and he asked their opinion on wording. Although Secretary of War Edwin Stanton supported it, Seward advised Lincoln to issue the Proclamation after a major Union victory, or else it would appear as if the Union was giving \"its last shriek of retreat\". Walter Stahr, however, writes, \"There are contemporary sources, however, that suggest others were involved in the decision to delay\", and Stahr quotes them.\nIn September 1862, the Battle of Antietam gave Lincoln the victory he needed to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. In the battle, though the Union suffered heavier losses than the Confederates and General McClellan allowed the escape of Robert E. Lee's retreating troops, Union forces turned back a Confederate invasion of Maryland, eliminating more than a quarter of Lee's army in the process. This marked a turning point in the Civil War.\nOn September 22, 1862, five days after Antietam, Lincoln called his cabinet into session and issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. According to Civil War historian James M. McPherson, Lincoln told cabinet members, \"I made a solemn vow before God, that if General Lee was driven back from Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slaves.\" Lincoln had first shown an early draft of the proclamation to Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, an ardent abolitionist, who was more often kept in the dark on presidential decisions. Lincoln issued the Final Emancipation Proclamation, as he had promised in the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, on January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to issue the Proclamation \"as a necessary war measure.\" Therefore, it was not the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment, because Lincoln or a subsequent president could revoke it. One week after issuing the final Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to Major General John McClernand: \"After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the 'institution'; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States. They chose to disregard it, and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity. And being made, it must stand\". Lincoln continued, however, that the states included in the Proclamation could \"adopt systems of apprenticeship for the colored people, conforming substantially to the most approved plans of gradual emancipation; and ... they may be nearly as well off, in this respect, as if the present trouble had not occurred\". He concluded by asking McClernand not to \"make this letter public\".\nInitially, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves, namely those who were behind Union lines in areas not exempted. Most slaves were still behind Confederate lines or in exempted Union-occupied areas. Secretary of State William H. Seward commented, \"We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.\" Had any slave state ended its secession attempt before January 1, 1863, it could have kept slavery, at least temporarily. The Proclamation freed the slaves only in areas of the South that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. But as the Union army advanced into the South, slaves fled to behind its lines, and \"[s]hortly after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, the Lincoln administration lifted the ban on enticing slaves into Union lines.\" These events contributed to the destruction of slavery.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 black men, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army. Their contributions were significant in winning the war. The Confederacy did not allow slaves in their army as soldiers until the last month before its defeat.\nThough the counties of Virginia that were soon to form West Virginia were specifically exempted from the Proclamation (Jefferson County being the only exception), a condition of the state's admittance to the Union was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery (an immediate emancipation of all slaves was also adopted there in early 1865). Slaves in the border states of Maryland and Missouri were also emancipated by separate state action before the Civil War ended. In Maryland, a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on November 1, 1864. The Union-occupied counties of eastern Virginia and the allegedly pro-Union parishes of Louisiana, which had been exempted from the Proclamation, both adopted state constitutions that abolished slavery in April 1864. In early 1865, Tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery.\nImplementation.\nUnion-occupied areas of the Confederate states where the Proclamation was put into immediate effect by local commanders included Winchester, Virginia, Corinth, Mississippi, the Sea Islands along the coasts of the Carolinas and Georgia, Key West, Florida, and Port Royal, South Carolina.\nImmediate impact.\nOn New Year's Eve in 1862, African Americans \u2013 enslaved and free \u2013 gathered across the United States to hold Watch Night ceremonies for \"Freedom's Eve\", looking toward the stroke of midnight and the promised fulfillment of the Proclamation. It has been inaccurately claimed that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free a single slave; historian Lerone Bennett Jr. alleged that the Proclamation was a hoax deliberately designed not to free any slaves. However, as a result of the Proclamation, most slaves became free during the war, beginning on the day it took effect; eyewitness accounts at places such as Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and Port Royal, South Carolina record celebrations on January 1 as thousands of blacks were informed of their new legal status of freedom. \"Estimates of the number of slaves freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation are uncertain. One contemporary estimate put the 'contraband' population of Union-occupied North Carolina at 10,000, and the Sea Islands of South Carolina also had a substantial population. Those 20,000 slaves were freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation.\" This Union-occupied zone where freedom began at once included parts of eastern North Carolina, the Mississippi Valley, northern Alabama, the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, a large part of Arkansas, and the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina. Although some counties of Union-occupied Virginia were exempted from the Proclamation, the lower Shenandoah Valley and the area around Alexandria were covered. \nEmancipation was immediately enforced as Union soldiers advanced into the Confederacy. Slaves fled their masters and were often assisted by Union soldiers. But Robert Gould Shaw was skeptical and, on September 25, 1862, wrote to his mother, \"So the 'Proclamation of Emancipation' has come at last, or rather, its forerunner. I suppose you all are very much excited about it. For my part, I can't see what \"practical\" good it can do now. Wherever our army has been, there remain no slaves, and the Proclamation will not free them where we don't go.\" Ten days later, he wrote her again, \"Don't imagine, from what I said in my last that I thought Mr. Lincoln's 'Emancipation Proclamation' not right ... but still, as a \"war-measure\", I don't see the immediate benefit of it, ... as the slaves are \"sure\" of being free at any rate, with or without an Emancipation Act.\"\nBooker T. Washington, as a boy of 9 in Virginia, remembered the day in early 1865:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom... [S]ome man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper\u2014the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.\nRunaway slaves who had escaped to Union lines had previously been held by the Union Army as \"contraband of war\" under the Confiscation Acts. The Sea Islands off the coast of Georgia had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of Reconstruction was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the Proclamation and told them they were free.\nSlaves had been part of the \"engine of war\" for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines. George Washington Albright, a teenage slave in Mississippi, recalled that like many of his fellow slaves, his father escaped to join Union forces. According to Albright, plantation owners tried to keep news of the Proclamation from slaves, but they learned of it through the grapevine. The young slave became a \"runner\" for an informal group they called the \"4Ls\" (\"Lincoln's Legal Loyal League\") bringing news of the Proclamation to secret slave meetings at plantations throughout the region.\nConfederate general Robert E. Lee saw the Emancipation Proclamation as a way for the Union to increase the number of soldiers it could place on the field, making it imperative for the Confederacy to increase its own numbers. Writing on the matter after the sack of Fredericksburg, Lee wrote, \"In view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy, of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death, if we would save the honor of our families from pollution [and] our social system from destruction, let every effort be made, every means be employed, to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies, until God in his mercy shall bless us with the establishment of our independence.\"\nThe Emancipation Proclamation marked a significant turning point in the war as it made the goal of the North not only preserving the Union, but also freeing the slaves. The Proclamation also rallied support from abolitionists and Europeans, while encouraging enslaved individuals to escape to the North. This weakened the South's labor force while bolstering the North's ranks.\nPolitical impact.\nThe Proclamation was immediately denounced by Copperhead Democrats, who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery. Horatio Seymour, while running for governor of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white Southerners, saying it was \"a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe\". The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power. In the \"Republican Watchman\" in Greenpoint, Long Island, its editor Henry A. Reeves wrote, \"In the name of freedom for Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test an utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their stead.\" By contrast, in a speech delivered in February 1863 at the Cooper Union and published in the New-York Tribune, Frederick Douglass called the Proclamation \"the greatest event of our nation's history, if not the greatest event of the century\". \nRacism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North supported the war only as an effort to force the South to stay in the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery were declared lies by their opponents, who cited the Emancipation Proclamation. In Columbiana, Ohio, Copperhead David Allen told a crowd, \"Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Britheren of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!\" The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut, H. B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to \"those stupid thickheaded persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution.\"\nWar Democrats, who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.\nLincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation by suspending habeas corpus. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.\nIn the 1862 elections, the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of New York. Lincoln's friend Orville Hickman Browning told the president that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been \"disastrous\" for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Jarvis of Connecticut pronounced the election the \"beginning of the end of the utter downfall of Abolitionism\".\nHistorians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results looked very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and \"at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party's in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican... Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate.\" McPherson states, \"If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln's conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies.\"\nConfederate response.\nThe initial Confederate response was outrage. The Proclamation was seen as vindication of the rebellion and proof that Lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the Union. It intensified the fear of slaves revolting and undermined morale, especially spurring fear among slave owners who saw it as a threat to their business. In an August 1863 letter to President Lincoln, U.S. Army general Ulysses S. Grant observed that the Proclamation's \"arming the negro\", together with \"the emancipation of the negro, is the heavyest [\"sic\"] blow yet given the Confederacy. The South rave a greatdeel [\"sic\"] about it and profess to be very angry.\" In May 1863, a few months after the Proclamation took effect, the Confederacy passed a law demanding \"full and ample retaliation\" against the U.S. for such measures. The Confederacy stated that black U.S. soldiers captured while fighting against the Confederacy would be tried as slave insurrectionists in civil courts\u2014a capital offense with an automatic sentence of death. Less than a year after the law's passage, the Confederates massacred black U.S. soldiers at Fort Pillow.\nConfederate President Jefferson Davis reacted to the Emancipation Proclamation with outrage and in an address to the Confederate Congress on January 12 threatened to send any U.S. military officer captured in Confederate territory covered by the Proclamation to state authorities to be charged with \"exciting servile insurrection\", which was a capital offense.\nConfederate General Robert E. Lee called the Proclamation a \"savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death.\"\nHowever, some Confederates welcomed the Proclamation, because they believed it would strengthen pro-slavery sentiment in the Confederacy and thus lead to greater enlistment of white men into the Confederate army. According to one Confederate cavalry sergeant from Kentucky, \"The Proclamation is worth three hundred thousand soldiers to our Government at least... It shows exactly what this war was brought about for and the intention of its damnable authors.\" Even some Union soldiers concurred with this view and expressed reservations about the Proclamation, not on principle, but rather because they were afraid it would increase the Confederacy's determination to fight on and maintain slavery. One Union soldier from New York stated worryingly after the Proclamation's issuance, \"I know enough of the southern spirit that I think they will fight for the institution of slavery even to extermination.\"\nAs a result of the Proclamation, the price of slaves in the Confederacy increased in the months after its issuance, with one Confederate from South Carolina opining in 1865 that \"now is the time for Uncle to buy some negro women and children...\"\nInternational impact.\nAs Lincoln had hoped, the Proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the Union by gaining the support of anti-slavery countries and countries that had already abolished slavery (especially the developed countries in Europe such as the United Kingdom and France). This shift ended the Confederacy's hopes of gaining official recognition.\nSince the Emancipation Proclamation made the eradication of slavery an explicit Union war goal, it linked support for the South to support for slavery. Public opinion in Britain would not tolerate support for slavery. As Henry Adams noted, \"The Emancipation Proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy.\" In Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi hailed Lincoln as \"the heir of the aspirations of John Brown\". On August 6, 1863, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: \"Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure\".\nMayor Abel Haywood, a representative for workers from Manchester, England, wrote to Lincoln saying, \"We joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders: 'All men are created free and equal.'\" The Emancipation Proclamation served to ease tensions with Europe over the North's conduct of the war, and combined with the recent failed Southern offensive at Antietam, to remove any practical chance for the Confederacy to receive foreign military intervention in the war.\nHowever, in spite of the Emancipation Proclamation, arms sales to the Confederacy through blockade running, from British firms and dealers, continued, with knowledge of the British government. The Confederacy was able to sustain the fight for two more years largely thanks to the weapons supplied by British blockade runners. As a result, the blockade runners operating from Britain were responsible for killing 400,000 additional soldiers and civilians on both sides.\nGettysburg Address.\nLincoln's Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863 made indirect reference to the Proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase \"new birth of freedom\". The Proclamation solidified Lincoln's support among the rapidly growing abolitionist elements of the Republican Party and ensured that they would not block his renomination in 1864.\nProclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction (1863).\nIn December 1863, Lincoln issued his \"Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction\", which dealt with the ways the rebel states could reconcile with the Union. Key provisions required that the states accept the Emancipation Proclamation and thus the freedom of their slaves, and accept the Confiscation Acts, as well as the Act banning slavery in United States territories.\nPostbellum.\nNear the end of the war, abolitionists were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation would be construed solely as a war measure, as Lincoln intended, and would no longer apply once fighting ended. They also were increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect on November 1, 1864. Slavery in Missouri ended on January 11, 1865, when a state convention approved an ordinance abolishing slavery by a vote of 60-4, and later the same day, Governor Thomas C. Fletcher followed up with his own \"Proclamation of Freedom.\"\nWinning re-election, Lincoln pressed the lame duck 38th Congress to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming 39th Congress to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the Thirteenth Amendment, banning slavery in all U.S. states and territories, except as punishment for a crime. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were approximately 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.\nCritiques.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation has been ridiculed, notably by Richard Hofstadter, who wrote that it \"had all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading\" and \"declared free all slaves ... precisely where its effect could not reach\". Disagreeing with Hofstadter, William W. Freehling wrote that \"in rebel-held areas, Lincoln presided over ... a conquering army, perfect to smooth the fugitives' road toward liberating themselves\". Freehling added that Lincoln's asserting his power as Commander-in-Chief to issue the proclamation \"reads not like an entrepreneur's bill for past services but like a warrior's brandishing of a new weapon\".\nLincoln's proclamation has been called \"one of the most radical emancipations in the history of the modern world.\" Nonetheless, as over the years American society continued to be deeply unfair towards black people, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. One attack was Lerone Bennett's \"\" (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. To this, one scholarly review states, \"Few Civil War scholars take Bennett and DiLorenzo seriously, pointing to their narrow political agenda and faulty research.\" In his \"Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation\", Allen C. Guelzo noted professional historians' lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was the U.S.'s \"last Enlightenment politician\" and as such had \"allegiance to 'reason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason'... But the most important among the Enlightenment's political virtues for Lincoln, and for his Proclamation, was prudence\".\nOther historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished toward ending slavery and for his own growth in political and moral stature. More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As Eric Foner wrote:\nLincoln was not an abolitionist or Radical Republican, a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held racist views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.\nLegacy in the civil rights era.\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr..\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. made many references to the Emancipation Proclamation during the civil rights movement. These include an \"Emancipation Proclamation Centennial Address\" he gave in New York City on September 12, 1962, in which he placed the Proclamation alongside the Declaration of Independence as an \"imperishable\" contribution to civilization and added, \"All tyrants, past, present and future, are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations...\" He lamented that despite a history where the United States \"proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents,\" it \"sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles.\" He concluded, \"There is but one way to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. That is to make its declarations of freedom real; to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world, and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.\"\nKing's most famous invocation of the Emancipation Proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (often referred to as the \"I Have a Dream\" speech). King began the speech saying \"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.\"\nThe \"Second Emancipation Proclamation\".\nIn the early 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates called on President John F. Kennedy to bypass Southern segregationist opposition in the Congress by issuing an executive order to put an end to segregation. This envisioned document was referred to as the \"Second Emancipation Proclamation\". Kennedy, however, did not issue a second Emancipation Proclamation \"and noticeably avoided all centennial celebrations of emancipation.\" Historian David W. Blight points out that, although the idea of an executive order to act as a second Emancipation Proclamation \"has been virtually forgotten,\" the manifesto that King and his associates produced calling for an executive order showed his \"close reading of American politics\" and recalled how moral leadership could have an effect on the American public through an executive order. Despite its failure \"to spur a second Emancipation Proclamation from the White House, it was an important and emphatic attempt to combat the structured forgetting of emancipation latent within Civil War memory.\"\nPresident John F. Kennedy.\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy spoke on national television about civil rights. Kennedy, who had been routinely criticized as timid by some civil rights activists, reminded Americans that two black students had been peacefully enrolled in the University of Alabama with the aid of the National Guard, despite the opposition of Governor George Wallace.\nJohn Kennedy called it a \"moral issue.\" Invoking the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation he said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free. We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.\nIn the same speech, Kennedy announced he would introduce a comprehensive civil rights bill in the United States Congress, which he did a week later. Kennedy pushed for its passage until he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Historian Peniel E. Joseph holds Lyndon Johnson's ability to get that bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed into law on July 2, 1964, to have been aided by \"the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech\", which had turned \"the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal.\"\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson.\nDuring the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson invoked the Emancipation Proclamation, holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented.\nAs vice president, while speaking from Gettysburg on May 30, 1963 (Memorial Day), during the centennial year of the Emancipation Proclamation, Johnson connected it directly with the ongoing civil rights struggles of the time, saying \"One hundred years ago, the slave was freed. One hundred years later, the Negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin... In this hour, it is not our respective races which are at stake\u2014it is our nation. Let those who care for their country come forward, North and South, white and Negro, to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision... Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent we shall have fallen short of assuring freedom to the free.\"\nAs president, Johnson again invoked the Proclamation in a speech presenting the Voting Rights Act at a joint session of Congress on Monday, March 15, 1965. This was one week after violence had been inflicted on peaceful civil rights marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches. Johnson said \"it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed\u2014more than 100 years\u2014since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln\u2014a great President of another party\u2014signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed\u2014more than 100 years\u2014since equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.\"\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1963 episode of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Andy Discovers America\", Andy asks Barney to explain the Emancipation Proclamation to Opie who is struggling with history at school. Barney brags about his history expertise, yet it is apparent he cannot answer Andy's question. He finally becomes frustrated and explains it is a proclamation for certain people who wanted emancipation. In addition, the Emancipation Proclamation was also a main item of discussion in the movie \"Lincoln\" (2012) directed by Steven Spielberg.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation is celebrated around the world, including on stamps of nations such as the Republic of Togo. The United States commemorative was issued on August 16, 1963, the opening day of the Century of Negro Progress Exhibition in Chicago, Illinois. Designed by Georg Olden, an initial printing of 120\u00a0million stamps was authorized.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9516", "revid": "237572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9516", "title": "Erwin Rommel", "text": "German field marshal (1891\u20131944)\nJohannes Erwin Eugen Rommel (; 15 November 1891\u00a0\u2013 14 October 1944), known as The Desert Fox (, ), was a German \"Generalfeldmarschall\" (field marshal) during World War II. He served in the \"Wehrmacht\" of Nazi Germany, as well as in the \"Reichswehr\" of the Weimar Republic, and Imperial German Army of the German Empire.\nRommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and awarded the \"Pour le M\u00e9rite\" for his actions on the Italian Front. In 1937, he published his classic book on military tactics, \"Infantry Attacks\", drawing on his experiences in that war. In World War II, he commanded the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established his reputation as one of the ablest tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname \"der W\u00fcstenfuchs\", \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for chivalry, and his phrase \"war without hate\" has been uncritically used to describe the North African campaign. Other historians have rejected the phrase as a myth, citing crimes against North African Jewish populations. Others note there is no clear evidence Rommel was involved in or aware of these crimes. He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944.\nAfter the Nazis gained power, Rommel pledged allegiance to the new regime. However, historians have given different accounts of the specific period and his motivations. At least until near the war's end, he was a loyal supporter of Adolf Hitler, but not to the Nazi party and SS. In 1944, Rommel was implicated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. Subsequently, Rommel was given a choice between suicide or facing a trial that would result in his disgrace and execution. He ultimately chose the former and took a cyanide pill. Rommel was given a state funeral, and it was announced he had succumbed to injuries from the strafing of his car in Normandy.\nRommel became a larger-than-life figure in Allied and Nazi propaganda, and in postwar popular culture. Numerous authors portray him as an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of Nazi Germany, although others have contested this assessment and called it the \"Rommel myth\". Rommel's reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the West German rearmament and reconciliation between the former enemies \u2013 the UK and the US on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other. Several of Rommel's former subordinates, notably his chief of staff Hans Speidel, played key roles in German rearmament and integration into NATO in the postwar era. The German Army's largest military base, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf, and a third ship of the L\u00fctjens-class destroyer of the German Navy are both named in his honour. His son Manfred Rommel was the longtime mayor of Stuttgart, Germany and namesake of Stuttgart Airport.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and career.\nRommel was born on 15 November 1891 in Heidenheim, from Ulm, in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, then part of the German Empire. He was the third of five children to Erwin Rommel Senior (1860\u20131913) and his wife Helene von Luz. Her father, Karl von Luz, headed the local government council. As a young man, Rommel's father had been an artillery lieutenant. Rommel had one older sister who was an art teacher and his favourite sibling, one older brother named Manfred who died in infancy, and two younger brothers, of whom one became a successful dentist and the other an opera singer.\nAt age 18, Rommel joined the W\u00fcrttemberg Infantry Regiment No. 124 in Weingarten as a \"F\u00e4hnrich\" (ensign), in 1910, studying at the Officer Cadet School in Danzig. He graduated in November 1911 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1912 and was assigned to the 124th Infantry in Weingarten. He was posted to Ulm in March 1914 to the 49th Field Artillery Regiment, XIII (Royal W\u00fcrttemberg) Corps, as a battery commander. He returned to the 124th when war was declared. While at Cadet School, Rommel met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894\u20131971), of Italian and Polish descent.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I, Rommel fought in France as well as in the Romanian, notably at the Second Battle of the Jiu Valley, and Italian campaigns. He successfully employed the tactics of penetrating enemy lines with heavy covering fire coupled with rapid advances, as well as moving forward rapidly to a flanking position to arrive at the rear of hostile positions, to achieve tactical surprise. His first combat experience was on 22 August 1914 as a platoon commander near Verdun, when \u2013 catching a French garrison unprepared \u2013 Rommel and three men opened fire on them without ordering the rest of his platoon forward. The armies continued to skirmish in open engagements throughout September, as the static trench warfare typical of the war was still in the future. For his actions in September 1914 and January 1915, Rommel was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. Rommel was promoted to \"Oberleutnant\" (first lieutenant) and transferred to the newly created Royal Wurttemberg Mountain Battalion of the \"Alpenkorps\" in September 1915, as a company commander. In November 1916 in Danzig, Rommel and Lucia married.\nIn August 1917, his unit was involved in the battle for Co\u0219na Hill, a heavily fortified objective on the border between Hungary and Romania, which they took after weeks of difficult uphill fighting. The Mountain Battalion was next assigned to the Isonzo front, in a mountainous area in Italy. The offensive, known as the Battle of Caporetto, began on 24 October 1917. Rommel's battalion, consisting of three rifle companies and a machine gun unit, was part of an attempt to take enemy positions on three mountains: Kolovrat, Matajur, and Stol. From 25 to 27 October, Rommel and his 150 men captured 81 guns and 9,000 men, at a loss of six dead and 30 wounded. Rommel achieved this by taking advantage of the terrain to outflank the Italian forces, attacking from unexpected directions or behind enemy lines, and taking the initiative to attack when he had orders to the contrary. In one instance, the Italian forces, taken by surprise and believing their lines had collapsed, surrendered after a brief firefight. In this battle, Rommel helped pioneer infiltration tactics, a new form of manoeuvre warfare being adopted by German armies, and later by foreign armies, and later described by some as Blitzkrieg without tanks. However, he played no role in the early adoption of Blitzkrieg in World War II.\nActing as advance guard in the capture of Longarone on 9 November 1917, Rommel again decided to attack with a much smaller force. Convinced that they were surrounded by an entire German division, the 1st Italian Infantry Division \u2013 10,000 men \u2013 surrendered to Rommel. For this and his actions at Matajur, he received the order of Pour le M\u00e9rite.\nIn January 1918, Rommel was promoted to \"Hauptmann\" (captain) and assigned to a staff position in the 64th Army Corps, where he served for the remainder of the war. In his book \"Infanterie greift an\", Rommel wrote in detail about his activities during World War I.\nInterwar period.\nRommel remained with the 124th Regiment until October 1920. The regiment was involved in quelling riots and civil disturbances occurring throughout Germany. Wherever possible, Rommel avoided the use of force. In 1919, he was briefly sent to Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, where he restored order by \"sheer force of personality\" in the 32nd Internal Security Company, which was composed of rebellious and pro-communist sailors. He decided against storming nearby Lindau, which had been taken by revolutionary communists. Instead, Rommel negotiated with the city council and returned it to the legitimate government through diplomatic means. This was followed by his defence of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, again bloodless. He was then posted to the Ruhr, where a Red Army was responsible for fomenting unrest. Historian Raffael Scheck praised Rommel as a coolheaded and moderate mind, exceptional amid the many takeovers of revolutionary cities by regular and irregular units and the associated violence.\nAccording to Reuth, this period gave Rommel the indelible impression that \"Everyone in this Republic was fighting each other\", along with the direct experience of people who attempted to convert Germany into a socialist republic on Soviet lines. Like Rommel, Hitler had known the solidarity of trench warfare and had participated in the Reichswehr's suppression of the First and Second Bavarian Soviet Republics. The need for national unity thus became a legacy of the first World War. Brighton noted that while both believed in the Stab-in-the-back myth, Rommel was able to succeed using peaceful methods because he saw the problem as related to economics, rather than Judeo-Bolshevism \u2013 which right-wing soldiers such as Hitler blamed for the chaos.\nOn 1 October 1920, Rommel was appointed to a company command with the 13th Infantry Regiment in Stuttgart, a post he held for the next nine years. He was then assigned to an instruction position at the Dresden Infantry School from 1929 to 1933. In April 1932, he was promoted to major. While at Dresden, he wrote a manual on infantry training, published in 1934. In October 1933, he was promoted to \"Oberstleutnant\" (lieutenant colonel) and given his next command, the 3rd \"J\u00e4ger\" Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, stationed at Goslar. There he first met Adolf Hitler, who inspected his troops on 30 September 1934.\nIn September 1935, Rommel was moved to the Kriegsschule (War Academy) in Potsdam as an instructor, serving for the next three years. His book \"Infanterie greift an\" (\"Infantry Attacks\"), a description of his wartime experiences along with his analysis, was published in 1937. It became a bestseller, which, according to Scheck, later \"enormously influenced\" many armies. Hitler owned a copy.\nHearing of Rommel's reputation as an outstanding military instructor, in February 1937 Hitler assigned him as the War Ministry liaison officer to the Hitler Youth in charge of military training. Here, Rommel clashed with Baldur von Schirach, the Reichsjugendf\u00fchrer, over the training the boys should receive. Trying to fulfil a mission assigned to him by the Ministry of War, Rommel had twice proposed a plan that would have effectively subordinated Hitler Youth to the Wehrmacht, removing it from NSDAP control. That went against Schirach's express wishes. Schirach appealed to Hitler; consequently, Rommel was quietly removed from the project in 1938. He had been promoted to \"Oberst\" (colonel), on 1 August 1937. After the \"Anschluss\" in March 1938, he was appointed commandant of the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt.\nIn October 1938, Hitler specially requested that Rommel be seconded to command the \"F\u00fchrerbegleitbatallion\" (his escort battalion). This unit accompanied Hitler whenever he travelled outside of Germany. Rommel indulged his interest in engineering and mechanics by learning about the inner workings and maintenance of combustion engines and heavy machine guns. He memorised logarithm tables in his spare time, and enjoyed skiing and other outdoor sports. Ian Beckett wrote that by 1938, Rommel drifted towards uncritical acceptance of the Nazi regime, quoting Rommel's letter to his wife in which he stated \"The German Wehrmacht is the sword of the new German world view\", as a reaction to a speech by Hitler.\nDuring his visit to Switzerland in 1938, Rommel reported that Swiss soldiers who he met showed \"remarkable understanding of our Jewish problem\". Biographer Daniel Allen Butler commented that he did share the view (popular in Germany and many countries) that the Jews were loyal to themselves rather than the nations in which they lived. Despite this, other evidence shows he considered the Nazi racial theories to be rubbish. Alaric Searle comments that Rommel knew the official stand of the regime, but in this case, the phrase was ambiguous and there is no evidence after or before this event that he ever sympathised with the antisemitism of the Nazi movement. Rommel's son Manfred Rommel stated in the documentary \"The Real Rommel\" that his father would \"look the other way\" when faced with anti-Jewish violence on the streets. But Rommel requested proof of \"Aryan descent\" from the Italian boyfriend of his illegitimate daughter Gertrud.\nDuring his time in Goslar, he repeatedly clashed with the SA whose members terrorised the Jews and dissident citizens. After the R\u00f6hm Purge (1934), he mistakenly believed that the worst was over, although restrictions on Jewish businesses were still being imposed and agitation against Jews continued. Manfred Rommel recounted that his father knew about and privately disagreed with the regime's antisemitism, but he had not actively campaigned on behalf of the Jews. However, Uri Avnery notes that even when Rommel was a low-ranking officer, he protected Jews who lived in his district. Manfred Rommel told the \"Stuttgarter Nachrichten\" that their family lived in isolated military facilities but knew about discrimination against the Jews occurring outside. They could not foresee the enormity of the impending atrocities, about which they only knew much later.\nRommel wrote to his wife that Hitler had a \"magnetic, maybe hypnotic, strength\" that had its origin in Hitler's belief that he \"was called upon by God\", and Hitler sometimes \"spoke from the depth of his being [...] like a prophet\".\nWorld War II.\nPoland 1939.\nRommel was promoted to \"Generalmajor\" in August 1939 and assigned commander of the \"F\u00fchrerbegleitbatallion\", guarding Hitler and his field headquarters during the invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September. Rommel's letters show he did not understand Hitler's true nature and intentions, as he quickly went from predicting a swift peaceful settlement to approving Hitler's reaction (\"bombs will be retaliated with bombs\") to the Gleiwitz incident, a false flag operation used as pretext for the invasion. Rommel attended Hitler's daily briefings and accompanied him everywhere, making use of the opportunity to observe first-hand the use of tanks and other motorised units. On 26 September Rommel returned to Berlin to set up a new headquarters for his unit in the Reich Chancellery. Rommel briefly returned to occupied Warsaw on 5 October to prepare for the German victory parade. In a letter to his wife he claimed that the occupation by Nazi Germany was \"probably welcomed with relief\" by the inhabitants of the ruined city and that they were \"rescued\".\nFrance 1940.\nPromotion to armoured division commander.\nFollowing the invasion of Poland, Rommel began lobbying for command of one of Germany's panzer divisions, of which there were then only ten. Rommel's successes in World War I were based on surprise and manoeuvre, two elements for which the new panzer units were ideally suited. Rommel received promotion to general from Hitler ahead of more senior officers. Rommel obtained the command he aspired to, despite having been earlier turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered command of a mountain division instead. Rommel was backed by Hitler, the influential Fourteenth Army commander Wilhelm List, a fellow W\u00fcrttemberger middle-class \"military outsider\", and likely Heinz Guderian, commander of XIX Army Corps.\nGoing against military protocol, this promotion added to Rommel's growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders, although his outstanding leadership in France quelled complaints about his promotion and political scheming. The 7th Panzer Division had been converted to an armoured division consisting of 218 tanks in three battalions, with two rifle regiments, a motorcycle battalion, an engineer battalion, and an anti-tank battalion. Upon taking command on 10 February 1940, Rommel set his unit to practising the manoeuvres they would need in the upcoming campaign.\nInvasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and France.\nThe invasion began on 10 May 1940. By the third day Rommel and advance elements of his division, with a detachment of the 5th Panzer Division, had reached the Meuse, where they found the bridges had been destroyed. Rommel was active in the forward areas, directing efforts to make a crossing, which were initially unsuccessful because of suppressive fire by the French. Rommel brought up tanks and flak units to provide counter-fire and had nearby houses set on fire to create a smokescreen. He sent infantry across in rubber boats, appropriated the bridging tackle of the 5th Panzer Division, grabbed a light machine gun to fight off a French counterattack supported by tanks, and went into the water himself, encouraging the sappers and helping lash together the pontoons. By 16 May Rommel reached Avesnes, and contravening orders, pressed on to Cateau. That night, the French II Army Corps was shattered and on 17 May, Rommel's forces took 10,000 prisoners, losing 36 men. He was surprised to find only his vanguard had followed his tempestuous surge. The High Command and Hitler had been nervous about his disappearance, although they awarded him the Knight's Cross. Rommel and Guderian's successes and the possibilities offered by the new tank arm were welcomed by a few generals, but worried and paralysed the rest.\nOn 20 May, Rommel reached Arras. General Hermann Hoth received orders that the town should be bypassed and its British garrison thus isolated. He ordered the 5th Panzer Division to move to the west and the 7th Panzer Division to the east, flanked by the SS Division Totenkopf. The following day, the British launched a counterattack in the Battle of Arras. It failed and the British withdrew.\n7th Panzer continued its advance, reaching Lille on 27 May. The Siege of Lille continued until 31 May, when the French garrison of 40,000 men surrendered. Rommel was summoned to Berlin to meet Hitler. He was the only divisional commander present at the planning session for \"Fall Rot\" (Case Red), the second phase of the invasion of France.\nDrive for the Channel.\nRommel, resuming his advance on 5 June, drove for the River Seine to secure bridges near Rouen. Advancing in two days, the division reached Rouen to find it defended by three French tanks which destroyed German tanks before being taken out. The German force, enraged by this, forbade fire brigades access to the burning district of the Norman capital, so most of the historic quarter was reduced to ashes. Rommel instructed the German artillery to bombard the city as a \"fire demonstration\". The smoke was intense enough that it reached Paris. Daniel Allen Butler states that the bridges to the city were already destroyed. After the fall of the city, 100 black civilians and colonial troops were executed on 9 June by unknown German units. Rouen fell to the 5th Panzer Division, while Rommel advanced from the Seine towards the Channel. On 10 June, Rommel, near Dieppe, sent Hoth the message \"Am on the coast\". On 17 June, 7th Panzer was ordered to advance on Cherbourg, where British evacuations were under way. The division advanced in 24 hours, and after two days of shelling, the French garrison surrendered. The speed and surprise it consistently achieved, to thethat the enemy and \"Oberkommando des Heeres\" (OKH, \"High Command of the Army\") lost track of its whereabouts, earned the 7th Panzers the nickname \"ghost division\".\nAfter the armistice with the French was signed on 22 June, the division was placed in reserve, being sent first to the Somme and then Bordeaux to reequip and prepare for \"Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we\" (Operation Sea Lion), the planned invasion of Britain. This invasion was cancelled.\nNorth Africa 1941\u20131943.\nOn 6 February 1941, Rommel was appointed commander of the new Afrika Korps (\"Deutsches Afrika Korps\"; DAK), consisting initially of the 5th Light Division (later 21st Panzer Division) and 15th Panzer Division. Promoted to \"Generalleutnant\", he arrived in Tripoli on 12 February. The DAK had been sent in Operation Sonnenblume to support Italian forces that had suffered heavy defeats in Operation Compass. His operations in the Western Desert Campaign soon earned him the nickname \"Desert Fox\" in both Allied and German reporting. Allied troops in the theatre were commanded by General Archibald Wavell.\nFirst Axis offensive.\nFormally subordinate to Italian commander-in-chief General Italo Gariboldi, Rommel rejected the instructions of the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\" (OKW) to hold a defensive line near Sirte. Encouraged by Hitler to act aggressively, he launched a limited offensive on 24 March 1941 with 5th Light Division and two Italian divisions, even though 15th Panzer Division had not yet arrived. The British, weakened by the transfer of formations to the Battle of Greece, fell back to Mersa El Brega, where they were defeated on 31 March.\nRommel then pushed rapidly east, taking Benghazi on 3 April as the British withdrew. When Gariboldi ordered him to halt at Mersa El Brega, Rommel argued that \"one cannot permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles\", and misrepresented a signal from General Franz Halder so as to claim freedom of action. By 8 April Axis forces had reoccupied most of Cyrenaica; only the port of Tobruk held out and was invested on 11 April. Throughout the campaign fuel, food and water remained chronic problems, as everything had to be brought from Europe and moved over difficult desert tracks.\nSiege of Tobruk.\nTobruk was not fully encircled, since the garrison could be supplied by sea, but Rommel regarded its capture as essential to shorten his overstretched supply line and gain port capacity for further operations. The strongly fortified port, held by about 36,000 Commonwealth troops under Australian Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, withstood a surprise assault on 14 April.\nRepeated German\u2013Italian attacks failed. A second assault at the end of April 1941 was repulsed, and an Allied attempt to break the siege in Operation Brevity in May, followed by Operation Battleaxe in June, also ended in failure. The outcome contributed to Wavell\u2019s replacement by General Claude Auchinleck as theatre commander.\nIn August 1941 Rommel was appointed commander of the newly created Panzer Army Africa, with Fritz Bayerlein as chief of staff. The Afrika Korps (15th Panzer and the reinforced 21st Panzer Division) under Generalleutnant Ludwig Cr\u00fcwell, together with 90th Light Division and several Italian formations, formed his main striking force, while Field Marshal Albert Kesselring was given overall responsibility for the Mediterranean area to improve air and sea coordination.\nAuchinleck reorganised his forces into XXX and XIII Corps, forming the British Eighth Army under General Alan Cunningham. As Rommel prepared another attempt on Tobruk for November, Auchinleck launched Operation Crusader on 18 November 1941 to relieve the garrison.\nIn the confused fighting that followed, the Eighth Army lost large numbers of tanks, but Rommel\u2019s armoured forces also suffered heavy casualties and supply problems. On 24 November he attempted a wide counterstroke towards the Egyptian frontier\u2014the so-called \"dash to the wire\"\u2014which overextended his forces and was criticised by the German high command and his own staff. While he advanced into Egypt, Commonwealth troops east of Tobruk endangered his rear. With losses mounting, Rommel withdrew, and on 27 November the British linked up with the Tobruk garrison. By early December he had fallen back to a defensive line at Gazala, just west of Tobruk, under heavy pressure from the Desert Air Force. The British recovered most of Cyrenaica, but his retreat shortened Axis supply lines to El Agheila.\nBattle of Gazala and capture of Tobruk.\nReceiving new tanks and supplies in January 1942, Rommel launched a counteroffensive from El Agheila on 21 January. Taking the British by surprise, he retook Benghazi on 29 January and forced them back to a defensive line west of Tobruk near Gazala.\nBetween December 1941 and June 1942, Axis intelligence was aided by detailed reports from US military attach\u00e9 Bonner Fellers, whose messages were sent in a compromised code. Following Kesselring's temporary neutralisation of Malta in April 1942, supply deliveries improved, and Rommel sought to pre-empt a British offensive. On 26 May he attacked first, starting the Battle of Gazala. The main armoured force swung south and then north behind the British left flank.\nAfter heavy fighting, including a stubborn defence by the Free French at Bir Hakeim until 10 June, the British line collapsed and the Eighth Army began a rapid retreat towards Egypt, dubbed the \"Gazala Gallop\". Rommel pressed on and assaulted Tobruk on 20 June; the garrison surrendered the next day. Around 32,000 Commonwealth troops were captured, along with substantial supplies and the port itself. Only at the fall of Singapore earlier that year had more British Commonwealth troops been taken prisoner. On 22 June Hitler promoted Rommel to \"Generalfeldmarschall\".\nRommel wished to exploit the victory immediately by advancing into Egypt, aiming at Alexandria and the Suez Canal, which he saw as a decisive strategic objective linking to operations in the Caucasus and Middle East. His success at Tobruk, however, contributed to Hitler\u2019s decision to postpone Operation Herkules, the projected assault on Malta, allowing Allied interdiction of Axis supplies to resume.\nAuchinleck relieved Lieutenant General Neil Ritchie of command of the Eighth Army and took over personally. Rommel, aware that delay favoured the British, attacked the new fallback position at Mersa Matruh on 28 June. The fortress fell the next day, and large stocks of fuel, vehicles and equipment were captured, many of which were pressed into Axis service.\nEl Alamein.\nFirst Battle of El Alamein.\nThe Eighth Army withdrew to prepared positions near El Alamein, where the sea to the north and the impassable Qattara Depression to the south created a narrow defensive front that could not easily be outflanked. Axis propaganda leaflets, distributed in Egypt and Syria, urged local populations to support Rommel\u2019s advance and portrayed the struggle in strongly antisemitic terms.\nThe First Battle of El Alamein began on 1 July 1942. Rommel had about 100 operational tanks, and his troops faced a numerically superior enemy with growing air supremacy. Delayed by sandstorms and artillery fire, his attacks made little headway, and by early July he recorded in his diary that his strength had \"faded away\". Both sides suffered comparable losses during the month, but the Axis supply situation continued to deteriorate, and Rommel recognised that the initiative was slipping away.\nIn August Auchinleck was replaced by General Harold Alexander as theatre commander, and Bernard Montgomery took over the Eighth Army (after the death of General William Gott in an air attack). Expecting a major British build-up\u2014Rommel knew a large convoy was due in September\u2014he tried to pre-empt it with another attack. He planned an armoured thrust through the southern sector using 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions, 90th Light Division and Italian XX Motorized Corps.\nBattle of Alam El Halfa.\nThe resulting Battle of Alam el Halfa opened on 30 August 1942. Forced by terrain and minefields to repeat a wide sweep to the south, Rommel\u2019s armour became bogged down in unexpected soft ground and came under heavy fire from British artillery and aircraft; Montgomery had even arranged for him to receive a falsified map of the area. By 2 September, with fuel running short and no prospect of outflanking the British, Rommel broke off the attack and withdrew.\nA British spoiling attack on 3 September was repulsed by 90th Light Division, and Montgomery chose not to pursue, preferring to conserve strength and train his army for a set-piece offensive. Rommel had suffered nearly 3,000 casualties and lost about 50 tanks, similar numbers of guns and some 400 lorries\u2014losses he could not easily replace\u2014while British losses were lighter except in tanks. He concluded that the war in Africa could no longer be won and, suffering from illness and exhaustion, flew to Germany to recuperate; General Georg Stumme took over command.\nSecond Battle of El Alamein.\nBy late 1942 British code-breaking and naval-air interdiction meant that only a fraction of Axis supplies reached North Africa. Mussolini diverted some deliveries to garrisons in Tripoli and refused further reinforcements, leaving Rommel\u2019s forces short of fuel, ammunition and replacements. The Axis defensive line west of El Alamein was anchored on a deep mine belt and prepared infantry positions, behind which armoured reserves were to counterattack any breakthrough.\nThe British offensive began on 23 October. Stumme died of a heart attack at the front on 24 October, and Rommel, recalled from Germany, resumed command the next day. Montgomery aimed to cut corridors through the northern minefields, then grind down the Axis armour. By 25 October, 15th Panzer Division had only 31 operational tanks left from an initial 119, and Rommel pulled 21st Panzer and the Italian \"Ariete\" Division north to reinforce the sector.\nAfter several days of attritional fighting, Rommel had about 150 operational tanks, facing some 800 British tanks, many of them Shermans. On 2 November Montgomery launched \"Operation Supercharge\" with a massive artillery barrage, breaking through the depleted Axis front. Rommel ordered a withdrawal, but on 3 November Hitler radioed a \"stand fast\" order, instructing him to hold the line to the last man. Rommel initially complied, but after discussions with Kesselring and other commanders he again ordered a retreat on 4 November, a delay he later called his greatest mistake in Africa. The British 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions broke through and attempted to encircle the retreating Axis forces. That evening Hitler finally authorised withdrawal.\nEnd of Africa campaign.\nRommel conducted a fighting retreat across Libya towards Tunisia, seeking to preserve as many men and vehicles as possible. Heavy rain and temporary grounding of the Desert Air Force occasionally aided his withdrawal, but the Eighth Army\u2019s pressure, together with Allied control of the air and sea, forced him to abandon much Italian equipment and rely increasingly on improvised combat groups. Kesselring criticised the retreat because each abandoned airfield extended Allied air range, but Rommel argued that any attempt to stand and fight would simply lead to encirclement and destruction of his remaining forces.\nIn Tunisia, Rommel struck at the US II Corps to secure his lines of communication to Tunis, inflicting a sharp defeat at the Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943\u2014his first major engagement against American forces and his last significant battlefield victory. He then turned back to face the Eighth Army behind the old French Mareth Line defences on the Libyan\u2013Tunisian border.\nWhile Rommel was at Kasserine, Italian General Giovanni Messe was appointed commander of Panzer Army Africa, now redesignated the Italo\u2013German Panzer Army. Though nominally replacing Rommel, he deferred to him in practice, and on 23 February Army Group Africa was created with Rommel in overall command, including Messe\u2019s army in the south and General Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim\u2019s German Fifth Panzer Army in northern Tunisia.\nRommel\u2019s final offensive in North Africa came on 6 March 1943, when he attacked the British Eighth Army at the Battle of Medenine with 10th, 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions. Forewarned by Ultra intercepts, Montgomery had sited strong anti-tank defences along the expected axes of advance. After losing 52 tanks in failed assaults, Rommel broke off the attack. On 9 March he returned to Germany to recover his health and report to Hitler; command of Army Group Africa passed to von Arnim, and Rommel did not return to the African theatre.\nItaly 1943.\nOn 23 July 1943, Rommel was moved to Greece as commander of Army Group E to counter a possible British invasion. He arrived in Greece on 25 July but was recalled to Berlin the same day following Mussolini's dismissal from office. This caused the German High Command to review the defensive integrity of the Mediterranean and it was decided Rommel should be posted to Italy as commander of the newly formed Army Group B. On 16 August 1943, Rommel's headquarters moved to Lake Garda in north Italy and he assumed command of the group, consisting of the 44th Infantry Division, the 26th Panzer Division and the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. When Italy announced its armistice with the Allies on 8 September, Rommel's group took part in Operation Achse, disarming the Italian forces.\nHitler met with Rommel and Kesselring on 30 September 1943 to discuss operations in Italy. Rommel insisted on a defensive line north of Rome, while Kesselring was more optimistic and advocated holding a line south of Rome. Hitler preferred Kesselring's recommendation, and therefore revoked his decision for the subordination of Kesselring's forces to Rommel's army group. On 19 October, Hitler decided that Kesselring would be the overall commander of the forces in Italy, sidelining Rommel. Rommel had wrongly predicted that the collapse of the German line in Italy would be fast. On 21 November, Hitler moved Rommel and Army Group B to Normandy in France, with responsibility for defending the coast against the anticipated Western Allied invasion.\nAtlantic Wall 1944.\nIn November 1943 Rommel was appointed General Inspector of the Western Defences, with authority to inspect the Atlantic Wall and recommend improvements. Hitler, who increasingly disagreed with him on military issues, also hoped to use Rommel\u2019s prestige to bolster German morale.\nThere was sharp disagreement in the German high command over how to meet an Allied landing in France. Commander-in-Chief West, Gerd von Rundstedt, favoured holding the armoured reserves inland near Paris for a concentrated counter-attack, repeating the operational methods of 1940 and in line with practice on the Eastern Front. Rommel, drawing on his North African experience of Allied air superiority, believed German armour would be destroyed before it could assemble and argued that the invasion must be defeated on or very close to the beaches. Rundstedt privately told him the Atlantic Wall was largely a propaganda project.\nOn arriving in northern France Rommel was dismayed by the state of the defences. Initially only in an inspection role, he pressed his ideas down the chain of command, but encountered resistance from above until January 1944, when he was given command of Army Group B, controlling the 7th and 15th Armies and a coastal strip from the Zuiderzee to the Loire estuary. The command structure remained fragmented: Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine units answered to their own chiefs, and Rommel needed Hitler\u2019s approval to commit panzer divisions.\nRommel energetically expanded the Atlantic Wall, with millions of mines and extensive beach obstacles, anti-landing stakes (later dubbed Rommel's asparagus), and strengthened strongpoints, including in areas suitable for airborne landings. His staff developed or adapted a wide variety of obstacles to hinder landing craft and armour; Steven Zaloga calls this Rommel\u2019s most important contribution to the defence of Normandy. Shortages of materials, manpower and time meant many positions were unfinished by June 1944, and numerous units were poorly trained or inadequately supplied.\nRundstedt expected the main invasion at the Pas-de-Calais\u2014the shortest route from Britain and closest to Germany. Rommel\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s views shifted, but most senior commanders, influenced by Allied deception operations, ultimately believed that even if landings occurred elsewhere, a second and larger blow would fall in the Calais area. Hitler compromised between the rival strategies, assigning three panzer divisions (2nd, 21st and 116th) to Rommel, four to Rundstedt and others to Army Group G, satisfying no one.\nBad weather in the Channel at the start of June 1944 led German meteorologists to rule out an imminent invasion. On 5 June Rommel travelled to Germany for his wife's fiftieth birthday. When the Allied landings in Normandy began on 6 June, Hitler initially refused to release the armoured reserve, and German commanders hesitated, still suspecting a diversion. Only limited panzer movements were authorised, and heavy Allied air attacks disrupted counter-attacks planned for 7 June. By nightfall on D-Day the Allies had secured five beachheads and landed about 155,000 troops.\nAs the bridgehead expanded despite strong resistance, Rommel concluded that German forces should withdraw out of range of Allied naval guns, regroup and attempt a counter-attack from a shorter line. He persuaded Rundstedt, but both failed to convince Hitler, who insisted the Wehrmacht hold its positions. At a meeting at the Wolfsschlucht II headquarters near Margival on 17 June, Rommel warned Hitler that the front would collapse, but was brusquely told to concentrate on military operations.\nBy mid-July the German position in Normandy was deteriorating rapidly. On 17 July 1944, while returning from a visit to I SS Panzer Corps headquarters, Rommel\u2019s staff car was strafed by Allied fighters near Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery. The driver lost control and crashed; Rommel was thrown from the vehicle and suffered severe head and facial injuries, including three skull fractures, which forced his removal from command. Responsibility for the attack has been variously attributed to pilots Charley Fox, and Johannes Jacobus le Roux.\nPlot against Hitler.\nThe extent of Rommel\u2019s involvement in the military resistance against Hitler and the 20 July plot is disputed, as most conspirators were killed and documentation is fragmentary. One important piece of evidence is a conversation recorded by British intelligence in which Heinrich Eberbach, in captivity, recalled Rommel telling him that Hitler and his closest associates had to be killed as the only way out for Germany, a month before Rommel\u2019s forced suicide. \nFurther evidence comes from the papers of Rudolf Hartmann and Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel, discovered in 2018, which include Hartmann\u2019s account of a meeting between Rommel and St\u00fclpnagel in May 1944 and photographs of a gathering of the resistance inner circle with Rommel at Mareil-Marly. According to Hartmann, by late May Rommel was involved in their plans. In a post-war account, Stuttgart mayor Karl Str\u00f6lin stated that he, St\u00fclpnagel and Alexander von Falkenhausen approached Rommel in early 1944, and Rommel agreed in February to support the resistance.\nOn 15 April 1944 Rommel\u2019s new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced him to St\u00fclpnagel. The conspirators needed an active field marshal and instructed Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle. Late in May, Speidel met former foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath and Str\u00f6lin, who advocated opening surrender negotiations with the Western Allies; Speidel later claimed Rommel agreed to further steps in this direction. \nAt least initially Rommel opposed assassinating Hitler, fearing civil war and a martyr-cult, and instead favoured arrest and trial. He did not attempt to seize Hitler when he visited Margival on 17 June, an operation that would in any case have been highly unlikely to succeed given Hitler\u2019s security and Rommel\u2019s former role in his protection detail. Rommel repeatedly urged Hitler to seek peace with the Western Allies, a stance many historians describe as politically na\u00efve, since the Allies no longer trusted Hitler.\nPost-war, Rommel\u2019s widow Lucie resisted linking her husband to the conspiracy, partly because many Germans continued to view the plotters as traitors. At the time, however, the resistance hoped to harness Rommel\u2019s popularity to win over the army and population. Several contemporaries, including Siegfried Westphal, later recalled Rommel\u2019s refusal to accept further \u201csenseless sacrifices\u201d. According to recollections reported by Butler and others, Rommel told Hitler that if he personally stood in the way of peace he should resign or kill himself, but Hitler insisted on continued resistance. Historians note that Rommel\u2019s blunt demands for political solutions were unusual among senior Wehrmacht officers.\nOn 15 July Rommel wrote to Hitler giving him what he described as a last chance to end hostilities with the Western Allies and urging him to \u201cdraw the proper conclusions without delay\u201d. The letter reached Hitler only after a delay, partly due to Ob. West commander G\u00fcnther von Kluge\u2019s attempts to shield himself and others in the tense days before and after the 20 July plot. Several senior commanders in the West indicated they would support Rommel, while others, such as Erich von Manstein, rejected approaches but did not inform Hitler.\nOn 17 July 1944 Rommel was gravely wounded in an Allied air attack, removing him from command just days before the bomb attempt on Hitler. Many authors consider this a crucial blow to the conspirators, who had hoped to rely on him in the West. After the failure of the 20 July plot, mass arrests followed. Rommel was first implicated when the badly injured St\u00fclpnagel repeatedly muttered his name before attempting suicide; under torture, Caesar von Hofacker also named Rommel as involved. Civilian resistance leader Carl Goerdeler had listed Rommel as a potential Reich President, though this plan was never discussed with him.\nOn 27 September Martin Bormann submitted a memorandum to Hitler stating that St\u00fclpnagel, Hofacker and other defendants had testified that Rommel knew about the assassination plan and had promised to serve the new government. Gestapo surveillance of Rommel\u2019s home in Ulm followed. Historian Peter Lieb identifies Bormann\u2019s memo, Eberbach\u2019s intercepted conversation and the testimonies of surviving resistance members such as Hartmann as the key sources indicating Rommel\u2019s support for the conspiracy, while acknowledging that some, notably Speidel, had strong post-war motives to emphasise their own roles. Other historians stress that, whatever his precise involvement in the bomb plot, Rommel developed his own plan to end the war in the West and sought, increasingly openly, to bring senior commanders over to his side.\nDeath.\nRommel's case was turned over to the \"Court of Military Honour\"\u2014a drumhead court-martial convened to decide the fate of officers involved in the conspiracy. The court included Generalfeldmarschalls Wilhelm Keitel and Gerd von Rundstedt, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian, General der Infanterie Walther Schroth and Generalleutnant Karl-Wilhelm Specht, with General der Infanterie Karl Kriebel and Generalleutnant Heinrich Kirchheim (whom Rommel had fired after Tobruk in 1941) as deputy members and Generalmajor Ernst Maisel as protocol officer. The Court acquired information from Speidel, Hofacker and others that implicated Rommel, with Keitel and Ernst Kaltenbrunner assuming he had taken part. Keitel and Guderian then made the decision that favoured Speidel's case and shifted the blame to Rommel. By normal procedure, this would lead to Rommel's being brought to Roland Freisler's People's Court, a kangaroo court that always decided in favour of the prosecution. However, Hitler knew having Rommel executed as a traitor would damage morale on the home front. He decided to offer Rommel the chance to take his own life.\nTwo generals from Hitler's headquarters, Wilhelm Burgdorf and Ernst Maisel, visited Rommel at his home on 14 October 1944. Burgdorf informed him of the charges and offered him three options: (a) defend himself in front of Hitler in Berlin, or refuse, but this would be taken as admission of guilt; (b) face the People's Court, which would have been tantamount to a death sentence; or (c) choose death by suicide. In (b), his family would have suffered even before the all-but-certain conviction and execution, and his staff would have been arrested and executed as well. In (c), the government would claim he died a hero and bury him with military honours, and his family would receive pensions. In support of the suicide option, Burgdorf had brought a cyanide capsule.\nRommel chose suicide, and explained his decision to his wife and son. Wearing his Afrika Korps jacket and carrying his field marshal's baton, he got into Burgdorf's car, driven by SS-Stabsscharf\u00fchrer Heinrich Doose, and was driven out of the village. After stopping, Doose and Maisel walked away from the car leaving Rommel with Burgdorf. Five minutes later Burgdorf gestured to the two men to return, and Doose noticed Rommel was slumped over. He died before being taken to the Wagner-Schule field hospital. Ten minutes later, the group telephoned Rommel's wife to inform her.\nThe official notice of Rommel's death reported to the public stated he had died of either a heart attack or cerebral embolism\u2014a complication of the skull fractures he had suffered in the strafing of his staff car. To strengthen the story, Hitler ordered a day of mourning. As promised, Rommel was given a state funeral, but it was held in Ulm instead of Berlin, as had been requested by Rommel. Hitler sent Field Marshal Rundstedt, who was unaware Rommel had died as a result of Hitler's orders, as his representative to the funeral. The truth behind Rommel's death became known to the Allies when intelligence officer Charles Marshall interviewed Rommel's widow, as well as from a letter by Rommel's son Manfred in 1945.\nRommel's grave is located in Herrlingen, a short distance west of Ulm. For decades after the anniversary of his death, veterans of the Africa campaign, including former opponents, would gather at his grave.\nStyle as military commander.\nOn the Italian front in the First World War, Rommel developed a preference for fast-moving, mobile operations and bold initiative. He concluded that seizing the momentum and denying the enemy time to regroup was key to victory. Some authors argue that many of his early opponents were second-rate, disorganised or depleted, and that his methods proved less effective against well-led and well-equipped forces later in the Second World War. Others note that throughout his career he often fought while outnumbered and outgunned, sometimes overwhelmingly so, and also had to contend with internal opponents in Germany who hoped for his failure.\nRommel is praised by numerous authors as a gifted and charismatic commander. Basil Liddell Hart described him as a strong leader, worshipped by his troops and respected by his adversaries, and considered him one of the \"Great Captains of History\". Owen Connelly likewise write that \"no better example of military leadership can be found\", citing Friedrich von Mellenthin on the close, almost intuitive understanding between Rommel and his men. Hitler, by contrast, remarked that Rommel was a \"very great leader\" in success but an \"absolute pessimist\" when difficulties arose. Claus Telp criticises him for advancing the careers of his own officers while ignoring or slighting peers in his reports.\nSurprise and psychological pressure were central to Rommel's approach to offensive warfare. He used sandstorms, darkness and rapid manoeuvre to conceal his movements and unsettle the enemy. He was notably aggressive and often directed operations from the front or flew over the battlefield in a reconnaissance aircraft. When the British mounted Operation Flipper deep behind German lines to kill him and his staff before Operation Crusader, Rommel was indignant that they expected to find his headquarters behind the front. His habit of personally intervening at the decisive point of battle could, however, leave him out of touch with the wider situation: Mellenthin cites his counterattack during Operation Crusader as an example. Butler agrees that, although leading from the front inspired his troops, Rommel carried it to such extremes\u2014sometimes directing individual companies or battalions\u2014that communication and coordination suffered and his own life was put at unnecessary risk. Albert Kesselring complained that Rommel \"cruised about the battlefield\" like a divisional or corps commander rather than an army leader, but his staff officers Gause and Westphal argued that in the African desert this methods was often the only way to command effectively. His staff admired his dedication but complained about his austere, almost Spartan lifestyle, which they felt made their tasks harder and reduced his effectiveness.\nDuring the 1940 campaign in France, Rommel's leadership of the 7th Panzer Division attracted both praise and criticism. Officers such as General Georg Stumme, who had previously commanded the division, were impressed by the speed and success of its advance. Others, including his corps commander Kluge, considered his decisions impulsive and accused him of claiming excessive credit, for example by presenting misleading diagrams or failing to acknowledge the contribution of other units, particularly the Luftwaffe. His division took heavy casualties, but in exchange for 2,160 men and 42 tanks lost, it captured more than 100,000 prisoners and destroyed or seized about 450 tanks, vehicles and guns.\nRommel spoke German with a marked southern German, or Swabian, accent and did not belong to the Prussian aristocracy that dominated the German high command, which made him something of an outsider to the traditional power structure. He believed a commander should be physically more robust than his troops and lead by example. He expected his subordinate commanders to display similar stamina.\nPersonally, Rommel was direct, unbending and often brusque with both superiors and subordinates, and he could be disobedient to Hitler when he felt orders were impractical or harmful, while remaining gentle and diplomatic with lower-ranking soldiers. Despite his willingness to work with propaganda photographers and journalists, he was personally shy, introverted and stiff in manner even with his closest aides, judging people primarily on merit. He could, however, show strong loyalty and warmth to a small circle of trusted individuals, including Hitler in the earlier years of their relationship.\nRelationship with Italian forces.\nRommel\u2019s relationship with the Italian high command in North Africa was tense. Although nominally subordinate to them, he exercised wide autonomy and directed both German and Italian formations, creating friction, especially over supplies, which Italian authorities tended to prioritise for their own units. Rommel's blunt style did little to ease matters. Italian commanders, though generally less aggressive than Rommel, were often capable logisticians and artillery tacticians, and their troops\u2014despite poor equipment\u2014were usually well trained. Disputes over supply and priorities were frequent, and Kesselring\u2019s attempt to improve cooperation produced limited success; he later complained that Rommel ignored him much as he ignored the Italians.\nItalian assessments of Rommel varied widely. Some senior officers criticised him or used him as a scapegoat, while others sought to appropriate parts of the Rommel myth; most, however, found his emotional and chaotic leadership difficult to work with. Among rank-and-file troops he enjoyed a stronger reputation and \u201cbecame sort of a myth\u201d. Rommel himself rated Italian soldiers more highly than their leaders and, unlike many German officers, was generally described as \u201ckindly disposed\u201d towards Italians as a people. By contrast, James J. Sadkovich cites cases of Rommel refusing cooperation, abandoning Italian units and blaming them for his own failures, characterising him as \u201carrogantly ethnocentric\u201d.\nViews on the conduct of war.\nCombat.\nMany authors describe Rommel as a chivalrous and professionally minded officer who generally tried to observe the customary laws of war and who won the respect of both his troops and many of his enemies. This reputation has led some commentators to contrast him with more ideologically driven Nazi commanders, though others argue that it forms part of a post-war \"clean Wehrmacht\" image that needs careful scrutiny.\nDuring Operation Achse, the German disarmament of Italian forces after the Armistice of Cassibile in 1943, harsh orders signed by Rommel and Kesselring contributed to brutal behaviour elsewhere. Gerhard Schreiber quotes their directive that \"sentimentality\" towards former Italian allies was misplaced and that those fighting against German troops \"shall experience toughness\". He interprets this as a hate-filled order aimed primarily at Italian soldiers rather than partisans and argues that it helped brutalise the campaign. Remy cautions against taking the order out of context, noting that disarmament in Rommel's sector occurred largely without major bloodshed and that Rommel insisted Italian prisoners be treated on the same footing as German civilians. Peter Lieb similarly concludes that the order did not significantly radicalise the war in Rommel's area of responsibility, although Italian internees were subsequently deported to Germany for forced labour, something Rommel is not believed to have known about. Historian Dennis Showalter comments that Rommel was not directly involved in the anti-partisan war in Italy, but that orders prescribing death for Italian soldiers captured in arms or civilians sheltering escaped prisoners suggest he might not have behaved fundamentally differently from many of his Wehrmacht contemporaries.\nLieb and others argue that Rommel repeatedly refused to carry out illegal orders, most notably Hitler's Commando Order instructing the execution of captured Allied commandos, which he did not pass on to his subordinates. Units under his command reported treating such captives as regular prisoners of war, and it is likely he behaved similarly in North Africa. Historian Szymon Datner suggests that Rommel may have wished to keep Nazi atrocities hidden from the Western Allies. Remy argues that although Rommel heard rumours about massacres while in Africa, his personality and circumstances meant he was not fully confronted with the scale of Nazi crimes until 1944. When he learned of atrocities committed by the \"Leibstandarte\" in Italy in 1943, he reportedly forbade his son from joining the Waffen-SS.\nAttitude toward colonial troops.\nFrench colonial troops were depicted in Nazi propaganda as symbols of French decadence, and several historians argue that Rommel shared some of the racial attitudes common among German officers of his time. Myron Echenberg writes that he, like Hitler, regarded black French soldiers with particular disdain. Ward Rutherford and Vaughn Raspberry present him as considering non-European troops, especially black Africans and Indians, to belong to \"inferior races\" and resenting their use against German forces.\nOther authors emphasise a more complex picture. Bruce Watson notes that whatever racist assumptions Rommel initially brought to the desert war, they eroded when he encountered the effectiveness of units such as the 4th Indian Division, whose fighting qualities he later praised. Initially reluctant to employ Indian volunteers captured from Allied units under his command, he later visited the Indian Legion in France, commended their performance and supported their integration despite prejudice within the Wehrmacht.\nReports from black South African prisoners of war describe Rommel ordering that they be housed and queued for food together with white prisoners, telling them that brave soldiers should be treated alike. Accounts from veterans of the 28th M\u0101ori Battalion suggest that, although Rommel complained that some of their tactics violated European norms, he generally treated captured M\u0101ori soldiers fairly and expressed respect for their combat skills. Historian Ralf Georg Reuth argues that Rommel tried to ensure correct treatment of colonial prisoners within his command, while distancing himself from Hitler's racist war in the East and maintaining an idealised, selective view of the F\u00fchrer.\nReputation as a military commander.\nRommel was famous in his lifetime, including among adversaries. His tactical prowess and decency in the treatment of Allied prisoners earned him the respect of opponents including Claude Auchinleck, Archibald Wavell, George S. Patton, and Bernard Montgomery.\nRommel's military reputation has been controversial. While military practitioners acknowledge Rommel's excellent tactical skills and bravery, some, such as US major general David T. Zabecki, consider Rommel's performance as an operational level commander to be overstated and other officers agree. General Klaus Naumann agrees with historian Charles Messenger that Rommel's violation of the unity of command principle, bypassing chain of command, was unacceptable and contributed to failure in North Africa. Biographer Wolf Heckmann describes Rommel as \"the most overrated commander of an army...\".\nNevertheless, there are many officers who admire his methods, like Norman Schwarzkopf who described Rommel as a genius at battles of movement saying \"Look at Rommel. Look at North Africa, the Arab-Israeli wars, and all the rest of them. A war in the desert is a war of mobility and lethality. It's not a war where straight lines are drawn in the sand and [you] say, 'I will defend here or die.\" Ariel Sharon deemed the military model used by Rommel superior that used by Montgomery. His compatriot Moshe Dayan considered Rommel a model and icon. Wesley Clark states that \"Rommel's military reputation...has lived on, and still sets the standard for a style of daring, charismatic leadership to which most officers aspire.\" During later desert wars, Rommel's theories attracted interest from policymakers and military instructors. Chinese military leader Sun Li-jen had the laudatory nickname \"Rommel of the East\".\nCertain military historians are sceptical of Rommel as an operational, let alone strategic level commander. They point to Rommel's lack of appreciation for Germany's strategic situation, his misunderstanding of the relative importance of his theatre to German High Command, poor grasp of logistical realities, and, according to Ian Beckett, \"penchant for glory hunting\". Citino credits Rommel's limitations as an operational level commander as \"materially contributing\" to the demise of the Axis in Africa, while Addington focuses on the struggle over strategy, whereby Rommel's initial brilliant success resulted in \"catastrophic effects\" for Germany in Africa. Porch highlights Rommel's \"offensive mentality\", symptomatic of Wehrmacht commanders as a whole, that tactical and operational victories would lead to strategic success.\nGeoffrey P. Megargee points out Rommel's playing German and Italian command structures against each other to his advantage. Rommel used the confused structure\u2014the High command of the Wehrmacht, the OKH (Supreme High Command of the Army) and \"Comando Supremo\" (Italian Supreme Command)\u2014to disregard orders he disagreed with, or appeal to whatever authority would be most sympathetic to his requests.\nSome historians take issue with Rommel's absence from Normandy on the day of the Allied invasion. He left France on 5 June and was home on the 6th celebrating his wife's birthday. According to Rommel, he planned to see Hitler the next day to discuss the invasion situation. Zabecki calls his decision to leave the theatre in view of imminent invasion \"an incredible lapse of command responsibility\". Lieb remarks that Rommel displayed mental agility, but the lack of an energetic commander, which caused the battle not to be conducted in his way, though the result was still better than Geyr's plan. Lieb opines that while his harshest critics often said Rommel was overrated or not suitable for higher commands, envy was a big factor.\nT.L. McMahon argues that while Rommel no doubt possessed operational vision, he did not have the strategic resources to effect his operational choices. While his forces provided the tactical ability to accomplish his goals, the German system was designed for commanders who led from the front, and he might have chosen the same options as Montgomery had he been put in the same conditions. Tactical flexibility was an advantage of the German system, but in the final years of the war, Hitler, Himmler and Goering had usurped more authority at the strategic level, leaving professionals like Rommel constrained. Martin Blumenson considers Rommel had a compelling view of strategy and logistics, demonstrated through his many arguments with superiors, although Blumenson thinks that what distinguished Rommel was his boldness, intuitive feel for the battlefield. Schwarzkopf comments \"Rommel had a feel for the battlefield like no other...\"\nJoseph Forbes comments: \"The complex, conflict-filled interaction between Rommel and his superiors over logistics, objectives and priorities should not be used to detract from Rommel's reputation as a remarkable military leader\", because Rommel was not given powers over logistics, and because if only generals who attain strategic goals are great, such highly regarded commanders as Robert E. Lee, Hannibal, Charles XII would be excluded. General Siegfried Storbeck of the Bundeswehr, remarks that, Rommel's leadership style and offensive thinking, although carrying risks like losing overview of the situation and creating overlapping authority, have been proved effective, and been analysed and incorporated in the training of officers by \"us, our Western allies, the Warsaw Pact, and even the Israel Defense Forces\". Maurice Remy defends his strategic decision regarding Malta as, although risky, the only logical choice.\nRommel was among the few Axis commanders targeted for assassination by Allied planners. Two attempts were made, the first was Operation Flipper in North Africa in 1941, and the second was Operation Gaff in Normandy in 1944. Research by Norman Ohler claims Rommel's behaviour was heavily influenced by Pervitin which he took in heavy doses. Ohler refers to him as \"the Crystal Fox\"\u2014playing off the nickname \"Desert Fox\".\nDebate about atrocities.\nExecutions of prisoners and forced labour in France.\nRommel ordered the execution of a French officer who refused three times to cooperate when taken prisoner; accounts differ on whether this was justified. Caddick-Adams argues that this episode, which Rommel himself described, would make him a war criminal condemned by his own hand and notes that many authors overlook it. Petitfr\u00e8re regards the act as debatable but stresses that Rommel was in a hurry and unwilling to waste time in argument.\nRaffael Scheck points out that, although no direct evidence implicates Rommel personally, his 7th Panzer Division operated in areas where massacres of black French prisoners of war were frequent, and contemporary sources show that such killings were part of a wider pattern of Wehrmacht violence. Daniel Butler considers it possible that killings occurred in actions such as Le Quesnoy, but argues that existing evidence does not prove Rommel ordered or condoned them and that his own wording about enemy troops being \"wiped out or forced to withdraw\" has been overinterpreted. Rommel later protested the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre.\nConstruction of the Atlantic Wall was formally the responsibility of the Organisation Todt, but Rommel took a close interest in strengthening the defences. He objected to the use of slave labour and suggested that French civilians should be recruited and paid proper wages, yet in practice French civilians and Italian prisoners of war were also forced by Vichy authorities, the Todt Organisation and SS units to work on defences he requested, often in very harsh conditions.\nTreatment of Jews and other civilians in North Africa.\nRolf-Dieter M\u00fcller notes that the desert war, although bloody, differed from the genocidal campaign in eastern Europe, as fighting was concentrated along a narrow coastal strip and affected fewer civilians. Dennis Showalter observes that both sides initially tried to wage a comparatively \"clean\" war, a 'war without hate', as Rommel put it in his reflections. Showalter cites the relative absence of civilians and Nazi political units, and the dominance of pre-war professional officers, though he stresses this did not mean the campaign was free of brutality. \nPatrick Bernhard argues that the North African campaign was \"anything but war without hate\", documenting rapes, ill-treatment and executions of prisoners, racially motivated killings of Arabs, Berbers and Jews, and the establishment of labour and detention camps. He shows that anti-Jewish and anti-Arab violence increased when Rommel and Ettore Bastico regained territory in 1941 and 1942, and that German officers representing Rommel urged Italian authorities to use whatever measures were necessary to suppress resistance in the rear areas. According to Bernhard, Rommel did not intervene against reprisals and thus became complicit in war crimes by effectively granting a free hand to Italian forces. Gershom Gorenberg similarly concludes that whether Rommel\u2019s motivation was ideological or purely pragmatic, his demand for quiet rear areas enabled hangings and other abuses.\nOther historians emphasise the wider institutional context. Joachim K\u00e4ppner and Richard J. Evans note that units of the Afrika Korps and other German forces in North Africa committed war crimes, including the rape of Jewish women and killings linked to the broader framework of the Holocaust. Christopher Gabel cautions that attempts to portray Rommel as a war criminal solely by association have not produced clear evidence of his direct knowledge of specific atrocities. The documentary \"Rommels Krieg\" similarly concludes that, even if Rommel was unaware of particular crimes, his military successes created the conditions for forced labour, torture and robbery and thus formed part of Hitler's ideological war. Hein Klemann argues that Afrika Korps requisitions and confiscations in its \"foraging zone\" endangered the survival of local civilians in a manner comparable to Wehrmacht economic practices in eastern Europe.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum describes Rommel\u2019s relationship to the proposed Einsatzkommando Egypt as \"problematic\". An SS unit under Walter Rauff was to be attached to his command to murder Jews in North Africa and Palestine should German forces advance into the Middle East. Rommel\u2019s staff were visited by Rauff in 1942, and Rommel was aware that such planning was underway, although the Einsatzkommando was never activated and smaller SS detachments carried out killings independently. \nKlaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin C\u00fcppers discuss a post-war CIA report that portrays Rommel as having angrily rejected Rauff\u2019s proposals, but they argue that the meeting described could not have taken place as stated, since Rommel and Rauff were in different locations at the time. Rauff\u2019s unit was later redirected to Greece and then withdrawn to Germany as the Axis position in Africa deteriorated. Jean-Christoph Caron finds no evidence that Rommel knew of, or would have supported, the SS mission, and concludes that he bore no direct responsibility for SS looting of Jewish property in Tunisia. Haim Saadon and others argue that Rauff\u2019s surviving papers point primarily to plans for forced labour rather than systematic extermination, and that by the time labour camps were fully established in Tunisia Rommel was already in retreat and had no contact with the Einsatzkommando. A \"Haaretz\" investigation, drawing on additional declassified material, accepts that Rommel probably objected to Rauff\u2019s proposals and suggests that his attitude may have somewhat moderated German policy towards Jews and other civilians in North Africa.\nMarvin Perry and Jan Friedmann note that the Axis bridgehead in Tunisia enabled the creation of a network of forced-labour camps where around 2,500 Tunisian Jews died during six months of German rule, with regular Wehrmacht units also involved in abuses. Caddick-Adams and Ben H. Shepherd emphasise that most SS activity in Tunisia took place when Rommel was already withdrawing and that no Waffen-SS units served directly under his command in Africa. Wolfgang M\u00e4hrle argues that Rommel's role as a \"Generalfeldmarschall\" in a criminal war is undeniable, but that this alone does not fully define his personal attitudes or all of his actions.\nMartin Kitchen suggests that the Afrika Korps\u2019 reputation was partly shaped by circumstance: the sparsely populated desert limited opportunities for ethnic cleansing; German forces never reached the large Jewish communities of Egypt and Palestine; and in Tunisia and Tripolitania the Italian authorities often constrained German efforts against Jews who were Italian citizens. Nevertheless, many North African Jews later believed that Rommel\u2019s failure to break through to Egypt and Palestine had spared them from the \"Final Solution\". Curtis and Remy estimate that around 120,000 Jews lived in Algeria, 200,000 in Morocco and about 80,000 in Tunisia during the war; of these, several thousand were subjected to forced labour and other forms of persecution, particularly in Tunisia and Libya.\nSome authors highlight cases where Rommel appears to have opposed or ignored Nazi racial policy. Shepherd notes that he complained to Italian authorities about indiscriminate reprisals against Arabs, arguing that punishing civilians without identifying the perpetrators was neither just nor militarily useful. Several sources state that he refused to implement Hitler\u2019s directives to kill Jewish prisoners of war. Bryan Mark Rigg argues that the Afrika Korps was relatively lenient in applying racial laws to soldiers of partial Jewish descent, citing officers such as Horst von Oppenfeld and Fritz Bayerlein who served under Rommel without being dismissed, although he concedes that this may also reflect gaps in enforcement rather than deliberate protection.\nAlleged treasure and spoils.\nStories linking Rommel to the plunder of Jewish property in Tunisia are often grouped under the label \"Rommel's treasure\" or \"Rommel's gold\". Michael FitzGerald and Jean-Christoph Caron argue that such stories are better described as \"Rauff's gold\": SS units under Walter Rauff looted Jewish property in Tunisia, and later rumours placed part of this loot in Corsica, where Rauff served in 1943, but there is no evidence that Rommel was involved. According to Caron and J\u00f6rg M\u00fcllner, the legend originated with an SS veteran who produced a false treasure map after the war; Rommel's name became attached simply because of his fame as commander in North Africa.\nRick Atkinson criticises Rommel for accepting a looted stamp collection and a villa taken from Jewish owners. Other authors note that Rommel reacted angrily when he discovered SS looting and abuses in Italy and that the villa in question was only made available to his family after their own house had been destroyed, without being transferred to their ownership. Rommel was one of the few senior officers who declined the large landed estates and cash gifts with which Hitler rewarded many of his generals.\nIn Nazi and Allied propaganda.\nIn the beginning, although Hitler and Goebbels took notice of Rommel, the elites had no intention of creating one war hero, partly out of fear he would offset Hitler, generating propaganda campaigns for not only Rommel but also Gerd von Rundstedt, Walther von Brauchitsch, Eduard Dietl, Sepp Dietrich. Nevertheless, several factors\u2014including Rommel's unusual charisma, his talents in military matters and public relations, the efforts of Goebbels's propaganda machine, and the Allies' participation in mythologising him (either for political benefits, sympathy for someone who evoked a romantic archetype, or genuine admiration for his actions)\u2014gradually contributed to Rommel's fame. Spiegel wrote, \"Even back then his fame outshone that of all other commanders.\"\nRommel's victories in France were featured in the German press and the February 1941 film \"Sieg im Westen (Victory in the West),\" in which Rommel helped direct a segment reenacting the crossing of the Somme River. Although there is no evidence of Rommel committing crimes, during shooting of the movie, African prisoners of war, were forced to take part in its making, and carry out humiliating acts. Stills from the re-enactment are found in the \"Rommel Collection\"; it was filmed by Hans Ertl, assigned to this task by Kurt Hesse, a friend of Rommel, who worked for Wehrmacht Propaganda Section V. Rommel's victories in 1941 were played up by Nazi propaganda, even though his successes in Africa were in one of Germany's least important theatres. In November 1941, Goebbels wrote about \"the urgent need\" to have Rommel \"elevated to a kind of popular hero.\" Rommel, with his innate abilities as a commander and love of the spotlight, was a perfect fit for the role Goebbels designed.\nSuccesses in North Africa.\nRommel received help in cultivating his image from Alfred Ingemar Berndt, an official at the Reich Propaganda Ministry who had volunteered for military service. Seconded by Goebbels, Berndt was assigned to Rommel's staff and became a close aides. Berndt acted as a liaison between Rommel, the Propaganda Ministry, and the F\u00fchrer Headquarters. He directed Rommel's photo shoots and filed radio dispatches describing the battles.\nIn the spring of 1941, Rommel's name began to appear in the British media. In the autumn of 1941 and that winter, he was mentioned almost daily. Toward the end of the year, the Reich propaganda machine used Rommel's successes in Africa as a diversion from the Wehrmacht's challenging situation with the stall of Operation Barbarossa. The American press soon began to take notice of Rommel, following the country's entry into the war in December 1941, writing that \"The British...admire him because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general.\" General Auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel the notion that Rommel was a \"superman\". Rommel, no matter how hard the situation was, made an effort to spend time with soldiers and patients, his own and POWs, which contributed greatly to his reputation of not only being a great commander but \"a decent chap\".\nThe attention of the Western press thrilled Goebbels, who wrote in his diary in early 1942: \"Rommel continues to be the recognized darling of even the enemies' news agencies.\" The Field Marshal was pleased by the media attention, although he knew the downsides. Hitler took note of the British propaganda, commenting in summer 1942 that Britain's leaders must have hoped \"to be able to explain their defeat to their own nation more easily by focusing on Rommel\".\nRommel was the commander most frequently covered in German media and the only one to be given a press conference, in October 1942. It was moderated by Goebbels and attended by domestic and foreign media. Rommel declared: \"Today we (...) have the gates of Egypt in hand, and with the intent to act!\" Keeping the focus on Rommel distracted the public from Wehrmacht losses elsewhere as the tide of the war turned. He became a symbol to reinforce the public's faith in ultimate Axis victory.\nMilitary reverses.\nIn the wake of the successful British offensive in November 1942 and other military reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until spring 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. To ensure the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel, Goebbels had the Army High Command announce in May 1943 that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress with Rommel at the helm. After the radio programme ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.\nAlthough Rommel then entered a period without a significant command, he remained a household name in Germany, synonymous with the aura of invincibility. Hitler made Rommel part of his defensive strategy for Fortress Europe by sending him to inspect the Atlantic Wall. Goebbels supported the decision, noting in his diary that Rommel was \"undoubtedly the suitable man\". The propaganda minister expected the move to reassure the German public and have a negative impact on the Allied forces' morale.\nIn France, a Wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for domestic and foreign audiences. In May 1944 German newsreels reported on Rommel's speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that \"every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland.\" The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.\nWhen Rommel was seriously wounded in July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry attempted to conceal this so as not to undermine morale. Despite this, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumours of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at a 1 August press conference. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much Reich propaganda was using him.\nRommel's views on propaganda.\nRommel was interested in propaganda beyond the promotion of his image. In 1944, after visiting Rommel in France and reading his proposals on counteracting Allied propaganda, Alfred-Ingemar Berndt remarked: \"He is also interested in this propaganda business and wants to develop it by all means. He has even thought and brought out practical suggestions for each program and subject.\"\nRommel saw the propaganda and education values in his and his nation's deeds. He also did value justice; according to Admiral Ruge's diary, Rommel told Ruge: \"Justice is the indispensable foundation of a nation. Unfortunately, the higher-ups are not clean. The slaughterings are grave sins.\" The key to successfully creating an image, according to Rommel, was leading by example: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The men tend to feel no kind of contact with a commander who, they know, is sitting somewhere in headquarters. What they want is what might be termed a physical contact with him. In moments of panic, fatigue, or disorganization, or when something out of the ordinary has to be demanded from them, the personal example of the commander works wonders, especially if he has had the wit to create some sort of legend around himself. He urged Axis authorities to treat the Arab with the utmost respect to prevent uprisings behind the front. He protested the use of propaganda at the cost of explicit military benefits though, criticising Hitler's headquarters for being unable to tell the German people and the world that El Alamein had been lost and preventing evacuation of the German forces in Northern Africa in the process. Ruge suggests that his chief treated his own fame as a kind of weapon.\nIn 1943, he surprised Hitler by proposing a Jew should be made into a \"Gauleiter\" to prove to the world that Germany was innocent of accusations that Rommel had heard from the enemy regarding the mistreatment of Jews. Hitler replied, \"Dear Rommel, you understand nothing about my thinking at all.\"\nRelationship with Nazism.\nRommel was not a Nazi Party member, but like many \"Wehrmacht\" officers welcomed the Nazi rise to power. He quickly developed a close, if complicated, relationship with Hitler. Rommel was one of Hitler's favourite generals and benefitted from the dictator\u2019s patronage throughout his inter-war and wartime career. Historians such as Robert Citino describe him as \u201cnot apolitical\u201d, noting that Rommel owed much of his rapid rise to Hitler\u2019s favour, a view shared by Messenger. Kesselring characterised Rommel\u2019s influence over Hitler as \u201chypnotic\u201d. In 1944 Rommel told Ruge and his wife that Hitler possessed an irresistible \u201cmagnetic\u201d aura. According to Remy, their relationship became personal in 1939 when Rommel proudly recounted that he had \u201csort of forced Hitler to go with me\u201d to the Hradschin Castle in an open car, without bodyguards, under his protection\u2014an episode Hitler \u201cwould never forget\u201d.\nThe close relationship continued after the 1940 campaign. Hitler praised a diary Rommel prepared on the 7th Division, though Speer recalled that Hitler was irritated by Rommel\u2019s vague battlefield reports. Remy argues the relationship resembled a \u201cdream marriage\u201d until cracks appeared in 1942, eventually turning into what Ernst J\u00fcnger later called a \u201c\"Ha\u00dfliebe\"\u201d. Rommel\u2019s letters reveal fluctuating emotions: disgust at atrocities and mounting pessimism offset by enthusiasm whenever Hitler visited. Hitler displayed a similar ambivalence. He valued Rommel\u2019s energy, spoke to him frequently about technical matters, and continued to seek his advice even as Rommel\u2019s disobedience strained their relationship. Remy and \"Der Spiegel\" remark that Rommel\u2019s later statement\u2014\u201cOnce I have loved the F\u00fchrer, and I still do\u201d\u2014was genuine, while Watson notes that Rommel believed he deserved death for his role in the conspiracy against Hitler.\nRommel accepted the propaganda campaigns built around him and benefitted from them. Naumann notes that the regime used him to create a myth, which Rommel tolerated due to ambition and vanity. Although he wished to remain \u201ca man of the troops\u201d, and disliked political manoeuvring, he showed interest in aspects of Nazi ideology, including the *Volksgemeinschaft* and the idea of a \u201ccommon man\u201d general elevated by merit. Butler describes his politics as centrist, with mild leanings to the left.\nHistorians disagree on when and how far Rommel broke with Hitler. Messenger argues that Rommel\u2019s attitude changed only after recognising the war was lost following the Allied invasion of Normandy, while Remy believes Rommel never truly severed emotional ties but opposed Hitler when conscience demanded. Lieb notes that it is uncertain whether strategic defeat alone motivated Rommel\u2019s desire to switch sides. Remy highlights a turning point in July 1943, when Hitler told Rommel that should Germany lose, the German people \u201ccould rot\u201d; thereafter Rommel considered it fortunate that his Afrika Korps was safe as POWs. \"Die Welt\" later suggested that Hitler had favoured Rommel precisely because his non-Party status allowed him to appear \u201cclean\u201d.\nRommel\u2019s political inclinations were controversial among Nazi elites. While he supported some elements of Nazi ideology and cooperated with propaganda, he objected when media falsely portrayed him as an early Party member or son of a mason. Goebbels nonetheless insisted Rommel was \u201cideologically sound\u201d. As defeat loomed, Hitler and Goebbels attempted unsuccessfully to find another general who could match Rommel\u2019s energy and influence. Even after learning of Rommel\u2019s involvement in the plot against him, Hitler initially considered retiring him rather than executing him. Rommel\u2019s refusal to publicly deny the accusations contributed to his forced suicide.\nSeveral episodes have been cited as evidence of Rommel\u2019s political naivety. After German forces murdered his wife\u2019s uncle, Edmund Roszczynialski, in occupied Poland, Rommel\u2014apparently failing to grasp the implications\u2014wrote repeated letters to Himmler\u2019s adjutants asking that he be looked after. In 1943 he suggested that a Jewish \"Gauleiter\" be appointed, which scholars interpret as a sign he misunderstood the nature of Nazi antisemitism. Lieb doubts that a commander of Rommel\u2019s rank could have been unaware of Nazi atrocities, and \"Der Spiegel\" has described him as in denial about the crimes of the regime. Searle argues that early, largely bloodless Nazi successes allowed Rommel to sustain a favourable image of Hitler, while Scheck cautions that it may never be possible to determine how far he understood the regime\u2019s criminal nature.\nRommel myth.\nAccording to revisionist authors, an assessment of Rommel's role in history has been hampered by views formed for political reasons, creating what historians have called the \"Rommel myth\". The interpretation considered by some historians to be a myth is the depiction of the Field Marshal as an apolitical, brilliant commander and victim of Nazi Germany who participated in the 20 July plot against Hitler. There are authors who refer to \"Rommel Myth\" or \"Rommel Legend\" in a neutral or positive manner, though. The seeds of the myth can be found first in Rommel's drive for success as a young officer in World War I and in his popular 1937 book \"Infantry Attacks,\" which was written in a style that diverged from other military literature and became a best-seller.\nThe myth then took shape during the opening years of World War II, as a component of Nazi propaganda to praise the Wehrmacht and instil optimism in the public, with Rommel's willing participation. When Rommel came to North Africa, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British press, as the Allies sought to explain their inability to defeat the Axis in North Africa. British military and political figures contributed to the heroic image of Rommel, when he resumed offensive operations in January 1942 against British forces weakened by redeployments to the Far East. During parliamentary debate following the fall of Tobruk, Churchill described Rommel as an \"extraordinary bold and clever opponent\" and \"great field commander\".\nAccording to \"Der Spiegel\" following the war's end, West Germany yearned for father figures to replace the former ones who had been unmasked as criminals. Rommel was chosen because he embodied the decent soldier, cunning yet fair-minded, and if guilty by association, not so guilty he became unreliable, and comrades reported that he was close to the Resistance. While everyone else was disgraced, his star became brighter than ever, and he made the unprecedented leap over the threshold between eras: from Hitler's favourite general to the young republic's hero. Cornelia Hecht notes that despite the change of times, Rommel has become the symbol of different regimes and concepts, which is paradoxical, whoever the man he really was.\nThe Western Allies, and particularly the British, depicted Rommel as the \"good German\". His reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the West German rearmament and reconciliation between former enemies\u2014Britain and the US on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other. When Rommel's alleged involvement in the plot to kill Hitler became known after the war, his stature was enhanced in the eyes of former adversaries. Rommel was often cited in Western sources as a patriotic German willing to stand up to Hitler. Churchill wrote about him in 1950: \"[Rommel] (...) deserves our respect because, although a loyal German soldier, he came to hate Hitler and all his works and took part in the conspiracy of 1944 to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant.\"\nFamily life.\nWhile at Cadet School in 1911, Rommel became engaged to 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894\u20131971). While stationed in Weingarten in 1913, Rommel developed a relationship with Walburga Stemmer, which produced a daughter, Gertrud, in December 1913. Because of elitism in the officer corps, Stemmer's working-class background made her unsuitable as an officer's wife, and Rommel felt honour-bound to uphold his commitment to Mollin. With Mollin's cooperation, he accepted financial responsibility for the child. Rommel and Mollin were married in 1916 in Danzig. Rommel's marriage was happy, and he wrote his wife at least one letter every day while he was in the field.\nAfter the First World War, the couple settled in Stuttgart, and Stemmer and her child lived with them. Gertrud was referred to as Rommel's niece, a fiction that went unquestioned because of the many women widowed during the war. Walburga died suddenly in 1928, commiting suicide as Lucia was pregnant. Gertrud remained a member of the household until Rommel's death in 1944. The incident with Walburga affected Rommel for the rest of his life: he would keep women distant. A son, Manfred Rommel, was born on 24 December 1928, and served as Mayor of Stuttgart from 1974 to 1996.\nCommemoration.\nThe German Army's largest base, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf, is named in his honour; at the dedication in 1961, his widow Lucie and son Manfred were guests of honour. The Rommel Barracks, Dornstadt, was named for him in 1965. A third base, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Osterode, closed in 2004. The was named for him in 1969, christened by his widow, and decommissioned in 1998.\nThe Rommel Memorial was erected in Heidenheim in 1961. In 2020, a sculpture of a landmine victim was placed next to it. The mayor Bernhard Ilg commented that, regarding \"the great son of Heidenheim\", \"there are many opinions\". Heidenheim eventually dedicated the Memorial towards a stand against war, militarism and extremism, stating that when the memorial was erected, statements were added that now are incompatible with modern knowledge about Rommel. Rommel's troops laid down landmines, and since statistics started in the 1980s, it is claimed 3,300 people have lost their lives, and 7,500 have been maimed due to these. It is disputed whether the landmines in El Alamein, the most notable portion of landmines left over, were left by the Afrika Korps or the British.\nIn Aalen, after a discussion on renaming a street named after him, a new place of commemoration was created, where stelae with information on Rommel and opponents of the regime stand together. The History Association of Aalen, together with a commission of historians from D\u00fcsseldorf, welcomes the keeping of the street's name and notes that Rommel was neither a war criminal nor resistance fighter, but a perpetrator and victim \u2013 he willingly served as figurehead for the regime, then recognised his mistake and paid with his life. An education program named \"Erwin Rommel and Aalen\" for schoolchildren in Aalen is aestablished.\nIn 2021, the Student Council of the University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg changed the name of their S\u00fcd-Campus into Rommel-Campus, emphasising that the city of Erlangen stands behind the name and the university needs to do the same. The university's branch of the Education and Science Workers' Union describes the decision as problematic considering Rommel's history of supporting the Nazi regime.\nNumerous streets in Germany, especially in Rommel's home state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, are named in his honour, including the street near his last home. The Rommel Museum opened in 1989 in the Villa Lindenhof in Herrlingen. It now operates under the name Museum Lebenslinien (Lifelines Museum), which presents the lives of Rommel and other notable residents of Herrlingen. There is a Rommel Museum in Mersa Matruh in Egypt which opened in 1977, and is located in one of Rommel's former headquarters; various other localities and establishments in Mersa Matruh, including Rommel Beach, are also named for Rommel. The reason for the naming is that he respected the Bedouins' traditions and sanctity of their homes (he kept his troops at least 2 kilometres from their houses) and refused to poison the wells against the Allies, fearing it would harm the population.\nIn Italy, the annual marathon tour \"Rommel Trail\", celebrates Rommel and the Battle of Caporetto.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "9518", "revid": "48802843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9518", "title": "Edmund Husserl", "text": "Austrian-German philosopher (1859\u20131938)\nEdmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl (; 8 April 1859 \u2013 27 April 1938) was an Austrian-German philosopher and mathematician who established the school of phenomenology.\nIn his early work, he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic based on analyses of intentionality. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl's thought profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.\nHusserl studied mathematics, taught by Karl Weierstrass and Leo K\u00f6nigsberger, and philosophy taught by Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. He taught philosophy as a \"Privatdozent\" at Halle from 1887, then as professor, first at G\u00f6ttingen from 1901, then at Freiburg from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive. In 1933, under racial laws of the Nazi Party, Husserl was banned from using the library of the University of Freiburg due to his Jewish family background and months later resigned from the Deutsche Akademie. Following an illness, he died in Freiburg in 1938.\nLife and career.\nYouth and education.\nHusserl was born in 1859 in Pro\u00dfnitz in the Margraviate of Moravia in the Austrian Empire (today Prost\u011bjov in the Czech Republic). He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children. His father was a milliner. His childhood was spent in Prost\u011bjov, where he attended the secular primary school. Then Husserl traveled to Vienna to study at the \"Realgymnasium\" there, followed next by the Staatsgymnasium in Olm\u00fctz.\nAt the University of Leipzig from 1876 to 1878, Husserl studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy. At Leipzig, he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by Wilhelm Wundt, one of the founders of modern psychology. Then he moved to the Frederick William University of Berlin (the present-day Humboldt University of Berlin) in 1878, where he continued his study of mathematics under Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass. In Berlin, he found a mentor in Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk (then a former philosophy student of Franz Brentano and later the first president of Czechoslovakia) and attended Friedrich Paulsen's philosophy lectures. In 1881, he left for the University of Vienna to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of Leo K\u00f6nigsberger (a former student of Weierstrass). At Vienna in 1883, he obtained his PhD with the work \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Variationsrechnung\" (\"Contributions to the Calculus of variations\").\nEvidently, as a result of his becoming familiar with the New Testament during his twenties, Husserl asked to be baptized into the Lutheran Church in 1886. Husserl's father, Adolf, had died in 1884. Herbert Spiegelberg writes, \"While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience.\" At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral \"renewal\". Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational \"autonomy\" in all things, Husserl could also speak \"about his vocation and even about his mission under God's will to find new ways for philosophy and science,\" observes Spiegelberg.\nFollowing his PhD in mathematics, Husserl returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to Karl Weierstrass. Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy. Then Weierstrass became very ill. Husserl became free to return to Vienna, where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to philosophy. In 1884, at the University of Vienna he attended the lectures of Franz Brentano on philosophy and philosophical psychology. Brentano introduced him to the writings of Bernard Bolzano, Hermann Lotze, J. Stuart Mill, and David Hume. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e.g., with regard to intentionality. Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed Carl Stumpf, a former student of Brentano, to the University of Halle, seeking to obtain his habilitation which would qualify him to teach at the university level. There, under Stumpf's supervision, he wrote his habilitation thesis, \"\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl\" (\"On the Concept of Number\"), in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, \"Philosophie der Arithmetik\" (1891).\nIn 1887, Husserl married Malvine Steinschneider, a union that would last over fifty years. In 1892, their daughter Elizabeth was born, in 1893 their son Gerhart, and in 1894 their son Wolfgang. Elizabeth would marry in 1922, and Gerhart in 1923; Wolfgang, however, became a casualty of the First World War. Gerhart would become a philosopher of law, contributing to the subject of comparative law, teaching in the United States and after the war in Austria.\nProfessor of philosophy.\nFollowing his marriage, Husserl began his long teaching career in philosophy. He started in 1887 as a \"Privatdozent\" at the University of Halle. In 1891, he published his \"Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen\" which, drawing on his prior studies in mathematics and philosophy, proposed a psychological context as the basis of mathematics. It drew the adverse notice of Gottlob Frege, who criticized its psychologism.\nIn 1901, Husserl with his family moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he taught as \"extraordinarius professor\". Just prior to this, a major work of his, \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (Halle, 1900\u20131901), was published. Volume One contains seasoned reflections on \"pure logic\" in which he carefully refutes \"psychologism\". This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by Wilhelm Dilthey; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey. Two years later, in Italy, he paid a visit to Franz Brentano, his inspiring old teacher, and to the mathematician Constantin Carath\u00e9odory. Kant and Descartes were also now influencing his thought. In 1910, he became joint editor of the journal \"Logos\". During this period, Husserl had delivered lectures on \"internal time consciousness\", which several decades later his former students Edith Stein and Martin Heidegger edited for publication.\nIn 1912, in Freiburg, the journal \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung\" (\"Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research\") was founded by Husserl and his school, which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930. His important work \"Ideen\" was published in its first issue (Vol. 1, Issue 1, 1913). Before beginning \"Ideen\", Husserl's thought had reached the stage where \"each subject is 'presented' to itself, and to each all others are 'presentiated' (\"Vergegenw\u00e4rtigung\"), not as parts of nature but as pure consciousness\". \"Ideen\" advanced his transition to a \"transcendental interpretation\" of phenomenology, a view later criticized by, among others, Jean-Paul Sartre. In \"Ideen\" Paul Ric\u0153ur sees the development of Husserl's thought as leading \"from the psychological cogito to the transcendental cogito\". As phenomenology further evolves, it leads (when viewed from another vantage point in Husserl's 'labyrinth') to \"transcendental subjectivity\". Also in \"Ideen\" Husserl explicitly elaborates the phenomenological and eidetic reductions. Ivan Ilyin and Karl Jaspers visited Husserl at G\u00f6ttingen.\nIn October 1914, both his sons were sent to fight on the Western Front of World War I, and the following year, one of them, Wolfgang Husserl, was badly injured. On 8 March 1916, on the battlefield of Verdun, Wolfgang was killed in action. The next year, his other son, Gerhart Husserl was wounded in the war but survived. His own mother, Julia, died. In November 1917, one of his outstanding students and later a noted philosophy professor in his own right, Adolf Reinach, was killed in the war while serving in Flanders.\nHusserl had transferred in 1916 to the University of Freiburg (in Freiburg im Breisgau) where he continued bringing his work in philosophy to fruition, now as a full professor. Edith Stein served as his personal assistant during his first few years in Freiburg, followed later by Martin Heidegger from 1920 to 1923. The mathematician Hermann Weyl began corresponding with him in 1918. Husserl gave four lectures on the phenomenological method at University College London in 1922. The University of Berlin in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. In 1926, Heidegger dedicated his book \"Sein und Zeit\" (\"Being and Time\") to him \"in grateful respect and friendship.\" Husserl remained in his professorship at Freiburg until he requested retirement, teaching his last class on 25 July 1928. A \"Festschrift\" to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 April 1929.\nDespite retirement, Husserl gave several notable lectures. The first, at Paris in 1929, led to \"M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes\" (Paris 1931). Husserl here reviews the phenomenological epoch\u00e9 (or phenomenological reduction), presented earlier in his pivotal \"Ideen\" (1913), in terms of a further reduction of experience to what he calls a 'sphere of ownness.' From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental ego finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad. This 'a priori' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental intersubjectivity, which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings. There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject. One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the \"Cartesian Meditations\" itself becomes transcendent. It remains, however, alone (unconnected). Only the ego's grasp \"by analogy\" of the Other (e.g., by conjectural reciprocity) allows the possibility for an 'objective' intersubjectivity, and hence for community.\nIn 1933, the racial laws of the new National Socialist German Workers Party were enacted. On 6 April Husserl was banned from using the library at the University of Freiburg, or any other academic library; the following week, after a public outcry, he was reinstated. Yet his colleague Heidegger was elected Rector of the university on 21\u201322 April, and joined the Nazi Party. By contrast, in July Husserl resigned from the Deutsche Akademie.\nLater, Husserl lectured at Prague in 1935 and Vienna in 1936, which resulted in a very differently styled work that, while innovative, is no less problematic: \"Die Krisis\" (Belgrade 1936). Husserl describes here the cultural crisis gripping Europe, then approaches a philosophy of history, discussing Galileo, Descartes, several British philosophers, and Kant. The apolitical Husserl before had specifically avoided such historical discussions, pointedly preferring to go directly to an investigation of consciousness. Merleau-Ponty and others question whether Husserl here does not undercut his own position, in that Husserl had attacked in principle historicism, while specifically designing his phenomenology to be rigorous enough to transcend the limits of history. On the contrary, Husserl may be indicating here that historical traditions are merely features given to the pure ego's intuition, like any other. A longer section follows on the \"lifeworld\" [\"Lebenswelt\"], one not observed by the objective logic of science, but a world seen through subjective experience. Yet a problem arises similar to that dealing with 'history' above, a chicken-and-egg problem. Does the lifeworld contextualize and thus compromise the gaze of the pure ego, or does the phenomenological method nonetheless raise the ego up transcendent? These last writings presented the fruits of his professional life. Since his university retirement, Husserl had \"worked at a tremendous pace, producing several major works.\"\nAfter suffering a fall in the autumn of 1937, the philosopher became ill with pleurisy. Edmund Husserl died in Freiburg on 27 April 1938, having just turned 79. His wife, Malvine, survived him. Eugen Fink, his research assistant, delivered his eulogy. Gerhard Ritter was the only Freiburg faculty member to attend the funeral, as an anti-Nazi protest.\nHeidegger and the Nazi era.\nHusserl was rumoured to have been denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation of April 1933. Relatedly, among other disabilities, Husserl was unable to publish his works in Nazi Germany [see above footnote to \"Die Krisis\" (1936)]. It was also rumoured that his former pupil Martin Heidegger informed Husserl that he was discharged, but it was actually the previous rector.\nApparently, Husserl and Heidegger had moved apart during the 1920s, which became clearer after 1928 when Husserl retired and Heidegger succeeded to his university chair. In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed: e.g., Heidegger substituted \"Dasein\" [\"Being-there\"] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl. Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of Max Scheler, were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various \"Kant Societies\" in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled \"Ph\u00e4nomenologie und Anthropologie\".\nIn the wartime 1941 edition of Heidegger's primary work, \"Being and Time\" (\"\", first published in 1927), the original dedication to Husserl was removed. This was not due to a negation of the relationship between the two philosophers, however, but rather was the result of a suggested censorship by Heidegger's publisher who feared that the book might otherwise be banned by the Nazi regime. The dedication can still be found in a footnote on page 38, thanking Husserl for his guidance and generosity. Husserl had died three years earlier. In post-war editions of \"Sein und Zeit\" the dedication to Husserl is restored. The complex, troubled, and sundered philosophical relationship between Husserl and Heidegger has been widely discussed.\nOn 4 May 1933, Professor Edmund Husserl addressed the recent regime change in Germany and its consequences:The future alone will judge which was the true Germany in 1933, and who were the true Germans\u2014those who subscribe to the more or less materialistic-mythical racial prejudices of the day, or those Germans pure in heart and mind, heirs to the great Germans of the past whose tradition they revere and perpetuate.After his death, Husserl's manuscripts, amounting to approximately 40,000 pages of \"Gabelsberger\" stenography and his complete research library, were in 1939 smuggled to the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium by the Franciscan priest Herman Van Breda. There they were deposited at Leuven to form the \"Husserl-Archives\" of the Higher Institute of Philosophy. Much of the material in his research manuscripts has since been published in the Husserliana critical edition series.\nDevelopment of his thought.\nSeveral early themes.\nIn his first works, Husserl combined mathematics, psychology, and philosophy with the goal of providing a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzed the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then built up a theory on this analysis. He used methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass, he derived the idea of generating\nthe concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. From Brentano and Stumpf, he took the distinction between \"proper\" and \"improper\" presenting. In an example, Husserl explained this in the following way: if someone is standing in front of a house, they have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if they are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, the person can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic, as Husserl also calls it) one if they only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\" (1900\u20131901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as mereology.\nAnother important element that Husserl took over from Brentano was intentionality, the notion that the main characteristic of consciousness is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of \"mental phenomena\", by which they could be distinguished from \"physical phenomena\". Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the \"intentional object\"). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.\nThe elaboration of phenomenology.\nSome years after the 1900\u20131901 publication of his main work, the \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (\"Logical Investigations\"), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of essences would only be possible by \"bracketing\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called \"epoch\u00e9\". These new concepts prompted the publication of the \"Ideen\" (\"Ideas\") in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the \"Logische Untersuchungen\".\nFrom the \"Ideen\" onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what people perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a transcendental idealist. Husserl proposed that the world of objects\u2014and of ways in which people direct themselves toward and perceive those objects\u2014is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural attitude\", which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that people see as emanating from them (this attitude is also called physicalist objectivism). Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how people, in their many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \"constitute\" them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply \"external\" and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or \"type\". The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but \"bracketed\" as a way in which people regard objects\u2014instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence, founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. To better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things people perceive (or an assumption underlying how people perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.\nIn a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of intersubjectivity, specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (\"Cartesian Meditations\", Meditation V). Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of phenomenology to scientific inquiry (and specifically to psychology) and what it means to \"bracket\" the natural attitude. \"The Crisis of the European Sciences\" is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of Western philosophy and science, emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly one-sided empirical and naturalistic orientation. Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis, and that a science of the mind (\") must be established on as scientific a foundation as the natural sciences have managed: \"It is my conviction that intentional phenomenology has for the first time made spirit as spirit the field of systematic scientific experience, thus effecting a total transformation of the task of knowledge.\"\nHusserl's thought.\nHusserl's thought is revolutionary in several ways, most notably in the distinction between \"natural\" and \"phenomenological\" modes of understanding. In the former, sense-perception in correspondence with the material realm constitutes the known reality, and understanding is premised on the accuracy of the perception and the objective knowability of what is called the \"real world\". Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously \"presuppositionless\" by means of what Husserl calls \"phenomenological reduction\". This reduction is not conditioned but rather transcendental: in Husserl's terms, pure consciousness of absolute Being. In Husserl's work, consciousness of any given thing calls for discerning its meaning as an \"intentional object\". Such an object does not simply strike the senses, to be interpreted or misinterpreted by mental reason; it has already been selected and grasped, grasping being an etymological connotation, of \"percipere\", the root of \"perceive\".\nMeaning and object.\nFrom \"Logical Investigations\" (1900/1901) to \"Experience and Judgment\" (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between meaning and object. He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object. Examples of this are \"the victor in Jena\" and \"the loser in Waterloo\", or \"the equilateral triangle\" and \"the equiangular triangle\"; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: \"Aristotle\", \"Socrates\", and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called \"universal names\"; their meaning is a \"concept\" and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way people know sensible objects is called \"sensible intuition\".\nHusserl also identifies a series of \"formal words\" which are necessary to form sentences and have no sensible correlates. Examples of formal words are \"a\", \"the\", \"more than\", \"over\", \"under\", \"two\", \"group\", and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls \"formal categories\". There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-ontological categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of conjunction, disjunction, forms of plural, among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, cardinal number, ordinal number, part and whole, relation, and so on. The way people know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called \"categorial intuition\".\nThrough sensible intuition, consciousness constitutes what Husserl calls a \"situation of affairs\" (). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, people are able to constitute a \"state of affairs\" (). One situation of affairs, through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose \"a\" and \"b\" are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. It can be used as the basis to say, \"\"a\"&lt;\"b\" and \"b\"&gt;\"a\"\", two judgments which designate the same state of affairs. For Husserl, a sentence has a proposition or judgment as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base.\nFormal and regional ontology.\nHusserl sees ontology as a \"science of essences\". \"Sciences of essences\" are contrasted with \"factual sciences\": the former are knowable a priori and provide the foundation for the later, which are knowable a posteriori. Ontology as a science of essences is not interested in \"actual facts\", but in the essences themselves, whether they \"have instances or not\". Husserl distinguishes between \"formal ontology\", which investigates the essence of \"objectivity in general\", and \"regional ontologies\", which study \"regional essences\" that are shared by all entities belonging to the region. Regions correspond to the highest genera of concrete entities: material nature, personal consciousness, and interpersonal spirit. Husserl's method for studying ontology and sciences of essence in general is called eidetic variation. It involves imagining an object of the kind under investigation and varying its features. The changed feature is \"inessential\" to this kind if the object can survive its change, otherwise it belongs to the \"kind's essence\". For example, a triangle remains a triangle if one of its sides is extended, but it ceases to be a triangle if a fourth side is added. Regional ontology involves applying this method to the essences corresponding to the highest genera.\nPhilosophy of logic and mathematics.\nHusserl believed that \"truth-in-itself\" has as ontological correlate \"being-in-itself\", just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates. Logic is a formal theory of judgment, that studies the formal \"a priori\" relations among judgments using meaning categories. Mathematics, on the other hand, is formal ontology; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence, for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why sensible objects are not dealt with in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called \"categorial abstraction.\" Through this faculty, people are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.\nThanks to \"eidetic reduction\" (or \"essential intuition\"), people are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity, and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic reduction, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.\nHusserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that offer objective knowledge of pure logic. All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted noematically), as it is constituted by consciousness, needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness).\nHusserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it.\nThe ontological correlate to the third stratum is the \"theory of manifolds\". In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner. It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all. Through the positing of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the apodeictic connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved.\nAccording to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as \"n\"-dimensional manifolds (both Euclidean and non-Euclidean), Hermann Grassmann's theory of extensions, William Rowan Hamilton's Hamiltonians, Sophus Lie's theory of transformation groups, and Cantor's set theory.\nJacob Klein was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to \"desedimentize\" mathematics and the mathematical sciences.\nHusserl and psychologism.\nPhilosophy of arithmetic and Frege.\nAfter obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the foundations of mathematics from a psychological point of view. In his \"On the Concept of Number\" (1887) and in his \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\" (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano's descriptive psychology, to define the natural numbers in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of Karl Weierstrass, Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, and other contemporary mathematicians. Later, in the first volume of his \"Logical Investigations\", the \"Prolegomena of Pure Logic\", Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the \"Prolegomena\" did not apply directly to his \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\". Some scholars question whether Frege's negative review of the \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\" helped turn Husserl towards modern Platonism, but he had already discovered the work of Bernard Bolzano independently around 1890/91. In his \"Logical Investigations\", Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, G. W. Leibniz and Hermann Lotze as inspirations for his newer position.\nHusserl's review of Ernst Schr\u00f6der, published before Frege's landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes sense from reference; thus, Husserl's notions of noema and object also arose independently. Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\", Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept. Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by Brentano and his school, and may have surfaced as early as Brentano's 1870s lectures on logic.\nScholars such as J. N. Mohanty, Claire Ortiz Hill, and Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock, among others, have argued that Husserl's so-called change from psychologism to Platonism came about independently of Frege's review. For example, the review falsely accuses Husserl of subjectivizing everything, so that no objectivity is possible, and falsely attributes to him a notion of abstraction whereby objects disappear until all that remains are numbers as mere ghosts. Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl's \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\", there are already two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective. Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work. Frege's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass's Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives.\nFurthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\". Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind\u2014that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset. He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and David Hume. Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change. In his \"Logical Investigations\", Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege's \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\", and again to question Frege's use of the word \"\" to designate \"reference\" rather than \"meaning\" (sense).\nIn a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the \"Philosophy of Arithmetic\" and Husserl's review of Ernst Schr\u00f6der's \"\". In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schr\u00f6der's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.\nCommentators argue that Husserl's notion of noema has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because \"noemata\" are necessarily fused with noeses, which are the conscious activities of consciousness. \"Noemata\" have three different levels:\nConsequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema. Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence, concepts with no objects have no truth value in arguments. Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege, the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl, it is a \"state of affairs.\" Frege's notion of \"sense\" is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of \"meaning\" and \"object\" differ from those of Frege.\nIn detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that arithmetic could be derived from logic. For Husserl, this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of geometry) is the ontological correlate of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other.\nHusserl's criticism of psychologism.\nReacting against authors such as John Stuart Mill, Christoph von Sigwart and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i.e. their conception of these abstract and \"a priori\" sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature. According to psychologism, logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical \"art\" of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did) or a description of the factual processes of human thought. Husserl pointed out that the failure of anti-psychologists to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side. Pure logic does not deal at all with \"thoughts\" or \"judgings\" as mental episodes but with \"a priori\" laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves.\n\"Here 'Judgement' has the same meaning as 'proposition', understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning. This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic. Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions.\"\nSince \"truth-in-itself\" has \"being-in-itself\" as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism. Psychologists have not been successful either in showing how induction or psychological processes can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.\nThis confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as biologism and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:\nFrom this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a Platonist conception of logic. This means that logical and mathematical laws should be regarded as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths, and meanings in general.\nInfluence.\nDavid Carr commented on Husserl following in his 1970 dissertation at Yale: \"It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task\" as originally intended by the radical new science. Notwithstanding, he did attract philosophers to phenomenology.\nMartin Heidegger is the best known of Husserl's students, the one whom Husserl chose as his successor at Freiburg. Heidegger's magnum opus \"Being and Time\" was dedicated to Husserl. They shared their thoughts and worked alongside each other for over a decade at the University of Freiburg, Heidegger being Husserl's assistant during 1920\u20131923. Heidegger's early work followed his teacher, but with time he began to develop new insights distinctively variant. Husserl became increasingly critical of Heidegger's work, especially in 1929, and included pointed criticism of Heidegger in lectures he gave during 1931. Heidegger, while acknowledging his debt to Husserl, followed a political position offensive and harmful to Husserl after the Nazis came to power in 1933, Husserl being of Jewish origin and Heidegger infamously being then a Nazi proponent. Academic discussion of Husserl and Heidegger is extensive.\nAt G\u00f6ttingen in 1913, Adolf Reinach \"was now Husserl's right hand. He was above all the mediator between Husserl and the students, for he understood extremely well how to deal with other persons, whereas Husserl was pretty much helpless in this respect.\" He was an original editor of Husserl's new journal, \"Jahrbuch\"; one of his works (giving a phenomenological analysis of the law of obligations) appeared in its first issue. Reinach was widely admired and a remarkable teacher. Husserl, in his 1917 obituary, wrote, \"He wanted to draw only from the deepest sources, he wanted to produce only work of enduring value. And through his wise restraint, he succeeded in this.\"\nEdith Stein was Husserl's student at G\u00f6ttingen and Freiburg while she wrote her doctoral thesis \"The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and Considered Phenomenologically\" (1916). She then became his assistant at Freiburg in 1916\u201318. She later adapted her phenomenology to the modern school of modern Thomism.\nLudwig Landgrebe became assistant to Husserl in 1923. From 1939, he collaborated with Eugen Fink at the Husserl-Archives in Leuven. In 1954, he became the leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion, and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.\nEugen Fink was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the \"Sixth Cartesian Meditation\" which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work. Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.\nRoman Ingarden, an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in German and Polish. In his \"Sp\u00f3r o istnienie \u015bwiata\" (Ger.: \"Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt\", Eng.: \"Dispute about existence of the world\"), he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.\nMax Scheler met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at G\u00f6ttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung\" (1913). Scheler's work \"Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value\" appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler's legal troubles, and Scheler returned to Munich. Although Scheler later criticised Husserl's idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a \"phenomenology of love\", he states that he remained \"deeply indebted\" to Husserl throughout his work.\nNicolai Hartmann was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921, the prestige of Hartmann, the neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Marburg, was added to the Movement; he \"publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of \"die Ph\u00e4nomenologie\".\" Yet Hartmann's connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.\nEmmanuel Levinas in 1929 gave a presentation at one of Husserl's last seminars in Freiburg. Also that year, he wrote on Husserl's \"Ideen\" (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl's \"M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes\" (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in Lithuania. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.\nAlfred Schutz's \"Phenomenology of the Social World\" seeks to rigorously ground Max Weber's interpretive sociology in Husserl's phenomenology. Husserl was impressed by this work and asked Schutz to be his assistant.\nJean-Paul Sartre was also largely influenced by Husserl, although he later came to disagree with key points in his analyses. Sartre rejected Husserl's transcendental interpretations begun in his \"Ideen\" (1913) and instead followed Heidegger's ontology.\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty's \"Phenomenology of Perception\" is influenced by Edmund Husserl's work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space, and temporality, including Husserl's theory of retention and protention. Merleau-Ponty's description of 'motor intentionality' and sexuality, for example, retains the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of \"Ideen I\", yet further concretizes what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition. Merleau-Ponty's most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, \"the Philosopher and His Shadow.\" Depending on the interpretation of Husserl's accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl's \"Phenomenological Psychology\" and \"Experience and Judgment\", it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the \"eidetic reduction\" nor the \"pure essence\" said to result. Merleau-Ponty was the first student to study at the Husserl-archives in Leuven.\nGabriel Marcel explicitly rejected existentialism, due to Sartre, but not phenomenology, which has enjoyed a wide following among French Catholics. He appreciated Husserl, Scheler, and (but with apprehension) Heidegger. His expressions like \"ontology of sensability\" when referring to the body, indicate influence by phenomenological thought.\nKurt G\u00f6del is known to have read \"Cartesian Meditations\". He expressed very strong appreciation for Husserl's work, especially with regard to \"bracketing\" or \"epoch\u00e9\".\nHermann Weyl's interest in intuitionistic logic and impredicativity appears to have resulted from his reading of Husserl. He was introduced to Husserl's work through his wife, Helene Joseph, herself a student of Husserl at G\u00f6ttingen.\nColin Wilson has used Husserl's ideas extensively in developing his \"New Existentialism,\" particularly in regards to his \"intentionality of consciousness,\" which he mentions in a number of his books.\nRudolf Carnap was also influenced by Husserl, not only concerning Husserl's notion of essential insight that Carnap used in his \"Der Raum\", but also his notion of \"formation rules\" and \"transformation rules\" is founded on Husserl's philosophy of logic.\nKarol Wojtyla, who would later become Pope John Paul II, was influenced by Husserl. Phenomenology appears in his major work, \"The Acting Person\" (1969). Originally published in Polish, it was translated by Andrzej Potocki and edited by Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka in the \"Analecta Husserliana\". \"The Acting Person\" combines phenomenological work with Thomistic ethics.\nPaul Ric\u0153ur has translated many works of Husserl into French and has also written many of his own studies of the philosopher. Among other works, Ric\u0153ur employed phenomenology in his \"Freud and Philosophy\" (1965).\nJacques Derrida wrote several critical studies of Husserl early in his academic career. These included his dissertation, \"The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy,\" and also his introduction to \"The Origin of Geometry\". Derrida continued to make reference to Husserl in works such as \"Of Grammatology\".\nStanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz were inspired by Husserl's formal analysis of language. Accordingly, they employed phenomenology in the development of categorial grammar.\nJos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset visited Husserl at Freiburg in 1934. He credited phenomenology for having 'liberated him' from a narrow neo-Kantian thought. While perhaps not a phenomenologist himself, he introduced the philosophy to Iberia and Latin America.\nWilfrid Sellars, an influential figure in the so-called \"Pittsburgh School\" (Robert Brandom, John McDowell) had been a student of Marvin Farber, a pupil of Husserl, and was influenced by phenomenology through him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Marvin Farber led me through my first careful reading of the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" and introduced me to Husserl. His combination of utter respect for the structure of Husserl's thought with the equally firm conviction that this structure could be given a naturalistic interpretation was undoubtedly a key influence on my own subsequent philosophical strategy.\nIn his 1942 essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", absurdist philosopher Albert Camus acknowledges Husserl as a previous philosopher who described and attempted to deal with the feeling of the absurd, but claims he committed \"philosophical suicide\" by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous Platonic forms and an abstract god.\nHans Blumenberg received his habilitation in 1950, with a dissertation on ontological distance, an inquiry into the crisis of Husserl's phenomenology.\nRoger Scruton, despite some disagreements with Husserl, drew upon his work in \"Sexual Desire\" (1986).\nThe influence of the Husserlian phenomenological tradition in the 21st century extends beyond the confines of the European and North American legacies. It has already started to impact (indirectly) scholarship in Eastern and Oriental thought, including research on the impetus of philosophical thinking in the history of ideas in Islam.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9531", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9531", "title": "Electrical engineering", "text": "Branch of engineering\nElectrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.\nElectrical engineering is divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, control engineering, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science. Electrical engineers also study machine learning and computer science techniques due to significant overlap.\nElectrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering, electronic or electrical and electronic engineering. Practicing engineers may have professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET, formerly the IEE).\nElectrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.\nHistory.\nElectricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term \"electricity\". He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Wilcke invented a device later named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.\n19th century.\nIn the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, who discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle; of William Sturgeon, who in 1825 invented the electromagnet; of Joseph Henry and Edward Davy, who invented the electrical relay in 1835; of Georg Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor; of Michael Faraday, the discoverer of electromagnetic induction in 1831; and of James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and magnetism in his treatise \"Electricity and Magnetism\".\nIn 1782, Georges-Louis Le Sage developed and presented in Berlin probably the world's first form of electric telegraphy, using 24 different wires, one for each letter of the alphabet. This telegraph connected two rooms. It was an electrostatic telegraph that moved gold leaf through electrical conduction.\nIn 1795, Francisco Salva Campillo proposed an electrostatic telegraph system. Between 1803 and 1804, he worked on electrical telegraphy, and in 1804, he presented his report at the Royal Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Salva's electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was greatly influenced by and based upon two discoveries made in Europe in 1800\u2014Alessandro Volta's electric battery for generating an electric current and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyle's electrolysis of water. Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network, and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and the US to support the new discipline. Francis Ronalds created an electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy.\nPractical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardized units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and henry. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893. The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardization in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.\nDuring these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics since early electrical technology was considered electromechanical in nature. The Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882 and introduced the first-degree course in electrical engineering in 1883. The first electrical engineering degree program in the United States was started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, though it was Cornell University to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885. The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell's Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts.\nIn about 1885, Cornell President Andrew Dickson White established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States. In the same year, University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain. Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at University of Missouri established the electrical engineering department in 1886. Afterwards, universities and institutes of technology gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.\nDuring these decades the use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, Thomas Edison switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts\u2014direct current (DC)\u2014to 59 customers on Manhattan Island in New York City. In 1884, Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine allowing for more efficient electric power generation. Alternating current, with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of transformers, developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy and Miksa D\u00e9ri (later called ZBD transformers), Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs and William Stanley Jr. Practical AC motor designs including induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and further developed into a practical three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown. Charles Steinmetz and Oliver Heaviside contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering. The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the \"war of the currents\" between a George Westinghouse backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.\nEarly 20th century.\nDuring the development of radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics. The mathematical work of James Clerk Maxwell during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of electromagnetic radiation including the possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called \"radio waves\"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, Heinrich Hertz proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting radio waves with a spark-gap transmitter, and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these \"Hertzian waves\" into a purpose-built commercial wireless telegraphic system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of .\nMillimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 1894\u20131896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60GHz in his experiments. He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves, when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901.\nIn 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun introduced the cathode-ray tube as part of an oscilloscope, a crucial enabling technology for electronic television. John Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Two years later, Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube, called the triode.\nIn 1920, Albert Hull developed the magnetron which would eventually lead to the development of the microwave oven in 1946 by Percy Spencer. In 1934, the British military began to make strides toward radar (which also uses the magnetron) under the direction of Dr Wimperis, culminating in the operation of the first radar station at Bawdsey in August 1936.\nIn 1941, Konrad Zuse presented the Z3, the world's first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts. In 1943, Tommy Flowers designed and built the Colossus, the world's first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer. In 1946, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives.\nIn 1948, Claude Shannon published \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" which mathematically describes the passage of information with uncertainty (electrical noise).\nSolid-state electronics.\nThe first working transistor was a point-contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) in 1947. They then invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. While early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, they opened the door for more compact devices.\nThe first integrated circuits were the hybrid integrated circuit invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the monolithic integrated circuit chip invented by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959.\nThe MOSFET (metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at BTL in 1959. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.\nThe MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuit chips. The earliest experimental MOS IC chip to be fabricated was built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA Laboratories in 1962. MOS technology enabled Moore's law, the doubling of transistors on an IC chip every two years, predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965. Silicon-gate MOS technology was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968. Since then, the MOSFET has been the basic building block of modern electronics. The mass-production of silicon MOSFETs and MOS integrated circuit chips, along with continuous MOSFET scaling miniaturization at an exponential pace (as predicted by Moore's law), has since led to revolutionary changes in technology, economy, culture and thinking.\nThe Apollo program which culminated in landing astronauts on the Moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 was enabled by NASA's adoption of advances in semiconductor electronic technology, including MOSFETs in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) and silicon integrated circuit chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC).\nThe development of MOS integrated circuit technology in the 1960s led to the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s. The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. The Intel 4004 was designed and realized by Federico Faggin at Intel with his silicon-gate MOS technology, along with Intel's Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima. The microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers and personal computers, and the microcomputer revolution.\nElectrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.\nIn the recent times, the subject of machine learning (including speech systems, computer vision and reinforcement learning) has had significant overlap with electrical engineering fields such as signal processing, image processing and control engineering, and is as such studied often by electrical engineers. Machine learning techniques are also used in electrical engineering systems in subfields such as electronic design automation, stochastic and adaptive control, smart grids, adaptive signal processing, etc.\nSubfields.\nOne of the properties of electricity is that it is very useful for energy transmission as well as for information transmission. These were also the first areas in which electrical engineering was developed. Today, electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes, certain fields, such as electronic engineering and computer engineering, are considered disciplines in their own right.\nPower and energy.\nPower &amp; Energy engineering deals with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called \"on-grid\" power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called \"off-grid\" power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems.\nTelecommunications.\nTelecommunications engineering focuses on the transmission of information across a communication channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.\nOnce the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. Typically, if the power of the transmitted signal is insufficient once the signal arrives at the receiver's antenna(s), the information contained in the signal will be corrupted by noise, specifically static.\nControl engineering.\nControl engineering focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers, electronics control engineers may use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles. It also plays an important role in industrial automation.\nControl engineers often use feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle's speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.\nControl engineers also work in robotics to design autonomous systems using control algorithms which interpret sensory feedback to control actuators that move robots such as autonomous vehicles, autonomous drones and others used in a variety of industries.\nElectronics.\nElectronic engineering involves the design and testing of electronic circuits that use the properties of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors to achieve a particular functionality. The tuned circuit, which allows the user of a radio to filter out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.\nPrior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as \"radio engineering\" and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television. Later, in post-war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term \"radio engineering\" gradually gave way to the name \"electronic engineering\".\nBefore the invention of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number\u2014often millions\u2014of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today.\nMicroelectronics and nanoelectronics.\nMicroelectronics engineering deals with the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level.\nNanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100\u00a0nm processing having been standard since around 2002.\nMicroelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics.\nSignal processing.\nSignal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.\nSignal processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of digital signal processing and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, audio engineering, broadcast engineering, power electronics, and biomedical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. Analog signal processing is still important in the design of many control systems.\nDSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital television sets, radios, hi-fi audio equipment, mobile phones, multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, noise cancelling headphones, digital spectrum analyzers, missile guidance systems, radar systems, and telematics systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for noise reduction, speech recognition or synthesis, encoding or decoding digital media, wirelessly transmitting or receiving data, triangulating positions using GPS, and other kinds of image processing, video processing, audio processing, and speech processing.\nInstrumentation.\nInstrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier-Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.\nOften instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.\nComputers.\nComputer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems. This may involve the design of new hardware. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline. Desktop computers represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of embedded devices including video game consoles and DVD players. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing. Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.\nPhotonics and optics.\nPhotonics and optics deals with the generation, transmission, amplification, modulation, detection, and analysis of electromagnetic radiation. The application of optics deals with design of optical instruments such as lenses, microscopes, telescopes, and other equipment that uses the properties of electromagnetic radiation. Other prominent applications of optics include electro-optical sensors and measurement systems, lasers, fiber-optic communication systems, and optical disc systems (e.g. CD and DVD). Photonics builds heavily on optical technology, supplemented with modern developments such as optoelectronics (mostly involving semiconductors), laser systems, optical amplifiers and novel materials (e.g. metamaterials).\nRelated disciplines.\nMechatronics is an engineering discipline that deals with the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles.\n\"Electronic systems design\" is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.\nThe term \"mechatronics\" is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.\nIn aerospace engineering and robotics, an example is the most recent electric propulsion and ion propulsion.\nEducation.\nElectrical engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, electronics and computer engineering, electrical engineering technology, or electrical and electronic engineering. The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Technology, or Bachelor of Applied Science, depending on the university. The bachelor's degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and a variety of topics in electrical engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. \nAt many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others, electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.\nSome electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering/Master of Science (MEng/MSc), a Master of Engineering Management, a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering, an Engineering Doctorate (Eng.D.), or an Engineer's degree. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than a standalone postgraduate degree.\nProfessional practice.\nIn most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), Chartered engineer or Incorporated Engineer (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union).\nThe advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada \"only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients\". This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.\nProfessional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually. The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe. Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.\nIn Australia, Canada, and the United States, electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force.\nTools and work.\nFrom the Global Positioning System to electric power generation, electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of telecommunications systems, the operation of electric power stations, the lighting and wiring of buildings, the design of household appliances, or the electrical control of industrial machinery.\nFundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided design programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.\nAlthough most electrical engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is, the interactions of elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunications systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, and the ability to understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.\nA wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers. For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. In RF engineering and high-frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.\nFor many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.\nThe workplaces of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a fabrication plant, on board a Naval ship, the offices of a consulting firm or on site at a mine. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers, and other engineers.\nElectrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences. For instance, the physicist Lord Kelvin played a major role in the engineering of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Conversely, the engineer Oliver Heaviside produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables. Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects. For instance, large particle accelerators such as CERN need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project including the power distribution, the instrumentation, and the manufacture and installation of the superconducting electromagnets.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9532", "revid": "44120587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9532", "title": "Electromagnetism", "text": "Fundamental interaction between charged particles\nIn physics, electromagnetism is an interaction that occurs between particles with electric charge via electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is the dominant force in the interactions of atoms and molecules. Electromagnetism can be thought of as a combination of electrostatics and magnetism, which are distinct but closely intertwined phenomena. Electromagnetic forces occur between any two charged particles. Electric forces cause an attraction between particles with opposite charges and repulsion between particles with the same charge, while magnetism is an interaction that occurs between charged particles in relative motion. These two forces are described in terms of electromagnetic fields. Macroscopic charged objects are described in terms of Coulomb's law for electricity and Amp\u00e8re's force law for magnetism; the Lorentz force describes microscopic charged particles.\nThe electromagnetic force is responsible for many of the chemical and physical phenomena observed in daily life. The electrostatic attraction between atomic nuclei and their electrons holds atoms together. Electric forces also allow different atoms to combine into molecules, including the macromolecules such as proteins that form the basis of life. Meanwhile, magnetic interactions between the spin and angular momentum magnetic moments of electrons also play a role in chemical reactivity; such relationships are studied in spin chemistry. Electromagnetism also plays several crucial roles in modern technology: electrical energy production, transformation and distribution; light, heat, and sound production and detection; fiber optic and wireless communication; sensors; computation; electrolysis; electroplating; and mechanical motors and actuators.\nElectromagnetism has been studied since ancient times. Many ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and the Mayans, created wide-ranging theories to explain lightning, static electricity, and the attraction between magnetized pieces of iron ore. However, it was not until the late 18th century that scientists began to develop a mathematical basis for understanding the nature of electromagnetic interactions. In the 18th and 19th centuries, prominent scientists and mathematicians such as Coulomb, Gauss and Faraday developed namesake laws which helped to explain the formation and interaction of electromagnetic fields. This process culminated in the 1860s with the discovery of Maxwell's equations, a set of four partial differential equations which provide a complete description of classical electromagnetic fields. Maxwell's equations provided a sound mathematical basis for the relationships between electricity and magnetism that scientists had been exploring for centuries, and predicted the existence of self-sustaining electromagnetic waves. Maxwell postulated that such waves make up visible light, which was later shown to be true. Gamma-rays, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared radiation, microwaves and radio waves were all determined to be electromagnetic radiation differing only in their range of frequencies.\nIn the modern era, scientists continue to refine the theory of electromagnetism to account for the effects of modern physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity. The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the requirement that observations remain consistent when viewed from various moving frames of reference (relativistic electromagnetism) and the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the medium of propagation (permeability and permittivity), helped inspire Einstein's theory of special relativity in 1905. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) modifies Maxwell's equations to be consistent with the quantized nature of matter. In QED, changes in the electromagnetic field are expressed in terms of discrete excitations, particles known as photons, the quanta of light.\nHistory.\nAncient world.\nInvestigation into electromagnetic phenomena began about 5,000 years ago. There is evidence that the ancient Chinese, Mayan, and potentially even Egyptian civilizations knew that the naturally magnetic mineral magnetite had attractive properties, and many incorporated it into their art and architecture. Ancient people were also aware of lightning and static electricity, although they had no idea of the mechanisms behind these phenomena. The Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus discovered around 600 B.C.E. that amber could acquire an electric charge when it was rubbed with cloth, which allowed it to pick up light objects such as pieces of straw. Thales also experimented with the ability of magnetic rocks to attract one other, and hypothesized that this phenomenon might be connected to the attractive power of amber, foreshadowing the deep connections between electricity and magnetism that would be discovered over 2,000 years later. Despite all this investigation, ancient civilizations had no understanding of the mathematical basis of electromagnetism, and often analyzed its impacts through the lens of religion rather than science (lightning, for instance, was considered to be a creation of the gods in many cultures).\n19th century.\nElectricity and magnetism were originally considered to be two separate forces. This view changed with the publication of James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 \"A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\" in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:\nIn April 1820, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted observed that an electrical current in a wire caused a nearby compass needle to move. At the time of discovery, \u00d8rsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The CGS unit of magnetic induction (oersted) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.\nHis findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in electrodynamics. They influenced French physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re's developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. \u00d8rsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.\nThis unification, which was observed by Michael Faraday, extended by James Clerk Maxwell, and partially reformulated by Oliver Heaviside and Heinrich Hertz, is one of the key accomplishments of 19th-century mathematical physics. It has had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of light. Unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other electromagnetic waves are at present seen as taking the form of quantized, self-propagating oscillatory electromagnetic field disturbances called photons. Different frequencies of oscillation give rise to the different forms of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to gamma rays at the highest frequencies.\n\u00d8rsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, Gian Domenico Romagnosi, an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear, nor if current flowed across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community.\nAn earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson. The account stated:A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box ... and having placed the box in the corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder, lightning, &amp;c. ... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails, observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number was tried, and found to do the same, and that, to such a degree as to take up large nails, packing needles, and other iron things of considerable weight ... E. T. Whittaker suggested in 1910 that this particular event was responsible for lightning to be \"credited with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of Leyden jars.\"\nA fundamental force.\nThe electromagnetic force is the second strongest of the four known fundamental forces and has unlimited range.\nAll other forces, known as non-fundamental forces. (e.g., friction, contact forces) are derived from the four fundamental forces. At high energy, the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single interaction called the electroweak interaction.\nMost of the forces involved in interactions between atoms are explained by electromagnetic forces between electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of chemical phenomena.\nElectromagnetism explains how materials carry momentum despite being composed of individual particles and empty space. The forces we experience when \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" ordinary material objects result from intermolecular forces between individual molecules in our bodies and in the objects.\nThe effective forces generated by the momentum of electrons' movement is a necessary part of understanding atomic and intermolecular interactions. As electrons move between interacting atoms, they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The behavior of matter at the molecular scale, including its density, is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.\nClassical electrodynamics.\nIn 1600, William Gilbert proposed, in his \"De Magnete\", that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Franklin's proposed experiments in 1752 were conducted on 10May 1752 by Thomas-Fran\u00e7ois Dalibard of France using a iron rod instead of a kite and he successfully extracted electrical sparks from a cloud.\nOne of the first to discover and publish a link between human-made electric current and magnetism was Gian Romagnosi, who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a voltaic pile deflected a nearby compass needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when \u00d8rsted performed a similar experiment. \u00d8rsted's work influenced Amp\u00e8re to conduct further experiments, which eventually gave rise to a new area of physics: electrodynamics. By determining a force law for the interaction between elements of electric current, Amp\u00e8re placed the subject on a solid mathematical foundation.\nA theory of electromagnetism, known as classical electromagnetism, was developed by several physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873, when James Clerk Maxwell's treatise was published, which unified previous developments into a single theory, proposing that light was an electromagnetic wave propagating in the \"luminiferous ether\". In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as Maxwell's equations, and the electromagnetic force is given by the Lorentz force law.\nOne of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics, but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space. This violates Galilean invariance, a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a luminiferous aether through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincar\u00e9, in 1905, Albert Einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see History of special relativity.)\nIn addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term \"electromagnetism\". (For more information, see Classical electromagnetism and special relativity and Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism.)\nToday few problems in electromagnetism remain unsolved. These include: the lack of magnetic monopoles, Abraham\u2013Minkowski controversy, the location in space of the electromagnetic field energy, and the mechanism by which some organisms can sense electric and magnetic fields.\nExtension to nonlinear phenomena.\nThe Maxwell equations are \"linear,\" in that a change in the sources (the charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields. Nonlinear dynamics can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of magnetohydrodynamics, which combines Maxwell theory with the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Another branch of electromagnetism dealing with nonlinearity is nonlinear optics.\nQuantities and units.\nHere is a list of common units related to electromagnetism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the electromagnetic CGS system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via Amp\u00e8re's law and takes the permeability as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.\nFormulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as Maxwell's equations) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no one-to-one correspondence between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit \"sub-systems\", including Gaussian, \"ESU\", \"EMU\", and Heaviside\u2013Lorentz. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase \"CGS units\" is often used to refer specifically to CGS-Gaussian units.\nApplications.\nThe study of electromagnetism informs electric circuits, magnetic circuits, and semiconductor devices' construction.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nWeb sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTextbooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral coverage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9534", "revid": "51032235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9534", "title": "Euphemism", "text": "Innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive\nEuphemism is the substitution of an expression that may offend or imply something unpleasant, with one that is more agreeable or inoffensive (which may be called \"a euphemism\"). Some euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive terms for concepts that the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms may be used to mask profanity or refer to topics some consider taboo such as mental or physical disability, sexual intercourse, bodily excretions, pain, violence, illness, or death in a polite way.\nEtymology.\n\"Euphemism\" comes from the Greek word () which refers to the use of 'words of good omen'; it is a compound of (), meaning 'good, well', and (), meaning 'prophetic speech; rumour, talk'. \"Eupheme\" is a reference to the female Greek spirit of words of praise and positivity, etc. The term \"euphemism\" itself was used as a euphemism by the ancient Greeks; with the meaning \"to keep a holy silence\" (speaking well by not speaking at all).\nPurpose.\nAvoidance.\nReasons for using euphemisms vary by context and intent. Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing, such as death, sex, and excretory bodily functions. They may be created for innocent, well-intentioned purposes or nefariously and cynically, intentionally to deceive, confuse, or deny. Euphemisms that emerge as dominant social euphemisms are often created to serve progressive causes. The Oxford University Press's \"Dictionary of Euphemisms\" identifies \"late\" as an occasionally ambiguous term, whose nature as a euphemism for 'dead' and an adjective meaning 'overdue' can cause confusion in listeners.\nMitigation.\nEuphemisms are also used to mitigate, soften, or downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at Auschwitz concentration camp, relative to their sheer number, is \"directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms\". Another example of this is during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his speech starting the invasion, called the invasion a \"special military operation\".\nEuphemisms are sometimes used to lessen the opposition to a political move. For example, according to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the neutral Hebrew lexical item (literally 'beatings (of the heart)'), rather than ('withdrawal'), to refer to the stages in the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, in order to lessen the opposition of right-wing Israelis to such a move. was thus used as a euphemism for 'withdrawal'.\nRhetoric.\nEuphemism may be used as a means to persuade, in which case its goal is to change the emotional impact of a description.\nControversial use.\nUsing a euphemism can in itself be controversial, as in the following examples:\nOnline.\nThe use of euphemism online is known as \"algospeak\" when used to evade automated online moderation techniques used on Meta and TikTok's platforms. Algospeak has been used in debate about the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nFormation methods.\nModification.\nMinced oaths (Phonetically).\nPhonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities and blasphemies, diminishing their intensity. To alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as profanity) to form a euphemism is known as \"taboo deformation\", or a \"minced oath\". Such modifications include:\nSubstitutions (Semantically).\nPleasant, positive, worthy, neutral, or nondescript terms are often substituted for explicit or unpleasant ones, with many substituted terms deliberately coined by sociopolitical movements, marketing, public relations, or advertising initiatives, including:\nSome examples of Cockney rhyming slang may serve the same purpose: to call a person a \"berk\" sounds less offensive than to call a person a \"cunt\", though \"berk\" is short for Berkeley Hunt, which rhymes with \"cunt\".\nForeign words.\nExpressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use or derived for a new word as euphemism. For example, the French word sometimes became \"encient\" or used instead of the English word \"pregnant\"; into \"abbatoire\" for \"slaughterhouse\", although in French the word retains its explicit violent meaning 'a place for beating down', conveniently lost on non-French speakers; \"entrepreneur\" for \"businessman\", adds glamour; \"douche\" (French for 'shower') for vaginal irrigation device; \"bidet\" ('little pony') for vessel for anal washing. Although in English physical \"handicaps\" are often described with euphemism, in French the English word \"handicap\" is used as a euphemism for their problematic words or .\nPeriphrasis &amp; circumlocution.\nPeriphrasis, or circumlocution, is one of the most common: to \"speak around\" a given word, implying it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.\nSlang.\nThe use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, \"screwed up\" is a euphemism for 'fucked up'; \"hook-up\" and \"laid\" are euphemisms for 'sexual intercourse'.\nUnderstatement.\nEuphemisms formed from understatements include \"asleep\" for dead and \"drinking\" for consuming alcohol. \"Tired and emotional\" is a notorious British euphemism for \"drunk\", one of many recurring jokes popularized by the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\"; it has been used by MPs to avoid unparliamentary language.\nDoublespeak.\nBureaucracies frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as doublespeak expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term \"sunshine units\" for contamination by radioactive isotopes. The United States Central Intelligence Agency refers to systematic torture as \"enhanced interrogation techniques\". An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge often used the clause \"imprisonment without right to correspondence\": the person sentenced would be shot soon after conviction. As early as 1939, Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich used the term (\"special treatment\") to mean summary execution of persons viewed as \"disciplinary problems\" by the Nazis even before commencing the systematic extermination of the Jews. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be \"guided\" (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps after having been \"evacuated\" to their doom. Such was part of the formulation of the (the \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\"), which became known to the outside world during the Nuremberg Trials.\nLifespan.\nFrequently, over time, euphemisms themselves become taboo words, through the linguistic process of semantic change known as pejoration, which University of Oregon linguist Sharon Henderson Taylor dubbed the euphemism cycle in 1974, also frequently referred to as the euphemism treadmill, as worded by Steven Pinker. For instance, the place of human defecation is a needy candidate for a euphemism in all eras. \"Toilet\" is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism \"house-of-office\", which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms \"privy-house\" and \"bog-house\". In the 20th century, where the old euphemisms \"lavatory\" (a place where one washes) and \"toilet\" (a place where one dresses) had grown from widespread usage (e.g., in the United States) to being synonymous with the crude act they sought to deflect, they were sometimes replaced with \"bathroom\" (a place where one bathes), \"washroom\" (a place where one washes), or \"restroom\" (a place where one rests) or even by the extreme form \"powder room\" (a place where one applies facial cosmetics). The form \"water closet\", often shortened to \"W.C.\", is a less deflective form. The word \"shit\" appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the Proto-Indo-European root , from which it was derived, meant 'to cut off'.\nAnother example in American English is the replacement of \"colored people\" with \"Negro\" (euphemism by foreign language), which itself came to be replaced by either \"African American\" or \"Black\". Also in the United States the term \"ethnic minorities\" in the 2010s has been replaced by \"people of color\".\n\"Venereal disease\", which euphemistically associated a contagious infection with Venus, the goddess of love, lost its deflective force as the word \"venereal\" became more closely associated to the infection than the goddess, and was abbreviated \"VD\". Later this was replaced by the more clinical abbreviation \"STD\" (sexually transmitted disease), which has itself since been replaced by \"STI\" (sexually transmitted infection) in an effort to de-stigmatize testing for asymptomatic patients before they show symptoms of disease.\nIntellectually-disabled people were originally defined with words such as \"morons\" or \"imbeciles\", which then became commonly used insults. The medical diagnosis was changed to \"mentally retarded\", which morphed into the pejorative, \"retard\", against those with intellectual disabilities. To avoid the negative connotations of their diagnoses, students who need accommodations because of such conditions are often labeled as \"special needs\" instead, although the words \"special\" or \"SPED\" (short for \"special education\") have long been schoolyard insults. As of August 2013, the Social Security Administration replaced the term \"mental retardation\" with \"intellectual disability\". Since 2012, that change in terminology has been adopted by the National Institutes of Health and the medical industry at large. There are numerous disability-related euphemisms that have negative connotations.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9536", "revid": "50667895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9536", "title": "Edmund Spenser", "text": "English poet (c. 1552 \u2013 1599)\nEdmund Spenser (; c.\u20091552 \u2013 13 January 1599 O.S.) was an English poet best known for \"The Faerie Queene\", an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse, and he is considered one of the great poets in the English language.\nLife.\nEdmund Spenser was born in East Smithfield, London, around the year 1552; however, there is still some ambiguity as to the exact date of his birth. His parentage is obscure, but he was probably the son of John Spenser, a journeyman clothmaker. As a young boy, he was educated in London at the Merchant Taylors' School and matriculated as a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he became a friend of Gabriel Harvey and later consulted him, despite their differing views on poetry. In 1578, he became for a short time secretary to John Young, Bishop of Rochester. In 1579, he published \"The Shepheardes Calender\" and around the same time married his first wife, Machabyas Childe. They had two children, Sylvanus (died 1638) and Katherine.\nIn July 1580, Spenser went to Ireland in service of the newly appointed Lord Deputy, Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton. Spenser served under Lord Grey with Walter Raleigh at the siege of Smerwick massacre. When Lord Grey was recalled to England, Spenser stayed on in Ireland, having acquired other official posts and lands in the Munster Plantation. Raleigh acquired other nearby Munster estates confiscated in the Second Desmond Rebellion. Sometime between 1587 and 1589, Spenser acquired his main estate at Kilcolman, near Doneraile in North Cork. He later bought a second holding to the south, at Rennie, on a rock overlooking the river Blackwater in North Cork. Its ruins are still visible. A short distance away grew a tree, locally known as \"Spenser's Oak\", until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the 1960s. Local legend claims that he penned some of \"The Faerie Queene\" under this tree.\nIn 1590, Spenser brought out the first three books of his most famous work, \"The Faerie Queene\", having travelled to London to publish and promote the work, with the likely assistance of Raleigh. He was successful enough to obtain a life pension of \u00a350 a year from the Queen. He probably hoped to secure a place at court through his poetry, but his next significant publication boldly antagonised the queen's principal secretary, Lord Burghley (William Cecil), through its inclusion of the satirical \"Mother Hubberd's Tale\". He returned to Ireland. He was at the centre of a literary circle whose members included his lifelong friend Lodowick Bryskett and Dr. John Longe, Archbishop of Armagh.\nIn 1591, Spenser published a translation in verse of Joachim Du Bellay's sonnets, \"Les Antiquit\u00e9s de Rome\", which had been published in 1558. Spenser's version, \"Ruines of Rome: by Bellay\", may also have been influenced by Latin poems on the same subject, written by Jean or Janis Vitalis and published in 1576.\nBy 1594, Spenser's first wife had died, and in that year he married a much younger Elizabeth Boyle, a relative of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. He addressed to her the sonnet sequence \"Amoretti\". The marriage was celebrated in \"Epithalamion\". They had a son named Peregrine.\nIn 1596, Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled \"A View of the Present State of Irelande\". This piece, in the form of a dialogue, circulated in manuscript, remaining unpublished until the mid-17th century. It is probable that it was kept out of print during the author's lifetime because of its inflammatory content. The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally \"pacified\" by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed, if necessary by violence.\nIn 1598, during the Nine Years' War, Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of Hugh O'Neill. His castle at Kilcolman was burned, and Ben Jonson, who may have had private information, asserted that one of his infant children died in the blaze.\nIn the year after being driven from his home, 1599, Spenser travelled to London, where he died at the age of forty-six \u2013 \"for want of bread\", according to Ben Jonson; one of Jonson's more doubtful statements, since Spenser had a payment to him authorised by the government and was due his pension. His coffin was carried to his grave, deliberately near that of Geoffrey Chaucer, in what became known as Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey by other poets, who threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave. His second wife survived him and remarried twice. His sister Sarah, who had accompanied him to Ireland, married into the Travers family, and her descendants were prominent landowners in Cork for centuries.\nRhyme and reason.\nThomas Fuller, in \"Worthies of England\", included a story where the Queen told her treasurer, William Cecil, to pay Spenser \u00a3100 for his poetry. The treasurer, however, objected that the sum was too much. She said, \"Then give him what is reason\". Without receiving his payment in due time, Spenser gave the Queen this quatrain on one of her progresses:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nI was promis'd on a time,\nTo have a reason for my rhyme:\nFrom that time unto this season,\nI receiv'd nor rhyme nor reason.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nShe immediately ordered the treasurer to pay Spenser the original \u00a3100.\nThis story seems to have attached itself to Spenser from Thomas Churchyard, who apparently had difficulty in getting payment of his pension, the only other pension Elizabeth awarded to a poet. Spenser seems to have had no difficulty in receiving payment when it was due as the pension was being collected for him by his publisher, Ponsonby.\n\"The Shepheardes Calender\".\n\"The Shepheardes Calender\" is Edmund Spenser's first major work, which appeared in 1579. It emulates Virgil's \"Eclogues\" of the first century BCE and the \"Eclogues\" of Mantuan by Baptista Mantuanus, a late medieval, early renaissance poet. An eclogue is a short pastoral poem that is in the form of a dialogue or soliloquy. Although all the months together form an entire year, each month stands alone as a separate poem. Editions of the late 16th and early 17th centuries include woodcuts for each month/poem, and thereby have a slight similarity to an emblem book which combines a number of self-contained pictures and texts, usually a short vignette, saying, or allegory with an accompanying illustration.\n\"The Faerie Queene\".\nSpenser's masterpiece is the epic poem \"The Faerie Queene\". The first three books of \"The Faerie Queene\" were published in 1590, and the second set of three books was published in 1596. Spenser originally indicated that he intended the poem to consist of twelve books, so the version of the poem we have today is incomplete. Despite this, it remains one of the longest poems in the English language. It is an allegorical work, and can be read (as Spenser presumably intended) on several levels of allegory, including as praise of Queen Elizabeth I. In a completely allegorical context, the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues. In Spenser's \"A Letter of the Authors\", he states that the entire epic poem is \"cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devises\", and that the aim behind \"The Faerie Queene\" was to \"fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\".\nShorter poems.\nSpenser published numerous relatively short poems in the last decade of the 16th century, almost all of which consider love or sorrow. In 1591, he published \"Complaints\", a collection of poems that express complaints in mournful or mocking tones. Four years later, in 1595, Spenser published \"Amoretti and Epithalamion\". This volume contains eighty-nine sonnets commemorating his courtship of Elizabeth Boyle. In \"Amoretti\", Spenser uses subtle humour and parody while praising his beloved, reworking Petrarchism in his treatment of longing for a woman. \"Epithalamion\", similar to \"Amoretti\", deals in part with the unease in the development of a romantic and sexual relationship. It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle. Some have speculated that the attention to disquiet, in general, reflects Spenser's personal anxieties at the time, as he was unable to complete his most significant work, \"The Faerie Queene\". In the following year, Spenser released \"Prothalamion\", a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke, allegedly in hopes to gain favour in the court.\nThe Spenserian stanza and sonnet.\nSpenser used a distinctive verse form, called the Spenserian stanza, in several works, including \"The Faerie Queene\". The stanza's main metre is iambic pentameter with a final line in iambic hexameter (having six feet or stresses, known as an Alexandrine), and the rhyme scheme is ababbcbcc. He also used his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet. In a Spenserian sonnet, the last line of every quatrain is linked with the first line of the next one, yielding the rhyme scheme ababbcbccdcdee. \"Men call you fayre\" is a fine sonnet from \"Amoretti\":\n&lt;poem&gt;\nMen call you fayre, and you doe credit it,\n for that your selfe ye dayly such doe see:\n but the trew fayre, that is the gentle wit,\n and vertuous mind is much more praysd of me.\nFor all the rest, how euer fayre it be,\n shall turne to nought and loose that glorious hew:\n but onely that is permanent and free\n from frayle corruption, that doth flesh ensew.\nThat is true beautie: that doth argue you\n to be diuine and borne of heauenly seed:\n deriu'd from that fayre Spirit, from whom all true\n and perfect beauty did at first proceed.\nHe onely fayre, and what he fayre hath made,\n all other fayre like flowres vntymely fade.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe poet presents the concept of true beauty in the poem. He addresses the sonnet to his beloved, Elizabeth Boyle, and presents his courtship. Like all Renaissance men, Edmund Spenser believed that love is an inexhaustible source of beauty and order. In this Sonnet, the poet expresses his idea of true beauty. The physical beauty will finish after a few days; it is not a permanent beauty. He emphasises beauty of mind and beauty of intellect. He considers his beloved is not simply flesh but is also a spiritual being. The poet opines that he is beloved born of heavenly seed and she is derived from fair spirit. The poet states that because of her clean mind, pure heart and sharp intellect, men call her fair and she deserves it. At the end, the poet praises her spiritual beauty and he worships her because of her Divine Soul.\nInfluences.\nThough Spenser was well-read in classical literature, scholars have noted that his poetry does not rehash tradition, but rather is distinctly his. This individuality may have resulted, to some extent, from a lack of comprehension of the classics. Spenser strove to emulate such ancient Roman poets as Virgil and Ovid, whom he studied during his schooling, but many of his best-known works are notably divergent from those of his predecessors. The language of his poetry is purposely archaic, reminiscent of earlier works such as \"The Canterbury Tales\" of Geoffrey Chaucer and \"Il Canzoniere\" of Petrarch, whom Spenser greatly admired.\nAn Anglican and a devotee of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, Spenser was particularly offended by the anti-Elizabethan propaganda that some Catholics circulated. Like most Protestants near the time of the Reformation, Spenser saw a Catholic church full of corruption, and he determined that it was not only the wrong religion but the anti-religion. This sentiment is an important backdrop for the battles of \"The Faerie Queene\".\nSpenser was called \"the Poet's Poet\" by Charles Lamb, and was admired by John Milton, William Blake, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Lord Byron, Alfred Tennyson and others. Among his contemporaries Walter Raleigh wrote a commendatory poem to \"The Faerie Queene\" in 1590 in which he claims to admire and value Spenser's work more so than any other in the English language. John Milton in his \"Areopagitica\" mentions \"our sage and serious poet Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas\". In the 18th century, Alexander Pope compared Spenser to \"a mistress, whose faults we see, but love her with them all\".\n\"A View of the Present State of Irelande\".\nIn his work \"A View of the Present State of Irelande\" (1596), Spenser discussed future plans to establish control over Ireland, the most recent Irish uprising, led by Hugh O'Neill having demonstrated the futility of previous efforts. The work is partly a defence of Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton, who was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1580, and who greatly influenced Spenser's thinking on Ireland.\nThe goal of the piece was to show that Ireland was in great need of reform. Spenser believed that \"Ireland is a diseased portion of the State, it must first be cured and reformed, before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation\". In \"A View of the Present State of Ireland\", Spenser categorises the \"evils\" of the Irish people into three prominent categories: laws, customs and religion. According to Spenser, these three elements worked together in creating the supposedly \"disruptive and degraded people\" who inhabited the country. One example given in the work is the Irish law system termed \"Brehon law\", which at the time trumped the established law as dictated by the Crown. The Brehon system had its own court and methods of punishing infractions committed. Spenser viewed this system as a backward custom which contributed to the \"degradation\" of the Irish people. A particular legal punishment viewed with distaste by Spenser was the Brehon method of dealing with murder, which was to impose an \"\u00e9raic\" (fine) on the murderer's family. From Spenser's viewpoint, the appropriate punishment for murder was capital punishment. Spenser also warned of the dangers that allowing the education of children in the Irish language would bring: \"Soe that the speach being Irish, the hart must needes be Irishe; for out of the aboundance of the hart, the tonge speaketh\".\nHe pressed for a scorched earth policy in Ireland, noting its effectiveness in the Second Desmond Rebellion:\n\"'Out of everye corner of the woode and glenns they came creepinge forth upon theire handes, for theire legges could not beare them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spake like ghostes, crying out of theire graves; they did eate of the carrions, happye wheare they could find them, yea, and one another soone after, in soe much as the verye carcasses they spared not to scrape out of theire graves; and if they found a plott of water-cresses or shamrockes, theyr they flocked as to a feast... in a shorte space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentyfull countrye suddenly lefte voyde of man or beast: yett sure in all that warr, there perished not manye by the sworde, but all by the extreamytie of famine ... they themselves had wrought.'\"\nList of works.\n1569: \n1579: \n1590:\n1591:\n1592:\n1595:\n1596:\nPosthumous:\nDigital archive.\nWashington University in St. Louis professor Joseph Lowenstein, with the assistance of several undergraduate students, has been involved in creating, editing, and annotating a digital archive of the first publication of poet Edmund Spenser's collective works in 100 years.

For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage, using for example, the pumped-storage method.\nConsumable electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be \"produced\", transforming other forms of energy to electricity. Production is carried out in power stations, also called \"power plants\". Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission, but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power. There are exotic and speculative methods to recover energy, such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast-moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction (see magnetohydrodynamics). \nPhasing out coal-fired power stations and eventually gas-fired power stations, or, if practical, capturing their greenhouse gas emissions, is an important part of the energy transformation required to limit climate change. Vastly more solar power and wind power is forecast to be required, with electricity demand increasing strongly with further electrification of transport, homes and industry. However, in 2023, it was reported that the global electricity supply was approaching peak CO2 emissions thanks to the growth of solar and wind power.\nHistory.\nThe fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist Michael Faraday. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or Faraday disc, between the poles of a magnet. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current (AC) power transmission, using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.\nCommercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. The mechanical production of electric power began the Second Industrial Revolution and made possible several inventions using electricity, with the major contributors being Thomas Alva Edison and Nikola Tesla. Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the telegraph.\nElectricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a steam engine driving a dynamo at Pearl Street Station produced a DC current that powered public lighting on Pearl Street, New York. The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adapted their gas-fueled street lights to electric power. Soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains.\nThe first power plants used water power or coal. Today a variety of energy sources are used, such as coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and oil, as well as solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal sources.\nIn the 1880s the popularity of electricity grew massively with the introduction of the Incandescent light bulb. Although there are 22 recognised inventors of the light bulb prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison, Edison and Swan's invention became by far the most successful and popular of all. During the early years of the 19th century, massive jumps in electrical sciences were made. And by the later 19th century the advancement of electrical technology and engineering led to electricity being part of everyday life. With the introduction of many electrical inventions and their implementation into everyday life, the demand for electricity within homes grew dramatically. With this increase in demand, the potential for profit was seen by many entrepreneurs who began investing into electrical systems to eventually create the first electricity public utilities. This process in history is often described as electrification.\nThe earliest distribution of electricity came from companies operating independently of one another. A consumer would purchase electricity from a producer, and the producer would distribute it through their own power grid. As technology improved so did the productivity and efficiency of its generation. Inventions such as the steam turbine had a massive impact on the efficiency of electrical generation but also the economics of generation as well. This conversion of heat energy into mechanical work was similar to that of steam engines, however at a significantly larger scale and far more productively. The improvements of these large-scale generation plants were critical to the process of centralised generation as they would become vital to the entire power system that we now use today. \nThroughout the middle of the 20th century many utilities began merging their distribution networks due to economic and efficiency benefits. Along with the invention of long-distance power transmission, the coordination of power plants began to form. This system was then secured by regional system operators to ensure stability and reliability. The electrification of homes began in Northern Europe and in the Northern America in the 1920s in large cities and urban areas. It was not until the 1930s that rural areas saw the large-scale establishment of electrification.\nMethods of generation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSeveral fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. Utility-scale generation is achieved by rotating electric generators or by photovoltaic systems. A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries. Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the triboelectric effect, the piezoelectric effect, the thermoelectric effect, and betavoltaics.\nGenerators.\nElectric generators transform kinetic energy into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity based on Faraday's law. It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of conducting material, e.g. copper wire. Almost all commercial electrical generation uses electromagnetic induction, in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate.\nElectrochemistry.\nElectrochemistry is the direct transformation of chemical energy into electricity, as in a battery. Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries. Primary cells, such as the common zinc\u2013carbon batteries, act as power sources directly, but secondary cells (i.e. rechargeable batteries) are used for storage systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as fuel cells, can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merge.\nPhotovoltaic effect.\nThe photovoltaic effect is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in solar cells. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to DC electricity. Power inverters can then convert that to AC electricity if needed. The photovoltaic industry has undergone spectacular growth since the 1990s.\nEconomics.\nThe selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in widespread residential selling prices. Hydroelectric plants, nuclear power plants, thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. \nAll power grids have varying loads on them. The daily minimum is the base load, often supplied by plants which run continuously. Nuclear, coal, oil, gas and some hydro plants can supply base load. If well construction costs for natural gas are below $10 per MWh, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.\nNuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, nuclear disasters have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high.\nHydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It may not be an economically viable single source of production where the ability to store the flow of water is limited and the load varies too much during the annual production cycle.\nGenerating equipment.\nElectric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of electromagnetic induction in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity. The only commercial scale forms of electricity production that do not employ a generator are photovoltaic solar and fuel cells.\nTurbines.\nAlmost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine, driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including heat engines, hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by heat engines. \nThe combustion of fossil fuels supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from nuclear fission and some from renewable sources. The modern steam turbine, invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884, currently generates about 80% of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include:\nTurbines can also use other heat-transfer liquids than steam. Supercritical carbon dioxide based cycles can provide higher conversion efficiency due to faster heat exchange, higher energy density and simpler power cycle infrastructure. Supercritical carbon dioxide blends, that are currently in development, can further increase efficiency by optimizing its critical pressure and temperature points.\nAlthough turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by gasoline or diesel engines. These may used for backup generation or as a prime source of power within isolated villages.\nWorld production.\nTotal world generation in 2024 was 30,850 TWh, including coal (34%), gas (22%), hydro (14%), nuclear (9%), wind (8%), solar (7%), oil and other fossil fuels (3%), biomass (2%).\nEnvironmental concerns.\nVariations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70% and China is at 80%. The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Methane leaks (from natural gas to fuel gas-fired power plants) and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65% of all emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main component of acid rain. Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of NOx, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter in the US.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), low-carbon electricity generation needs to account for 85% of global electrical output by 2040 in order to ward off the worst effects of climate change. Like other organizations including the Energy Impact Center (EIC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the IEA has called for the expansion of nuclear and renewable energy to meet that objective. Some, like EIC founder Bret Kugelmass, believe that nuclear power is the primary method for decarbonizing electricity generation because it can also power direct air capture that removes existing carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Nuclear power plants can also create district heating and desalination projects, limiting carbon emissions and the need for expanded electrical output.\nA fundamental issue regarding centralised generation and the current electrical generation methods in use today is the significant negative environmental effects that many of the generation processes have. Processes such as coal and gas not only release carbon dioxide as they combust, but their extraction from the ground also impacts the environment. Open pit coal mines use large areas of land to extract coal and limit the potential for productive land use after the excavation. Natural gas extraction releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere when extracted from the ground, which greatly increases global greenhouse gases. Although nuclear power plants do not release carbon dioxide through electricity generation, there are risks associated with nuclear waste and safety concerns associated with the use of nuclear sources. \nPer unit of electricity generated coal and gas-fired power life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are almost always at least ten times that of other generation methods.\nCentralised and distributed generation.\nCentralised generation is electricity generation by large-scale centralised facilities, sent through transmission lines to consumers. These facilities are usually located far away from consumers and distribute the electricity through high voltage transmission lines to a substation, where it is then distributed to consumers; the basic concept being that multi-megawatt or gigawatt scale large stations create electricity for a large number of people. The vast majority of electricity used is created from centralised generation. Most centralised power generation comes from large power plants run by fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, though nuclear or large hydroelectricity plants are also commonly used. \nCentralised generation is fundamentally the opposite of distributed generation. Distributed generation is the small-scale generation of electricity to smaller groups of consumers. This can also include independently producing electricity by either solar or wind power. In recent years distributed generation as has seen a spark in popularity due to its propensity to use renewable energy generation methods such as rooftop solar.\nTechnologies.\nCentralised energy sources are large power plants that produce huge amounts of electricity to a large number of consumers. Most power plants used in centralised generation are thermal power plants meaning that they use a fuel to heat steam to produce a pressurised gas which in turn spins a turbine and generates electricity. This is the traditional way of producing energy. This process relies on several forms of technology to produce widespread electricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale.\nHydroelectricity.\nHydroelectricity is electricity generated from hydropower (water power). Hydropower supplies 15% of the world's electricity, almost 4,210 TWh in 2023, which is more than all other renewable sources combined and also more than nuclear power. Hydropower can provide large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand, making it a key element for creating secure and clean electricity supply systems. A hydroelectric power station that has a dam and reservoir is a flexible source, since the amount of electricity produced can be increased or decreased in seconds or minutes in response to varying electricity demand.\nNatural gas.\nNatural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to spin turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin. \nNatural gas power plants are more efficient than coal power generation, they however contribute to climate change, but not as highly as coal generation. Not only do they produce carbon dioxide from the ignition of natural gas, the extraction of gas when mined releases a significant amount of methane into the atmosphere.\nNuclear.\nNuclear power plants create electricity through steam turbines where the heat input is from the process of nuclear fission. Currently, nuclear power produces 11% of all electricity in the world. Most nuclear reactors use uranium as a source of fuel. In a process called nuclear fission, energy, in the form of heat, is released when nuclear atoms are split. Electricity is created through the use of a nuclear reactor where heat produced by nuclear fission is used to produce steam which in turn spins turbines and powers the generators. Although there are several types of nuclear reactors, all fundamentally use this process.\nNormal emissions due to nuclear power plants are primarily waste heat and radioactive spent fuel. In a reactor accident, significant amounts of radioisotopes can be released to the environment, posing a long term hazard to life. This hazard has been a continuing concern of environmentalists. Accidents such as the Three Mile Island accident, Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima nuclear disaster illustrate this problem.\nElectricity generation capacity by country.\nThe table lists 45 countries with their total electricity capacities. The data is from 2022.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, the total global electricity capacity in 2022 was nearly 8.9 terawatt (TW), more than four times the total global electricity capacity in 1981. The global average per-capita electricity capacity was about 1,120 watts in 2022, nearly two and a half times the global average per-capita electricity capacity in 1981. \nIceland has the highest installed capacity per capita in the world, at about 8,990 watts. All developed countries have an average per-capita electricity capacity above the global average per-capita electricity capacity, with the United Kingdom having the lowest average per-capita electricity capacity of all other developed countries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9541", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9541", "title": "Design of experiments", "text": "Design of tasks\nThe design of experiments (DOE), also known as experiment design or experimental design, is the design of any task that aims to describe and explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The term is generally associated with experiments in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to the design of quasi-experiments, in which natural conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.\nIn its simplest form, an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions, which is represented by one or more independent variables, also referred to as \"input variables\" or \"predictor variables.\" The change in one or more independent variables is generally hypothesized to result in a change in one or more dependent variables, also referred to as \"output variables\" or \"response variables.\" The experimental design may also identify control variables that must be held constant to prevent external factors from affecting the results. Experimental design involves not only the selection of suitable independent, dependent, and control variables, but planning the delivery of the experiment under statistically optimal conditions given the constraints of available resources. There are multiple approaches for determining the set of design points (unique combinations of the settings of the independent variables) to be used in the experiment.\nMain concerns in experimental design include the establishment of validity, reliability, and replicability. For example, these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the independent variable, reducing the risk of measurement error, and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of statistical power and sensitivity.\nCorrectly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering, with design of experiments methodology recognised as a key tool in the successful implementation of a Quality by Design (QbD) framework. Other applications include marketing and policy making. The study of the design of experiments is an important topic in metascience.\nHistory.\nStatistical experiments, following Charles S. Peirce.\nA theory of statistical inference was developed by Charles S. Peirce in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877\u20131878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883), two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics.\nRandomized experiments.\nCharles S. Peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights.\nPeirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1800s.\nOptimal designs for regression models.\nCharles S. Peirce also contributed the first English-language publication on an optimal design for regression models in 1876. A pioneering optimal design for polynomial regression was suggested by Gergonne in 1815. In 1918, Kirstine Smith published optimal designs for polynomials of degree six (and less).\nSequences of experiments.\nThe use of a sequence of experiments, where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments, including the possible decision to stop experimenting, is within the scope of sequential analysis, a field that was pioneered by Abraham Wald in the context of sequential tests of statistical hypotheses. Herman Chernoff wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs, while adaptive designs have been surveyed by S. Zacks. One specific type of sequential design is the \"two-armed bandit\", generalized to the multi-armed bandit, on which early work was done by Herbert Robbins in 1952.\nFisher's principles.\nA methodology for designing experiments was proposed by Ronald Fisher, in his innovative books: \"The Arrangement of Field Experiments\" (1926) and \"The Design of Experiments\" (1935). Much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods. As a mundane example, he described how to test the lady tasting tea hypothesis, that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. These methods have been broadly adapted in biological, psychological, and agricultural research.\nIn some fields of study it is not possible to have independent measurements to a traceable metrology standard. Comparisons between treatments are much more valuable and are usually preferable, and often compared against a scientific control or traditional treatment that acts as baseline.\nRandom assignment is the process of assigning individuals at random to groups or to different groups in an experiment, so that each individual of the population has the same chance of becoming a participant in the study. The random assignment of individuals to groups (or conditions within a group) distinguishes a rigorous, \"true\" experiment from an observational study or \"quasi-experiment\". There is an extensive body of mathematical theory that explores the consequences of making the allocation of units to treatments by means of some random mechanism (such as tables of random numbers, or the use of randomization devices such as playing cards or dice). Assigning units to treatments at random tends to mitigate confounding, which makes effects due to factors other than the treatment to appear to result from the treatment.\nThe risks associated with random allocation (such as having a serious imbalance in a key characteristic between a treatment group and a control group) are calculable and hence can be managed down to an acceptable level by using enough experimental units. However, if the population is divided into several subpopulations that somehow differ, and the research requires each subpopulation to be equal in size, stratified sampling can be used. In that way, the units in each subpopulation are randomized, but not the whole sample. The results of an experiment can be generalized reliably from the experimental units to a larger statistical population of units only if the experimental units are a random sample from the larger population; the probable error of such an extrapolation depends on the sample size, among other things.\nMeasurements are usually subject to variation and measurement uncertainty; thus they are repeated and full experiments are replicated to help identify the sources of variation, to better estimate the true effects of treatments, to further strengthen the experiment's reliability and validity, and to add to the existing knowledge of the topic. However, certain conditions must be met before the replication of the experiment is commenced: the original research question has been published in a peer-reviewed journal or widely cited, the researcher is independent of the original experiment, the researcher must first try to replicate the original findings using the original data, and the write-up should state that the study conducted is a replication study that tried to follow the original study as strictly as possible.\nBlocking is the non-random arrangement of experimental units into groups (blocks) consisting of units that are similar to one another. Blocking reduces known but irrelevant sources of variation between units and thus allows greater precision in the estimation of the source of variation under study.\nOrthogonality concerns the forms of comparison (contrasts) that can be legitimately and efficiently carried out. Contrasts can be represented by vectors and sets of orthogonal contrasts are uncorrelated and independently distributed if the data are normal. Because of this independence, each orthogonal treatment provides different information to the others. If there are \"T\" treatments and \"T\" \u2212 1 orthogonal contrasts, all the information that can be captured from the experiment is obtainable from the set of contrasts.\nUse of multifactorial experiments instead of the one-factor-at-a-time method. These are efficient at evaluating the effects and possible interactions of several factors (independent variables). Analysis of experiment design is built on the foundation of the analysis of variance, a collection of models that partition the observed variance into components, according to what factors the experiment must estimate or test.\nExample.\nThis example of design experiments is attributed to Harold Hotelling, building on examples from Frank Yates. The experiments designed in this example involve combinatorial designs.\nWeights of eight objects are measured using a pan balance and set of standard weights. Each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan and any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium. Each measurement has a random error formula_1. The average error is zero; the standard deviations of the probability distribution of the errors is the same number \u03c3 on different weighings; errors on different weighings are independent. Denote the true weights by\nformula_2.\nWe consider two different experiments with the same amount of measurements:\nLet \"y\"\"i\" be the measured difference for \"i\" = 1, ..., 8. The relationship between the true weights and experimental measurements may be represented with a general linear model, with the design matrix formula_3 having entries from formula_4:\n formula_5\nThe first design is represented by an identity matrix while the second design is represented by an 8x8 Hadamard matrix, formula_6, both examples of weighing matrices.\nThe weights are typically estimated using the method of least squares. Using a weighing matrix, this is equivalent to inverting on the measurements:\nformula_7\nformula_8\nThe question of design of experiments is: \"which experiment is better\"?\nInvestigating estimate A vs B for the first weight:\nformula_9\nformula_10\nA similar result follows for the remaining weight estimates. Thus, the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item, despite costing the same number of resources (number of weightings).\nMany problems of the design of experiments involve combinatorial designs, as in this example and others.\nAvoiding false positives.\nFalse positive conclusions, often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author's own confirmation bias, are an inherent hazard in many fields.\nUse of double-blind designs can prevent biases potentially leading to false positives in the data collection phase. When a double-blind design is used, participants are randomly assigned to experimental groups but the researcher is unaware of what participants belong to which group. Therefore, the researcher can not affect the participants' response to the intervention.\nExperimental designs with undisclosed degrees of freedom are a problem, in that they can lead to conscious or unconscious \"p-hacking\": trying multiple things until you get the desired result. It typically involves the manipulation \u2013 perhaps unconsciously \u2013 of the process of statistical analysis and the degrees of freedom until they return a figure below the p&lt;.05 level of statistical significance.\nP-hacking can be prevented by preregistering researches, in which researchers have to send their data analysis plan to the journal they wish to publish their paper in before they even start their data collection, so no data manipulation is possible.\nAnother way to prevent this is taking a double-blind design to the data-analysis phase, making the study triple-blind, where the data are sent to a data-analyst unrelated to the research who scrambles up the data so there is no way to know which participants belong to before they are potentially taken away as outliers.\nClear and complete documentation of the experimental methodology is also important in order to support replication of results.\nDiscussion topics when setting up an experimental design.\nAn experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment. An experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Some of the following topics have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section:\nThe independent variable of a study often has many levels or different groups. In a true experiment, researchers can have an experimental group, which is where their intervention testing the hypothesis is implemented, and a control group, which has all the same element as the experimental group, without the interventional element. Thus, when everything else except for one intervention is held constant, researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change. In some instances, having a control group is not ethical. This is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups. In some cases, independent variables cannot be manipulated, for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease, or testing the difference between genders (obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to). In these cases, a quasi-experimental design may be used.\nCausal attributions.\nIn the pure experimental design, the independent (predictor) variable is manipulated by the researcher \u2013 that is \u2013 every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population, and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable. Only when this is done is it possible to certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the outcome variables are caused by the different conditions. Therefore, researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible. However, the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation. In those cases, researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn't allow for it. For example, in observational designs, participants are not assigned randomly to conditions, and so if there are differences found in outcome variables between conditions, it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes, that is \u2013 a third variable. The same goes for studies with correlational design.\nStatistical control.\nIt is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments. When this is not possible, proper blocking, replication, and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments.\nTo control for nuisance variables, researchers institute control checks as additional measures. Investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences (e.g., source credibility perception) do not skew the findings of the study. A manipulation check is one example of a control check. Manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned.\nOne of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of spurious, intervening, and antecedent variables. In the most basic model, cause (X) leads to effect (Y). But there could be a third variable (Z) that influences (Y), and X might not be the true cause at all. Z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for. The same is true for intervening variables (a variable in between the supposed cause (X) and the effect (Y)), and anteceding variables (a variable prior to the supposed cause (X) that is the true cause). When a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for, the relation is said to be a zero order relationship. In most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes (X1, X2, X3). In most designs, only one of these causes is manipulated at a time.\nExperimental designs after Fisher.\nSome efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by Raj Chandra Bose and K. Kishen in 1940 at the Indian Statistical Institute, but remained little known until the Plackett\u2013Burman designs were published in \"Biometrika\" in 1946. About the same time, C. R. Rao introduced the concepts of orthogonal arrays as experimental designs. This concept played a central role in the development of Taguchi methods by Genichi Taguchi, which took place during his visit to Indian Statistical Institute in early 1950s. His methods were successfully applied and adopted by Japanese and Indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by US industry albeit with some reservations.\nIn 1950, Gertrude Mary Cox and William Gemmell Cochran published the book \"Experimental Designs,\" which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.\nDevelopments of the theory of linear models have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers. Today, the theory rests on advanced topics in linear algebra, algebra and combinatorics.\nAs with other branches of statistics, experimental design is pursued using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches: In evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs, frequentist statistics studies the sampling distribution while Bayesian statistics updates a probability distribution on the parameter space.\nSome important contributors to the field of experimental designs are C. S. Peirce, R. A. Fisher, F. Yates, R. C. Bose, A. C. Atkinson, R. A. Bailey, D. R. Cox, G. E. P. Box, W. G. Cochran, Walter T. Federer, V. V. Fedorov, A. S. Hedayat, J. Kiefer, O. Kempthorne, J. A. Nelder, Andrej P\u00e1zman, Friedrich Pukelsheim, D. Raghavarao, C. R. Rao, Shrikhande S. S., J. N. Srivastava, William J. Studden, G. Taguchi and H. P. Wynn.\nThe textbooks of D. Montgomery, R. Myers, and G. Box/W. Hunter/J.S. Hunter have reached generations of students and practitioners. Furthermore, there is ongoing discussion of experimental design in the context of model building for models either static or dynamic models, also known as system identification.\nHuman participant constraints.\nLaws and ethical considerations preclude some carefully designed \nexperiments with human subjects. Legal constraints are dependent on \njurisdiction. Constraints may involve \ninstitutional review boards, informed consent \nand confidentiality affecting both clinical (medical) trials and \nbehavioral and social science experiments.\nIn the field of toxicology, for example, experimentation is performed \non laboratory \"animals\" with the goal of defining safe exposure limits \nfor \"humans\". Balancing\nthe constraints are views from the medical field. Regarding the randomization of patients, \n\"... if no one knows which therapy is better, there is no ethical \nimperative to use one therapy or another.\" (p 380) Regarding \nexperimental design, \"...it is clearly not ethical to place subjects \nat risk to collect data in a poorly designed study when this situation \ncan be easily avoided...\".

It is also a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empiricism values some research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions that cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.\nIn some fields, quantitative research may begin with a research question (e.g., \"Does listening to vocal music during the learning of a word list have an effect on later memory for these words?\") which is tested through experimentation. Usually, the researcher has a certain theory regarding the topic under investigation. Based on this theory, statements or hypotheses will be proposed (e.g., \"Listening to vocal music has a negative effect on learning a word list.\"). From these hypotheses, predictions about specific events are derived (e.g., \"People who study a word list while listening to vocal music will remember fewer words on a later memory test than people who study a word list in silence.\"). These predictions can then be tested with a suitable experiment. Depending on the outcomes of the experiment, the theory on which the hypotheses and predictions were based will be supported or not, or may need to be modified and then subjected to further testing.\nHistory.\nThe experimental method has evolved over the ages, with many scientists contributing to its foundation and development. In ancient times, Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle, relied on observation and rational inference in their studies. Aristotle, for example, rejected exclusive reliance on logical deduction, emphasizing the importance of observation in understanding nature.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Muslim scientists significantly advanced the experimental method. Jabir ibn Hayyan, known as the father of chemistry, introduced experimental methodology into chemistry and developed chemical processes such as crystallization, calcination, and distillation. He also discovered important acids like sulfuric and nitric acid, expanding the possibilities of chemical experiments. The famous optics scientist Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) was among the first to rely on experimentation in studying light and vision. In his book \"Book of Optics\", he employed a scientific method based on observation, experimentation, and mathematical proof, making him a pioneer of the modern scientific method.\nThese scientific approaches were transmitted to Europe through translations, influencing the development of modern scientific methodology. European scientists, such as Francis Bacon, were inspired by the works of Muslim scholars in refining the experimental method. The researcher Robert Briffault, in his book \"Making of Humanity\", states:\n\"\"It was under their successors at Oxford School (that is, successors to the Muslims of Spain) that Roger Bacon learned Arabic and Arabic Sciences. Neither Roger Bacon nor later namesake has any title to be credited with having introduced the experimental method. Roger Bacon was no more than one of apostles of Muslim Science and Method to Christian Europe\".\"\nTerminology.\nThe term \"empirical\" was originally used to refer to certain ancient Greek practitioners of medicine who rejected adherence to the dogmatic doctrines of the day, preferring instead to rely on the observation of phenomena as perceived in experience. Later \"empiricism\" referred to a theory of knowledge in philosophy which adheres to the principle that knowledge arises from experience and evidence gathered specifically using the senses. In scientific use, the term \"empirical\" refers to the gathering of data using only evidence that is observable by the senses or in some cases using calibrated scientific instruments. What early philosophers described as empiricist and empirical research have in common is the dependence on observable data to formulate and test theories and come to conclusions.\nUsage.\nThe researcher attempts to describe accurately the interaction between the instrument (or the human senses) and the entity being observed. If instrumentation is involved, the researcher is expected to calibrate his/her instrument by applying it to known standard objects and documenting the results before applying it to unknown objects. In other words, it describes the research that has not taken place before and their results.\nIn practice, the accumulation of evidence for or against any particular theory involves planned research designs for the collection of empirical data, and academic rigor plays a large part of judging the merits of research design. Several typologies for such designs have been suggested, one of the most popular of which comes from Campbell and Stanley. They are responsible for popularizing the widely cited distinction among pre-experimental, experimental, and quasi-experimental designs and are staunch advocates of the central role of randomized experiments in educational research.\nScientific research.\nAccurate analysis of data using standardized statistical methods in scientific studies is critical to determining the validity of empirical research. Statistical formulas such as regression, uncertainty coefficient, t-test, chi square, and various types of ANOVA (analyses of variance) are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions. If empirical data reach significance under the appropriate statistical formula, the research hypothesis is supported. If not, the null hypothesis is supported (or, more accurately, not rejected), meaning no effect of the independent variable(s) was observed on the dependent variable(s).\nThe result of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never \"proof\". It can only \"support\" a hypothesis, \"reject\" it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities. Among scientific researchers, empirical \"evidence\" (as distinct from empirical \"research\") refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well calibrated thermometer, is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.\nThe varying perception of empiricism and rationalism shows concern with the limit to which there is dependency on experience of sense as an effort of gaining knowledge. According to rationalism, there are a number of different ways in which sense experience is gained independently for the knowledge and concepts. According to empiricism, sense experience is considered as the main source of every piece of knowledge and the concepts. \nIn general, rationalists are known for the development of their own views following two different way. First, the key argument can be placed that there are cases in which the content of knowledge or concepts end up outstripping the information. This outstripped information is provided by the sense experience (Hj\u00f8rland, 2010, 2). Second, there is construction of accounts as to how reasoning helps in the provision of addition knowledge about a specific or broader scope. Empiricists are known to be presenting complementary senses related to thought. \nFirst, there is development of accounts of how there is provision of information by experience that is cited by rationalists. This is insofar for having it in the initial place. At times, empiricists tend to be opting skepticism as an option of rationalism. If experience is not helpful in the provision of knowledge or concept cited by rationalists, then they do not exist (Pearce, 2010, 35). Second, empiricists have a tendency of attacking the accounts of rationalists, while considering reasoning to be an important source of knowledge or concepts. \nThe overall disagreement between empiricists and rationalists shows major concerns about how knowledge is gained with respect to the sources of knowledge and concepts. In some of the cases, disagreement on the point of gaining knowledge results in the provision of conflicting responses to other aspects as well. There might be a disagreement in the overall feature of warrant, while limiting the knowledge and thought. Empiricists are known for sharing the view that there is no existence of innate knowledge and rather that is derivation of knowledge out of experience. These experiences are either reasoned using the mind or sensed through the five senses human possess (Bernard, 2011, 5). On the other hand, rationalists are known to be sharing the view that there is existence of innate knowledge and this is different for the objects of innate knowledge being chosen. \nIn order to follow rationalism, there must be adoption of one of the three claims related to the theory that are deduction or intuition, innate knowledge, and innate concept. The more there is removal of concept from mental operations and experience, there can be performance over experience with increased plausibility in being innate. Further ahead, empiricism in context with a specific subject provides a rejection of the corresponding version related to innate knowledge and deduction or intuition (Weiskopf, 2008, 16). Insofar as there is acknowledgement of concepts and knowledge within the area of subject, the knowledge has major dependence on experience through human senses.\nEmpirical cycle.\nA.D. de Groot's empirical cycle:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Engineering statistics involves data concerning manufacturing processes such as: component dimensions, tolerances, type of material, and fabrication process control. There are many methods used in engineering analysis and they are often displayed as histograms to give a visual of the data as opposed to being just numerical. Examples of methods are:\nHistory.\nEngineering statistics dates back to 1000 B.C. when the Abacus was developed as means to calculate numerical data. In the 1600s, the development of information processing to systematically analyze and process data began. In 1654, the Slide Rule technique was developed by https:// for advanced data calculations. In 1833, a British mathematician named Charles Babbage designed the idea of an automatic computer which inspired developers at Harvard University and IBM to design the first mechanical automatic-sequence-controlled calculator called MARK I. The integration of computers and calculators into the industry brought about a more efficient means of analyzing data and the beginning of engineering statistics.\nExamples.\nFactorial Experimental Design.\nA factorial experiment is one where, contrary to the standard experimental philosophy of changing only one independent variable and holding everything else constant, multiple independent variables are tested at the same time. With this design, statistical engineers can see both the direct effects of one independent variable (main effect), as well as potential interaction effects that arise when multiple independent variables provide a different result when together than either would on its own.\nSix Sigma.\nSix Sigma is a set of techniques to improve the reliability of a manufacturing process. Ideally, all products will have the exact same specifications equivalent to what was desired, but countless imperfections of real-world manufacturing makes this impossible. The as-built specifications of a product are assumed to be centered around a mean, with each individual product deviating some amount away from that mean in a normal distribution. The goal of Six Sigma is to ensure that the acceptable specification limits are six standard deviations away from the mean of the distribution; in other words, that each step of the manufacturing process has at most a 0.00034% chance of producing a defect."}

He is widely regarded as one of the central figures of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States and of early American literature. Poe was one of the country's first successful practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered to be the inventor of the detective fiction genre. In addition, he is credited with contributing significantly to the emergence of science fiction. He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living exclusively through writing, which resulted in a financially difficult life and career.\nPoe was born in Boston. He was the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when Eliza died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he lived with them well into young adulthood. Poe attended the University of Virginia but left after only a year due to a lack of money. He frequently quarreled with John Allan over the funds needed to continue his education as well as his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under the assumed name of Edgar A. Perry, he published his first collection, \"Tamerlane and Other Poems\", which was credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife, Frances, in 1829. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared his intention to become a writer, primarily of poems, and parted ways with Allan.\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, when he was 27, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm. She died of tuberculosis in 1847.\nIn January 1845, he published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal, \"The Penn\", later renamed \"The Stylus\". But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown and has been attributed to many causes, including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.\nPoe's works influenced the development of literature throughout the world and even impacted such specialized fields as cosmology and cryptography. Since his death, he and his writings have appeared throughout popular culture in such fields as art, photography, literary allusions, music, motion pictures, and television. Several of his homes are dedicated museums. In addition, The Mystery Writers of America presents an annual Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\nEarly life, family and education.\nEdgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the second child of American actor David Poe Jr. and English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe. He had an elder brother, Henry, and a younger sister, Rosalie. Their grandfather, David Poe, had emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland, around 1750.\nHis father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from pulmonary tuberculosis. The two-year-old Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond, Virginia, who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves. The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\", although they never formally adopted him.\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son. The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815. Poe attended the grammar school in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland (where Allan had been born), before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School in Stoke Newington, then a suburb north of London.\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond, Virginia, in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette. In March 1825, Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 (). By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.\nPoe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder, Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty.\nThe unique system was rather chaotic, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, or procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome to return to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart, Royster, had married another man, Alexander Shelton. Instead, he traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper contributor. Poe started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period.\nMilitary career.\nAs Poe was unable to support himself, he decided to enlist in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name \"Edgar A. Perry\". Although he claimed that he was 22 years old, he was actually 18. He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month. That same year, his first book was published, a 40-page collection of poetry titled \"Tamerlane and Other Poems\", attributed only to \"A Bostonian\". 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. Poe's 1st Regiment of Artillery was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina, before embarking on the brig \"Waltham\" on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman tasked with preparing shells for artillery. His monthly pay doubled. Poe served for two years, attaining the rank of sergeant major for artillery, the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve. He then sought to end his five-year enlistment early.\nPoe revealed his real name and his actual circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who promised to allow Poe to be honorably discharged if he reconciled with Allan. Poe then wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe's pleas. Allan may not have written to Poe to inform him of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829. Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, Allan agreed to support Poe's desire to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.\nPoe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlistment. Before entering West Point, he moved to Baltimore, where he stayed with his widowed aunt, Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. That September, Poe received \"the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard\" in a review of his poetry by influential critic John Neal, which prompted Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal in his second book, \"Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems\", published in Baltimore in 1829.\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson. This marriage and the bitter quarrels with Poe over children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe then decided to leave West Point by intentionally getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, and church. Knowing he would be found guilty, Poe pleaded not guilty to the charges in order to induce dismissal.\nPoe left for New York in February 1831 and then released a third volume of poems, simply titled, \"Poems\". The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, some of whom donated as much as 75 cents to the cause. The total raised was approximately $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones Poe had written about commanding officers in the past. The book was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition\", and included a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\". It once again reprinted the somewhat lengthy poems, \"Tamerlane\", and \"Al Araaf\", while also including six previously unpublished poems, conspicuous among which are, \"To Helen\", and \"The City in the Sea\". Poe returned to Baltimore and to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been seriously ill for some time, in part due to complications resulting from alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.\nPublishing career.\nAfter his brother's death, Poe's earnest attempts to make a living as a writer were mostly unsuccessful. However, he eventually managed to earn a living by his pen alone, becoming one of the first American authors to do so. His efforts were initially hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. American publishers often chose to sell unauthorized copies of works by British authors rather than pay for new work written by Americans, regardless of merit. The initially anemic reception of Edgar Allan Poe's work may also have been influenced by the Panic of 1837.\nThere was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues. Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised, and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.After his early attempts at poetry, Poe turned his attention to prose, perhaps based on John Neal's critiques in \"The Yankee\" magazine. He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama, \"Politian\". The \"Baltimore Saturday Visiter\" awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his often overlooked short story \"MS. Found in a Bottle\". The tale brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his other stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" in Richmond.\nIn 1835, Poe became assistant editor of the \"Southern Literary Messenger\", but White discharged him within a few weeks, allegedly for being drunk on the job. Poe then returned to Baltimore, where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were actually married at that time. He was 26 and she was 13.\nPoe was reinstated by White after promising to improve his behavior, and he returned to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the \"Messenger\" until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, and many book reviews, critiques, essays, and articles, as well as a few stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia were officially married at a Presbyterian wedding ceremony performed by Amasa Converse at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.\nPhiladelphia.\nIn 1838, Poe relocated to Philadelphia, where he lived at five different residences between 1838 and 1844, one of which at 532 N. 7th Street has been preserved as a National Historic Landmark.\nThat same year, Poe's only novel, \"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\" was published and widely reviewed. In the summer of 1839, he became assistant editor of \"Burton's Gentleman's Magazine\". He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing the reputation he had established at the \"Messenger\" as one of America's foremost literary critics. Also in 1839, the collection \"Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque\" was published in two volumes, though Poe received little remuneration from it and the volumes received generally mixed reviews.\nIn June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called \"The Stylus\", although he originally intended to call it \"The Penn\", since it would have been based in Philadelphia. He bought advertising space for the prospectus in the June 6, 1840, issue of Philadelphia's \"Saturday Evening Post\": \"Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.\" However, Poe died before the journal could be produced.\nPoe left \"Burton's\" after a year and found a position as writer and co-editor at \"Graham's Magazine\", which was a successful monthly publication. In the last number of \"Graham's\" for 1841, Poe was among the co-signatories to an editorial note of celebration concerning the tremendous success the magazine had achieved in the past year: \"Perhaps the editors of no magazine, either in America or in Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible. We may assert without fear of contradiction that no periodical ever witnessed the same increase during so short a period.\"\nAround this time, Poe attempted to secure a position in the administration of John Tyler, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party. He hoped to be appointed to the United States Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. However, Poe failed to appear for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were eventually filled by others.\nOne evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, or tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano, which Poe described as the breaking of a blood vessel in her throat. She only partially recovered, and Poe is alleged to have begun to drink heavily due to the stress he suffered as a result of her illness. He then left \"Graham's\" and attempted to find a new position, for a time again angling for a government post. He finally decided to return to New York where he worked briefly at the \"Evening Mirror\" before becoming editor of the \"Broadway Journal\", and later its owner. There Poe alienated himself from other writers by, among other things, publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded. On January 29, 1845, Poe's poem, \"The Raven\", appeared in the \"Evening Mirror\" and quickly became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly, though at the time, he was paid only $9 () for its publication. It was concurrently published in \"\" under the pseudonym \"Quarles\".\nThe Bronx.\nThe \"Broadway Journal\" failed in 1846, and Poe then moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in the Bronx. That home, now known as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, was relocated in later years to a park near the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road. Nearby, Poe befriended the Jesuits at St. John's College, now Fordham University. Virginia died at the cottage on January 30, 1847. Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe's frequent theme of the \"death of a beautiful woman\" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.\nPoe was increasingly unstable after his wife's death. He attempted to court the poet Sarah Helen Whitman, who lived in Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail the relationship. Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.\nDeath.\nOn October 3, 1849, Poe was found semiconscious in Baltimore, \"in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance\", according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him. He was taken to Washington Medical College, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.\nPoe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and why he was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name \"Reynolds\" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. His attending physician said that Poe's final words were, \"Lord help my poor soul\". All of the relevant medical records have been lost, including Poe's death certificate.\nNewspapers at the time reported Poe's death as \"congestion of the brain\" or \"cerebral inflammation\", common euphemisms for death from disreputable causes such as alcoholism. The actual cause of death remains a mystery. Speculation has included \"delirium tremens\", heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation, carbon monoxide poisoning, and rabies. One theory dating from 1872 suggests that Poe's death resulted from cooping, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.\nGriswold's memoir.\nImmediately after Poe's death, his literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold, wrote a slanted, high-profile obituary under a pseudonym, filled with falsehoods that cast Poe as a lunatic, and which described him as a person who \"walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayers, (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned)\".\nThe long obituary appeared in the \"New York Tribune\", signed, \"Ludwig\" on the day Poe was buried in Baltimore. It was further published throughout the country. The obituary began, \"Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.\" \"Ludwig\" was soon identified as Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.\nGriswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called \"Memoir of the Author\", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. There he depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman, including some of Poe's \"letters\" as evidence. Many of his claims were either outright lies or obvious distortions; for example, there is little to no evidence that Edgar Allan Poe was a drug addict. Griswold's book was denounced by those who knew Poe well, including John Neal, who published an article defending Poe and attacking Griswold as a \"Rhadamanthus, who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety\". Griswold's book nevertheless became a popularly accepted biographical source. This was in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an \"evil\" man. Letters that Griswold presented as proof were later revealed as forgeries.\nLiterary style and themes.\nGenres.\nPoe's best-known fiction works have been labeled as Gothic horror, and adhere to that genre's general propensity to appeal to the public's taste for the terrifying or psychologically intimidating. His most recurrent themes seem to deal with death. The physical signs indicating death, the nature of decomposition, the popular concerns of Poe's day about premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, are all at length explored in his more notable works. Many of his writings are generally considered to be part of the dark romanticism genre, which is said to be a literary reaction to transcendentalism, which Poe strongly criticized. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement, including Emerson, as \"Frog-Pondians\", after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as \"metaphor\u2014run mad,\" lapsing into \"obscurity for obscurity's sake\" or \"mysticism for mysticism's sake\". However, Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, \"only the pretenders and sophists among them\".\nBeyond the horror stories he is most famous for, Poe also wrote a number of satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. He was a master of sarcasm. For comic effect, he often used irony and ludicrous extravagance in a deliberate attempt to liberate the reader from cultural and literary conformity. \"Metzengerstein\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published, and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genres of Poe's time. Poe was also one of the forerunners of American science fiction, responding in his voluminous writing to such emerging literary trends as the explorations into the possibilities of hot air balloons as featured in such works as, \"The Balloon-Hoax\".\nMuch of Poe's work coincided with themes that readers of his day found appealing, though he often professed to abhor the tastes of the majority of the people who read for pleasure in his time. In his critical works, Poe investigated and wrote about many of the pseudosciences that were then popular with the majority of his fellow Americans. They included, but were not limited to, the fields of astrology, cosmology, phrenology, and physiognomy.\nLiterary theory.\nPoe's writings often reflect the literary theories he introduced in his prolific critical works and expounded on in such essays as, \"The Poetic Principle\". He disliked didacticism and imitation masquerading as influence, believing originality to be the highest mark of genius. In Poe's conception of the artist's life, the attainment of the concretization of beauty should be the ultimate goal. That which is unique is alone of value. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art. He believed that any work worthy of being praised should have as its focus a single specific effect. That which does not tend towards the effect is extraneous. In his view, every serious writer must carefully calculate each sentiment and idea in his or her work to ensure that it strengthens the theme of the piece.\nPoe describes the method he employed while composing his most famous poem, \"The Raven\", in an essay entitled \"The Philosophy of Composition\". However, many of Poe's critics have questioned whether the method enunciated in the essay was formulated before the poem was written, or afterward, or, as T.\u00a0S. Eliot is quoted as saying, \"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\" Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\".\nLegacy.\nInfluence.\nDuring his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. The vast majority of Edgar Allan Poe's writings are nonfictional. Contemporary critic James Russell Lowell called him, \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America,\" suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's often caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". One target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was defended by his friends, literary and otherwise, in what was later called, \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\".\nPoe became known as the creator of a type of fiction that was difficult to categorize and nearly impossible to imitate. He was one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe was particularly esteemed in France, in part due to early translations of his work by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe.\nPoe's early mystery tales featuring the detective, C. Auguste Dupin, though not numerous, laid the groundwork for similar characters that would eventually become famous throughout the world. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the mystery genre \"The Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced writings that would eventually come to be called \"science fiction\", notably the works of Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel \"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\" called \"An Antarctic Mystery\", also known as \"The Sphinx of the Ice Fields\". And as the author H.\u00a0G. Wells noted, \"\"Pym\" tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, \"The Guardian\" cited \"Pym\" as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell.\nHorror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft described Poe as his \"God of Fiction\". Lovecraft's earliest stories are clearly influenced by Poe. \"At the Mountains of Madness\" directly quotes him. Lovecraft made extensive use of Poe's concept of the \"unity of effect\" in his fiction. Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\". Many references to Poe's works are present in Vladimir Nabokov's novels. The Japanese author Tar\u014d Hirai derived his pen name, Edogawa Ranpo, from an altered phonetic rendering of Poe's name.\nPoe's works have spawned many imitators. In 1863, a medium named Lizzie Doten published \"Poems of the Inner Life\", which compiled several poems she claimed were written by the channeled spirits of dead authors. She claimed six were by Poe, though Poe scholar Christopher P. Semtner dismisses them as \"merely pastiches\".\nPoe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.\nIt is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book \"Tamerlane and Other Poems\". In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.\nPhysics and cosmology.\n\"\", an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the Big Bang theory by 80 years, as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers' paradox.\nPoe eschewed the scientific method in \"Eureka\" and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, \"Eureka\" is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.\nCryptography.\nPoe had a keen interest in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper \"Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger\", inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called \"A Few Words on Secret Writing\" in \"Graham's Magazine\". Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote \"The Gold-Bug\" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story. Poe's success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.\nTwo ciphers he published in 1841 under the name \"W.\u00a0B. Tyler\" were not solved until 1992 and 2000 respectively. One was a quote from Joseph Addison's play \"Cato\"; the other is probably based on a poem by Hester Thrale.\nPoe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. William Friedman, America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe. Friedman's initial interest in cryptography came from reading \"The Gold-Bug\" as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan's PURPLE code during World War\u00a0II.\nPolitical stances.\nPoe was a news writer for a variety of presses including \"Southern Literary Messenger\", \"Burton's Gentleman's Magazine\", \"Graham's Magazine\", and the \"Broadway Journal\". In his news writing, Poe was critical of the American political system and was consequently labeled anti-American and \u201cbitterly hostile.\u201d He often called the government a mobocracy. In the \"Southern Literary Messenger\", he critiqued lynching by calling its proponents \"A trained band of villains\" and \"unlawful and abandoned wretches\".\nIn \"Graham's Magazine\" in 1846, he proposed separating the Appalachian South from the United States and naming it the \"United States of Alleghania\u201d.\nCommemorations and namesake.\nCharacter.\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often in order to represent the \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\" and in order to exploit his personal struggles. Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities. Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as \"The Poe Shadow\" by Matthew Pearl.\nPreserved homes, landmarks, and museums.\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.\nThe earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is at 203 North Amity St. in Baltimore, which is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia and possibly his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe.\nBetween 1834 and 1844, Poe lived in at least four different Philadelphia residences, including the Indian Queen Hotel at 15 S. 4th Street, at a residence at 16th and Locust Streets, at 2502 Fairmount Street, and then in the Spring Garden section of the city at 532 N. 7th Street, a residence that has been preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site. Poe's final home in Bronx, New York City, is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage.\nIn Boston, a commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is several blocks away from the actual location of Poe's birth. The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed \"Charles Street South\". A \"square\" at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor, but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was designated \"Edgar Allan Poe Square\".\nIn March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of a permanent memorial sculpture, known as \"Poe Returning to Boston\", at this location. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a \"paper trail\" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him. The public unveiling on October 5, 2014, was attended by former U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky.\nOther Poe landmarks include a building on the Upper West Side, where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York City. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote \"The Raven\" here. On Sullivan's Island in Charleston County, South Carolina, the setting of Poe's tale \"The Gold-Bug\" and where Poe served in the Army in 1827 at Fort Moultrie, there is a restaurant called Poe's Tavern. In the Fells Point section of Baltimore, a bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death. Known as \"The Horse You Came in On\", local lore insists that a ghost whom they call \"Edgar\" haunts the rooms above.\nPoe Toaster.\nBetween 1949 and 2009, a bottle of cognac and three roses were left at Poe's original grave marker every January 19 by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the \"Poe Toaster\". Sam Porpora was a historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore, where Poe is buried; he claimed on August 15, 2007, that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed, and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate. The Poe Toaster's last appearance was on January 19, 2009, the day of Poe's bicentennial.\nList of selected works.\nShort stories\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPoetry\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther works\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9550", "revid": "1111401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9550", "title": "Electricity", "text": "Phenomena related to electric charge\nElectricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter possessing an electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The motion of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, Coulomb's law determines the force acting on an electric charge. Electric potential is the work done to move an electric charge from one point to another within an electric field, typically measured in volts.\nElectricity plays a central role in many modern technologies, serving in electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment, and in electronics dealing with electrical circuits involving active components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nThe study of electrical phenomena dates back to antiquity, with theoretical understanding progressing slowly until the 17th and 18th centuries. The development of the theory of electromagnetism in the 19th century marked significant progress, leading to electricity's industrial and residential application by electrical engineers by the century's end. This rapid expansion in electrical technology at the time was the driving force behind the Second Industrial Revolution, with electricity's versatility driving transformations in both industry and society. Electricity is integral to applications spanning transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation, making it the foundation of modern industrial society.\nHistory.\nLong before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arab naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artefact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote \"De\u00a0Magnete\", in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the Neo-Latin word \"electricus\" (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\", from \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \"elektron\", the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" of 1646. Isaac Newton made early investigations into electricity, with an idea of his written down in his book \"Opticks\" arguably the beginning of the field theory of the electric force.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.148\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.\nConcepts.\nElectric charge.\nBy modern convention, the charge carried by electrons is defined as negative, and that by protons is positive. Before these particles were discovered, Benjamin Franklin had defined a positive charge as being the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with a silk cloth. A proton by definition carries a charge of exactly . This value is also defined as the elementary charge. No object can have a charge smaller than the elementary charge, and any amount of charge an object may carry is a multiple of the elementary charge. An electron has an equal negative charge, i.e. . Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.\nThe presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended by a fine thread can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: \"like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract\".\nThe force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them. The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.\nCharge originates from certain types of subatomic particles, the most familiar carriers of which are the electron and proton. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.\nCharge can be measured by a number of means, an early instrument being the gold-leaf electroscope, which although still in use for classroom demonstrations, has been superseded by the electronic electrometer.\nElectric current.\nThe movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the \"opposite\" direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nCurrent causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840. One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass.370 He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.\nElectric field.\nThe concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nAn electric field generally varies in space, and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, it follows that an electric field is a vector field.\nThe study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, they may never cross nor close in on themselves.\nA hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore 0 at all places inside the body. This is the operating principle of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell that isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.\nThe principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30\u00a0kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1\u00a0kV per centimetre.2 The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100\u00a0MV and have discharge energies as great as 250\u00a0kWh.\nThe field strength is greatly affected by nearby conducting objects, and it is particularly intense when it is forced to curve around sharply pointed objects. This principle is exploited in the lightning conductor, the sharp spike of which acts to encourage the lightning strike to develop there, rather than to the building it serves to protect.\nElectric potential.\nThe concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. The electric field is \"conservative\", which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.\nFor practical purposes, defining a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared is useful. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge and is therefore electrically uncharged\u2014and unchargeable.\nElectric potential is a scalar quantity. That is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, since otherwise there would be a force along the surface of the conductor that would move the charge carriers to even the potential across the surface.\nThe electric field was formally defined as the force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the electric field is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in volts\u00a0per\u00a0metre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.\nElectromagnets.\n\u00d8rsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it.370 \u00d8rsted's words were that \"the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.\" The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.\n\u00d8rsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Amp\u00e8re, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.\nThis relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.\nExperimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.\nElectric circuits.\nAn electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.\nThe components in an electric circuit can take many forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.\nThe resistor is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance is a consequence of the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter \u03a9. 1\u00a0\u03a9 is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.\nThe capacitor is a development of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol \"F\": one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.\nThe inductor is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current but opposes a rapidly changing one.\nElectric power.\nElectric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.\nElectric power, like mechanical power, is the rate of doing work, measured in watts, and represented by the letter \"P\". The term \"wattage\" is used colloquially to mean \"electric power in watts.\" The electric power in watts produced by an electric current \"I\" consisting of a charge of \"Q\" coulombs every \"t\" seconds passing through an electric potential (voltage) difference of \"V\" is\nformula_1\nwhere\n\"Q\" is electric charge in coulombs\n\"t\" is time in seconds\n\"I\" is electric current in amperes\n\"V\" is electric potential or voltage in volts\nElectric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.\nElectronics.\nElectronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes digital switching possible, and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.\nToday, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The underlying principles that explain how semiconductors work are studied in solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems are part of electronics engineering.\nElectronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain many billions of miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.\nElectromagnetic wave.\nFaraday's and Amp\u00e8re's work showed that a time-varying magnetic field created an electric field, and a time-varying electric field created a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, a field of the other is always induced. These variations are an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that in a vacuum such a wave would travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's equations, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.\nThe work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents and, via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.\nProduction, storage and uses.\nGeneration and transmission.\nIn the 6th century BC the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods: these were the first studies into the production of electricity. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electricity.\nElectrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators. These can be driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion or the heat released from nuclear reactions, but also more directly from the kinetic energy of wind or flowing water. The steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 is still used to convert the thermal energy of steam into a rotary motion that can be used by electro-mechanical generators. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. Electricity generated by solar panels rely on a different mechanism: solar radiation is converted directly into electricity using the photovoltaic effect.\nDemand for electricity grows with great rapidity as a nation modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year of the first three decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China.\nEnvironmental concerns with electricity generation, in particular the contribution of fossil fuel burning to climate change, have led to an increased focus on generation from renewable sources. In the power sector, wind and solar have become cost-effective, speeding up an energy transition away from fossil fuels.\nTransmission and storage.\nThe invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.\nNormally, demand for electricity must match the supply, as storage of electricity is difficult. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses. With increasing levels of variable renewable energy (wind and solar energy) in the grid, it has become more challenging to match supply and demand. Storage plays an increasing role in bridging that gap. There are four types of energy storage technologies, each in varying states of technology readiness: batteries (electrochemical storage), chemical storage such as hydrogen, thermal or mechanical (such as pumped hydropower).\nApplications.\nElectricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.\nThe resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate. Electrification is expected to play a major role in the decarbonisation of sectors that rely on direct fossil fuel burning, such as transport (using electric vehicles) and heating (using heat pumps).\nThe effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and electric cars.\nElectricity is used within telecommunications, and electrical telegraphs. With the construction of transcontinental, and transatlantic telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe.\nElectricity and the natural world.\nPhysiological effects.\nA voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1\u00a0mA to 1\u00a0mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock\u2014electrocution\u2014is still used for judicial execution in some US states, though its use had become very rare by the end of the 20th century.\nElectrical phenomena in nature.\nElectricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, notably lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is due to the natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when pressed. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek \"piezein\" (\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal: when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field it changes size slightly.\nSome organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon; these are electric fish in different orders. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best-known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.\nCultural perception.\nIt is said that in the 1850s, British politician William Ewart Gladstone asked the scientist Michael Faraday why electricity was valuable. Faraday answered, \"One day sir, you may tax it.\" However, according to Snopes.com \"the anecdote should be considered apocryphal because it isn't mentioned in any accounts by Faraday or his contemporaries (letters, newspapers, or biographies) and only popped up well after Faraday's death.\"\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature.69 This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. \"Revitalization\" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored \"Frankenstein\" (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.\nAs public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light,71 such as the workers who \"finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires\" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem \"Sons of Martha\".71 Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the \"Tom Swift\" books.71 The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real\u2014including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla\u2014were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.71\nWith electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it acquired particular attention by popular culture only when it \"stops\" flowing,71 an event that usually signals disaster.71 The people who \"keep\" it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb's song \"Wichita Lineman\" (1968),71 are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.71\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9553", "revid": "8524693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9553", "title": "Empedocles", "text": "5th century BC Greek philosopher\nEmpedocles (; ; c.\u2009494\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009434\u00a0BC, fl. 444\u2013443 BC) was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher and a native citizen of Akragas, a Greek city in Sicily. Empedocles' philosophy is known best for originating the cosmogonic theory of the four classical elements. He also proposed forces he called Love and Strife which would mix and separate the elements, respectively.\nEmpedocles challenged the practice of animal sacrifice and killing animals for food. He developed a distinctive doctrine of reincarnation. He is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to have recorded his ideas in verse. Some of his work survives, more than is the case for any other pre-Socratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.\nLife.\nThe exact dates of Empedocles' birth and death are unknown, and ancient accounts of his life conflict on the exact details. However, they agree that he was born in the early 5th century BC in the Greek city of Akragas in Magna Graecia, present-day Sicily. Modern scholars believe the accuracy of the accounts that he came from a rich and noble family and that his grandfather, also named Empedocles, had won a victory in the horse race at Olympia in the 71st Olympiad (496\u2013495 BC). Little else can be determined with accuracy.\nPrimary sources of information on the life of Empedocles come from the Hellenistic period, several centuries after his own death and long after any reliable evidence about his life would have perished. Modern scholarship generally believes that these biographical details, including Aristotle's assertion that he was the \"father of rhetoric\", his chronologically impossible tutelage under Pythagoras, and his employment as a doctor and miracle worker, were fabricated from interpretations of Empedocles' poetry, as was common practice for the biographies written during this time.\nDeath and legacy.\nAccording to Aristotle, Empedocles died at the age of 60 (c.\u2009430\u00a0BC), but other writers have him living as long as 109 years. Likewise, myths survive about his death: a tradition traced to Heraclides Ponticus posits that some force removed him from Earth somehow, while another tradition had him die in the flames of Sicily\u2019s Mount Etna. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius records the legend that Empedocles threw himself into Mount Etna so people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; the volcano, however, threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that he jumped into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal: he believed he would come back as a god after being consumed by the fire. In \"Icaro-Menippus\", a comedic dialogue written by the second-century satirist Lucian of Samosata, Empedocles's final fate is re-imagined. Rather than being incinerated in Mount Etna, one of its eruptions carries him up into the heavens. Although singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the Moon, surviving on dew.\nBurnet states that, although Empedocles likely did not die in Sicily, both general versions of the story (one in which he kills himself, the other in which he discovers he\u2019s the first man to survive leaving Earth) could be easily accepted by ancient writers, as there was no local tradition to contradict them.\nEmpedocles's death is the subject of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin's play \"Tod des Empedokles\" (\"The Death of Empedocles\") as well as Matthew Arnold's poem \"Empedocles on Etna\".\nLucretius speaks of him enthusiastically, evidently viewing him as his model. Horace also refers to the death of Empedocles in his work \"Ars Poetica\" and admits poets have the right to destroy themselves.\nPhilosophy.\nBased on the surviving fragments of his work, modern scholars generally believe that Empedocles was directly responding to Parmenides' doctrine of monism and was likely acquainted with the work of Anaxagoras, although it is unlikely he was aware of either the later Eleatics or the doctrines of the Atomists. Many later accounts of his life claim that Empedocles studied with the Pythagoreans on the basis of his doctrine of reincarnation, although he may have instead learned this from a local tradition rather than directly from the Pythagoreans. \nHowever, as the Modern Greek philosopher Helle Lambridis has argued, while Empedocles seems to have borrowed from the Eleatic tradition (with Parmenides at its centre) as well as from the Heraclitean and Pythagorean schools of thought, his own philosophy is very different from all these three influences. The work of Empedocles, Lambridis suggests, must be seen in relation to the work of the Greeks as a whole that borrowed elements from Egypt, Babylon and other Eastern cultures to produce a totally different philosophy.\nCosmogony.\nEmpedocles established four ultimate elements which make all the structures in the world\u2014fire, air, water, earth. Empedocles called these four elements \"roots\", which he also identified with the mythical names of Zeus, Hera, Nestis, and Aidoneus (e.g., \"Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with tears\"). Empedocles never used the term \"element\" (, \"stoicheion\"), which seems to have been first used by Plato. According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. One interpreter describes his philosophy as asserting that \"Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element.\" This theory of the four elements became the standard dogma for the next two thousand years.\nThe four elements, however, are simple, eternal, and unalterable, and as change is the consequence of their mixture and separation, it was also necessary to suppose the existence of moving powers that bring about mixture and separation. The four elements are both eternally brought into union and parted from one another by two divine powers, Love and (\"Philotes\" and \"Neikos\"). Love () is responsible for the attraction of different forms of what we now call matter, and Strife () is the cause of their separation. If the four elements make up the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, which are plainly observable in human behavior, but also pervade the universe. The two forces wax and wane in their dominance, but neither force ever wholly escapes the imposition of the other.\nAs the best and original state, there was a time when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.\nEmpedocles attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results\u2014heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts were found to be adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life.\nPsychology.\nLike Pythagoras, Empedocles believed in the transmigration of the soul or metempsychosis, that souls can be reincarnated between humans, animals and even plants. According to him, all humans, or maybe only a selected few among them, were originally long-lived daimons who dwelt in a state of bliss until committing an unspecified crime, possibly bloodshed or perjury. As a consequence, they fell to Earth, where they would be forced to spend 30,000 cycles of metempsychosis through different bodies before being able to return to the sphere of divinity. One's behavior during his lifetime would also determine his next incarnation. Wise people, who have learned the secret of life, are closer to the divine, while their souls similarly are closer to the freedom from the cycle of reincarnations, after which they are able to rest in happiness for eternity. This cycle of mortal incarnation seems to have been inspired by the god Apollo's punishment as a servant to Admetus.\nEmpedocles was a vegetarian and advocated vegetarianism, since the bodies of animals are also dwelling places of punished souls. For Empedocles, all living things were on the same spiritual plane; plants and animals are links in a chain where humans are a link too.\nEmpedocles is credited with the first comprehensive theory of light and vision. Historian Will Durant noted that \"Empedocles suggested that light takes time to pass from one point to another.\" He put forward the idea that we see objects because light streams out of our eyes and touches them. While flawed, this became the fundamental basis on which later Greek philosophers and mathematicians like Euclid would construct some of the most important theories of light, vision, and optics.\nKnowledge is explained by the principle that elements in the things outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves. Like is known by like. The whole body is full of pores and hence respiration takes place over the whole frame. In the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies around us; thus perception occurs. In vision, certain particles go forth from the eye to meet similar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes vision. Perception is not merely a passive reflection of external objects.\nEmpedocles also attempted to explain the phenomenon of respiration by means of an elaborate analogy with the clepsydra, an ancient device for conveying liquids from one vessel to another. This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in Aristotle's \"Physics\" where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that void does not exist. The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the corporeality of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void, and there is no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras.\nWritings.\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles wrote two poems, \"On Nature\" and \"On Purifications\", which together comprised 5000 lines. However, only some 550 lines of his poetry survive, quoted in fragments by later ancient sources.\nIn old editions of Empedocles, about 450 lines were ascribed to \"On Nature\" which outlined his philosophical system, and explains not only the nature and history of the universe, including his theory of the four classical elements, but also theories on causation, perception, and thought, as well as explanations of terrestrial phenomena and biological processes. The other 100 lines were typically ascribed to his \"Purifications\", which was taken to be a poem about ritual purification, or the poem that contained all his religious and ethical thought, which early editors supposed that it was a poem that offered a mythical account of the world which may, nevertheless, have been part of Empedocles' philosophical system.\nA late 20th century discovery has changed this situation. The Strasbourg papyrus contains a large section of \"On Nature\", including many lines formerly attributed to \"On Purifications\". This has raised considerable debate about whether the surviving fragments of his teaching should be attributed to two separate poems, with different subject matter; whether they may all derive from one poem with two titles; or whether one title refers to part of the whole poem.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9555", "revid": "39191556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9555", "title": "Ericaceae", "text": "Heather family of flowering plants\nThe Ericaceae () are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the heath or heather family, found most commonly in acidic and infertile growing conditions. The family is large, with about 4,250 known species spread across 124 genera, making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants. The many well known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various common heaths and heathers (\"Erica\", \"Cassiope\", \"Daboecia\", and \"Calluna\" for example).\nDescription.\nThe Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees. Their leaves are usually evergreen, alternate or whorled, simple and without stipules. Their flowers are hermaphrodite and show considerable variability. The petals are often fused (sympetalous) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely urn-shaped. The corollas are usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) and urn-shaped, but many flowers of the genus \"Rhododendron\" are somewhat bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). Anthers open by pores.\nTaxonomy.\nMichel Adanson used the term Vaccinia to describe a similar family, but first used the term Ericaceae. The name comes from the type genus \"Erica\", which appears to be derived from the Greek word (). The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning 'heather'. The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants before Linnaean times, and simply been formalised when Linnaeus described \"Erica\" in 1753, and then again when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.\nHistorically, the Ericaceae included both subfamilies and tribes. In 1971, Stevens, who outlined the history from 1876 and in some instances 1839, recognised six subfamilies (Rhododendroideae, Ericoideae, Vaccinioideae, Pyroloideae, Monotropoideae, and Wittsteinioideae), and further subdivided four of the subfamilies into tribes, the Rhododendroideae having seven tribes (Bejarieae, Rhodoreae, Cladothamneae, Epigaeae, Phyllodoceae, and Diplarcheae). Within tribe Rhodoreae, five genera were described, \"Rhododendron\" L. (including \"Azalea\" L. pro parte), \"Therorhodion\" Small, \"Ledum\" L., \"Tsusiophyllum\" Max., \"Menziesia\" J. E. Smith, that were eventually transferred into \"Rhododendron\", along with Diplarche from the monogeneric tribe Diplarcheae.\nIn 2002, systematic research resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a phylogenetic framework. The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group. One possible classification of the resulting family includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4,000 species:\nDistribution and ecology.\nThe Ericaceae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental Antarctica, parts of the high Arctic, central Greenland, northern and central Australia, and much of the lowland tropics and neotropics.\nThe family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile, shady conditions. Due to their tolerance of acidic conditions, this plant family is also typical of peat bogs and blanket bogs; examples include \"Rhododendron groenlandicum\" and species in the genus \"Kalmia\". In eastern North America, members of this family often grow in association with an oak canopy, in a habitat known as an oak\u2013heath forest. Plants in Ericaceae, especially species in \"Vaccinium\", rely on buzz pollination for successful pollination to occur.\nThe majority of ornamental species from \"Rhododendron\" are native to East Asia, but most varieties cultivated today are hybrids. Most rhododendrons grown in the United States are cultivated in the Pacific Northwest. The United States is the top producer of both blueberries and cranberries, with the state of Maine growing the majority of lowbush blueberry. The wide distribution of genera within Ericaceae has led to situations in which distinct American and European plants share the same common name, e.g. blueberry (\"Vaccinium corymbosum\" in North America and \"V.\"\u00a0\"myrtillus\" in Europe) and cranberry (\"V.\"\u00a0\"macrocarpon\" in America and \"V.\"\u00a0\"oxycoccos\" in Europe).\nMycorrhizal relationships.\nLike other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal fungi to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile soils, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients. This trait is not found in the Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae, the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, and some Epacridoideae) form a distinctive accumulation of mycorrhizae, in which fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients. The Pyroloideae are mixotrophic and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.\nThe cultivation of blueberries, cranberries, and wintergreen for their fruit and oils relies especially on these unique relationships with fungi, as a healthy mycorrhizal network in the soil helps the plants to resist environmental stresses that might otherwise damage crop yield. Ericoid mycorrhizae are responsible for a high rate of uptake of nitrogen, which causes naturally low levels of free nitrogen in ericoid soils. These mycorrhizal fungi may also increase the tolerance of Ericaceae to heavy metals in soil, and may cause plants to grow faster by producing phytohormones.\nHeathlands.\nIn many parts of the world, a \"heath\" or \"heathland\" is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-shrub community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in Ericaceae. Heathlands are a broadly anthropogenic habitat, requiring regular grazing or burning to prevent succession. Heaths are particularly abundant\u00a0\u2013 and constitute important cultural elements\u00a0\u2013 in Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and other countries in Central and Western Europe. The most common examples of plants in Ericaceae which dominate heathlands are \"Calluna vulgaris\", \"Erica cineria\", \"Erica tetralix\", and \"Vaccinium myrtillus.\"\nIn heathland, plants in Ericaceae serve as host plants to the butterfly \"Plebejus argus\". Other insects, such as \"Saturnia pavonia\", \"Myrmeleotettix maculatus\", \"Metrioptera brachyptera\", and \"Picromerus bidens\" are closely associated with heathland environments. Reptiles thrive in heaths due to an abundance of sunlight and prey, and birds hunt the insects and reptiles which are present.\nSome evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as \"Erica tetralix\" to grasslands. Nitrogen is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9559", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9559", "title": "Electrical network", "text": "Assemblage of connected electrical elements\nAn electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components (e.g., batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches, transistors) or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements (e.g., voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). An electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current. Thus all circuits are networks, but not all networks are circuits (although networks without a closed loop are often referred to as open circuits).\nA \"resistive network\" is a network containing only resistors and ideal current and voltage sources. Analysis of resistive networks is less complicated than analysis of networks containing capacitors and inductors. If the sources are constant (DC) sources, the result is a DC network. The effective resistance and current distribution properties of arbitrary resistor networks can be modeled in terms of their graph measures and geometrical properties.\nA network that contains active electronic components is known as an \"electronic circuit\". Such networks are generally nonlinear and require more complex design and analysis tools.\nClassification.\nBy passivity.\nAn active network contains at least one voltage source or current source that can supply energy to the network indefinitely. A passive network does not contain an active source.\nAn active network contains one or more sources of electromotive force. Practical examples of such sources include a battery or a generator. Active elements can inject power to the circuit, provide power gain, and control the current flow within the circuit.\nPassive networks do not contain any sources of electromotive force. They consist of passive elements like resistors and capacitors.\nBy linearity.\nLinear electrical networks, a special type consisting only of sources (voltage or current), linear lumped elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors), and linear distributed elements (transmission lines), have the property that signals are linearly superimposable. They are thus more easily analyzed, using powerful frequency domain methods such as Laplace transforms, to determine DC response, AC response, and transient response.\nPassive networks are generally taken to be linear, but there are exceptions. For instance, an inductor with an iron core can be driven into saturation if driven with a large enough current. In this region, the behaviour of the inductor is very non-linear.\nBy lumpiness.\nDiscrete passive components (resistors, capacitors and inductors) are called \"lumped elements\" because all of their, respectively, resistance, capacitance and inductance is assumed to be located (\"lumped\") at one place. This design philosophy is called the lumped-element model and networks so designed are called \"lumped-element circuits\". This is the conventional approach to circuit design. At high enough frequencies, or for long enough circuits (such as power transmission lines), the lumped assumption no longer holds because there is a significant fraction of a wavelength across the component dimensions. A new design model is needed for such cases called the distributed-element model. Networks designed to this model are called \"distributed-element circuits\".\nA distributed-element circuit that includes some lumped components is called a \"semi-lumped\" design. An example of a semi-lumped circuit is the combline filter.\nClassification of sources.\nSources can be classified as independent sources and dependent sources.\nIndependent.\nAn ideal independent source maintains the same voltage or current regardless of the other elements present in the circuit. Its value is either constant (DC) or sinusoidal (AC). The strength of voltage or current is not changed by any variation in the connected network.\nDependent.\nDependent sources depend upon a particular element of the circuit for delivering the power or voltage or current depending upon the type of source it is.\nApplying electrical laws.\nA number of electrical laws apply to all linear resistive networks. These include:\nApplying these laws results in a set of simultaneous equations that can be solved either algebraically or numerically. The laws can generally be extended to networks containing reactances. They cannot be used in networks that contain nonlinear or time-varying components.\nDesign methods.\nTo design any electrical circuit, either analog or digital, electrical engineers need to be able to predict the voltages and currents at all places within the circuit. Simple linear circuits can be analyzed by hand using complex number theory. In more complex cases the circuit may be analyzed with specialized computer programs or estimation techniques such as the piecewise-linear model.\nCircuit simulation software, such as HSPICE (an analog circuit simulator), and languages such as VHDL-AMS and verilog-AMS allow engineers to design circuits without the time, cost and risk of error involved in building circuit prototypes.\nNetwork simulation software.\nMore complex circuits can be analyzed numerically with software such as SPICE or GNUCAP, or symbolically using software such as SapWin.\nLinearization around operating point.\nWhen faced with a new circuit, the software first tries to find a steady state solution, that is, one where all nodes conform to Kirchhoff's current law \"and\" the voltages across and through each element of the circuit conform to the voltage/current equations governing that element.\nOnce the steady state solution is found, the \"operating points\" of each element in the circuit are known. For a small signal analysis, every non-linear element can be linearized around its operation point to obtain the small-signal estimate of the voltages and currents. This is an application of Ohm's Law. The resulting linear circuit matrix can be solved with Gaussian elimination.\nPiecewise-linear approximation.\nSoftware such as the PLECS interface to Simulink uses piecewise-linear approximation of the equations governing the elements of a circuit. The circuit is treated as a completely linear network of ideal diodes. Every time a diode switches from on to off or vice versa, the configuration of the linear network changes. Adding more detail to the approximation of equations increases the accuracy of the simulation, but also increases its running time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9566", "revid": "17692702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9566", "title": "Empty set", "text": "Mathematical set containing no elements\nIn mathematics, the empty set or void set is the unique set having no elements; its size or cardinality (count of elements in a set) is zero. Some axiomatic set theories ensure that the empty set exists by including an axiom of empty set, while in other theories, its existence can be deduced. Many possible properties of sets are vacuously true for the empty set.\nAny set other than the empty set is called \"non-empty\".\nIn some textbooks and popularizations, the empty set is referred to as the \"null set\". However, null set is a distinct notion within the context of measure theory, in which it describes a set of measure zero (which is not necessarily empty).\nNotation.\nCommon notations for the empty set include \"{ }\", \"formula_1\", and \"\u2205\". The latter two symbols were introduced by the Bourbaki group (specifically Andr\u00e9 Weil) in 1939, inspired by the letter \u00d8 () in the Danish and Norwegian alphabets. In the past, \"0\" (the numeral zero) was occasionally used as a symbol for the empty set, but this is now considered to be an improper use of notation.\nThe symbol \u2205 is available at Unicode point . It can be coded in HTML as and as or as . It can be coded in LaTeX as . The symbol formula_1 is coded in LaTeX as .\nWhen writing in languages such as Danish and Norwegian, where the empty set character may be confused with the alphabetic letter \u00d8 (as when using the symbol in linguistics), the Unicode character may be used instead.\nProperties.\nIn standard axiomatic set theory, by the principle of extensionality, two sets are equal if they have the same elements (that is, neither of them has an element not in the other). As a result, there can be only one set with no elements, hence the usage of \"the empty set\" rather than \"an empty set\".\nThe only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself; equivalently, the power set of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set. The number of elements of the empty set (i.e., its cardinality) is zero. The empty set is the only set with either of these properties.\nFor any set \"A\":\nFor any property \"P\":\nConversely, if for some property \"P\" and some set \"V\", the following two statements hold:\nthen formula_5\nBy the definition of subset, the empty set is a subset of any set \"A\". That is, every element \"x\" of formula_3 belongs to \"A\". Indeed, if it were not true that every element of formula_3 is in \"A\", then there would be at least one element of formula_3 that is not present in \"A\". Since there are no elements of formula_3 at all, there is no element of formula_3 that is not in \"A\". Any statement that begins \"for every element of formula_3\" is not making any substantive claim; it is a vacuous truth. This is often paraphrased as \"everything is true of the elements of the empty set.\"\nIn the usual set-theoretic definition of natural numbers, zero is modelled by the empty set.\nOperations on the empty set.\nWhen speaking of the sum of the elements of a finite set, one is inevitably led to the convention that the sum of the elements of the empty set (the empty sum) is zero. The reason for this is that zero is the identity element for addition. Similarly, the product of the elements of the empty set (the empty product) should be considered to be one, since one is the identity element for multiplication.\nA derangement is a permutation of a set without fixed points. The empty set can be considered a derangement of itself, because it has only one permutation (formula_12), and it is vacuously true that no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position.\nIn other areas of mathematics.\nExtended real numbers.\nSince the empty set has no member when it is considered as a subset of any ordered set, every member of that set will be an upper bound and lower bound for the empty set. For example, when considered as a subset of the real numbers, with its usual ordering, represented by the real number line, every real number is both an upper and lower bound for the empty set. When considered as a subset of the extended reals formed by adding two \"numbers\" or \"points\" to the real numbers (namely negative infinity, denoted formula_13 which is defined to be less than every other extended real number, and positive infinity, denoted formula_14 which is defined to be greater than every other extended real number), we have that: \nformula_15\nand\nformula_16\nThat is, the least upper bound (sup or supremum) of the empty set is negative infinity, while the greatest lower bound (inf or infimum) is positive infinity. By analogy with the above, in the domain of the extended reals, negative infinity is the identity element for the maximum and supremum operators, while positive infinity is the identity element for the minimum and infimum operators.\nTopology.\nIn any topological space formula_17, the empty set is open by definition, as is formula_17. Since the complement of an open set is closed and the empty set and formula_17 are complements of each other, the empty set is also closed, making it a clopen set. Moreover, the empty set is compact by the fact that every finite set is compact.\nA topological space formula_17 is said to have the indiscrete topology if the only open sets are formula_3 and the entire space.\nThe closure of the empty set is empty. This is known as \"preservation of nullary unions\".\nCategory theory.\nIf formula_22 is a set, then there exists precisely one function formula_23 from formula_3 to formula_25 the empty function. As a result, the empty set is the unique initial object of the category of sets and functions.\nThe empty set can be turned into a topological space, called the empty space, in just one way: by defining the empty set to be open. This empty topological space is the unique initial object in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps. In fact, it is a strict initial object: only the empty set has a function to the empty set.\nSet theory.\nIn the von Neumann construction of the ordinals, 0 is defined as the empty set, and the successor of an ordinal is defined as formula_26. Thus, we have formula_27, formula_28, formula_29, and so on. The von Neumann construction, along with the axiom of infinity, which guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, can be used to construct the set of natural numbers, formula_30, such that the Peano axioms of arithmetic are satisfied.\nExistence.\nHistorical issues.\nIn the context of sets of real numbers, Cantor used formula_31 to denote \"formula_32 contains no single point\". This formula_33 notation was utilized in definitions; for example, Cantor defined two sets as being disjoint if their intersection has an absence of points; however, it is debatable whether Cantor viewed formula_34 as an existent set on its own, or if Cantor merely used formula_33 as an emptiness predicate. Zermelo accepted formula_34 itself as a set, but considered it an \"improper set\".\nAxiomatic set theory.\nIn Zermelo set theory, the existence of the empty set is assured by the axiom of empty set, and its uniqueness follows from the axiom of extensionality. However, the axiom of empty set can be shown redundant in at least two ways:\nPhilosophical issues.\nWhile the empty set is a standard and widely accepted mathematical concept, it remains an ontological curiosity, whose meaning and usefulness are debated by philosophers and logicians.\nThe empty set is not the same thing as nothing; rather, it is a set with nothing inside it and a set is always something. This issue can be overcome by viewing a set as a bag\u2014an empty bag undoubtedly still exists. Darling (2004) explains that the empty set is not nothing, but rather \"the set of all triangles with four sides, the set of all numbers that are bigger than nine but smaller than eight, and the set of all opening moves in chess that involve a king.\"\nThe popular syllogism\nNothing is better than eternal happiness; a ham sandwich is better than nothing; therefore, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness\nis often used to demonstrate the philosophical relation between the concept of nothing and the empty set. Darling writes that the contrast can be seen by rewriting the statements \"Nothing is better than eternal happiness\" and \"[A] ham sandwich is better than nothing\" in a mathematical tone. According to Darling, the former is equivalent to \"The set of all things that are better than eternal happiness is formula_3\" and the latter to \"The set {ham sandwich} is better than the set formula_3\". The first compares elements of sets, while the second compares the sets themselves.\nJonathan Lowe argues that while the empty set\nwas undoubtedly an important landmark in the history of mathematics,\u00a0\u2026 we should not assume that its utility in calculation is dependent upon its actually denoting some object.\nit is also the case that:\n\"All that we are ever informed about the empty set is that it (1) is a set, (2) has no members, and (3) is unique amongst sets in having no members. However, there are very many things that 'have no members', in the set-theoretical sense\u2014namely, all non-sets. It is perfectly clear why these things have no members, for they are not sets. What is unclear is how there can be, uniquely amongst sets, a set which has no members. We cannot conjure such an entity into existence by mere stipulation.\"\nGeorge Boolos argued that much of what has been heretofore obtained by set theory can just as easily be obtained by plural quantification over individuals, without reifying sets as singular entities having other entities as members.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9567", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9567", "title": "Egoism", "text": "Philosophy concerning self-regarding motivations or behaviour\nEgoism is a philosophy concerned with the role of the self, or ego, as the motivation and goal of one's own action. Different theories of egoism encompass a range of disparate ideas and can generally be categorized into descriptive or normative forms. That is, they may be interested in either describing that people \"do\" act in self-interest or prescribing that they \"should\". Other definitions of egoism may instead emphasise action according to one's will rather than one's self-interest, and furthermore posit that this is a truer sense of egoism.\nThe \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" states of egoism that it \"incorporates in itself certain basic truths: it is natural for man to love himself; he should moreover do so, since each one is ultimately responsible for himself; pleasure, the development of one's potentialities, and the acquisition of power are normally desirable.\" The moral censure of self-interest is a common subject of critique in egoist philosophy, with such judgments being examined as means of control and the result of power relations. Egoism may also reject the idea that insight into one's internal motivation can arrive extrinsically, such as from psychology or sociology, though, for example, this is not present in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.\nOverview.\nThe term egoism is derived from the French , from the Latin (first person singular personal pronoun; \"I\") with the French (\"-ism\").\nDescriptive theories.\nThe descriptive variants of egoism are concerned with self-regard as a factual description of human motivation and, in its furthest application, that all human motivation stems from the desires and interest of the ego. In these theories, action which is self-regarding may be simply termed \"egoistic\".\nThe position that people \"tend\" to act in their own self-interest is called default egoism, whereas psychological egoism is the position that \"all\" motivations are rooted in an ultimately self-serving psyche. That is, in its strong form, that even seemingly altruistic actions are only disguised as such and are always self-serving. Its weaker form instead holds that, even if altruistic motivation is possible, the willed action necessarily becomes egoistic in serving one's own will. In contrast to this and philosophical egoism, biological egoism (also called evolutionary egoism) describes motivations rooted solely in reproductive self-interest (i.e. reproductive fitness). Furthermore, selfish gene theory holds that it is the self-interest of genetic information that conditions human behaviour.\nNormative theories.\nTheories which hold egoism to be normative stipulate that the ego ought to promote its own interests above other values. Where this ought is held to be a pragmatic judgment it is termed rational egoism and where it is held to be a moral judgment it is termed ethical egoism. The \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" states that \"ethical egoism might also apply to things other than acts, such as rules or character traits\" but that such variants are uncommon. Furthermore, conditional egoism is a consequentialist form of ethical egoism which holds that egoism is morally right if it leads to morally acceptable ends. John F. Welsh, in his work \"Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism: A New Interpretation\", coins the term dialectical egoism to describe an interpretation of the egoist philosophy of Max Stirner as being fundamentally dialectical.\nNormative egoism, as in the case of Stirner, need not reject that some modes of behavior are to be valued above others\u2014such as Stirner's affirmation that non-restriction and autonomy are to be most highly valued. Contrary theories, however, may just as easily favour egoistic domination of others.\nTheoreticians.\nNietzsche.\nI submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as \"we,\" other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things:\u2014if he sought a designation for it he would say: \"It is justice itself.\" \u2014\u200aFriedrich Nietzsche, \"Beyond Good and Evil\"\nThe philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche has been linked to forms of both descriptive and normative egoism. Nietzsche, in attacking the widely held moral abhorrence for egoistic action, seeks to free higher human beings from their belief that this morality is good for them. He rejects Christian and Kantian ethics as merely the disguised egoism of slave morality.\nThe word \"good\" is from the start \"in no way\" necessarily tied up with \"unegoistic\" actions, as it is in the superstition of those genealogists of morality. Rather, that occurs for the first time with the \"collapse\" of aristocratic value judgments, when this entire contrast between \"egoistic\" and \"unegoistic\" pressed itself ever more strongly into human awareness\u2014it is, to use my own words, the \"instinct of the herd\" which, through this contrast, finally gets its word (and its \"words\"). \u2014\u200aFriedrich Nietzsche, \"On the Genealogy of Morals\"\nIn his \"On the Genealogy of Morals\", Friedrich Nietzsche traces the origins of master\u2013slave morality to fundamentally egoistic value judgments. In the aristocratic valuation, excellence and virtue come as a form of superiority over the common masses, which the priestly valuation, in \"ressentiment\" of power, seeks to invert\u2014where the powerless and pitiable become the moral ideal. This upholding of unegoistic actions is therefore seen as stemming from a desire to reject the superiority or excellency of others. He holds that all normative systems which operate in the role often associated with morality favor the interests of some people, often, though not necessarily, at the expense of others.\nNevertheless, Nietzsche also states \"in the same book\" that there is no 'doer' of any acts, be they selfish or not:\n...there is no \"being\" behind doing, effecting, becoming; \"the doer\" is merely a fiction added to the deed\u2014the deed is everything.(\u00a713) \u2014\u200aFriedrich Nietzsche, \"On the Genealogy of Morals\"\nJonas Monte of Brigham Young University argues that Nietzsche doubted if any 'I' existed in the first place, which the former defined as \"a conscious Ego who commands mental states\".\nRelation to altruism.\nIn 1851, French philosopher Auguste Comte coined the term altruism (; from it \" altrui\", from la \" alteri\"\u00a0'others') as an antonym for egoism. In this sense, altruism defined Comte's position that all self-regard must be replaced with only the regard for others.\nWhile Friedrich Nietzsche does not view altruism as a suitable antonym for egoism, Comte instead states that only two human motivations exist, egoistic and altruistic, and that the two cannot be mediated; that is, one must always predominate the other. For Comte, the total subordination of the self to altruism is a necessary condition to both social and personal benefit. Nietzsche, rather than rejecting the practice of altruism, warns that despite there being neither much altruism nor equality in the world, there is almost universal endorsement of their value and, notoriously, even by those who are its worst enemies in practice. Egoist philosophy commonly views the subordination of the self to altruism as either a form of domination that limits freedom, an unethical or irrational principle, or an extension of some egoistic root cause.\nIn evolutionary theory, biological altruism is the observed occurrence of an organism acting to the benefit of others at the cost of its own reproductive fitness. While biological egoism does grant that an organism may act to the benefit of others, it describes only such when in accordance with reproductive self-interest. Kin altruism and selfish gene theory are examples of this division. On biological altruism, the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" states: \"Contrary to what is often thought, an evolutionary approach to human behaviour does not imply that humans are likely to be motivated by self-interest alone. One strategy by which \u2018selfish genes\u2019 may increase their future representation is by causing humans to be \"non\"-selfish, in the psychological sense.\" This is a central topic within contemporary discourse of psychological egoism.\nPhilosophies of personal identity such as open individualism have implications for egoism and altruism. Daniel Kolak argues that closed individualism, the idea that one's identity consists of a line stretching across time and that a future self exists, is incoherent. Kolak instead argues that personal identity is an illusion, and the \"self\" doesn't actually exist, similar to the idea of anatt\u0101 in Buddhist philosophy. Thus, it could be argued that egoism is incoherent, since there is no \"self\" in the first place. Similar arguments have been made by Derek Parfit in the book \"Reasons and Persons\" with ideas such as the teletransportation paradox.\nRelation to nihilism.\nThe history of egoist thought has often overlapped with that of nihilism. For example, Max Stirner's rejection of absolutes and abstract concepts often places him among the first philosophical nihilists. The popular description of Stirner as a moral nihilist, however, may fail to encapsulate certain subtleties of his ethical thought. The \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" states, \"Stirner is clearly committed to the non-nihilistic view that certain kinds of character and modes of behaviour (namely autonomous individuals and actions) are to be valued above all others. His conception of morality is, in this respect, a narrow one, and his rejection of the legitimacy of moral claims is not to be confused with a denial of the propriety of all normative or ethical judgement.\" Stirner's nihilism may instead be understood as cosmic nihilism. Likewise, both normative and descriptive theories of egoism further developed under Russian nihilism, shortly giving birth to rational egoism. Nihilist philosophers Dmitry Pisarev and Nikolay Chernyshevsky were influential in this regard, compounding such forms of egoism with hard determinism.\nMax Stirner's philosophy strongly rejects modernity and is highly critical of the increasing dogmatism and oppressive social institutions that embody it. In order that it might be surpassed, egoist principles are upheld as a necessary advancement beyond the modern world. The \"Stanford Encyclopedia\" states that Stirner's historical analyses serve to \"undermine historical narratives which portray the modern development of humankind as the progressive realisation of freedom, but also to support an account of individuals in the modern world as increasingly oppressed\". This critique of humanist discourses especially has linked Stirner to more contemporary poststructuralist thought.\nPolitical egoism.\nSince normative egoism rejects the moral obligation to subordinate the ego to society-at-large or to a ruling class, it may be predisposed to certain political implications. The \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Egoists ironically can be read as moral and political egalitarians glorifying the dignity of each and every person to pursue life as they see fit. Mistakes in securing the proper means and appropriate ends will be made by individuals, but if they are morally responsible for their actions they not only will bear the consequences but also the opportunity for adapting and learning.\nIn contrast with this however, such an ethic may not morally obligate against the egoistic exercise of power over others. On these grounds, Friedrich Nietzsche criticizes egalitarian morality and political projects as unconducive to the development of human excellence. Max Stirner's own conception, the union of egoists as detailed in his work \"The Ego and Its Own\", saw a proposed form of societal relations whereby limitations on egoistic action are rejected. When posthumously adopted by the anarchist movement, this became the foundation for egoist anarchism.\nStirner's variant of property theory is similarly dialectical, where the concept of ownership is only that personal distinction made between what is one's property and what is not. Consequentially, it is the exercise of control over property which constitutes the nonabstract possession of it. In contrast to this, Ayn Rand incorporates capitalist property rights into her egoist theory.\nRevolutionary politics.\nEgoist philosopher Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevskii was the dominant intellectual figure behind the 1860\u20131917 revolutionary movement in Russia, which resulted in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II eight years before his death in 1889. Dmitry Pisarev was a similarly radical influence within the movement, though he did not personally advocate political revolution.\nPhilosophical egoism has also found wide appeal among anarchist revolutionaries and thinkers, such as John Henry Mackay, Benjamin Tucker, \u00c9mile Armand, Han Ryner G\u00e9rard de Lacaze-Duthiers, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Gim\u00e9nez Igualada, and Lev Chernyi. Though he did not involve in any revolutionary movements himself, the entire school of individualist anarchism owes much of its intellectual heritage to Max Stirner.\nEgoist philosophy may be misrepresented as a principally revolutionary field of thought. However, neither Hobbesian nor Nietzschean theories of egoism approve of political revolution. Anarchism and revolutionary socialism were also strongly rejected by Ayn Rand and her followers.\nFascism.\nThe philosophies of both Nietzsche and Stirner were heavily appropriated (or possibly expropriated) by fascist and proto-fascist ideologies. Nietzsche in particular has infamously been represented as a predecessor to Nazism and a substantial academic effort was necessary to disassociate his ideas from their aforementioned appropriation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At first sight, Nazi totalitarianism may seem the opposite of Stirner's radical individualism. But fascism was above all an attempt to dissolve the social ties created by history and replace them by artificial bonds among individuals who were expected to render explicit obedience to the state on grounds of absolute egoism. Fascist education combined the tenets of asocial egoism and unquestioning conformism, the latter being the means by which the individual secured his own niche in the system. Stirner's philosophy has nothing to say against conformism, it only objects to the Ego being subordinated to any higher principle: the egoist is free to adjust to the world if it is clear he will better himself by doing so. His 'rebellion' may take the form of utter servility if it will further his interest; what he must not do is to be bound by 'general' values or myths of humanity. The totalitarian ideal of a barrack-like society from which all real, historical ties have been eliminated is perfectly consistent with Stirner's principles: the egoist, by his very nature, must be prepared to fight under any flag that suits his convenience.\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More generally in category theory, an endomorphism is a morphism from a category of objects to itself. An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is an automorphism. For example, an endomorphism of a vector space V is a linear map f: V \u2192 V, and an endomorphism of a group G is a group homomorphism f: G \u2192 G. \nIn general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any category. In the category of sets, endomorphisms are functions from a set \"S\" to itself.\nIn any category, the composition of any two endomorphisms of \"X\" is again an endomorphism of \"X\". It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of \"X\" forms a monoid, the full transformation monoid, and denoted End(\"X\") (or End\"C\"(\"X\") to emphasize the category \"C\").\nAutomorphisms.\nAn invertible endomorphism of \"X\" is called an automorphism. The set of all automorphisms is a subset of End(\"X\") with a group structure, called the automorphism group of \"X\" and denoted Aut(\"X\"). In the following diagram, the arrows denote implication:\nEndomorphism rings.\nAny two endomorphisms of an abelian group, \"A\", can be added together by the rule (\"f\" + \"g\")(\"a\") \n \"f\"(\"a\") + \"g\"(\"a\"). Under this addition, and with multiplication being defined as function composition, the endomorphisms of an abelian group form a ring (the endomorphism ring). For example, the set of endomorphisms of formula_1 is the ring of all \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices with integer entries. The endomorphisms of a vector space or module also form a ring, as do the endomorphisms of any object in a preadditive category. The endomorphisms of a nonabelian group generate an algebraic structure known as a near-ring. Every ring with one is the endomorphism ring of its regular module, and so is a subring of an endomorphism ring of an abelian group; however there are rings that are not the endomorphism ring of any abelian group.\nOperator theory.\nIn any concrete category, especially for vector spaces, endomorphisms are maps from a set into itself, and may be interpreted as unary operators on that set, acting on the elements, and allowing the notion of element orbits to be defined, etc.\nDepending on the additional structure defined for the category at hand (topology, metric, ...), such operators can have properties like continuity, boundedness, and so on. More details should be found in the article about operator theory.\nEndofunctions.\nAn endofunction is a function whose domain is equal to its codomain. A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism.\nLet \"S\" be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on \"S\" one finds permutations of \"S\" and constant functions associating to every \"x\" in \"S\" the same element \"c\" in \"S\". Every permutation of \"S\" has the codomain equal to its domain and is bijective and invertible. If \"S\" has more than one element, a constant function on \"S\" has an image that is a proper subset of its codomain, and thus is not bijective (and hence not invertible). The function associating to each natural number \"n\" the floor of \"n\"/2 has its image equal to its codomain and is not invertible.\nFinite endofunctions are equivalent to directed pseudoforests. For sets of size \"n\" there are \"n\"\"n\" endofunctions on the set.\nParticular examples of bijective endofunctions are the involutions; i.e., the functions coinciding with their inverses.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9574", "revid": "9889660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9574", "title": "Eric Hoffer", "text": "American moral and social conservative philosopher (1902\u20131983)\nEric Hoffer (July 25, 1902 \u2013 May 21, 1983) was an American philosopher and social critic. A conservative moderate with an atypical working-class background, Hoffer authored ten books over his career and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February 1983. His first book, \"The True Believer\" (1951), was widely recognized as a classic, receiving critical acclaim from both scholars and laymen, although Hoffer believed that \"The Ordeal of Change\" (1963) was his finest work. The Eric Hoffer Book Award is an international literary prize established in his honor. The University of California, Berkeley awards an annual literary prize named jointly for Hoffer.\nEarly life.\nMany elements of Hoffer's early life are unverified, but in autobiographical statements, Hoffer claimed to have been born in 1902 in The Bronx, New York City, New York, to Knut and Elsa (Goebel) Hoffer. His parents were immigrants from Alsace, then part of Imperial Germany. By age five, Hoffer could already read in both English and his parents' native German. When he was five, his mother fell down the stairs with him in her arms. He later recalled, \"I lost my sight at the age of seven. Two years before, my mother and I fell down a flight of stairs. She did not recover and died in that second year after the fall. I lost my sight and, for a time, my memory.\" Hoffer spoke with a pronounced German accent all his life, and spoke the language fluently. He was raised by a live-in relative or servant, a German immigrant named Martha. His eyesight inexplicably returned when he was 15. Fearing he might lose it again, he seized on the opportunity to read as much as he could. His recovery proved permanent, but Hoffer never abandoned his reading habit.\nHoffer was a young man when he also lost his father. The cabinetmaker's union paid for Knut Hoffer's funeral and gave Hoffer about $300 insurance money. He took a bus to Los Angeles and spent the next 10 years wandering, as he remembered, \"up and down the land, dodging hunger and grieving over the world.\" Hoffer eventually landed on Skid Row, reading, occasionally writing, and working at odd jobs.\nIn 1931, he considered suicide by drinking a solution of oxalic acid, but he could not bring himself to do it. He left Skid Row and became a migrant worker, following the harvests in California. He acquired a library card where he worked, dividing his time \"between the books and the brothels.\" He also prospected for gold in the mountains. Snowed in for the winter, he read the \"Essays\" by Michel de Montaigne. Montaigne impressed Hoffer deeply, and Hoffer often made reference to him. He also developed a respect for America's underclass, which he said was \"lumpy with talent.\"\nCareer.\nHe wrote a novel, \"Four Years in Young Hank's Life,\" and a novella, \"Chance and Mr. Kunze,\" both partly autobiographical. He also penned a long article based on his experiences in a federal work camp, \"Tramps and Pioneers.\" It was never published, but a truncated version appeared in \"Harper's Magazine\" after he became well known.\nHoffer tried to enlist in the U.S. Army at age 40 during World War II, but he was rejected due to a hernia. Instead, he began work as a longshoreman on the docks of San Francisco in 1943. At the same time, he began to write seriously.\nHoffer left the docks in 1964, and shortly after became an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He later retired from public life in 1970. \"I'm going to crawl back into my hole where I started,\" he said. \"I don't want to be a public person or anybody's spokesman... Any man can ride a train. Only a wise man knows when to get off.\" In 1970, he endowed the Lili Fabilli and Eric Hoffer Laconic Essay Prize for students, faculty, and staff at the University of California, Berkeley.\nHoffer called himself an atheist but had sympathetic views of religion and described it as a positive force.\nHe died at his home in San Francisco in 1983 at the age of 80.\nWorking-class roots.\nHoffer was influenced by his modest roots and working-class surroundings, seeing in it vast human potential. In a letter to Margaret Anderson in 1941, he wrote: \"My writing is done in railroad yards while waiting for a freight, in the fields while waiting for a truck, and at noon after lunch. Towns are too distracting.\" He once remarked, \"my writing grows out of my life just as a branch from a tree.\" When he was called an intellectual, he insisted that he simply was a longshoreman. Hoffer has been dubbed by some authors a \"longshoreman philosopher.\"\nPersonal life.\nHoffer, who was an only child, never married. He fathered a child with Lili Fabilli Osborne, named Eric Osborne, who was born in 1955 and raised by Lili Osborne and her husband, Selden Osborne. Lili Fabilli Osborne had become acquainted with Hoffer through her husband, a fellow longshoreman and acquaintance of Hoffer's. Despite this, Selden Osborne and Hoffer remained on good terms.\nHoffer referred to Eric Osborne as his son or godson. Lili Fabilli Osborne died in 2010 at the age of 93. Prior to her death, Osborne was the executor of Hoffer's estate, and vigorously controlled the rights to his intellectual property.\nIn his 2012 book \"Eric Hoffer: The Longshoreman Philosopher,\" journalist Tom Bethell revealed doubts about Hoffer's account of his early life. Although Hoffer claimed his parents were from Alsace-Lorraine, Hoffer himself spoke with a pronounced Bavarian accent. He claimed to have been born and raised in the Bronx but had no Bronx accent. His lover and executor Lili Fabilli stated that she always thought Hoffer was an immigrant. Her son, Eric Fabilli, said that Hoffer's life might have been comparable to that of B. Traven and considered hiring a genealogist to investigate Hoffer's early life, to which Hoffer reportedly replied, \"Are you \"sure\" you want to know?\" Pescadero land-owner Joe Gladstone, a family friend of the Fabillis who also knew Hoffer, said of Hoffer's account of his early life: \"I don't believe a word of it.\" To this day, no one ever has claimed to have known Hoffer in his youth, and no records apparently exist of his parents, nor indeed of Hoffer himself until he was about forty, when his name appeared in a census.\nBooks and opinions.\n\"The True Believer\".\nHoffer came to public attention with the 1951 publication of his first book, \"The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements\", which consists of a preface and 125 sections, which are divided into 18 chapters. Hoffer analyzes the phenomenon of \"mass movements,\" a general term that he applies to revolutionary parties, nationalistic movements, and religious movements. He summarizes his thesis in \u00a7113: \"A movement is pioneered by men of words, materialized by fanatics and consolidated by men of actions.\"\nHoffer argues that fanatical and extremist cultural movements, whether religious, social, or national, arise when large numbers of frustrated people, believing their own individual lives to be worthless or spoiled, join a movement demanding radical change. But the real attraction for this population is an escape from the self, not a realization of individual hopes: \"A mass movement attracts and holds a following not because it can satisfy the desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy the passion for self-renunciation.\"\nHoffer consequently argues that the appeal of mass movements is interchangeable: in the Germany of the 1920s and the 1930s, for example, the Communists and National Socialists were ostensibly enemies, but sometimes enlisted each other's members, since they competed for the same kind of marginalized, angry, frustrated people. For the \"true believer,\" Hoffer argues that particular beliefs are less important than escaping from the burden of the autonomous self.\nHarvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. said of \"The True Believer\": \"This brilliant and original inquiry into the nature of mass movements is a genuine contribution to our social thought.\"\nLater works.\nSubsequent to the publication of \"The True Believer\" (1951), Eric Hoffer touched upon Asia and American interventionism in several of his essays. In \"The Awakening of Asia\" (1954), published in \"The Reporter\" and later his book \"The Ordeal of Change\" (1963), Hoffer discusses the reasons for unrest on the continent. In particular, he argues that the root cause of social discontent in Asia was not government corruption, \"communist agitation,\" or the legacy of European colonial \"oppression and exploitation,\" but rather that a \"craving for pride\" was the central problem in Asia, suggesting a problem that could not be relieved through typical American intervention.\nDuring the Vietnam War, despite his objections to the antiwar movement and acceptance of the notion that the war was somehow necessary to prevent a third world war, Hoffer remained skeptical concerning American interventionism, specifically the intelligence with which the war was being conducted in Southeast Asia. After the United States became more involved in the war, Hoffer wished to avoid defeat in Vietnam because of his fear that such a defeat would transform American society for ill, opening the door to those who would preach a stab-in-the-back myth and allow for the rise of an American version of Hitler.\nIn \"The Temper of Our Time\" (1967), Hoffer implies that the United States as a rule should avoid interventions in the first place: \"the better part of statesmanship might be to know clearly and precisely what not to do, and leave action to the improvisation of chance.\" In fact, Hoffer indicates that \"it might be wise to wait for enemies to defeat themselves,\" as they might fall upon each other with the United States out of the picture. The view was somewhat borne out with the Cambodian-Vietnamese War and Chinese-Vietnamese War of the late 1970s.\nPapers.\nHoffer's papers, including 131 of the notebooks he carried in his pockets, were acquired in 2000 by the Hoover Institution Archives. The papers fill of shelf space. Because Hoffer cultivated an aphoristic style, the unpublished notebooks (dated from 1949 to 1977) contain very significant work. Although available for scholarly study since at least 2003, little of their contents has been published.

It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty of Paris, signed by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany and was generally seen as the first step in the process of European integration following the end of the Second World War in Europe. The organization is a spiritual predecessor to the contemporary European Union (EU) as its subsequent enlargement of both members and duties ultimately led to the creation of the EU.\nThe ECSC was first proposed via the Schuman Declaration by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 (commemorated in the EU as Europe Day), the day after the fifth anniversary of the end of World War II, to prevent another war between France and Germany. He declared \"the solidarity in production\" from pooling \"coal and steel production\" would make war between the two \"not only unthinkable but materially impossible\". The Treaty created a common market among member states that stipulated free movement of goods (without customs duties or taxes) and prohibited states from introducing unfair competitive or discriminatory practices.\nIts terms were enforced by four institutions: a High Authority composed of independent appointees, a Common Assembly composed of national parliamentarians, a Special Council composed of national ministers, and a Court of Justice. These would ultimately form the blueprint for today's European Commission, European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the Court of Justice of the European Union, respectively.\nThe ECSC set an example for the pan-European organizations created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957: the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community, with whom it shared its membership and some institutions. The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty merged the ECSC's institutions into the European Economic Community, but the former retained its own independent legal personality until the Treaty of Paris expired in 2002, leaving its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the frameworks of the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice.\nHistory.\nAs Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was instrumental in turning French policy away from the Gaullist objective of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany in a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence.\nBackground: Schuman declaration.\nThe Schuman Declaration had the stated aim of preventing further antagonism between France and Germany\nand among other European states by tackling the root cause of war through the establishment of common foundations for economic development. Schuman proposed the formation of the ECSC primarily with France and Germany in mind: \"The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries.\" Portraying the coal and steel industries as integral to the production of munitions,\nSchuman proposed that uniting these two industries across France and Germany under an innovative supranational system (that also included a European anti-cartel agency) would \"make war between France and Germany [...] not only unthinkable but materially impossible\".\nNegotiations.\nFollowing the Schuman Declaration in May 1950, negotiations on what became the Treaty of Paris (1951) began on 20 June 1950. The objective of the treaty was to create a single market in the coal and steel industries of the member states. Customs duties, subsidies, discriminatory and restrictive practices were all to be abolished. The single market was to be supervised by a High Authority, with powers to handle extreme shortages of supply or demand, to tax, and to prepare production forecasts as guidelines for investment.\nA key issue in the negotiations for the treaty was the break-up of the excessive concentrations in the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr, where the \"Konzerne\", or trusts, had underlain the military power of the former Reich. The Germans regarded the concentration of coal and steel as one of the bases of their economic efficiency, and a right. The steel barons were a formidable lobby because they embodied a national tradition.\nThe United States was not officially part of the treaty negotiations, but it was a major force behind the scenes. The US High Commissioner for Occupied Germany, John McCloy, was an advocate of decartelization and his chief advisor in Germany was a Harvard anti-trust lawyer, Robert Bowie. Bowie was asked to draft anti-trust articles, and texts of the two articles he prepared (on cartels and the abuse of monopoly power) became the basis of the treaty's competition policy regime. Also, Raymond Vernon in the State Department (of later fame for his studies on industrial policy at Harvard university) carefully reviewed successive drafts of the treaty. He stressed the importance of the freedom of the projected common market from restrictive practices.\nThe Americans insisted that the German coal sales monopoly, the \"Deutscher Kohlenverkauf\" (\"DKV\"), should lose its monopoly, and that the steel industries should no longer own the coalmines. It was agreed that the \"DKV\" would be broken up into four independent sales agencies. The steel firm \"Vereinigte Stahlwerke\" was to be divided into thirteen firms, and Krupp into two. Ten years after the Schuman negotiations, a US State Department official noted that while the articles as finally agreed were more qualified than American officials in touch with the negotiations would have wished, they were \"almost revolutionary\" in terms of the traditional European approach to these basic industries.\nPolitical pressures and treaty ratification.\nIn West Germany, Karl Arnold, the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, the state that included the coal and steel producing the Ruhr, was initially spokesman for German foreign affairs. He gave a number of speeches and broadcasts on a supranational coal and steel community at the same time as Robert Schuman began to propose this Community in 1948 and 1949. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (, SPD), in spite of support from unions and other socialists in Europe, decided it would oppose the Schuman plan. Kurt Schumacher's personal distrust of France, capitalism, and Konrad Adenauer aside, he claimed that a focus on integrating with a \"Little Europe of the Six\" would override the SPD's prime objective of German reunification and thus empower ultra-nationalist and Communist movements in democratic countries. He also thought the ECSC would end any hopes of nationalising the steel industry and lock in a Europe of \"cartels, clerics and conservatives\". Younger members of the party like Carlo Schmid, were, however, in favor of the Community and pointed to the long socialist support for the supranational idea.\nIn France, Schuman had gained strong political and intellectual support from all sections of the nation and many non-communist parties. Notable amongst these were ministerial colleague Andre Philip, president of the Foreign Relations Committee Edouard Bonnefous, and former prime minister, Paul Reynaud. Projects for a coal and steel authority and other supranational communities were formulated in specialist subcommittees of the Council of Europe in the period before it became French government policy. Charles de Gaulle, who was then out of power, had been an early supporter of \"linkages\" between economies, on French terms, and had spoken in 1945 of a \"European confederation\" that would exploit the resources of the Ruhr. However, he opposed the ECSC as a \"faux\" (false) pooling (\"le pool, ce faux semblant\") because he considered it an unsatisfactory \"piecemeal approach\" to European unity and because he considered the French government \"too weak\" to dominate the ECSC as he thought proper. De Gaulle also felt that the ECSC had an insufficient supranational mandate because its Assembly was not ratified by a European referendum and he did not accept Raymond Aron's contention that the ECSC was intended as a movement away from United States domination. Consequently, de Gaulle and his followers in the RPF voted against ratification in the lower house of the French Parliament.\nDespite these attacks and those from the extreme left, the ECSC found substantial public support. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.\nThe UK Prime Minister Clement Attlee opposed Britain joining the proposed European Coal and Steel Community, saying that he 'would not accept the [UK] economy being handed over to an authority that is utterly undemocratic and is responsible to nobody.'\nFounding treaty.\nThe 100-article Treaty of Paris, which established the ECSC, was signed on 18 April 1951 by \"the inner six\": France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The ECSC was based on supranational principles and was, through the establishment of a common market for coal and steel, intended to expand the economy, increase employment, and raise the standard of living within the Community. The market was also intended to progressively rationalise the distribution of production whilst ensuring stability and employment. The common market for coal was opened on 10 February 1953, and for steel on 1 May 1953. Upon taking effect, the ECSC replaced the International Authority for the Ruhr.\nOn 11 August 1952, the United States was the first non-ECSC member to recognise the Community and stated it would now deal with the ECSC on coal and steel matters, establishing its delegation in Brussels. Monnet responded by choosing Washington, D.C., as the site of the ECSC's first external presence. The headline of the delegation's first bulletin read \"Towards a Federal Government of Europe\".\nSix years after the Treaty of Paris, the Treaty of Rome was signed by the six ECSC members, creating the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). These \"Communities\" were based, with some adjustments, on the ECSC. The Treaty of Rome was to be in force indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to last for a renewable period of fifty years. These two new Communities worked on the creation of a customs union and nuclear power community respectively.\nMerger Treaty.\nDespite being separate legal entities, the ECSC, EEC and Euratom initially shared the Common Assembly and the European Court of Justice, although the Councils and the High Authority/Commissions remained separate. To avoid duplication, the Merger Treaty merged these separate bodies of the ECSC and Euratom with those of the EEC. The EEC later became one of the three pillars of the present day European Union.\nThe Treaty of Paris was frequently amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. \nExpiry.\nWith the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate began at the beginning of the 1990s on what to do with it. It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002. That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final time outside the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.\nInstitutions.\nThe institutions of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing producers, workers, consumers and dealers (article 18). These institutions were merged in 1967 with those of the European Community, except for the Consultative Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.\nThe Treaty stated that the location of the institutions would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was hotly contested. As a temporary compromise, the institutions were provisionally located in the City of Luxembourg, while the Assembly was based in Strasbourg.\nHigh Authority.\nThe High Authority (the predecessor to the European Commission) was a nine-member executive body which governed the ECSC. The Authority consisted of nine members in office for a term of six years, appointed by the governments of the six signatories. Two were from each of France, Germany and Italy; and one from each of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. These members appointed a person among themselves to be President of the High Authority.\nDespite being appointed by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to pledge not to represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, one third of the membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).\nThe Authority had a broad area of competence to ensure the objectives of the treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.\nUp to the merger in 1967, the authority had five Presidents followed by an interim President serving for the final days.\nCommon Assembly.\nThe Common Assembly (the forerunner to the European Parliament) was composed of 78 representatives: 18 from each of France, Germany, and Italy; 10 from Belgium and the Netherlands; and 4 from Luxembourg (article 21). It exercised supervisory powers over the executive High Authority (article 20). The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected \"by universal suffrage\" (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the Treaty of Rome, and no actual election until 1979, as Rome required agreement in the council on the electoral system first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term \"representatives of the peoples\". Some hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe, and The Treaty's \"Protocol on Relations with the Council of Europe\" encouraged links between the two institutions' assemblies. The ECSC Assembly was intended as a democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority (article 24). The first President (akin to a Speaker) was Paul-Henri Spaak.\nSpecial Council of Ministers.\nThe Special Council of Ministers (the forerunner to the Council of the European Union) was composed of representatives of national governments. The presidency was held by each state for a period of three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments. The council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority. Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the High Authority, and in these areas the council (unlike the modern council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the council.\nCourt of Justice.\nThe Court of Justice was to ensure the observation of ECSC law along with the interpretation and application of the Treaty. The Court was composed of seven judges, appointed by common accord of the national governments for six years. There were no requirements that the judges had to be of a certain nationality, simply that they be qualified and that their independence be beyond doubt. The Court was assisted by two Advocates General.\nConsultative Committee.\nThe Consultative Committee (forerunner to the European Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 51 members equally divided between producers, workers, consumers and dealers in the coal and steel sector (article 18). There were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Members were appointed for two years and were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Nomination of these members remained in the hands of the council. The High Authority was obliged to consult the committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC).\nMembers.\nAfter the original six members, the ESCS expanded to all members of the European Economic Community (later renamed the European Community) and the European Union (15 countries in 2002 at the time of the expiry of the Treaty of Paris).\nAchievements and shortcomings.\nMajor goal: ending war between member states.\nSchuman described the goal as to \"make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\" for signatory states. This is described in the treaty's preamble. It commences by quoting the French Government Proposal of Schuman:\n\"World peace cannot be safeguarded without creative measures commensurate with the dangers which threaten it\". Europe had been at the centre of world wars. For this, the Community created the world's first international anti-cartel agency. Treaty Chapters VI \"Ententes et Concentrations\" and VII on the Free Market describe joint action against cartels and trusts, which were instrumental in world war arms races, and activities leading to the disruption of the free market.\nThe six founding member states are now living in the longest period of peace in more than 2,000 years of their history.\nEconomic.\nThe economic mission of the ECSC (article 2) was to \"contribute to economic expansion, the development of employment and the improvement of the standard of living in participating countries\". Writing in \"Le Monde\" in 1970, Gilbert Mathieu argued the Community had little effect on coal and steel \"production\", which was influenced more by global trends. From 1952, oil, gas, and electricity became competitors to coal, so the 28% reduction in the amount of coal mined in the Six had little connection with the Treaty of Paris. However, the Treaty caused costs to be reduced by the abolition of discriminatory railway tariffs, and this promoted trade between members: steel trade increased tenfold. The High Authority also issued 280 modernization loans, which helped the industry to improve output and reduce costs.\nMathieu claims the ECSC failed to achieve several fundamental aims of the Treaty of Paris. He argues that the \"pool\" did not prevent the resurgence of large coal and steel groups, such as the \"Konzerne\", which helped Adolf Hitler build his war machine. The cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing. Furthermore, the Community failed to define a common energy policy. Mathieu also argues that the ECSC fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the industry. These failures could be put down to overambition in a short period of time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored.\nThe ECSC's greatest achievements relate to welfare issues, according to Mathieu. Some miners had extremely poor housing, and thus, over a period of 15 years, the ECSC financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers to buy a home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who had lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid, the ECSC spent $150 million (835 million francs) creating around 100,000 jobs, a third of which were offered to unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were copied and extended by several of the Six to workers outside the coal and steel sectors.\nFar more important than creating Europe's first social and regional policy, Robert Schuman argued that the ECSC introduced European peace. It involved the continent's first European tax. This was a flat tax, a levy on production with a maximum rate of one percent. Given that the European Community countries are now experiencing the longest period of peace in more than seventy years, this has been described by a European newspaper as the cheapest tax for peace in history.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was subsequently renamed the European Community (EC) upon becoming integrated into the first pillar of the newly formed European Union (EU) in 1993. In the popular language, the singular \"European Community\" was sometimes inaccurately used in the wider sense of the plural \"European Communities\", in spite of the latter designation covering all the three constituent entities of the first pillar. The EEC was also known as the European Common Market (ECM) in the English-speaking countries, and sometimes referred to as the European Community even before it was officially renamed as such in 1993. In 2009, the EC formally ceased to exist and its institutions were directly absorbed by the EU. This made the Union the formal successor institution of the Community.\nThe Community's initial aim was to bring about economic integration, including a common market and customs union, among its six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. It gained a common set of institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993, a complete single market was achieved, known as the internal market, which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994 the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association, forming the European Economic Area, which encompasses 15 countries.\nUpon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the EEC was renamed the European Community to reflect that it covered a wider range than economic policy. This was also when the three European Communities, including the EC, were collectively made to constitute the first of the three pillars of the European Union, which the treaty also founded. The EC existed in this form until it was abolished by the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, which incorporated the EC's institutions into the EU's wider framework and provided that the EU would \"replace and succeed the European Community\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn April 1951, the Treaty of Paris was signed, creating the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). This was an international community based on supranationalism and international law, designed to help the economy of Europe and prevent future war by integrating its members.\nWith the aim of creating a federal Europe two further communities were proposed: a European Defence Community and a European Political Community. While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the Common Assembly, the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the proposed defence community was rejected by the French Parliament. ECSC President Jean Monnet, a leading figure behind the communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration. Following the Messina Conference in 1955, Paul-Henri Spaak was given the task to prepare a report on the idea of a customs union. The so-called Spaak Report of the Spaak Committee formed the cornerstone of the intergovernmental negotiations at Val Duchesse conference centre in 1956. Together with the Ohlin Report the Spaak Report would provide the basis for the Treaty of Rome.\nIn 1956, Paul-Henri Spaak led the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the Val Duchesse conference centre, which prepared for the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the Treaty of Rome establishing a European Economic Community.\nCreation and early years.\nThe resulting communities were the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC). These were markedly less supranational than the previous communities, due to protests from some countries that their sovereignty was being infringed (however there would still be concerns with the behaviour of the Hallstein Commission). Germany became a founding member of the EEC, and Konrad Adenauer was made leader in a very short time. The first formal meeting of the Hallstein Commission was held on 16 January 1958 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Val-Duchesse. The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) was to create a customs union while Euratom would promote co-operation in the nuclear power sphere. The EEC rapidly became the most important of these and expanded its activities. The first move towards political developments came at the end of 1959 when the foreign ministers of the six members announced that would be meeting quarterly to discuss political issues and international problems. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products. In 1968, internal tariffs (tariffs on trade between member nations) were removed on certain products.\nAnother crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority-voting in the council had taken effect. Then-French President Charles de Gaulle's opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an \"empty chair policy\" whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the Luxembourg compromise on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.\nOn 1 July 1967, when the Merger Treaty came into operation, combining the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC, they already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Courts. Collectively they were known as the \"European Communities\". The Communities still had independent personalities although were increasingly integrated. Future treaties granted the community new powers beyond simple economic matters which had achieved a high level of integration. As it got closer to the goal of political integration and a peaceful and united Europe, what Mikhail Gorbachev described as a \"Common European Home\".\nEnlargement and elections.\nThe 1960s saw the first attempts at enlargement. In 1961, Denmark, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Norway (in 1962), applied to join the three Communities. However, President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership as a Trojan Horse for U.S. influence and vetoed membership, and the applications of all four countries were suspended. Greece became the first country to join the EC in 1961 as an associate member, however its membership was suspended in 1967 after a coup d'\u00e9tat established a military dictatorship called the Regime of the Colonels.\nA year later, in February 1962, Spain attempted to join the European Community. However, because Francoist Spain was not a democracy, all members rejected the request in 1964.\nThe four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with Georges Pompidou succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French president in 1969, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 under the pro-European UK government of Edward Heath, who had to deal with disagreements relating to the Common Agricultural Policy and the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations. Nevertheless, two years later the accession treaties were signed so that Denmark, Ireland and the UK joined the Community effective 1 January 1973. The Norwegian people had rejected membership in a referendum on 25 September 1972.\nThe Treaties of Rome had stated that the European Parliament must be directly elected; however, this required the Council to agree on a common voting system first. The Council procrastinated on the issue and the Parliament remained appointed, French President Charles de Gaulle was particularly active in blocking the development of the Parliament, with it only being granted Budgetary powers following his resignation.\nParliament pressured for agreement and on 20 September 1976 the Council agreed part of the necessary instruments for election, deferring details on electoral systems which remain varied to this day. During the tenure of President Jenkins, in June 1979, the elections were held in all the then-members (see 1979 European Parliament election). The new Parliament, galvanised by direct election and new powers, started working full-time and became more active than the previous assemblies.\nShortly after its election, the Parliament proposed that the Community adopt the flag of Europe design used by the Council of Europe. The European Council in 1984 appointed an \"ad hoc\" committee for this purpose. The European Council in 1985 largely followed the committee's recommendations; but, as the adoption of a flag was strongly reminiscent of a national flag representing statehood was controversial, the \"flag of Europe\" design was adopted with the status only of a \"logo\" or \"emblem\".\nThe European Council, or European summit, had developed since the 1960s as an informal meeting of the Council at the level of heads of state. It had originated from then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the commission) over the integration process. It was mentioned in the treaties for the first time in the Single European Act (see below).\nToward Maastricht.\nGreece re-applied to join the community on 12 June 1975, following the restoration of democracy, and joined on 1 January 1981. Following on from Greece, and after their own democratic restoration, Spain and Portugal applied to the communities in 1977 and joined on 1 January 1986. In 1987, Turkey formally applied to join the Community and began the longest application process for any country.\nWith the prospect of further enlargement, and a desire to increase areas of co-operation, the Single European Act was signed by the foreign ministers on 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and The Hague respectively. In a single document it dealt with reform of institutions, extension of powers, foreign policy cooperation and the single market. It came into force on 1 July 1987. The act was followed by work on what would be the Maastricht Treaty, which was agreed on 10 December 1991, signed the following year and coming into force on 1 November 1993 establishing the European Union, and paving the way for the European Monetary Union.\nEuropean Community.\nThe EU absorbed the European Communities as one of its three pillars. The EEC's areas of activities were enlarged and were renamed the \"European Community\", continuing to follow the supranational structure of the EEC. The EEC institutions became those of the EU, however the Court, Parliament and Commission had only limited input in the new pillars, as they worked on a more intergovernmental system than the European Communities. This was reflected in the names of the institutions, the council was formally the \"Council of the \"European Union\"\" while the commission was formally the \"Commission of the \"European Communities\"\".\nThere are more competencies listed in Article 3 of the European Communities pillar than there are in Article 3 of the Treaty of Rome. This is due to the fact that some competencies were already inherent in the Treaty of Tome, some were referred to in the Treaty of Rome, and some were extended under Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome. Competencies were added to cover trans-European networks, and the work of the Culture Committee and Education Committee that were previously sharing existing competencies. The only entry in Article 3 that represented something new is the competence covering the entry and movement of persons in the internal market.\nHowever, after the Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained a more formal role. Maastricht brought in the codecision procedure, which gave it equal legislative power with the Council on Community matters. This replaced the informal parliamentary blocking powers established by the 1979 Isoglucose decision.\nIt also abolished any existing state like Simple Majority voting in the EEC, replacing it with Qualified Majority Voting, a procedure more commonly used in international organisations.\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam transferred responsibility for free movement of persons (e.g., visas, illegal immigration, asylum) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC) as a result). Both Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice also extended codecision procedure to nearly all policy areas, giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.\nIn 2002, the Treaty of Paris which established the ECSC expired, having reached its 50-year limit (as the first treaty, it was the only one with a limit). No attempt was made to renew its mandate; instead, the Treaty of Nice transferred certain of its elements to the Treaty of Rome and hence its work continued as part of the EC area of the European Community's remit.\nAfter the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 the pillar structure ceased to exist. The European Community, together with its legal personality, was absorbed into the newly consolidated European Union which merged in the other two pillars (however Euratom remained distinct). This was originally proposed under the European Constitution but that treaty failed ratification in 2005.\nAims and achievements.\nThe main aim of the EEC, as stated in its preamble, was to \"preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\". Calling for balanced economic growth, this was to be accomplished through:\nCiting Article 2 from the original text of the Treaty of Rome of 25 March 1957, the EEC aimed at \"a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the States belonging to it\". Given the fear of the Cold War, many Western Europeans were afraid that poverty would make \"the population vulnerable to communist propaganda\" (Meurs 2018, p.\u00a068), meaning that increasing prosperity would be beneficial to harmonise power between the Western and Eastern blocs, other than reconcile Member States such as France and Germany after WW2. \nThe tasks entrusted to the Community were divided among an assembly, the European Parliament, Council, Commission, and Court of Justice. Moreover, restrictions to market were lifted to further liberate trade among Member States. Citizens of Member States (other than goods, services, and capital) were entitled to freedom of movement. The CAP, Common Agricultural Policy, regulated and subsided the agricultural sphere. A European Social Fund was implemented in favour of employees who lost their jobs. A European Investment Bank was established to \"facilitate the economic expansion of the Community by opening up fresh resources\" (Art. 3 Treaty of Rome 25 March 1957). All these implementations included overseas territories. Competition was to be kept alive to make products cheaper for European consumers.\nFor the customs union, the treaty provided for a 10% reduction in custom duties and up to 20% of global import quotas. Progress on the customs union proceeded much faster than the twelve years planned. However, France faced some setbacks due to their war with Algeria.\nMembers.\nThe six states that founded the EEC and the other two Communities were known as the \"inner six\" (the \"outer seven\" were those countries who formed the European Free Trade Association). The six were France, West Germany, Italy and the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The first enlargement was in 1973, with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Greece, Spain and Portugal joined in the 1980s. The former East Germany became part of the EEC upon German reunification in 1990. Following the creation of the EU in 1993, it has enlarged to include an additional sixteen countries by 2013.\nMember states are represented in some form in each institution. The Council is also composed of one national minister who represents their national government. Each state also has a right to one European Commissioner each, although in the European Commission they are not supposed to represent their national interest but that of the Community. Prior to 2004, the larger members (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) have had two Commissioners. In the European Parliament, members are allocated a set number seats related to their population, however these (since 1979) have been directly elected and they sit according to political allegiance, not national origin. Most other institutions, including the European Court of Justice, have some form of national division of its members.\nInstitutions.\nThere were three political institutions which held the executive and legislative power of the EEC, plus one judicial institution and a fifth body created in 1975. These institutions (except for the auditors) were created in 1957 by the EEC but from 1967 onwards they applied to all three Communities. The Council represents the member state governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the council for approval and the Parliament for an opinion (in some cases it had a veto, depending upon the legislative procedure in use). The commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. After the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, these institutions became those of the European Union, though limited in some areas due to the pillar structure. Despite this, Parliament in particular has gained more power over legislation and security of the commission. The Court of Justice was the highest authority in the law, settling legal disputes in the Community, while the Auditors had no power but to investigate.\nBackground.\nThe EEC inherited some of the Institutions of the ECSC in that the Common Assembly and Court of Justice of the ECSC had their authority extended to the EEC and Euratom in the same role. However the EEC, and Euratom, had different executive bodies to the ECSC. In place of the ECSC's Council of Ministers was the Council of the European Economic Community, and in place of the High Authority was the Commission of the European Communities.\nThere was greater difference between these than name: the French government of the day had grown suspicious of the supranational power of the High Authority and sought to curb its powers in favour of the intergovernmental style Council. Hence the council had a greater executive role in the running of the EEC than was the situation in the ECSC. By virtue of the Merger Treaty in 1967, the executives of the ECSC and Euratom were merged with that of the EEC, creating a single institutional structure governing the three separate Communities. From here on, the term \"European Communities\" were used for the institutions (for example, from \"Commission of the European Economic Community\" to the \"Commission of the European Communities\").\nCouncil.\nThe Council of the European Communities was a body holding legislative and executive powers and was thus the main decision-making body of the Community. Its Presidency rotated between the member states every six months and it is related to the European Council, which was an informal gathering of national leaders (started in 1961) on the same basis as the council.\nThe council was composed of one national minister from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or unanimity. In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament. Since the 1960s the council also began to meet informally at the level of heads of government and heads of state; these European summits followed the same presidency system and secretariat as the council but was not a formal formation of it.\nCommission.\nThe Commission of the European Communities was the executive arm of the community, drafting Community law, dealing with the day to running of the Community and upholding the treaties. It was designed to be independent, representing the interest of the Community as a whole. Every member state submitted one commissioner (two from each of the larger states, one from the smaller states). One of its members was the President, appointed by the council, who chaired the body and represented it.\nParliament.\nUnder the Community, the European Parliament (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an advisory role to the Council and Commission. There were a number of Community legislative procedures, at first there was only the consultation procedure, which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The Single European Act gave Parliament more power, with the assent procedure giving it a right to veto proposals and the cooperation procedure giving it equal power with the Council if the council was not unanimous.\nIn 1970 and 1975, the Budgetary treaties gave Parliament power over the Community budget. The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see 1979 European Parliament election). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the commission as a whole, and the right to approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.\nCourt.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Communities was the highest court of on matters of Community law and was composed of one judge per state with a president elected from among them. Its role was to ensure that Community law was applied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It became a powerful institution as Community law overrides national law.\nAuditors.\nThe fifth institution is the European Court of Auditors. Its ensured that taxpayer funds from the Community budget had been correctly spent by the Community's institutions. The ECA provided an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament and gave opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. It is the only institution not mentioned in the original treaties, having been set up in 1975.\nPolicy areas.\nAt the time of its abolition, the European Community pillar covered the following areas:\nEU evolution timeline.\nSince the end of World War II, most sovereign European countries have entered into treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or \"pooled sovereignty\") in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration project or the \"construction of Europe\" (). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)\u2014the principal framework for this unification. The EU inherited many of its present organizations, institutions, and responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9580", "revid": "18381312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9580", "title": "European Free Trade Association", "text": "Regional trade organisation and free trade area\nThe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is a regional trade organisation and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The organisation operates in parallel with the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the European single market and are part of the Schengen Area. They are not, however, party to the European Union Customs Union.\nEFTA was historically one of the two dominant western European trade blocs, but is now much smaller and closely associated with its historical competitor, the European Union. It was established on 3 May 1960 to serve as an alternative trade bloc for those European states that were unable or unwilling to join the then European Economic Community (EEC), the main predecessor of the EU. The Stockholm Convention (1960), to establish the EFTA, was signed on 4 January 1960 in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the \"Outer Seven\": Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). A revised Convention, the Vaduz Convention, was signed on 21 June 2001 and entered into force on 1 June 2002.\nAfter 1995 only two founding members remained, namely Norway and Switzerland. The other five, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, had joined the EU at some point in the intervening years. The initial Stockholm Convention was superseded by the Vaduz Convention, which aimed to provide a successful framework for continuing the expansion and liberalisation of trade, both among the organisation's member states and with the rest of the world.\nWhile the EFTA is not a customs union and member states have full rights to enter into bilateral third-country trade arrangements, it does have a coordinated trade policy. As a result, its member states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with the EU and a number of other countries. To participate in the EU's single market, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway are parties to the Agreement on a European Economic Area (EEA), with compliances regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. Switzerland has a set of multilateral agreements with the EU and its member states instead.\nMembership.\nHistory.\nOn 12 January 1960, the Convention establishing the European Free Trade Association was initiated in the Golden Hall of the Stockholm City Hall. This established the progressive elimination of customs duties on industrial products, but did not affect agricultural or fisheries products.\nThe main difference between the early EEC and the EFTA was that the latter did not operate common external customs tariffs unlike the former: each EFTA member was free to establish its individual customs duties against, or its individual free trade agreements with, non-EFTA countries.\nThe founding members of the EFTA were: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During the 1960s, these countries were often referred to as the \"Outer Seven\", as opposed to the Inner Six of the then European Economic Community (EEC).\nFinland became an associate member in 1961 and a full member in 1986, and Iceland joined in 1970. The United Kingdom and Denmark joined the EEC in 1973 and hence ceased to be EFTA members. Portugal also left EFTA for the European Community in 1986. Liechtenstein joined the EFTA in 1991 (previously its interests had been represented by Switzerland). Austria, Sweden, and Finland joined the EU in 1995 and thus ceased to be EFTA members.\nTwice, in 1972 and in 1994, the Norwegian government had tried to join the EU (still the EEC, in 1973) and by doing so, leave the EFTA. However, both the times, the membership of the EU was rejected in national referendums, keeping Norway in the EFTA. Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 due to the 2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis, but has since dropped its bid.\nOther negotiations.\nBetween 1994 and 2011, EFTA memberships for Andorra, San Marino, Monaco, the Isle of Man, Turkey, Israel, Morocco, and other European Neighbourhood Policy partners were discussed.\nAndorra, Monaco, and San Marino.\nIn November 2012, after the Council of the European Union had called for an evaluation of the EU's relations with Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino, which they described as \"fragmented\", the European Commission published a report outlining the options for their further integration into the EU. Unlike Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA via the EFTA and the Schengen Agreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of agreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to the current situation: \nHowever, the Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the major issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was dismissed in the near future because \"the EU institutions are currently not adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries\". The remaining options, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and were recommended by the commission. In response, the Council requested that negotiations with the three microstates on further integration continue, and that a report be prepared by the end of 2013 detailing the implications of the two viable alternatives and recommendations on how to proceed.\nAs EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU member states, the consent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, then Foreign Minister of Norway which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the internal market due to their different requirements from those of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, St\u00f8re's successor, responded to the commission's report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway would be open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decided to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter. Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not impede the functioning of the organisation. However, he suggested that the option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside of both the EFTA and the EU, should be considered. On 18 November 2013, the EU Commission concluded that \"the participation of the small-sized countries in the EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political and institutional reasons\", and that Association Agreements were a more feasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market.\nNorway.\nThe Norwegian electorate had rejected treaties of accession to the EU in two referendums. At the time of the first referendum in 1972, their neighbour, Denmark joined. Since the second referendum in 1994, two other Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland, have joined the EU. The last two governments of Norway have not advanced the question, as they have both been coalition governments consisting of proponents and opponents of EU membership.\nSwitzerland.\nSince Switzerland rejected the EEA membership in a referendum in 1992, more referendums on EU membership have been initiated, the last time being in 2001. These were all rejected. Switzerland has been in a customs union with fellow EFTA member state and neighbour Liechtenstein since 1924.\nIceland.\nOn 16 July 2009, the government of Iceland formally applied for EU membership, but the negotiation process was suspended in mid-2013, and in 2015 the foreign ministers wrote to withdraw its application.\nFaroe Islands (Kingdom of Denmark).\nDenmark was a founding member of EFTA in 1960, but its membership ended in 1973, when it joined the European Communities. The autonomous territories of the Kingdom of Denmark were covered by Denmark's EFTA membership: Greenland from 1961 and the Faroe Islands from 1968. In mid-2005, representatives of the Faroe Islands raised the possibility of their territory re-joining the EFTA. Because Article 56 of the EFTA Convention only allows sovereign states to become members of the EFTA, the Faroes considered the possibility that the \"Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroes\" could join the EFTA on their behalf. The Danish Government has stated that this mechanism would not allow the Faroes to become a member of the EEA because Denmark was already a party to the EEA Agreement.\nThe Faroes already have an extensive bilateral free trade agreement with Iceland, known as the Hoyv\u00edk Agreement.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom was a co-founder of EFTA in 1960, but ceased to be a member upon joining the European Economic Community. The country held a referendum in 2016 on withdrawing from the EU (popularly referred to as \"Brexit\"), resulting in a 51.9% vote in favour of withdrawing. A 2013 research paper presented to the Parliament of the United Kingdom proposed a number of alternatives to EU membership which would continue to allow it access to the EU's internal market, including continuing EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the Swiss model of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the single market.\nIn the first meeting since the Brexit vote, EFTA reacted by saying both that they were open to a UK return, and that Britain has many issues to work through. The president of Switzerland Johann Schneider-Ammann stated that its return would strengthen the association. However, in August 2016 the Norwegian Government expressed reservations. Norway's European affairs minister, Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, told the \"Aftenposten\" newspaper: \"It's not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organization. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway's interests.\"\nIn late 2016, the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that her priority was to keep the whole of the UK in the European single market but that taking Scotland alone into the EEA was an option being \"looked at\". However, other EFTA states have stated that only sovereign states are eligible for membership, so it could only join if it became independent from the UK, unless the solution scouted for the Faroes in 2005 were to be adopted (see above).\nIn early 2018, British MPs Antoinette Sandbach, Stephen Kinnock and Stephen Hammond called for the UK to rejoin EFTA.\nRelationship with the European Union: the European Economic Area.\nIn 1992, the EU, its member states, and the EFTA member states signed the Agreement on the European Economic Area in Porto, Portugal. However, the proposal that Switzerland ratify its participation was rejected by referendum. (Nevertheless, Switzerland has multiple bilateral treaties with the EU that allow it to participate in the European Single Market, the Schengen Agreement and other programmes). Thus, except for Switzerland, the EFTA members are also members of the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises three member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and 27 member states of the European Union (EU). It was established on 1 January 1994 following an agreement with the European Economic Community (which had become the European Community two months earlier). It allows the EFTA-EEA states to participate in the EU's Internal Market without being members of the EU. They adopt almost all EU legislation related to the single market, except laws on agriculture and fisheries. However, they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process. One EFTA member, Switzerland, has not joined the EEA but has a series of bilateral agreements, including a free trade agreement, with the EU.\nThe following table summarises the various components of EU laws applied in the EFTA countries and their sovereign territories. Some territories of EU member states also have a special status in regard to EU laws applied as is the case with some European microstates.\n An Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreements \nEEA institutions.\nA Joint Committee consisting of the EEA-EFTA States plus the European Commission (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant EU law to the non-EU members. An EEA Council meets twice yearly to govern the overall relationship between the EEA members.\nRather than setting up pan-EEA institutions, the activities of the EEA are regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA). Since Switzerland is not an EEA member, it does not participate in these institutions.\nThe EFTA Surveillance Authority performs a role for EFTA members that is equivalent to that of the European Commission for the EU, as \"guardian of the treaties\" and the EFTA Court performs the European Court of Justice-equivalent role.\nThe original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court: the European Court of Justice was to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice ruled by the Opinion 1/91 that it would be a violation of the treaties to give to the EU institutions these powers with respect to non-EU member states. Therefore, the current arrangement was developed instead.\nEEA and Norway Grants.\nThe EEA and Norway Grants are the financial contributions of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to reduce social and economic disparities in Europe. They were established in conjunction with the 2004 enlargement of the European Economic Area (EEA), which brought together the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in the Internal Market. In the period from 2004 to 2009, \u20ac1.3\u00a0billion of project funding was made available for project funding in the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe. The EEA and Norway Grants are administered by the Financial Mechanism Office, which is affiliated to the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels.\nInternational conventions.\nEFTA also originated the Hallmarking Convention and the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention, both of which are open to non-EFTA states.\nInternational trade relations.\nEFTA has 31 free trade agreements with non-EU countries as well as declarations on cooperation and joint workgroups to improve trade. Currently, the EFTA States have established preferential trade relations with 41 states and territories, in addition to the 27 member states of the European Union.\nEFTA's interactive Free Trade Map gives an overview of the partners worldwide.\nOngoing free trade negotiations.\nSigned:\nNegotiations:\nNegotiations currently on hold\nDeclarations on cooperation\nObsolete agreements.\nThe following agreements are no longer active, being superseded by other agreements:\nTravel policies.\nFree movement of people within EFTA and the EU/EEA.\nEFTA member states' citizens enjoy freedom of movement in each other's territories in accordance with the EFTA convention. EFTA &amp; EEA nationals also enjoy freedom of movement in the European Union (EU). EFTA nationals and EU citizens are not only visa-exempt but are legally entitled to enter and reside in each other's countries. The Citizens' Rights Directive (also sometimes called the \"Free Movement Directive\") defines the right of free movement for citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the three EFTA members Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein plus the member states of the EU. Switzerland, which is a member of EFTA but not of the EEA, is not bound by the Directive but rather has a separate multilateral agreement on free movement with the EU and its member states.\nAs a result, a citizen of an EFTA country can live and work in all the other EFTA countries and in all the EU countries, and a citizen of an EU country can live and work in all the EFTA countries (but for voting and working in sensitive fields, such as government / police / military, citizenship is often required, and non-citizens may not have the same rights to welfare and unemployment benefits as citizens).\nPortugal Fund.\nThe Portugal Fund came into operation in February 1977 when Portugal was still a member of EFTA. It was to provide funding for the development of Portugal after the Carnation Revolution and the consequential restoration of democracy and the decolonisation of the country's overseas possessions. This followed a period of economic sanctions by most of the international community, which left Portugal economically underdeveloped compared to the rest of the western Europe. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985 in order to join the EEC, the remaining EFTA members decided to continue the Portugal Fund so that Portugal would continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-interest loan from the EFTA member states to the value of US$100 million. Repayment was originally to commence in 1988, however, EFTA then decided to postpone the start of repayments until 1998. The Portugal Fund was dissolved in January 2002.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9581", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9581", "title": "European Parliament", "text": "Directly elected legislature of the European Union\nThe European Parliament (EP) is one of the two legislative bodies of the European Union (EU) and one of its seven institutions. Together with the Council of the European Union (known as the Council and informally as the Council of Ministers), it adopts European legislation, following a proposal by the European Commission. The Parliament is composed of 720 members (MEPs), after the June 2024 European elections, from a previous 705 MEPs. It represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India), with an electorate of around 375\u00a0million eligible voters in 2024.\nSince 1979, the Parliament has been directly elected every five years by the citizens of the European Union through universal suffrage. Voter turnout in parliamentary elections decreased each time after 1979 until 2019, when voter turnout increased by eight percentage points, and rose above 50% for the first time since 1994. The voting age is 18 in all EU member states except for Malta, Belgium, Austria and Germany, where it is 16, and Greece, where it is 17.\nThe European Parliament has legislative power in that the adoption of EU legislation normally requires its approval, and that of the Council, in what amounts to a bicameral legislature. However, it does not formally possess the right of initiative (i.e. the right to formally initiate the legislative procedure) in the way that most national parliaments of the member states do, as the right of initiative is a prerogative of the European Commission. Nonetheless, the Parliament and the Council each have the right to request the Commission to initiate the legislative procedure and put forward a proposal.\nThe Parliament is, in protocol terms, the \"first institution\" of the European Union (mentioned first in its treaties and having ceremonial precedence over the other EU institutions), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except on a few issues where special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Ultimately, the European Commission, which serves as the executive branch of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council's nominee for President of the Commission, and is further tasked with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the current Commission to resign by adopting a motion of censure.\nThe president of the European Parliament is the body's speaker and presides over the multi-party chamber. The five largest political groups are the European People's Party Group (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), Patriots for Europe (PfE), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), and Renew Europe (Renew). The last EU-wide election was held in 2024.\nThe Parliament's headquarters are officially in Strasbourg, France, and has its administrative offices in Luxembourg City. Plenary sessions are normally held in Strasbourg for four days a month, but sometimes there are additional sessions in Brussels, while the Parliament's committee meetings are held primarily in Brussels, Belgium. In practice, the Parliament works three weeks per month in Brussels and one week (four days) in Strasbourg.\nHistory.\nThe Parliament, like the other EU institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 appointed parliamentarians drawn from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers. The change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell of the University of Manchester: \"For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop' [but] is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world\".\" This was done notably through successive treaty changes and other agreements.\nIts development since its foundation shows how the European Union's structures have evolved without a clear 'master plan'. Tom Reid of \"The Washington Post\" has said of the union that \"nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU\". Even the Parliament's three working locations are a result of various disagreements and partial agreements among the governments of the Member States. Although most MEPs would prefer to be based just in Brussels, where it conducts the bulk of its work, at the 1992 Edinburgh summit chaired by John Major, France engineered an agreement whereby the European Parliament's official seat is in Strasbourg, but most of its work is done in Brussels.\nConsultative assembly.\nThe body was not mentioned in the original Schuman Declaration. It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to perform legislative tasks. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution to counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by allowing for direct election and using the term \"representatives of the people\". Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a European Political Community. By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952 with extra members, but after the failure of the negotiated and proposed European Defence Community (French parliament veto), the project was dropped.\nInstead, the European Economic Community and Euratom were established in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg City, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This is seen as the birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.\nThe three communities merged their remaining organs as the European Communities in 1967, and the body's name was changed to the current \"European Parliament\" in 1962. In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the Communities' budget, which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975. Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However, the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system beforehand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the European Court of Justice; this led to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but with each Member State using its own electoral system, leaving the issue of a uniform voting systems to be decided at a later date.\nFor its sessions the assembly, and later the parliament, until 1999 convened in the same premises as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe: the House of Europe until 1977, and the Palace of Europe until 1999.\nElected Parliament.\nIn 1979, its members were directly elected for the first time. This sets it apart from similar institutions such as those of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 17 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its president. Veil was also the first female president of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.\nAs an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the EU. For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the \"draft Treaty establishing the European Union\" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur Altiero Spinelli MEP). Although it was not adopted as such by the Member States, many of its ideas were later taken up in subsequent amending treaties. Furthermore, the Parliament began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto their appointment.\nSince it became an elected body, the membership of the European Parliament has expanded when new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after German reunification). Following this, the Treaty of Nice imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected: 732, later raised to 751 by the Treaty of Lisbon.\nLike the other institutions, the Parliament's seat was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.\nThe Parliament gained more powers from successive revisions of the EU treaties, notably through the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure (originally called the codecision procedure), and the right to approve international agreements through the consent procedure.\nIn 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.\nCommission accountability to the Parliament.\nThe Parliament had always had the right to dismiss the European Commission in a vote of censure, but it initially had no role in its appointment. In the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht, the Member States gave the Parliament the right to approve or reject an incoming Commission. In the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, they gave it the right to approve or reject an incoming Commission President, subsequently (in the Treaty of Lisbon) describing Parliament's vote as the \"election\" of the President, and requiring the European Council to make its proposal to Parliament in light of the results of the European elections.\nIn 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, the European Council proposed as Commission President a candidate, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, from the largest political party (the EPP). The Parliament approved him by 431 votes to 251. However, when it came to the vote on the Commission as a whole, MEPs raised doubts about some of the nominees following their performance in the public hearings of them conducted by Parliament's committees. Most notably, the Civil Liberties committee rejected Rocco Buttiglione for the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever opposed an incoming Commissioner and, despite Barroso's initial insistence upon Buttiglione, the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament voted to allow the Barroso Commission to take office.\nThe Parliament also became more assertive in amending legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission. A notable example was on the Bolkestein directive in 2006, when the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The \"Financial Times\" described it in the following terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That is where the European parliament has suddenly come into its own. It marks another shift in power between the three central EU institutions. Last week's vote suggests that the directly elected MEPs, in spite of their multitude of ideological, national and historical allegiances, have started to coalesce as a serious and effective EU institution, just as enlargement has greatly complicated negotiations inside both the Council and Commission.\u2014\u200a\nIn 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini included Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though, in this field at the time, MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they were due to gain in 2009 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nRecent history.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increased committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.\nThe Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 December 2009, granting Parliament powers over the entire EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and describing Parliament's vote on an incoming Commission President Commission President as an \"election\", with the European Council having to make its proposal to Parliament in light of the results of the European elections.\nBarroso gained the support of the European Council for a second term and secured majority support from the Parliament in September 2009. Parliament voted 382 votes in favour and 219 votes against (117 abstentions) with support of the European People's Party, European Conservatives and Reformists Party and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The liberals gave support after Barroso gave them a number of concessions; the liberals previously joined the socialists' call for a delayed vote (the EPP had wanted to approve Barroso in July of that year).\nOnce Barroso put forward the candidates for his next Commission, another case of MEPs opposing a particular nominee arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only had the support of the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).\nBefore the final vote on the Commission, Parliament demanded a number of concessions as part of a future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's president will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have an observer seat in the EU's Commission-led international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. Parliament did not secure an explicit vote over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy, but it was agreed that they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would automatically put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.\nDuring the setting up of the European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to influence the shape of the EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs did not manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.\nIn December 2017, Politico denounced the insufficient racial diversity among Members of the European Parliament. The subsequent news coverage contributed to create the Brussels So White movement to campaign to rectify this situation.\nOn gender balance, some 37 percent of MEPs were women in the 2014-19 Parliament and 40 percent in the 2019-24 Parliament, a greater proposition than in most national Parliaments in Member States In January 2019, MEPs supported proposals to boost opportunities for women and tackle sexual harassment in the European Parliament.\nIn 2022, four people were arrested because of corruption. This came to be known as the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament.\nIn October 2023, the Parliament adopted a resolution to condemn \"Hamas' despicable terrorist attacks against Israel\".\nSince then, Europe's initial and almost unconditional support for Israel started to dwindle due to the disproportionate attacks on the civilian population of Gaza and the Occupied West Bank, with tens of thousands of deaths reported. In July 2025, the EU was weighing partly suspending parts of the EU-Israel Association Agreement over reports the country is breaching its human rights obligations in Gaza. A majority for a suspension was not found, but the EU\u2019s 27 foreign ministers agreed to \u201ckeep a close watch\u201d on Israel\u2019s compliance with a recent agreement to improve humanitarian aid access into Gaza. They also delayed agreeing on a list of 10 options to respond to Israel's action in Gaza during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.\nPowers and functions.\nThe Parliament and Council have been compared to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except for the fact that the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of a right of initiative has anyway been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a \"de facto\" right of legislative initiative.\nThe Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a \"pan-European soapbox\" with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States. Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties and treaties amending the EU treaties, but cannot veto them. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said that if it did so, they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.\nLegislative procedure.\nWith each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament, in terms of its role in the Union's legislative procedures, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" (previously named \"codecision procedure\"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \"common position\". That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a \"Conciliation Committee\" is formed. The committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.\nIn practice, most legislation is adopted at the first reading stage after the Parliament and the Council, having set out their initial positions, then negotiate a compromise text. These negotiations take place in so-called \"trilogue\" meetings, in which the Commission is also present.\nIn a few areas, \"special legislative procedures\" apply. These include justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone after consulting the other (or with its consent).\nThere are different types of European Union law#Legislation. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind member states to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is applicable to a particular person or group. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding, declarations.\nBudget.\nThe Parliament and the Council are also the Union's budgetary authority since the Budgetary Treaties of the 1970s and the Lisbon Treaty. The EU budget is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved by the Council, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively, but only by a three-fifths majority.\nThe Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to grant discharge only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the discharge power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission. Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the European External Action Service, Parliament had a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.\nControl of the executive.\nThe President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament. That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a majority of members of the Parliament) who thereby \"elect\" the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.\nIn practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but the threat to do so has produced concessions to Parliament on the Commission's composition or on policy commitments. As described above, when the Barroso Commission was put forward, the Parliament forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to Parliament. That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also vote along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public\u00a0\u2013 reversing the previous decline in turnout for the Parliament's elections.\nThe Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission by a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been explicitly used, but when faced with such a vote, the Santer Commission then resigned of their own accord.\nThere are other control instruments, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer written and oral questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the Council to present its programme at the start of their presidency; the obligation on the President of the European Council to report to Parliament after each of its meetings; the right of MEPs to make requests for legislation and policy to the Commission; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. \"Commission Question Time\" every Tuesday). Regarding written and oral questions, MEPs voted in July 2008 to limit questions to those within the EU's mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.\nSupervisory and scrutiny powers.\nThe Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the Maastricht Treaty. The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, which it has done, for example over mad cow disease and CIA detention flights\u00a0\u2013 the former led to the creation of the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.\nThe European Ombudsman is elected by the Parliament to deal with public complaints about maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay) by any EU institution or body.\nPetitions can be brought to the Parliament by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Parliament's Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.\nMembers.\nThe parliamentarians are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. About 40 percent are women. Before the first direct elections, in 1979, they were appointed by their national parliaments.\nThe Parliament has been criticized for underrepresentation of minority groups. In 2017, an estimated 17 MEPs were non-white, and of these, three were black, a disproportionately low number. According to activist organization European Network Against Racism, while an estimated 10% of Europe is composed of racial and ethnic minorities, only 5% of MEPs were members of such groups following the 2019 European Parliament election.\nUnder the Lisbon Treaty, seats are allocated to each state according to population and the maximum number of members is set at 751. Since 1 February 2020 and the United Kingdom's leaving the EU, 705 MEPs sit in the European Parliament. It rose to 720 after the 2024 elections.\nRepresentation is currently limited to a maximum of 96 seats and a minimum of 6 seats per state and the seats are distributed according to \"degressive proportionality\", i.e., the larger the state, the more citizens are represented per MEP. As a result, Maltese and Luxembourgish voters have roughly 10x more influence per voter than citizens of the six largest countries.\nAs of 2014[ [update]], Germany (80.9 million inhabitants) has 96 seats (previously 99 seats), i.e. one seat for 843,000 inhabitants. Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has 6 seats, i.e. one seat for 70,000 inhabitants.\nThe new system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising the seating well before elections, was intended to avoid political horse trading when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.\nPursuant to this apportionment, the constituencies are formed. In four EU member states (Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Poland), the national territory is divided into a number of constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of proportional representation.\nTransitional arrangements.\nDue to the delay in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh parliament was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.\nSalaries and expenses.\nBefore 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of \u20ac8,484.05 each in 2016, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs are entitled to a pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. They may then only be prosecuted after the European Parliament waives their immunity. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.\nPolitical groups.\nMEPs in Parliament are organised into eight different parliamentary groups; members who do not join a group are known as \"non-attached members\" or \"non-inscrits\".\nThe two largest groups are the European People's Party Group (EPP) and the Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its existence, jointly holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats until 2019. No single group has ever held an absolute majority in Parliament.\nAs a result of being broad alliances of national parties, political groups in the European Parliament are decentralised and have more in common with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than with unitary states, like the majority of the EU member states. Nevertheless, the political groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.\nHalf of the groups are based on a single European political party, such as the European People's Party, with the addition of MEPs from national parties not members of a European party and independent MEPs. The others, such as the Greens\u2013European Free Alliance group or the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, center on two European parties, as well as other national parties and independents.\nGroups need 23 MEPs from seven different member states to register. Following registration, groups receive public funding from the budget of the European Parliament.\nCoalitions.\nGiven that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of many parliamentary systems, majorities are built issue by issue. Generally, this is along broadly consensual lines with dynamic coalitions rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions.\nThese coalitions usually involve the European People's Party and the Socialist and Democrat Group of the Party of European Socialists who tend to co-operate to find compromises between them and then bring in others. Their relationship has been described as a grand coalition. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing groups. Sometimes, the Liberal (Renew Europe) Group is then in the pivotal position.\nThere are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission. When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against \u00c9dith Cresson and Manuel Mar\u00edn, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the Community budget, President Jacques Santer stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. The Socialist Group initially supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, Pauline Green MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-opposition dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down. Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noted that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our work also shows that politics in the European Parliament is becoming increasingly based around party and ideology. Voting is increasingly split along left-right lines, and the cohesion of the party groups has risen dramatically, particularly in the fourth and fifth parliaments. So there are likely to be policy implications here too.\nDuring the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the Liberals (then called ELDR), rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament. The EPP-S&amp;D coalition lost their majority after the 2019 European Parliament election, requiring support by at least one other political group for a majority, most frequently the liberal Renew Group or the Greens.\nElections.\nElections have taken place, directly in every member state, every five years since 1979. As of 2019[ [update]] there have been ten elections. When a nation joins mid-term, a by-election is held in that country to elect its representatives. This has happened six times, most recently when Croatia joined in 2013. Elections take place on over a four-day period from a Thursday to a Sunday (each Member State votes on the day of its choice).\nMember States choose their electoral system within common guidelines, notably that the suffrage must be universal and that seats are allocated by proportional representation. This includes determining constituencies: while most Member States have a national constituencies, some divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member states according to their population, since 2014 with no state having more than 96, but no fewer than 6, to maintain proportionality.\nThe most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the European elections of 2019, held from 23 to 26 May 2019. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world.\nThe first session of the ninth parliament started 2 July 2019.\nEuropean political parties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections (as opposed to their corresponding EP groups). There have been a number of proposals designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the pan-European political parties announced, ahead of the elections, their candidates for president of the Commission, the so-called \"Spitzenkandidaten\" (German, \"leading candidates\" or \"top candidates\"). The President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and while there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful \"candidate\", the Lisbon Treaty states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate, and the candidate they propose must be endorsed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.\nThe \"Spitzenkandidaten\" in 2014 were Jean-Claude Juncker for the European People's Party, Martin Schulz for the Party of European Socialists, Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, Ska Keller and Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 jointly for the European Green Party and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left. The EPP won the most seats and Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated by the European Council and elected by the Parliament.\nIn 2019, the parties again announced their candidates for President of the Commission ahead of the European elections, notably Manfred Weber for the EPP and Frans Timmermans for the Party of European Socialists. However, after the election, there was no agreement among the parties after the election to back any of them. After a period of deadlock, the European Council proposed Ursula von der Leyen as a compromise and Parliament elected her, albeit by a narrow majority.\nIn 2024, the EPP decided to back Von der Leyen for a second term of office and put her forward as their \"Spitzenkandidat\" while the PES put forward Nicolas Schmit. After the election, the European Council duly nominated her and the Parliament elected her by 401 votes to 284, with support from the EPP, the Socialists, the liberal Renew Group and the Greens.\nUntil 2014, turnout dropped consistently in every election since the first election, and from 1999 until 2014 was below 50%. In 2007 both Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs in by-elections, having joined at the beginning of 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6% and 28.3% respectively. This trend was interrupted in the 2019 election, when turnout increased by 8% EU-wide, rising to 50.6%, the highest since 1994.\nIn England, Scotland and Wales, EP elections were originally held for a constituency MEP on a first-past-the-post basis. In 1999 the system was changed to a form of proportional representation where parties put up a team of candidates in regional constituencies. One could vote for a party's list of candidates, but not for an individual candidate (unless that party had a single candidate).\nProceedings.\nFormally, the European Parliament has an annual \"session\", divided into monthly \"part-sessions\" and daily \"sittings\". In practice, this entails a monthly cycle with two committee weeks where matters are discussed in committees, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups, and session weeks where members spend &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 days in Strasbourg for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part sessions are organised in Brussels throughout the year. Four weeks a year are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work, which they otherwise have to do at weekends. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.\nThe Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly set out by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own \"Rules of Procedure\" (the regulations governing the parliament).\nDuring sittings, members may speak after being called on by the President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due to the need for interpretation, and the politics of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the \"Official Journal of the European Union\" and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.\nMembers sit in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for listening to interpretation, and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the Groups sit on the front benches, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other.\nAccess to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who also aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.\nPresident and organisation.\nThe President is essentially the speaker of the Parliament and presides over the plenary when it is in session. The President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. The President is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term. The current President of the European Parliament is Roberta Metsola, who was elected in January 2022.\nIn most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol ranking of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depend upon the President. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona who had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.\nA number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The three female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament), Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen, and Roberta Metsola from Malta in 2022. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.\nDuring the election of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous vice-presidents) presides over the chamber. Prior to 2009, the oldest member fulfilled this role but the rule was changed to prevent far-right French MEP Jean-Marie Le Pen taking the chair.\nThe Parliament also elects 14 Vice-Presidents who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of bodies responsible for the running of Parliament. The two main ones are the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues and is composed of the President and the Vice-Presidents, and the Conference of Presidents which is the political governing body and is composed of the President of the Parliament and the leaders of each of the Parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are five Quaestors.\nAs of 2014[ [update]], the European Parliament budget was EUR 1.756 billion. A 2008 report on the Parliament's finances highlighted certain overspending and miss-payments. Despite some MEPs calling for the report to be published, Parliamentary authorities had refused until an MEP broke confidentiality and leaked it.\nCommittees and delegations.\nThe Parliament has 20 Standing Committees ranging in size from 25 to 88 MEPs (each reflecting the political make-up of the whole Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case: in the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.\nThe Parliament can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the Subcommittee on Human Rights) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in Democratic Processes in the European Union, 2020\u201323). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the \"Conference of Committee Chairmen\".\nThe nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the United States Congress, the European Parliament's committee secretariats are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.\nDelegations of the Parliament are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 44 delegations, mostly small (around 15 MEPs) but some larger. Chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. Delegations include \"Interparliamentary delegations\" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), \"joint parliamentary committees\" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the delegation to the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the NATO Assembly, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and through election observation in third countries.\nIntergroups.\nThe Intergroups in the European Parliament are informal fora which gather MEPs from various political groups around any topic. They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example), must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups who can each support a limited number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014\u20132019, the EPP or S&amp;D political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).\nTranslation and interpretation.\nSpeakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the 24 official languages of the European Union, ranging from French and German to Maltese and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-four languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full-time and 400 freelancers when there is higher demand). Citizens may also address the Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician.\nUsually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting)\u00a0\u2013 for example, when interpreting out of Estonian into Maltese. Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.\nWhile some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from \u20ac118,000 per day (for 21 languages then\u00a0\u2013 Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to \u20ac8,900 per day. There has also been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, on the basis of an argument that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.\nBecause the proceedings are translated into all of the official EU languages, they have been used to make a multilingual corpus known as Europarl. It is widely used to train statistical machine translation systems.\nCorruption scandals.\nQatar related.\nQatargate is an ongoing political scandal, involving allegations that European Parliament officials, lobbyists and their families have been influenced by the governments of Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania, engaging in corruption, money laundering, and organized crime to improve the image of these countries in the EU amongst others to kill off six parliamentary resolutions condemning Qatar's human rights record, and working to deliver a visa-free travel deal between Doha and the EU. Law enforcement authorities in Belgium, Italy and Greece seized \u20ac1.5 million in cash, confiscated computers and mobile phones, and charged four individuals with the alleged offences: Eva Kaili, Antonio Panzeri, an Italian former MEP, Francesco Giorgi and Luca Visentini. Later also Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca, Marc Tarabella and Andrea Cozzolino were arrested. In 2023, Belgian MEP Marie Arena was charged, and in 2025, two more women: Elisabetta Gualmini and Alessandra Moretti.\nAzerbaijan related.\nAzerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats to promote its causes abroad and legitimize its elections at home, a practice termed caviar diplomacy. In 2023 the Swedish-German investigative platform Blankspot published several investigative reports about freewheeling trips made by several European Parliament members to Azerbaijan. Several publications have emphasised how these trips raise questions on the reliability of EU Parliament ethics codes and the importance of enforcing them.\nFrench National Front assistants affair.\nIn December 2023, Marine Le Pen was ordered to stand trial after she was charged with paying National Front party officials through funds earmarked for European Parliament assistants. Twenty-seven others, including her father Jean Marie, served as her co-defendants. Her trial, for misappropriation of public funds, was scheduled in March 2024 to occur between 30 September and 27 November the same year.\nOn 31 March 2025, eight MEPs, 12 assistants from the National Rally, and Le Pen were found guilty of embezzling European Union funds by a Paris court. Le Pen received a four-year prison sentence, two years of which were suspended, in addition to a \u20ac100,000 fine. She did not begin serving the two years' house arrest immediately as all appeals must be exhausted before this part of the sentence is executed. Similarly, she did not lose her seat in the lower house of the French parliament immediately. On the other hand, the court also banned her, effective immediately, from standing for political office for five years, making her ineligible to run in the 2027 French presidential election.\nRussia related.\nThe former British MEP Nathan Gill (UKIP and later the Leader of the Reform UK party in Wales) pleaded guilty on Friday, 26 September 2025 to eight counts of bribery, under the UK's Bribery Act, 2010. He had taken payments to speak in the European Parliament to promote Russian interests, in particular in relation to Ukraine.\nOther.\nA January 2024 report published by investigative outlet \"Follow the Money\" found that 1 in 4 EU lawmakers have been implicated in judicial cases or scandals. Out of 253 cases highlighted in the report, only 23 have resulted in convictions.\nThere are also ongoing concerns related to allegations that members of the European Parliament were illegally or unethically influenced by Russia. Such concerns have been raised several times in 2023 and 2024 and dubbed \"Russiagate\".\nPanzeri's lobbying group, Fight Impunity, was largely funded by Iqbal Surv\u00e9, a controversial South African billionaire. Surv\u00e9's Sekunjalo Development Foundation was found to be the \"most important donor\" having donated \u20ac250,000 to the group.\nAnti-corruption policies.\nThe European Parliament has had criticism over its prodigality and for being too complacent with conflicts of interest. Its refusal to become full member of the GRECO like all its member states is also a matter of criticism.\nThe European Parliament revised its rules of procedure and its code of conduct in September 2023, placing six main obligations on MEPs:\nAnnual costs.\nAccording to the European Parliament website, the annual parliament budget for 2021 was \u20ac2.064 billion, which corresponds to 1.2% of EU budget. The main cost categories were:\nAccording to a European Parliament study prepared in 2013, the Strasbourg seat costs an extra \u20ac103 million over maintaining a single location and according to the Court of Auditors an additional \u20ac5 million is related to travel expenses caused by having two seats.\nAs a comparison, the German lower house of parliament (Bundestag) is estimated to cost \u20ac517 million in total for 2018, for a parliament with 709 members. The British House of Commons reported total annual costs in 2016\u20132017 of \u00a3249 million (\u20ac279 million). It had 650 seats.\nAccording to \"The Economist\", the European Parliament costs more than the British, French and German parliaments combined. A quarter of the costs is estimated to be related to translation and interpretation costs (c. \u20ac460 million) and the double seats are estimated to add an additional \u20ac180 million a year. For a like-for-like comparison, these two cost blocks can be excluded.\nOn 2 July 2018, MEPs rejected proposals to tighten the rules around the General Expenditure Allowance (GEA), which \"is a controversial \u20ac4,416 per month payment that MEPs are given to cover office and other expenses, but they are not required to provide any evidence of how the money is spent\".\nSeats.\nThe Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. The Member States attached a protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam that requires 12 plenary sessions to be held in Strasbourg (in practice, none in August but two in October), which is described as the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg City hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is one of at least two assemblies in the world with more than one meeting place (another being the parliament of the Isle of Man, Tynwald) and one of the few that does not have the power to decide its own location.\nThe Strasbourg seat is considered a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, two countries that previously fought over the region. However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe, Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions, with the majority of Parliament's work being carried out there. Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a \"travelling circus\", and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the 'capital' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing from numerous figures, including Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Commission First-Vice President from 2004 to 2010, who stated that \"something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol\u00a0\u2013 of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions\". The Green Party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200\u00a0million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268\u00a0tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m MEP. In August 2014, an assessment by the European Court of Auditors calculated that relocating the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament to Brussels would save \u20ac113.8 million per year. In 2006, there were allegations of irregularities in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented, thus further harming the case for the Strasbourg seat.\nMost MEPs prefer Brussels as a single base. A poll of MEPs found 89% of the respondents wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels. Another survey found 68% support. In July 2011, an absolute majority of MEPs voted in favour of a single seat. In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week. The mayor of Strasbourg officially reacted by stating \"we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary's strength to our own profit, as a judoka would do\". However, as Parliament's seat is now fixed by the treaties, it can only be changed by the Member States, acting unanimously and with national ratification, meaning that France could veto any move. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that the Strasbourg seat is \"non-negotiable\" and that France has no intention of surrendering the only EU Institution on French soil. Given France's declared intention to veto any relocation to Brussels, some MEPs have advocated civil disobedience by refusing to take part in the monthly exodus to Strasbourg.\nHowever, the main building in Brussels has been suffering for more than a decade from a state of degradation. Renovation or reconstruction works including a hemicycle were estimated to cost at least \u20ac500 million in 2017 with fear that the cost would be even higher and possibly escalate up to \u20ac1 billion, whereas the seat in Strasbourg already offers a fully-fledged hemicycle.\nChannels of dialogue, information, and communication with European civil society.\nIndividual MEPs are the main point of contact for citizens with the Parliament. They normally have an office in their constituency and travel back at the end of every week (and during weeks without parliamentary meetings) to participate in an array of meetings, events, interviews, visits and suchlike with voters, businesses, trade unions, local authorities and media.\nThe Parliament itself maintains a detailed website, receives around one million visitors a year, and streamlines debates and committee meetings.\nOver the last few years, European institutions have committed to promoting transparency, openness, and the availability of information about their work. In particular, transparency is regarded as pivotal to the action of European institutions and a general principle of EU law, to be applied to the activities of EU institutions in order to strengthen the Union's democratic foundation. The general principles of openness and transparency are reaffirmed in the articles 8 A, point 3 and 10.3 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Maastricht Treaty respectively, stating that \"every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen\". Furthermore, both treaties acknowledge the value of dialogue between citizens, representative associations, civil society, and European institutions.\nDialogue with religious and non-confessional organisations.\nArticle 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) lays the juridical foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations. In July 2014, in the beginning of the 8th term, then President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz tasked Antonio Tajani, then vice-president, with implementing the dialogue with the religious and confessional organisations included in article 17. In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.\nEuropean Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction.\nThe chair of European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was established in 1987 by initiative of British MEP Charles Henry Plumb, with the goal of helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinness (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009\u20132014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004\u20132009), Mary Banotti (1995\u20132004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987\u20131994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.\nLiaison Offices (EPLOs) &amp; Antennas.\nThe European Parliament operates Liaison Offices (EPLOs) in all Member States, as well as in the United Kingdom (London and the United States (Washington, D.C.). On 17 September 2025, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola opened the Parliament's antenna office in Kyiv, co-located with the EU delegation in Kyiv. The European Parliament also operates antennas in New York (for the United Nations), Addis Ababa (for the African Union) Jakarta (for ASEAN), Tirana (for the Western Balkans), Chi\u0219in\u0103u (for Eastern Partnership). All antennas are co-located within the EEAS delegations.\nEuropean Parliamentary Research Service.\nThe European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) is the European Parliament's in-house research department and think tank. It provides Members of the European Parliament\u00a0\u2013 and, where appropriate, parliamentary committees\u00a0\u2013 with independent, objective and authoritative analysis of, and research on, policy issues relating to the European Union, in order to assist them in their parliamentary work. It is also designed to increase Members' and EP committees' capacity to scrutinise and oversee the European Commission and other EU executive bodies.\nEPRS aims to provide a comprehensive range of products and services, backed by specialist internal expertise and knowledge sources in all policy fields, so empowering Members and committees through knowledge and contributing to the Parliament's effectiveness and influence as an institution. In undertaking this work, the EPRS supports and promotes parliamentary outreach to the wider public, including dialogue with relevant stakeholders in the EU's system of multi-level governance. All EPRS publications are publicly available on the EP Think Tank platform.\nEurobarometer of the European Parliament.\nThe European Parliament periodically commissions opinion polls and studies on public opinion trends in member states to survey perceptions and expectations of citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union. Topics include citizens' perception of the European Parliament's role, their knowledge of the institution, their sense of belonging in the European Union, opinions on European elections and European integration, identity, citizenship, political values, but also on current issues such as climate change, current economy and politics, etc. Eurobarometer analyses seek to provide an overall picture of national situations, regional specificities, socio-demographic cleavages, and historical trends.\nPrizes.\nSakharov Prize.\nWith the Sakharov Prize, created in 1988, the European Parliament supports human rights by awarding individuals that contribute to promoting human rights worldwide, thus raising awareness on human rights violations. Priorities include: protection of human rights and fundamental liberties, with particular focus on freedom of expression; protection of minority rights; compliance with international law; and development of democracy and authentic rule of law.\nEuropean Charlemagne Youth Prize.\nThe European Charlemagne Youth Prize seeks to encourage youth participation in the European integration process. It is awarded by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen to youth projects aimed at nurturing common European identity and European citizenship.\nEuropean Citizens' Prize.\nThe European Citizens' Prize is awarded by the European Parliament to activities and actions carried out by citizens and associations to promote integration between the citizens of EU member states and transnational cooperation projects in the EU.\nLUX Prize.\nSince 2007, the LUX Prize is awarded by the European Parliament to films dealing with current topics of public European interest that encourage reflection on Europe and its future. Over time, the Lux Prize has become a prestigious cinema award which supports European film and production also outside the EU.\nDaphne Caruana Galizia Journalism Prize.\nFrom 2021, the Daphne Caruana Galizia Journalism prize shall be awarded by the European Parliament to outstanding journalism that reflect EU values. The prize consists in an award of 20,000 euros. This award is named after the late Maltese journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia who was assassinated in Malta on 16 October 2017. In October 2021 the prize was first awarded to the Pegasus Project.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9582", "revid": "38745438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9582", "title": "European Council", "text": "EU institution\nThe European Council (informally EUCO) is a collegiate body (directorial system) and a symbolic collective head of state, that defines the overall political direction and general priorities of the European Union (EU). It is composed of the heads of state or of government of the EU member states, the president of the European Council, and the president of the European Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings.\nEstablished as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009 upon the commencement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its current president is Ant\u00f3nio Costa, former prime minister of Portugal.\nScope.\nWhile the European Council has no legislative power, it is a strategic (and crisis-solving) body that provides the union with general political directions and priorities, and acts as a collective presidency. The European Commission remains the sole initiator of legislation, but the European Council provides a guide to legislative policy and has been called \"the law-maker-in-chief\".\nThe meetings of the European Council, still commonly referred to as EU summits, are chaired by its president and take place at least twice every six months; usually in the Europa building in Brussels. Decisions of the European Council are taken by consensus, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\nHistory.\nThe European Council officially gained the status of an EU institution after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits of the leaders of the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (notably the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.\nThe summits were only formalised in the period between 1974 and 1988. At the December summit in Paris in 1974, following a proposal from then-French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, it was agreed that more high-level, political input was needed following the \"empty chair crisis\" and economic problems. The inaugural \"European Council\", as it became known, was held in Dublin on 10 and 11 March 1975 during Ireland's first Presidency of the Council of Ministers. In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the Single European Act) and had a defined role for the first time in the Maastricht Treaty. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975\u20131995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008\u20132014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The seat of the Council was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1\u00bd years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official \"Council conclusions\", as they instead end by more broad political \"Statements\" on some cherry-picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official \"Council conclusions\" but differ from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the 11 September attacks.\nSome meetings of the European Council\u2014and, before the European Council was formalised, meetings of the heads of government\u2014are seen by some as turning points in the history of the European Union. For example:\nAs such, the European Council had already existed before it gained the status as an institution of the European Union with the entering into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but even after it had been mentioned in the treaties (since the Single European Act) it could only take political decisions, not formal legal acts. However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the Council of Ministers and take formal decisions in that role. Sometimes, this was even compulsory, e.g. Article 214(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provided (before it was amended by the Treaty of Lisbon) that 'the Council, meeting \"in the composition of Heads of State or Government\" and acting by a qualified majority, shall nominate the person it intends to appoint as President of the Commission' (emphasis added); the same rule applied in some monetary policy provisions introduced by the Maastricht Treaty (e.g. Article 109j TEC). In that case, what was politically part of a European Council meeting was legally a meeting of the Council of Ministers. When the European Council, already introduced into the treaties by the Single European Act, became an institution by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, this was no longer necessary, and the \"Council [of the European Union] meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government\", was replaced in these instances by the European Council now taking formal legally binding decisions in these cases ().\nThe Treaty of Lisbon made the European Council a formal institution distinct from the (ordinary) Council of the EU, and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As an outgrowth of the Council of the EU, the European Council had previously followed the same Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council of the EU retains that system, the European Council established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year term\u2014which can be renewed for the same person only once. Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the European Council elected the then-Prime Minister of Belgium Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent president; he resigned the prime ministerial position.\nPowers and functions.\nThe European Council is an official institution of the EU, described in the Lisbon Treaty as a body which \"shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development\". Essentially it defines the EU's policy agenda and has thus been considered to be the motor of European integration. Beyond the need to provide \"impetus\", the council has developed further roles: to \"settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level\", to lead in foreign policy\u00a0\u2014 acting externally as a \"collective Head of State\", \"formal ratification of important documents\" and \"involvement in the negotiation of the treaty changes\".\nSince the institution is composed of national leaders, it gathers the executive power of the member states and has thus a great influence in high-profile policy areas as for example foreign policy. It also exercises powers of appointment, such as appointment of its own President, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the President of the European Central Bank. It proposes, to the European Parliament, a candidate for President of the European Commission. Moreover, the European Council influences police and justice planning, the composition of the commission, matters relating to the organisation of the rotating Council presidency, the suspension of membership rights, and changing the voting systems through the Passerelle Clause. Although the European Council has no direct legislative power, under the \"emergency brake\" procedure, a state outvoted in the Council of Ministers may refer contentious legislation to the European Council. However, the state may still be outvoted in the European Council. Hence with powers over the supranational executive of the EU, in addition to its other powers, the European Council has been described by some as the Union's \"supreme political authority\".\nComposition.\nThe European Council consists of the heads of state or government of the member states, alongside its own President and the Commission President (both non-voting). The meetings used to be regularly attended by the national foreign minister as well, and the Commission President likewise accompanied by another member of the commission. However, since the Treaty of Lisbon, this has been discontinued, as the size of the body had become somewhat large following successive accessions of new Member States to the Union.\nMeetings can also include other invitees, such as the President of the European Central Bank, as required. The Secretary-General of the Council attends, and is responsible for organisational matters, including minutes. The President of the European Parliament also attends to give an opening speech outlining the European Parliament's position before talks begin.\nAdditionally, the negotiations involve a large number of other people working behind the scenes. Most of those people, however, are not allowed to the conference room, except for two delegates per state to relay messages. At the push of a button members can also call for advice from a Permanent Representative via the \"Antici Group\" in an adjacent room. The group is composed of diplomats and assistants who convey information and requests. Interpreters are also required for meetings as members are permitted to speak in their own languages.\nAs the composition is not precisely defined, some states which have a considerable division of executive power can find it difficult to decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that there was no need for the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian B\u0103sescu and Prime Minister C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu in 2007\u20132008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.\nEurozone summits.\nA number of ad hoc meetings of heads of state or government of the member states of the euro area were held in 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign Debt crisis. It was agreed in October 2011 that they should meet regularly twice a year (with extra meetings if needed). This will normally be at the end of a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 20) heads of state or government of the member states of the eurozone.\nPresident.\nThe President of the European Council is elected by its members through a qualified majority vote for a once-renewable term of two and a half years. Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) identifies his duties. It is the Heads of State or Government who vote for this office. The President must report to the European Parliament after each European Council meeting. The post was created by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in accordance with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office of a head of state, merely a \"primus inter pares\" (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.\nMembers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitical alliances.\nAlmost all members of the European Council are members of a political party at the national level. Most of them are also members of political alliances at the European level such as European political parties and political groups of the European Parliament.\nThese alliances frequently hold pre-meetings with their European Council members, prior to their meetings. However, the members of the European Council represent their member states rather than political alliances, and decisions are generally made along national lines, though ideological alignment can colour political agreements and appointments (such as the president of the European Council).\nThe charts below outline the number of leaders affiliated to each alliance and their total voting weight. The map indicates the political group of the member representing each individual country.\nSeat and meetings.\nThe European Council is required by Article 15.3 TEU to meet at least twice every six months, but convenes more frequently in practice. Despite efforts to contain business, meetings typically last for at least two days, and run long into the night.\nUntil 2002, the venue for European Council summits was the member state that held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement at such a time as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's \"supreme political authority\".\nOriginally, both the European Council and the Council of the European Union utilised the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. In order to make room for additional meeting space a number of renovations were made, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional press briefing rooms. However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year. This resulted in the Europa building, which opened its doors in 2017. The focal point of the new building, the distinctive multi-storey \"lantern-shaped\" structure in which the main meeting room is located, is utilised in both the European Council's and Council of the European Union's official logos.\nRole in security and defence.\nThe EU command and control (C2) structure is directed by political bodies composed of member states' representatives, and generally requires unanimous decisions. As of April 2019:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;1 In the event of a CSDP Civilian Mission also being in the field, the relations with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) and its Civilian Operation Commander (Civ OpCdr), as well as the subordinate Head of Mission (HoM), are coordinated as shown.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;2 Other Component Commanders (CCs) and service branches which may be established.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;3 The MPCC is part of the EUMS and Dir MPCC is double-hatted as DGEUMS. Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), either a national OHQ offered by member states or the NATO Command Structure (NCS) would serve this purpose. In the latter instance, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), rather than Dir MPCC, would serve as Operation Commander (OpCdr).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;4 Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), the MFCdr would be known as a Force Commander (FCdr), and direct a Force Headquarters (FHQ) rather than a MFHQ. Whereas the MFHQ would act both on the operational and tactical level, the FHQ would act purely on the operational level.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;5 The political strategic level is not part of the C2 structure per se, but represents the political bodies, with associated support facilities, that determine the missions' general direction. The Council determines the role of the High Representative (HR/VP), who serves as Vice-President of the European Commission, attends European Council meetings, chairs the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and may chair the Political and Security Committee (PSC) in times of crisis. The HR/VP proposes and implements CSDP decisions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;6 Same composition as Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) II, which also prepares for the CSDP-related work of the FAC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9587", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9587", "title": "Euthanasia", "text": "Intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering\nEuthanasia (from : + ) is the practice of intentionally ending life to eliminate pain and suffering.\nDifferent countries have different euthanasia laws. The British House of Lords select committee on medical ethics defines euthanasia as \"a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life to relieve intractable suffering\". In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is understood as \"termination of life by a doctor at the request of a patient\". The Dutch law, however, does not use the term 'euthanasia' but includes the concept under the broader definition of \"assisted suicide and termination of life on request\".\nEuthanasia is categorised in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary. Voluntary euthanasia is when a person wishes to have their life ended and is legal in a growing number of countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia occurs when a patient's consent is unavailable, (e.g., comatose or under a persistent-vegetative state,) and is legal in some countries under certain limited conditions, in both active and passive forms. Involuntary euthanasia, which is done without asking for consent or against the patient's will, is illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.\nAs of 2006[ [update]], euthanasia had become the most active area of research in bioethics.\nIn some countries, divisive public controversy occurs over the moral, ethical, and legal issues associated with euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as \"pulling the plug\") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia, however, is legal or \"de facto\" legal in only a handful of countries (for example, Belgium, Canada, Uruguay and Switzerland), which limit it to specific circumstances and require the approval of counsellors, doctors, or other specialists. In some countries\u2014such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan\u2014support for active euthanasia is almost nonexistent.\nDefinition.\nCurrent usage.\nAs of 2024, dictionary definitions focus on euthanasia as the act of killing someone to prevent further suffering. There is no sense of whether the person agrees or is proactive in the situation.\nPast discussions on key elements.\nIn 1974 euthanasia was defined as the \"painless inducement of a quick death\". However, it is argued that this approach fails to properly define euthanasia, as it leaves open a number of possible actions that would meet the requirements of the definition but would not be seen as euthanasia. In particular, these include situations where a person kills another, painlessly, but for no reason beyond that of personal gain, or accidental deaths that are quick and painless but not intentional.\nAnother approach incorporated the notion of suffering into the definition. The definition offered by the Oxford English Dictionary incorporates suffering as a necessary condition with \"the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma\", This approach is included in Marvin Khol and Paul Kurtz's definition of it as \"a mode or act of inducing or permitting death painlessly as a relief from suffering\". Counterexamples can be given: such definitions may encompass killing a person suffering from an incurable disease for personal gain (such as to claim an inheritance), and commentators such as Tom Beauchamp and Arnold Davidson have argued that doing so would constitute \"murder simpliciter\" rather than euthanasia.\nThe third element incorporated into many definitions is that of intentionality: the death must be intended rather than accidental, and the intent of the action must be a \"merciful death\". Michael Wreen argued that \"the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from intentional killing simpliciter is the agent's motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned.\" Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that \"the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be in the best interests of the person on the receiving end.\" Definitions such as those offered by the House of Lords Select committee on Medical Ethics take this path, where euthanasia is defined as \"a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering.\" Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight Baruch Brody's \"an act of euthanasia is one in which one person\u00a0... (A) kills another person (B) for the benefit of the second person, who actually does benefit from being killed\".\nDraper argued that any definition of euthanasia must incorporate four elements: an agent and a subject; an intention; causal proximity, such that the actions of the agent lead to the outcome; and an outcome. Based on this, she offered a definition incorporating those elements, stating that euthanasia \"must be defined as death that results from the intention of one person to kill another person, using the most gentle and painless means possible, that is motivated solely by the best interests of the person who dies.\" Prior to Draper, Beauchamp and Davidson had also offered a definition that included these elements. Their definition specifically discounts fetuses to distinguish between abortions and euthanasia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In summary, we have argued\u00a0... that the death of a human being, A, is an instance of euthanasia if and only if (1) A's death is intended by at least one other human being, B, where B is either the cause of death or a causally relevant feature of the event resulting in death (whether by action or by omission); (2) there is either sufficient current evidence for B to believe that A is acutely suffering or irreversibly comatose, or there is sufficient current evidence related to A's present condition such that one or more known causal laws supports B's belief that A will be in a condition of acute suffering or irreversible comatoseness; (3) (a) B's primary reason for intending A's death is cessation of A's (actual or predicted future) suffering or irreversible comatoseness, where B does not intend A's death for a different primary reason, though there may be other relevant reasons, and (b) there is sufficient current evidence for either A or B that causal means to A's death will not produce any more suffering than would be produced for A if B were not to intervene; (4) the causal means to the event of A's death are chosen by A or B to be as painless as possible, unless either A or B has an overriding reason for a more painful causal means, where the reason for choosing the latter causal means does not conflict with the evidence in 3b; (5) A is a nonfetal organism.\nWreen, in part responding to Beauchamp and Davidson, offered a six-part definition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Person A committed an act of euthanasia if and only if (1) A killed B or let her die; (2) A intended to kill B; (3) the intention specified in (2) was at least partial cause of the action specified in (1); (4) the causal journey from the intention specified in (2) to the action specified in (1) is more or less in accordance with A's plan of action; (5) A's killing of B is a voluntary action; (6) the motive for the action specified in (1), the motive standing behind the intention specified in (2), is the good of the person killed.\nWreen also considered a seventh requirement: \"(7) The good specified in (6) is, or at least includes, the avoidance of evil\", although, as Wreen noted in the paper, he was not convinced that the restriction was required.\nIn discussing his definition, Wreen noted the difficulty of justifying euthanasia when faced with the notion of the subject's \"right to life\". In response, Wreen argued that euthanasia has to be voluntary and that \"involuntary euthanasia is, as such, a great wrong\". Other commentators incorporate consent more directly into their definitions. For example, in a discussion of euthanasia presented in 2003 by the European Association of Palliative Care (EPAC) Ethics Task Force, the authors offered: \"Medicalized killing of a person without the person's consent, whether nonvoluntary (where the person is unable to consent) or involuntary (against the person's will), is not euthanasia: it is murder. Hence, euthanasia can be voluntary only.\" Although the EPAC Ethics Task Force argued that both non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia could not be included in the definition of euthanasia, there is discussion in the literature about excluding one but not the other.\nHistorical use.\n\"Euthanasia\" has had different meanings depending on usage. The first apparent usage of the term \"euthanasia\" belongs to the historian Suetonius, who described how the Emperor Augustus, \"dying quickly and without suffering in the arms of his wife, Livia, experienced the 'euthanasia' he had wished for.\" The word \"euthanasia\" was first used in a medical context by Francis Bacon in the 17th century to refer to an easy, painless, happy death, during which it was a \"physician's responsibility to alleviate the 'physical sufferings' of the body.\" Bacon referred to an \"outward euthanasia\"\u2014the term \"outward\" he used to distinguish from a spiritual concept\u2014the euthanasia \"which regards the preparation of the soul.\"\nClassification.\nEuthanasia may be classified into three types, according to whether a person gives informed consent: voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary.\nThere is a debate within the medical and bioethics literature about whether or not the non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients can be regarded as euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient's circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent on the part of the patient was not considered one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia. However, others see consent as essential.\nVoluntary euthanasia.\nVoluntary euthanasia is conducted with the consent of the patient. Active voluntary euthanasia is legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Passive voluntary euthanasia is legal throughout the US per \"Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health\". When the patient brings about their own death with the assistance of a physician, the term assisted suicide is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.\nNon-voluntary euthanasia.\nNon-voluntary euthanasia is conducted when the consent of the patient is unavailable. Examples include child euthanasia, which is illegal worldwide but decriminalised under certain specific circumstances in the Netherlands under the Groningen Protocol. Passive forms of non-voluntary euthanasia (i.e. withholding treatment) are legal in a number of countries under specified conditions.\nInvoluntary euthanasia.\nInvoluntary euthanasia is done without asking for consent or against the patient's will. It is considered murder and is illegal in all countries.\nPassive and active euthanasia.\nVoluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary types can be further divided into passive or active variants. Passive euthanasia entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces (such as administering a lethal injection), and is more controversial. While some authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of painkillers, there is a debate whether or not to regard the practice as active or passive.\nHistory.\nEuthanasia was practiced in Ancient Greece and Rome: for example, hemlock was employed as a means of hastening death on the island of Kea, a technique also employed in Massalia. Euthanasia, in the sense of the deliberate hastening of a person's death, was supported by Socrates, Plato and Seneca the Elder in the ancient world, although Hippocrates appears to have spoken against the practice, writing \"I will not prescribe a deadly drug to please someone, nor give advice that may cause his death\" (noting there is some debate in the literature about whether or not this was intended to encompass euthanasia).\nEarly modern period.\nThe term \"euthanasia\", in the earlier sense of supporting someone as they died, was used for the first time by Francis Bacon. In his work, \"Euthanasia medica\", he chose this ancient Greek word and, in doing so, distinguished between \"euthanasia interior\", the preparation of the soul for death, and \"euthanasia exterior\", which was intended to make the end of life easier and painless, in exceptional circumstances by shortening life. That the ancient meaning of an easy death came to the fore again in the early modern period can be seen from its definition in the 18th century \"Zedlers Universallexikon\":\nEuthanasia: a very gentle and quiet death, which happens without painful convulsions. The word comes from \u03b5\u03c5, \"bene\", well, and \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \"mors\", death.\nThe concept of euthanasia in the sense of alleviating the process of death goes back to the medical historian Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx, who drew on Bacon's philosophical ideas. According to Marx, a doctor had a moral duty to ease the suffering of death through encouragement, support and mitigation using medication. Such an \"alleviation of death\" reflected the contemporary \"zeitgeist\", but was brought into the medical canon of responsibility for the first time by Marx. Marx also stressed the distinction of the theological care of the soul of sick people from the physical care and medical treatment by doctors.\nEuthanasia in its modern sense has always been strongly opposed in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Thomas Aquinas opposed both and argued that the practice of euthanasia contradicted our natural human instincts of survival, as did Francois Ranchin (1565\u20131641), a French physician and professor of medicine, and Michael Boudewijns (1601\u20131681), a physician and teacher. Other voices argued for euthanasia, such as John Donne in 1624, and euthanasia continued to be practised. In 1678, the publication of Caspar Questel's \"De pulvinari morientibus non-subtrahend\", (\"On the pillow of which the dying should not be deprived\"), initiated debate on the topic. Questel described various customs which were employed at the time to hasten the death of the dying, (including the sudden removal of a pillow, which was believed to accelerate death), and argued against their use, as doing so was \"against the laws of God and Nature\". This view was shared by others who followed, including Philipp Jakob Spener, Veit Riedlin and Johann Georg Kr\u00fcnitz. Despite opposition, euthanasia continued to be practised, involving techniques such as bleeding, suffocation, and removing people from their beds to be placed on the cold ground.\nSuicide and euthanasia became more accepted during the Age of Enlightenment. Thomas More wrote of euthanasia in \"Utopia\", although it is not clear if More was intending to endorse the practice. Other cultures have taken different approaches: for example, in Japan suicide has not traditionally been viewed as a sin, as it is used in cases of honor, and accordingly, the perceptions of euthanasia are different from those in other parts of the world.\nBeginnings of the contemporary euthanasia debate.\nIn the mid-1800s, the use of morphine to treat \"the pains of death\" emerged, with John Warren recommending its use in 1848. A similar use of chloroform was revealed by Joseph Bullar in 1866. However, in neither case was it recommended that the use should be to hasten death. In 1870 Samuel Williams, a schoolteacher, initiated the contemporary euthanasia debate through a speech given at the Birmingham Speculative Club in England, which was subsequently published in a one-off publication entitled \"Essays of the Birmingham Speculative Club\", the collected works of a number of members of an amateur philosophical society. Williams' proposal was to use chloroform to deliberately hasten the death of terminally ill patients:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That in all cases of hopeless and painful illness, it should be the recognized duty of the medical attendant, whenever so desired by the patient, to administer chloroform or such other anaesthetic as may by-and-bye supersede chloroform \u2013 so as to destroy consciousness at once, and put the sufferer to a quick and painless death; all needful precautions being adopted to prevent any possible abuse of such duty; and means being taken to establish, beyond the possibility of doubt or question, that the remedy was applied at the express wish of the patient.\u2014\u200a\nThe essay was favourably reviewed in \"The Saturday Review\", but an editorial against the essay appeared in \"The Spectator\". From there it proved to be influential, and other writers came out in support of such views: Lionel Tollemache wrote in favour of euthanasia, as did Annie Besant, the essayist and reformer who later became involved with the National Secular Society, considering it a duty to society to \"die voluntarily and painlessly\" when one reaches the point of becoming a 'burden'. \"Popular Science\" analyzed the issue in May 1873, assessing both sides of the argument. Kemp notes that at the time, medical doctors did not participate in the discussion; it was \"essentially a philosophical enterprise\u00a0... tied inextricably to a number of objections to the Christian doctrine of the sanctity of human life\".\nEarly euthanasia movement in the United States.\nThe rise of the euthanasia movement in the United States coincided with the so-called Gilded Age, a time of social and technological change that encompassed an \"individualistic conservatism that praised laissez-faire economics, scientific method, and rationalism\", along with major depressions, industrialisation and conflict between corporations and labour unions. It was also the period in which the modern hospital system was developed, which has been seen as a factor in the emergence of the euthanasia debate.\nRobert Ingersoll argued for euthanasia, stating in 1894 that where someone is suffering from a terminal illness, such as terminal cancer, they should have a right to end their pain through suicide. Felix Adler offered a similar approach, although, unlike Ingersoll, Adler did not reject religion. In fact, he argued from an Ethical Culture framework. In 1891, Adler argued that those suffering from overwhelming pain should have the right to commit suicide, and, furthermore, that it should be permissible for a doctor to assist \u2013 thus making Adler the first \"prominent American\" to argue for suicide in cases where people were suffering from chronic illness. Both Ingersoll and Adler argued for voluntary euthanasia of adults suffering from terminal ailments. Dowbiggin argues that by breaking down prior moral objections to euthanasia and suicide, Ingersoll and Adler enabled others to stretch the definition of euthanasia.\nThe first attempt to legalise euthanasia took place in the United States, when Henry Hunt introduced legislation into the General Assembly of Ohio in 1906. Hunt did so at the behest of Anna Sophina Hall, a wealthy heiress who was a major figure in the euthanasia movement during the early 20th century in the United States. Hall had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not have to endure the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited Lurana Sheldon and Maud Ballington Booth, and organised a debate on euthanasia at the annual meeting of the American Humane Association in 1905 \u2013 described by Jacob Appel as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.\nHunt's bill called for the administration of an anesthetic to bring about a patient's death, so long as the person is of lawful age and sound mind, and was suffering from a fatal injury, an irrevocable illness, or great physical pain. It also required that the case be heard by a physician, required informed consent in front of three witnesses, and required the attendance of three physicians who had to agree that the patient's recovery was impossible. A motion to reject the bill outright was voted down, but the bill failed to pass, 79 to 23.\nAlong with the Ohio euthanasia proposal, in 1906 Assemblyman Ross Gregory introduced a proposal to permit euthanasia to the Iowa legislature. However, the Iowa legislation was broader in scope than that offered in Ohio. It allowed for the death of any person of at least ten years of age who suffered from an ailment that would prove fatal and cause extreme pain, should they be of sound mind and express a desire to artificially hasten their death. In addition, it allowed for infants to be euthanised if they were sufficiently deformed, and permitted guardians to request euthanasia on behalf of their wards. The proposed legislation also imposed penalties on physicians who refused to perform euthanasia when requested: a 6\u201312-month prison term and a fine of between $200 and $1,000. The proposal proved to be controversial. It engendered considerable debate and failed to pass, having been withdrawn from consideration after being passed to the Committee on Public Health.\nAfter 1906 the euthanasia debate reduced in intensity, resurfacing periodically, but not returning to the same level of debate until the 1930s in the United Kingdom.\nEuthanasia opponent Ian Dowbiggin argues that the early membership of the Euthanasia Society of America (ESA) reflected how many perceived euthanasia at the time, often seeing it as a eugenics matter rather than an issue concerning individual rights. Dowbiggin argues that not every eugenist joined the ESA \"solely for eugenic reasons\", but he postulates that there were clear ideological connections between the eugenics and euthanasia movements.\n1930s in Britain.\nThe Voluntary Euthanasia Legalisation Society was founded in 1935 by Charles Killick Millard (now called Dignity in Dying). The movement campaigned for the legalisation of euthanasia in Great Britain.\nIn January 1936, King George V was given a fatal dose of morphine and cocaine to hasten his death. At the time he was suffering from cardio-respiratory failure, and the decision to end his life was made by his physician, Lord Dawson. Although this event was kept a secret for over 50 years, the death of George V coincided with proposed legislation in the House of Lords to legalise euthanasia.\nNazi Euthanasia Program.\nA 24 July 1939 killing of a severely disabled infant in Nazi Germany was described in a BBC \"Genocide Under the Nazis Timeline\" as the first \"state-sponsored euthanasia\". Parties that consented to the killing included Hitler's office, the parents, and the Reich Committee for the Scientific Registration of Serious and Congenitally Based Illnesses. \"The Telegraph\" noted that the killing of the disabled infant\u2014whose name was Gerhard Kretschmar, born blind, with missing limbs, subject to convulsions, and reportedly \"an idiot\"\u2014 provided \"the rationale for a secret Nazi decree that led to 'mercy killings' of almost 300,000 mentally and physically handicapped people\". While Kretchmar's killing received parental consent, most of the 5,000 to 8,000 children killed afterwards were forcibly taken from their parents.\nThe \"euthanasia campaign\" of mass murder gathered momentum on 14 January 1940 when the \"handicapped\" were killed with gas vans and at killing centres, eventually leading to the deaths of 70,000 adult Germans. was a campaign of mass murder by involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany. Its code name Aktion T4 is derived from \u00a04, a street address of the Chancellery department which recruited and paid personnel associated with the program. Professor Robert Jay Lifton, author of \"The Nazi Doctors\" and a leading authority on the T4 program, contrasts this program with what he considers to be a genuine euthanasia. He explains that the Nazi version of \"euthanasia\" was based on the work of Adolf Jost, who published \"The Right to Death\" (Das Recht auf den Tod) in 1895. Lifton writes:\nJost argued that control over the death of the individual must ultimately belong to the social organism, the state. This concept is in direct opposition to the Anglo-American concept of euthanasia, which emphasizes the \"individual's\" 'right to die' or 'right to death' or 'right to his or her own death,' as the ultimate human claim. In contrast, Jost was pointing to the state's right to kill.\u00a0... Ultimately the argument was biological: 'The rights to death [are] the key to the fitness of life.' The state must own death\u2014must kill\u2014in order to keep the social organism alive and healthy.\nIn modern terms, the use of \"euthanasia\" in the context of Aktion T4 is seen to be a euphemism to disguise a program of genocide, in which people were killed on the grounds of \"disabilities, religious beliefs, and discordant individual values\". Compared to the discussions of euthanasia that emerged post-war, the Nazi program may have been worded in terms that appear similar to the modern use of \"euthanasia\", but there was no \"mercy\" and the patients were not necessarily terminally ill. Despite these differences, historian and euthanasia opponent Ian Dowbiggin writes that \"the origins of Nazi euthanasia, like those of the American euthanasia movement, predate the Third Reich and were intertwined with the history of eugenics and Social Darwinism, and with efforts to discredit traditional morality and ethics.\"\n1949 New York State Petition for Euthanasia and Catholic opposition.\nOn 6 January 1949, the Euthanasia Society of America presented to the New York State Legislature a petition to legalize euthanasia, signed by 379 leading Protestant and Jewish ministers, the largest group of religious leaders ever to have taken this stance. A similar petition had been sent to the New York Legislature in 1947, signed by approximately 1,000 New York physicians. Roman Catholic religious leaders criticized the petition, saying that such a bill would \"legalize a suicide-murder pact\" and a \"rationalization of the fifth commandment of God, 'Thou Shalt Not Kill.'\" The Right Reverend Robert E. McCormick stated that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The ultimate object of the Euthanasia Society is based on the Totalitarian principle that the state is supreme and that the individual does not have the right to live if his continuance in life is a burden or hindrance to the state. The Nazis followed this principle and compulsory Euthanasia was practiced as a part of their program during the recent war. We American citizens of New York State must ask ourselves this question: \"Are we going to finish Hitler's job?\"\nThe petition brought tensions between the American Euthanasia Society and the Catholic Church to a head that contributed to a climate of anti-Catholic sentiment generally, regarding issues such as birth control, eugenics, and population control. However, the petition did not result in any legal changes.\nDebate.\nHistorically, the euthanasia debate has tended to focus on a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that people have a right to self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle\u2013the doctrine of double effect\u2013is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.\nSimilarly, Emanuel argues that there are four major arguments presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined with the use of effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a slippery slope, which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain was not one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.\nIn the United States in 2013, 47% nationwide supported doctor-assisted suicide. This included 32% of Latinos and 29% of African-Americans. Some US disability rights organizations have also opposed bills legalizing assisted suicide.\nA 2015 Populus poll in the United Kingdom found broad public support for assisted dying; 82% of people supported the introduction of assisted dying laws, including 86% of people with disabilities.\nAn alternative approach to the question is seen in the hospice movement which promotes palliative care for the dying and terminally ill. This has pioneered the use of pain-relieving drugs in a holistic atmosphere in which the patient's spiritual care ranks alongside physical care. It 'intends neither to hasten nor postpone death'.\nLegal status.\nEligibility for euthanasia varies across jurisdictions where it is legal. Some countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands allow euthanasia for mental illness.\nWest's \"Encyclopedia of American Law\" states that \"a 'mercy killing' or euthanasia is generally considered to be a criminal homicide\" and is normally used as a synonym of homicide committed at a request made by the patient.\nThe judicial sense of the term \"homicide\" includes any intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, even to relieve intractable suffering. Not all homicide is unlawful. Two designations of homicide that carry no criminal punishment are justifiable and excusable homicide. In most countries this is not the status of euthanasia. The term \"euthanasia\" is usually confined to the active variety; the University of Washington website states that \"euthanasia generally means that the physician would act directly, for instance by giving a lethal injection, to end the patient's life\". Physician-assisted suicide is thus not classified as euthanasia by the US State of Oregon, where it is legal under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, and despite its name, it is not legally classified as suicide either. Unlike physician-assisted suicide, withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments with patient consent (voluntary) is almost unanimously considered, at least in the United States, to be legal. The use of pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it hastens death, has been held as legal in several court decisions.\nSome governments around the world have legalized voluntary euthanasia but most commonly it is still considered to be criminal homicide. In the Netherlands and Belgium, where euthanasia has been legalized, it still remains homicide although it is not prosecuted and not punishable if the perpetrator (the doctor) meets certain legal conditions.\nIn a historic judgment, the Supreme Court of India legalized passive euthanasia. The apex court remarked in the judgment that the Constitution of India values liberty, dignity, autonomy, and privacy. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra delivered a unanimous judgment. Common Cause (India) was the main petitioner in the case, filed in 2005.\nHealth professionals' sentiment.\nA 2010 survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians found that 16.3% of physicians would consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demanded it, even if they believed that it was premature. Approximately 54.5% would not, and the remaining 29.2% responded \"it depends\". The study also found that 45.8% of physicians agreed that physician-assisted suicide should be allowed in some cases; 40.7% did not, and the remaining 13.5% felt it depended.\nIn the United Kingdom, the assisted dying campaign group Dignity in Dying cites research in which 54% of general practitioners support or are neutral towards a law change on assisted dying. Similarly, a 2017 Doctors.net.uk poll reported in the British Medical Journal stated that 55% of doctors believe assisted dying, in defined circumstances, should be legalised in the UK.\nIn 2019, the World Medical Association issued a statement during its 70th Assembly declaring itself opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide.\nReligious views.\nChristianity.\nBroadly against.\nThe Roman Catholic Church condemns euthanasia and assisted suicide as morally wrong. As paragraph 2324 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, \"Intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator\". Because of this, per the Declaration on Euthanasia, the practice is unacceptable within the Church. The Orthodox Church in America, along with other Eastern Orthodox Churches, also opposes euthanasia stating that \"euthanasia is the deliberate cessation of human life, and, as such, must be condemned as murder.\"\nMany non-Catholic churches in the United States take a stance against euthanasia. Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is \"morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses.\" Protestant and other non-Catholic churches which oppose euthanasia include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPartially in favor of.\nThe Church of England accepts passive euthanasia under some circumstances, but is strongly against active euthanasia, and has led opposition against recent attempts to legalise it. The United Church of Canada accepts passive euthanasia under some circumstances, but is in general against active euthanasia, with growing acceptance now that active euthanasia has been partly legalised in Canada. The Waldensians take a liberal stance on euthanasia and allow the decision to lie with individuals.\nIslam.\nEuthanasia is a complex issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is considered contrary to Islamic law and holy texts. Among interpretations of the Qur'an and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all Muslim majority countries.\nJudaism.\nThere is much debate on the topic of euthanasia in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States). Passive euthanasia was declared legal by Israel's highest court under certain conditions and has reached some level of acceptance. Active euthanasia remains illegal; however, the topic is actively under debate with no clear consensus through legal, ethical, theological and spiritual perspectives.\nHinduism.\nAlthough there is no absolute consensus, Hinduism generally views euthanasia as a serious act that conflicts with core principles such as Dharma (duty), Karma (actions and their consequences), and Ahimsa (non-violence).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
