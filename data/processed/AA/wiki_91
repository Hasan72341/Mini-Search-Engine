The book is a satire on Victorian society.\nThe first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are based on Butler's own experiences in New Zealand, where, as a young man, he worked as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station for four years (1860\u20131864), exploring parts of the interior of the South Island and writing about it in \"A First Year in Canterbury Settlement\" (1863).\nThe novel is one of the first to explore ideas of artificial intelligence, as influenced by Darwin's recently published \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859) and the machines developed out of the Industrial Revolution (late 18th to early 19th centuries). Specifically, it concerns itself, in the three-chapter \"Book of the Machines\", with the potentially dangerous ideas of machine consciousness and self-replicating machines.\nIn Erewhon, illness is crime and crime is illness. As a result, citizens are imprisoned for offenses like physical ailments, misfortune, or ugliness while those who commit conventional crimes like fraud or theft are seen more sympathetically as exhibiting symptoms of moral afflictions and prescribed sessions with a \"straightener\" (essentially a psychologist) for treatment. The lack of compassion for physical sickness is reflected in the role of physicians in Erewhonian society, which is described as something more akin to that of a judge or law enforcement officer than that of a doctor. This system of law and medicine is a satirical inversion of the pattern in western society where crimes are punished and physical illnesses are treated\u2014immorality is a matter of luck beyond one's control while sickness falls into the purview of one's individual autonomy.\nContent.\nThe greater part of the book consists of a description of Erewhon. \nThe Book of the Machines.\nButler developed the three chapters of \"Erewhon\" that make up \"The Book of the Machines\" from a number of articles he had contributed to \"The Press\", which had just begun publication in Christchurch, New Zealand, beginning with \"Darwin among the Machines\" (1863). Butler was the first to write about the possibility that machines might develop consciousness by natural selection.\nIn his preface to the second edition Butler wrote, \"I regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr Darwin's theory to an absurdity. Nothing could be further from my intention, and few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr Darwin.\"\nReception.\nIn 1873, the reviewer in the Dunedin newspaper the \"Otago Witness\" declared that \"Erewhon\" was the best English satirical fiction since \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1726).\nIn a 1945 broadcast, George Orwell praised the book and said that when Butler wrote \"Erewhon\" it needed \"imagination of a very high order to see that machinery could be dangerous as well as useful\". He recommended the novel, though not its sequel, \"Erewhon Revisited\".\nAdaptations.\nIn 2014, New Zealand artist Gavin Hipkins released his first feature film, titled \"Erewhon\" and based on Butler's book. It premiered at the New Zealand International Film Festival and the Edinburgh Art Festival.\nInfluence.\nDeleuze and Guattari.\nThe French philosopher Gilles Deleuze used ideas from Butler's book at various points in the development of his philosophy of difference. In \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968), Deleuze refers to what he calls \"Ideas\" as \"Erewhon\". \"Ideas are not concepts\", he said, they are \"a form of eternally positive differential multiplicity, distinguished from the identity of concepts.\" \"Erewhon\" refers to the \"nomadic distributions\" that pertain to simulacra, which \"are not universals like the categories, nor are they the \"hic et nunc\" or \"nowhere\", the diversity to which categories apply in representation.\" \"Erewhon\", in this reading, is \"not only a disguised \"no-where\" but a rearranged \"now-here\".\"\nIn his collaboration with F\u00e9lix Guattari, \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972), Deleuze draws on Butler's \"The Book of the Machines\" to \"go beyond\" the \"usual polemic between vitalism and mechanism\" as it relates to their concept of \"desiring-machines\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For one thing, Butler is not content to say that machines extend the organism, but asserts that they are really limbs and organs lying on the body without organs of a society, which men will appropriate according to their power and their wealth, and whose poverty deprives them as if they were mutilated organisms. For another, he is not content to say that organisms are machines, but asserts that they contain such an abundance of parts that they must be compared to very different parts of distinct machines, each relating to the others, engendered in combination with the others ... He shatters the vitalist argument by calling in question the specific or personal unity of the organism, and the mechanist argument even more decisively, by calling in question the structural unity of the machine.\nIn popular culture.\nErewhon Station is a high-country station in New Zealand's South Island, neighbouring Mesopotamia Station where Samuel Butler lived for several years. Originally named Stronechrubie Station, it was renamed Erewhon Station in 1915 by the then lease-holder, Sidney Pawson, who was a reader of Samuel Butler's books.\nAgatha Christie references \"Erewhon\" in her novel \"Death on the Nile\" (1937).\nA copy of \"Erewhon\" figures in Elizabeth Bowen's short story \"The Cat Jumps\" (1934).\nKarl Popper's book \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" (1945), includes an epigraph from \"Erewhon\" that reads, \"It will be seen ... that the Erewhonians are a meek and long-suffering people easily led by the nose, and quick to offer up common sense at the shrine of logic, when a philosopher arises among them who carries them away ... by convincing them that their existing institutions are not based on the strictest principles of morality.\"\nAlan M. Turing references \"Erewhon\" in his posthumously published paper, \"Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\" (c. 1951). He writes, \"At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler's Erewhon.\"\nAldous Huxley alludes to \"Erewhon\" in his novels \"The Doors of Perception\" (1954) and \"Island\" (1962).\nIn his book \"A Testament\" (1957), Frank Lloyd Wright mistakenly attributes the origin of the term Usonia as an alternate name for the United States of America to Samuel Butler in \"Erewhon\".\nThe \"Butlerian Jihad\" is the name of the crusade to wipe out \"thinking machines\" in Frank Herbert's novel, \"Dune\" (1965).\nC. S. Lewis alludes to \"Erewhon\" in his essay, \"The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment.\"\nThe movie \"The Day of the Dolphin\" (1973) features a boat named the Erewhon.\n\"Erewhon\" is the unofficial name US astronauts give Regan Station, a military space station in David Brin's novel \"Earth\" (1990).\nIn 1994, a group of ex-Yugoslavian writers in Amsterdam, who had established the PEN centre of Yugoslav Writers in Exile, published a single issue of the literary journal \"Erewhon\".\nIn the 1997 film \"Face/Off\", FBI Agent Sean Archer, enters Erehwon Prison, a high-tech prison with severe punishment for any transgressions.\nIn the graphic novel \"Bye Bye, Earth\" (2000), Belle's sword is called \"Erehwon\", and the story makes reference to the novel \"Erewhon\".\nNew Zealand sound art organization, the Audio Foundation, published in 2012 an anthology edited by Bruce Russell named \"Erewhon Calling\" after Butler's novel.\nIn \"Smile\", the second episode of the 2017 season of \"Doctor Who\", the Doctor and Bill explore a spaceship named \"Erehwon\". Despite the slightly different spelling, the episode writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce confirmed that this was a reference to Butler's novel.\nIn the 2019 Ubisoft video game \"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint\", \"Erewhon\" is the name for the world's settler hideout and players' online hub.\nA copy of Erewhon figures prominently in the video for \"A Barely Lit Path,\" the lead single from Oneohtrix Point Never's 2023 album \"Again.\"\nCompanies\nErewhon Market is the name of an upscale Los Angeles-based natural foods grocery chain originally founded in Boston in 1966. The store\u2019s co-founder Aveline Kushi named it after Erewhon because it was the favorite book of her mentor, George Ohsawa.\nErewhon is also the name of an independent speculative fiction publishing company founded in 2018 by Liz Gorinsky.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The EC is the main interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. The EC-hippocampus system plays an important role in declarative (autobiographical/episodic/semantic) memories and in particular spatial memories including memory formation, memory consolidation, and memory optimization in sleep. The EC is also responsible for the pre-processing (familiarity) of the input signals in the reflex nictitating membrane response of classical trace conditioning; the association of impulses from the eye and the ear occurs in the entorhinal cortex.\nAnatomy.\nThe entorhinal cortex is a portion of the rostral parahippocampal gyrus.\nStructure.\nIt is usually divided into medial and lateral regions with three bands with distinct properties and connectivity running perpendicular across the whole area. A distinguishing characteristic of the EC is the lack of cell bodies where layer IV should be; this layer is called the \"Lamina dissecans\".\nConnections.\nThe superficial layers \u2013 layers II and III \u2013 of EC project to the dentate gyrus and hippocampus: Layer II projects primarily to dentate gyrus and hippocampal region CA3; layer III projects primarily to hippocampal region CA1 and the subiculum. These layers receive input from other cortical areas, especially associational, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, as well as prefrontal cortex. EC as a whole, therefore, receives highly processed input from every sensory modality, as well as input relating to ongoing cognitive processes, though it should be stressed that, within EC, this information remains at least partially segregated.\nThe deep layers, especially layer V, receive one of the three main outputs of the hippocampus and, in turn, reciprocate connections from other cortical areas that project to superficial EC.\nFunction.\nNeuron information processing.\nIn 2005, it was discovered that entorhinal cortex contains a neural map of the spatial environment in rats. In 2014, John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, partly because of this discovery.\nIn rodents, neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex exhibit little spatial selectivity, whereas neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), exhibit multiple \"place fields\" that are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, and are, therefore, called \"grid cells\". These fields and spacing between fields increase from the dorso-lateral MEA to the ventro-medial MEA.\nThe same group of researchers has found speed cells in the medial entorhinal cortex of rats. The speed of movement is translated from proprioceptive information and is represented as firing rates in these cells. The cells are known to fire in correlation to future speed of the rodent.\nRecently, a general theory has been proposed to elucidate the function of the reelin positive cells in the layer II of the entorhinal cortex. According to this concept, these cells would be generally organized into 1-dimensional ring attractors, and in the \"medial\" (in humans: \"posteromedial\") portion, would function as grid cells (anatomically: stellate cells) while in \"lateral\" (in humans: \"anterolateral\") portion, where they appear as fan cells, would enable the encoding of new episodic memories. This concept is underscored by the fact that fan cells of the entorhinal cortex are indispensable for the formation of episodic-like memories in rodents.\nSingle-unit recording of neurons in humans playing video games find path cells in the EC, the activity of which indicates whether a person is taking a clockwise or counterclockwise path. Such EC \"direction\" path cells show this directional activity irrespective of the location of where a person experiences themselves, which contrasts them to place cells in the hippocampus, which are activated by specific locations.\nEC neurons process general information such as directional activity in the environment, which contrasts to that of the hippocampal neurons, which usually encode information about specific places. This suggests that EC encodes general properties about current contexts that are then used by hippocampus to create unique representations from combinations of these properties.\nResearch generally highlights a useful distinction in which the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) mainly supports processing of space, whereas the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) mainly supports the processing of time. \nThe MEC exhibits a strong ~8 Hz rhythmic neural activity known as theta. Alterations in the neural activity across the brain region results in an observed \"traveling wave\" phenomena across the MEC long-axis, similar to that of the hippocampus, due to asymmetric theta oscillations. The underlying cause of these phase shifts and their waveform changes is unknown. \nIndividual variation in the volume of EC is linked to taste perception. People with a larger EC in the left hemisphere found quinine, the source of bitterness in tonic water, less bitter.\nClinical significance.\nAlzheimer's disease.\nThe entorhinal cortex is the first area of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease; in year 2013, a functional magnetic resonance imaging study has localised the area to the lateral entorhinal cortex. More recently, a particular group of neurons called fan cells have been proposed to be first neurons suffering Alzheimer's-related damage in the lateral entorhinal cortex.\nLopez \"et al.\" have shown, in a multimodal study, that there are differences in the volume of the left entorhinal cortex between progressing (to Alzheimer's disease) and stable mild cognitive impairment patients. These authors also found that the volume of the left entorhinal cortex inversely correlates with the level of alpha band phase synchronization between the right anterior cingulate and temporo-occipital regions.\nIn 2012, neuroscientists at UCLA conducted an experiment using a virtual taxi video game connected to seven epilepsy patients with electrodes already implanted in their brains, allowing the researchers to monitor neuronal activity whenever memories were being formed. As the researchers stimulated the nerve fibers of each of the patients' entorhinal cortex as they were learning, they were then able to better navigate themselves through various routes and recognize landmarks more quickly. This signified an improvement in the patients' spatial memory.\nResearch.\nEffect of aerobic exercise\nA study on young subjects found aerobic fitness to be positively correlated with entorhinal cortex volume, indicating that aerobic exercise may have a positive effect on the medial temporal lobe memory system (which includes the entorhinal cortex).\nIn other animals.\nIn rodents, the EC is located at the caudal end of the temporal lobe. The rodent entorhinal cortex shows a modular organization, with different properties and connections in different areas.\nIn primates it is located at the rostral end of the temporal lobe and stretches dorsolaterally.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9668", "revid": "50841505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9668", "title": "Ernst Haeckel", "text": "German biologist, philosopher, physician, and artist (1834\u20131919)\nErnst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (; ; 16 February 1834 \u2013 9 August 1919) was a German zoologist, naturalist, eugenicist, philosopher, physician, professor, marine biologist and artist. He discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms and coined many terms in biology, including \"ecology\", \"phylum\", \"phylogeny\", ontogeny, and \"Protista.\" Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the disproven but influential recapitulation theory (\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"), wrongly claiming that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarizes its species' evolutionary development, or phylogeny, using incorrectly drawn images of human embryonic development. Whether they were intentionally falsified, or drawn poorly by accident is a matter of debate.\nThe published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures, collected in his \"Kunstformen der Natur\" (\"Art Forms of Nature\"), a book which would go on to influence the Art Nouveau artistic movement. As a philosopher, Ernst Haeckel wrote \"Die Weltr\u00e4thsel\" (1895\u20131899; in English: \"The Riddles of the Universe\", 1900), the genesis for the term \"world riddle\" (\"Weltr\u00e4tsel\"); and \"Freedom in Science and Teaching\" to support teaching evolution.\nHaeckel promoted scientific racism and embraced the idea of Social Darwinism. He was the first person to characterize the Great War as the \"first\" World War, which he did as early as 1914.\nEarly life and education.\nErnst Haeckel was born on 16 February 1834, in Potsdam (then part of the Kingdom of Prussia).\nIn 1852, Haeckel completed studies at the \"Domgymnasium\", the cathedral high-school of Merseburg. He then studied medicine in Berlin and W\u00fcrzburg, particularly with Albert von K\u00f6lliker, Franz Leydig, Rudolf Virchow (with whom he later worked briefly as assistant), and with the anatomist-physiologist Johannes Peter M\u00fcller (1801\u20131858). Together with Hermann Steudner he attended botany lectures in W\u00fcrzburg. In 1857 Haeckel attained a doctorate in medicine, and afterwards he received the license to practice medicine. The occupation of physician appeared less worthwhile to Haeckel after contact with suffering patients.\nCareer.\nHaeckel studied under Carl Gegenbaur at the University of Jena for three years. In 1861 he earned a habilitation in comparative anatomy and became a professor of zoology at the University at Jena, where he remained for 47 years, from 1862 to 1909. Between 1859 and 1866, Haeckel worked on many phyla, such as radiolarians, poriferans (sponges) and annelids (segmented worms). During a trip to the Mediterranean, Haeckel named nearly 700 new species of radiolarians.\nFrom 1866 to 1867 Haeckel made an extended journey to the Canary Islands with Hermann Fol. On 17 October 1866 he arrived in London. Over the next few days he met Charles Lyell, and visited Thomas Huxley and family at their home. On 21 October he visited Charles Darwin at Down House in Kent. In 1867 he married Agnes Huschke. Their son Walter was born in 1868, their daughters Elizabeth in 1871 and Emma in 1873. In 1869 he traveled as a researcher to Norway, in 1871 to Croatia (where he lived on the island of Hvar in a monastery), and in 1873 to Egypt, Turkey, and Greece. In 1907 he had a museum built in Jena to teach the public about evolution. Haeckel retired from teaching in 1909, and in 1910 he withdrew from the Evangelical Church of Prussia.\nOn the occasion of his 80th birthday celebration he was presented with a two-volume work entitled \"Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken (What We Owe to Ernst Haeckel)\", edited at the request of the German Monistenbund by Heinrich Schmidt of Jena.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1864, his first wife, Anna Sethe, died. Haeckel dedicated some species of jellyfish that he found beautiful (such as \"Desmonema annasethe\") to her.\nHaeckel's second wife, Agnes, died in 1915, and he became substantially frailer, breaking his leg and arm. He sold his \"Villa Medusa\" in Jena in 1918 to the Carl Zeiss foundation, which preserved his library. \nHaeckel died on 9 August 1919.\nReligious views.\nIn \"Monism as Connecting Religion and Science\" (1892), he argued in favor of monism as the view most compatible with the current scientific understanding of the natural world. His perspective of monism was pantheistic and impersonal. The monistic idea of God, which alone is compatible with our present knowledge of nature, recognizes the divine spirit in all things. It can never recognise in God a \"personal being,\" or, in other words, an individual of limited extension in space, or even of human form. God is everywhere.\nHaeckel became the most famous proponent of Monism in Germany.\nIn 1906 Haeckel belonged to the founders of the Monist League (), which took a stance against philosophical materialism and promote a \"natural Weltanschauung\". This organization lasted until 1933 and included such notable members as Wilhelm Ostwald, Georg von Arco (1869\u20131940), Helene St\u00f6cker and Walter Arthur Berendsohn.\nPolitics.\nHaeckel's affinity for the German Romantic movement, coupled with his acceptance of a form of Lamarckism, influenced his political beliefs. Rather than being a strict Darwinian, Haeckel believed that the characteristics of an organism were acquired through interactions with the environment and that ontogeny reflected phylogeny. He saw the social sciences as instances of \"applied biology\", and that phrase was picked up and used for Nazi propaganda.\nHe was the first person to use the term \"first world war\" about World War I.\nHowever, Haeckel's books were banned by the Nazi Party, which refused Monism and Haeckel's freedom of thought. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Haeckel had often overtly recognized the great contribution of educated Jews to the German culture.\nResearch.\nHaeckel was a zoologist, an accomplished artist and illustrator, and later a professor of comparative anatomy. Although Haeckel's ideas are important to the history of evolutionary theory, and although he was a competent invertebrate anatomist most famous for his work on radiolaria, many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect. For example, Haeckel described and named hypothetical ancestral microorganisms that have never been found.\nHe was one of the first to consider psychology as a branch of physiology. He also proposed the kingdom \"Protista\" in 1866. His chief interests lay in evolution and life development processes in general, including development of nonrandom form, which culminated in the beautifully illustrated \"Kunstformen der Natur\" (\"Art forms of nature\"). Haeckel did not support natural selection, rather believing in Lamarckism.\nHaeckel advanced a version of the earlier recapitulation theory previously set out by \u00c9tienne Serres in the 1820s and supported by followers of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire including Robert Edmond Grant. It proposed a link between ontogeny (development of form) and phylogeny (evolutionary descent), summed up by Haeckel in the phrase \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". His concept of recapitulation has been refuted in the form he gave it (now called \"strong recapitulation\"), in favour of the ideas first advanced by Karl Ernst von Baer. The strong recapitulation hypothesis views ontogeny as repeating forms of adult ancestors, while weak recapitulation means that what is repeated (and built upon) is the ancestral embryonic development process. Haeckel supported the theory with embryo drawings that have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate, and the theory is now considered an oversimplification of quite complicated relationships, however comparison of embryos remains a powerful way to demonstrate that all animals are related. Haeckel introduced the concept of heterochrony, the change in timing of embryonic development over the course of evolution.\nHaeckel was a flamboyant figure, who sometimes took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence. For example, at the time when Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection\" (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified. He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, \"Pithecanthropus alalus\", and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to go and find it.\nOne student did find some remains: a Dutchman named Eug\u00e8ne Dubois searched the East Indies from 1887 to 1895, discovering the remains of Java Man in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's \"Pithecanthropus\" label, though they were later reclassified as \"Homo erectus\". Some scientists of the day suggested Dubois' Java Man as a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of \"Homo erectus\" (possibly \"Homo ergaster\"), rather than the Asian populations exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man. (Ironically, a new human species, \"Homo floresiensis\", a dwarf human type, has recently been discovered in the island of Flores).\nPolygenism and racial theory.\nThe creationist polygenism of Samuel George Morton and Louis Agassiz, which presented human races as separately created species, was rejected by Charles Darwin, who argued for the monogenesis of the human species and the African origin of modern humans. Haeckel put forward a racist doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist August Schleicher, in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman \"Urmenschen\" (), which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved \u2013 in a kind of Lamarckian use-inheritance \u2013 as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. From this, Haeckel drew the implication that languages with the most potential yield the human races with the most potential, led by the Semitic and Indo-Germanic groups, with Berber, Jewish, Greco-Roman and Germanic varieties to the fore. As Haeckel stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We must mention here one of the most important results of the comparative study of languages, which for the Stammbaum of the species of men is of the highest significance, namely that human languages probably had a multiple or polyphyletic origin. Human language as such probably developed only after the species of speechless \"Urmenschen\" or \"Affenmenschen\" () had split into several species or kinds. With each of these human species, language developed on its own and independently of the others. At least this is the view of Schleicher, one of the foremost authorities on this subject.\u00a0... If one views the origin of the branches of language as the special and principal act of becoming human, and the species of humankind as distinguished according to their language stem, then one can say that the different species of men arose independently of one another.\nHaeckel's view can be seen as a forerunner of the views of Carleton Coon, who also believed that human races evolved independently and in parallel with each other. These ideas eventually fell from favour.\nHaeckel also applied the hypothesis of polygenism to the modern diversity of human groups. He became a key figure in social darwinism and leading proponent of scientific racism, stating for instance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Caucasian, or Mediterranean man (\"Homo Mediterraneus\"), has from time immemorial been placed at the head of all the races of men, as the most highly developed and perfect. It is generally called the Caucasian race, but as, among all the varieties of the species, the Caucasian branch is the least important, we prefer the much more suitable appellation proposed by Friedrich M\u00fcller, namely, that of \"Mediterranese\". For the most important varieties of this species, which are moreover the most eminent actors in what is called \"Universal History\", first rose to a flourishing condition on the shores of the Mediterranean.\u00a0... This species alone (with the exception of the Mongolian) has had an actual history; it alone has attained to that degree of civilisation which seems to raise men above the rest of nature.\nHaeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction. In his view, 'Negroes' were savages and Whites were the most civilised: for instance, he claimed that '[t]he Negro' had stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which, he argued, was evidence of their being less evolved, and which led him to compare them to '\"four-handed\" Apes'.\nIn his \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\" Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote: \"[Haeckel's] evolutionary racism; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a 'just' state; his belief that harsh, inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike, conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others\u00a0... all contributed to the rise of Nazism.\"\nIn his introduction to the Nazi Party ideologue Alfred Rosenberg's 1930 book \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\" Peter Peel affirms that Rosenberg had indeed read Haeckel.\nIn the same line of thought, historian Daniel Gasman states that Haeckel's ideology stimulated the birth of Fascist ideology in Italy and France.\nHowever, in 2009 Robert J. Richards noted: \"Haeckel, on his travels to Ceylon and Indonesia, often formed closer and more intimate relations with natives, even members of the untouchable classes, than with the European colonials.\" and says the Nazis rejected Haeckel, since he opposed antisemitism, while supporting ideas they disliked (for instance atheism, feminism, internationalism, pacifism etc.).\nThe Jena Declaration, published by the German Zoological Society, rejects the idea of human \"races\" and distances itself from the racial theories of Ernst Haeckel and other 20th century scientists. It claims that genetic variation between human populations is smaller than within them, demonstrating that the biological concept of \"races\" is invalid. The statement highlights that there are no specific genes or genetic markers that match with conventional racial categorizations. It also indicates that the idea of \"races\" is based on racism rather than any scientific factuality.\nAsia hypothesis.\nHaeckel claimed the origin of humanity was to be found in Asia: he believed that Hindustan (Indian subcontinent) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of Africa.\nHaeckel later claimed that the missing link was to be found on the lost continent of Lemuria located in the Indian Ocean. He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans and that Asia was the home of many of the earliest primates; he thus supported that Asia was the cradle of hominid evolution. Haeckel also claimed that Lemuria connected Asia and Africa, which allowed the migration of humans to the rest of the world.\nIn Haeckel's book \"The History of Creation\" (1884) he included migration routes which he thought the first humans had used outside of Lemuria.\nEmbryology and recapitulation theory.\nWhen Haeckel was a student in the 1850s he showed great interest in embryology, attending the rather unpopular lectures twice and in his notes sketched the visual aids: textbooks had few illustrations, and large format plates were used to show students how to see the tiny forms under a reflecting microscope, with the translucent tissues seen against a black background. Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages made it even more difficult to compare different species. It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all vertebrates looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic recapitulation theory that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a linear chain of being, and Karl Ernst von Baer's opposing view, stated in von Baer's laws of embryology, that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an archetype but no relation to other types or any transmutation of species. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher Albert von K\u00f6lliker, which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence. Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons.\nDarwin, Naturphilosophie and Lamarck.\nDarwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", which made a powerful impression on Haeckel when he read it in 1864, was very cautious about the possibility of ever reconstructing the history of life, but did include a section reinterpreting von Baer's embryology and revolutionising the field of study, concluding that \"Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals.\" It mentioned von Baer's 1828 anecdote (misattributing it to Louis Agassiz) that at an early stage embryos were so similar that it could be impossible to tell whether an unlabelled specimen was of a mammal, a bird, or of a reptile, and Darwin's own research using embryonic stages of barnacles to show that they are crustaceans, while cautioning against the idea that one organism or embryonic stage is \"higher\" or \"lower\", or more or less evolved. Haeckel disregarded such caution, and in a year wrote his massive and ambitious \"Generelle Morphologie\", published in 1866, presenting a revolutionary new synthesis of Darwin's ideas with the German tradition of \"Naturphilosophie\" going back to Goethe and with the progressive evolutionism of Lamarck in what he called \"Darwinismus\". He used morphology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life, in the absence of fossil evidence using embryology as evidence of ancestral relationships. He invented new terms, including ontogeny and phylogeny, to present his evolutionised recapitulation theory that \"ontogeny recapitulated phylogeny\". The two massive volumes sold poorly, and were heavy going: with his limited understanding of German, Darwin found them impossible to read. Haeckel's publisher turned down a proposal for a \"strictly scholarly and objective\" second edition.\nEmbryological drawings.\nHaeckel's aim was a reformed morphology with evolution as the organising principle of a cosmic synthesis unifying science, religion, and art. He was giving successful \"popular lectures\" on his ideas to students and townspeople in Jena, in an approach pioneered by his teacher Rudolf Virchow. To meet his publisher's need for a popular work he used a student's transcript of his lectures as the basis of his \"Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte\" of 1868, presenting a comprehensive presentation of evolution. In the Spring of that year he drew figures for the book, synthesising his views of specimens in Jena and published pictures to represent types. After publication he told a colleague that the images \"are completely exact, partly copied from nature, partly assembled from all illustrations of these early stages that have hitherto become known\". There were various styles of embryological drawings at that time, ranging from more schematic representations to \"naturalistic\" illustrations of specific specimens. Haeckel believed privately that his figures were both exact and synthetic, and in public asserted that they were schematic like most figures used in teaching. The images were reworked to match in size and orientation, and though displaying Haeckel's own views of essential features, they support von Baer's concept that vertebrate embryos begin similarly and then diverge. Relating different images on a grid conveyed a powerful evolutionary message. As a book for the general public, it followed the common practice of not citing sources.\nThe book sold very well, and while some anatomical experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig R\u00fctimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the \"Archiv f\u00fcr Anthropologie\" wondered about the claim that the work was \"popular and scholarly\", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost \"scrupulosity and conscientiousness\" and an artist must \"not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes\" which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, \"one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [the] embryo of the dog, the chick, [and] the turtle\". He accused Haeckel of \"playing fast and loose with the public and with science\", and failing to live up to the obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned \"embryo of a mammal or bird\". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clich\u00e9s) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this \"extremely rash foolishness\" had occurred in undue haste but was \"bona fide\", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.\nThe revised 1870 second edition of 1,500 copies attracted more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs as the book became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical \"culture of progress\" in Otto von Bismarck's new German Empire. The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as Michael Foster of the University of Cambridge. In the introduction to his 1871 \"The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex\", Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if \"Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte\" \"had appeared before my essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it\". The first chapter included an illustration: \"As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy\" with a footnote citing the sources and noting that \"H\u00e4ckel has also given analogous drawings in his \"Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte.\"\" The fifth edition of Haeckel's book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans.\nControversy.\nLater in 1874, Haeckel's simplified embryology textbook \"Anthropogenie\" made the subject into a battleground over Darwinism aligned with Bismarck's \"Kulturkampf\" (\"culture struggle\") against the Catholic Church. Haeckel took particular care over the illustrations, changing to the leading zoological publisher Wilhelm Engelmann of Leipzig and obtaining from them use of illustrations from their other textbooks as well as preparing his own drawings including a dramatic double page illustration showing \"early\", \"somewhat later\" and \"still later\" stages of 8 different vertebrates. Though Haeckel's views had attracted continuing controversy, there had been little dispute about the embryos and he had many expert supporters, but Wilhelm His revived the earlier criticisms and introduced new attacks on the 1874 illustrations. \nExpert anatomists were critical of Haeckel's work. Catholic priests also opposed Haeckel's views. Specifically, Haeckel's critics accused him of manipulating the embryo drawings to make the early stages of different species look more similar. They claimed that the drawings of four-week dog and human embryos had been copied without attribution from other sources, and changed by expanding dog's head and reducing the human head, moving the eye, and exaggerating the size of the human tail. Haeckel himself considered the drawings stylized and illustrative, but his detractors considered them forgery and fraud.\nWhile it has been widely claimed that Haeckel was charged with fraud by five professors and convicted by a university court at Jena, there does not appear to be an independently verifiable source for this claim. Recent analyses (Richardson 1998, Richardson and Keuck 2002) have found that some of the criticisms of Haeckel's embryo drawings were legitimate, but others were unfounded. There were multiple versions of the embryo drawings, and Haeckel rejected the claims of fraud. It was later said that \"there is evidence of sleight of hand\" on both sides of the feud between Haeckel and Wilhelm His. Robert J. Richards, in a paper published in 2008, defends the case for Haeckel, shedding doubt against the fraud accusations based on the material used for comparison with what Haeckel could access at the time.\nAssessments of potential influence on Nazism.\nSome historians have seen Haeckel's social Darwinism as a forerunner to Nazi ideology. Others have denied the relationship altogether.\nThe evidence is in some respects ambiguous. On one hand, Haeckel was an advocate of scientific racism. He held that evolutionary biology had definitively proven that races were unequal in intelligence and ability, and that their lives were also of unequal value, e.g., \"These lower races (such as the Veddahs or Australian negroes) are psychologically nearer to the mammals (apes or dogs) than to civilised Europeans; we must therefore, assign a totally different value to their lives.\" As a result of the \"struggle for existence\", it followed that the \"lower\" races would eventually be exterminated. He was also a social Darwinist who believed that \"survival of the fittest\" was a natural law, and that struggle led to improvement of the race. As an advocate of eugenics, he also believed that about 200,000 mentally and congenitally ill should be killed by a medical control board. This idea was later put into practice by Nazi Germany, as part of the Aktion T4 program. \nAlfred Ploetz, founder of the German Society for Racial Hygiene, praised Haeckel repeatedly, and invited him to become an honorary member. Haeckel accepted the invitation. Haeckel also believed that Germany should be governed by an authoritarian political system, and that inequalities both within and between societies were an inevitable product of evolutionary law. Haeckel was also an extreme German nationalist who believed strongly in the superiority of German culture.\nOn the other hand, Haeckel was not an anti-Semite. In the racial hierarchies he constructed Jews tended to appear closer to the top, rather than closer to the bottom as in Nazi racial thought. He was also a pacifist until the First World War, when he wrote propaganda in favor of the war. The principal arguments of historians who deny a meaningful connection between Haeckel and Nazism are that Haeckel's ideas were very common at the time, that Nazis were much more strongly influenced by other thinkers, and that Haeckel is properly classified as a 19th-century German liberal, rather than a forerunner to Nazism. They also point to incompatibilities between evolutionary biology and Nazi ideology.\nNazis themselves divided on the question of whether Haeckel should be counted as a pioneer of their ideology. SS captain and biologist Heinz Br\u00fccher wrote a biography of Haeckel in 1936, in which he praised Haeckel as a \"pioneer in biological state thinking\". This opinion was also shared by the scholarly journal, \"Der Biologe\", which celebrated Haeckel's 100th birthday, in 1934, with several essays acclaiming him as a pioneering thinker of Nazism. Other Nazis kept their distance from Haeckel. Nazi propaganda guidelines issued in 1935 listed books which popularized Darwin and evolution on an \"expunged list\". Haeckel was included by name as a forbidden author. Gunther Hecht, a member of the Nazi Department of Race Politics, also issued a memorandum rejecting Haeckel as a forerunner of Nazism. Kurt Hildebrandt, a Nazi political philosopher, also rejected Haeckel. Eventually Haeckel was rejected by Nazi bureaucrats.\nAwards and honors.\nHaeckel was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1885. He was awarded the title of Excellency by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1907 and the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908. In the United States, \"Mount Haeckel\", a summit in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, overlooking the Evolution Basin, is named in his honour, as is another \"Mount Haeckel\", a summit in New Zealand; and the asteroid 12323 Haeckel.\nIn Jena he is remembered with a monument at Herrenberg (erected in 1969), an exhibition at Ernst-Haeckel-Haus, and at the Jena Phyletic Museum, which continues to teach about evolution and share his work to this day.\nThe ratfish, \"Harriotta haeckeli\" is named in his honor.\nThe research vessel \"Ernst Haeckel\" is named in his honor.\nIn 1981, a botanical journal called \"Ernstia\" was started being published in the city of Maracay, Venezuela.\nIn 2013, \"Ernstia\", a genus of calcareous sponges in the family Clathrinidae. The genus was erected to contain five species previously assigned to \"Clathrina\". The genus name honors Ernst Haeckel for his contributions towards sponge taxonomy and phylogeny.\nPublications.\nDarwin's 1859 book \"On the Origin of Species\" had immense popular influence, but although its sales exceeded its publisher's hopes it was a technical book rather than a work of popular science: long, difficult and with few illustrations. One of Haeckel's books did a great deal to explain his version of \"Darwinism\" to the world. It was a bestselling, provocatively illustrated book in German, titled \"Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte\", published in Berlin in 1868, and translated into English as \"The History of Creation\" in 1876. Until 1909, eleven editions had appeared, as well as 25 translations into other languages. The \"Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte\" cemented Haeckel's reputation as one of Germany's most forceful popularizers of science. His \"Weltr\u00e4thsel\" were reprinted ten times after the book's first publication in 1899; ultimately, over 400,000 copies were sold.\nHaeckel argued that human evolution consisted of precisely 22 phases, the 21st \u2013 the \"missing link\" \u2013 being a halfway step between apes and humans. He even formally named this missing link \"Pithecanthropus alalus\", translated as \"ape man without speech\".\nHaeckel's literary output was extensive, including many books, scientific papers, and illustrations.\nTravel books.\nFor a fuller list of works of and about Haeckel, see his entry in the .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Botanist/styles.css\"/&gt;The standard author abbreviation Haeckel is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its exact meaning has changed over time as the study of evolution has progressed. In the 19th century, it was used to describe the belief that organisms deliberately improved themselves through progressive inherited change (orthogenesis). The teleological belief went on to include cultural evolution and social evolution. In the 1970s, the term \"Neo-Evolutionism\" was used to describe the idea that \"human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control.\"\nThe term is most often used by creationists to describe adherence to the scientific consensus on evolution as equivalent to a secular religion. The term is very seldom used within the scientific community, since the scientific position on evolution is accepted by the overwhelming majority of scientists. Because evolutionary biology is the default scientific position, it is assumed that \"scientists\" or \"biologists\" are \"evolutionists\" unless specifically noted otherwise. In the creation\u2013evolution controversy, creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis \"evolutionists\" and the theory itself \"evolutionism\".\n19th-century teleological use.\nBefore its use to describe biological evolution, the term \"evolution\" was originally used to refer to any orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start. The first five editions of Darwin's in \"Origin of Species\" used the word \"evolved\", but the word \"evolution\" was only used in its sixth edition in 1872. By then, Herbert Spencer had developed the concept theory that organisms strive to evolve due to an internal \"driving force\" (orthogenesis) in 1862. Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term \"evolution\" to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of unilineal (social) evolution used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900). The term evolutionism subsequently came to be used for the now discredited theory that evolution contained a deliberate component, rather than the selection of beneficial traits from random variation by differential survival.\nModern use by creationists.\nThe term \"evolution\" is widely used, but the term \"evolutionism\" is not used in the scientific community to refer to evolutionary biology as it is redundant and anachronistic.\nHowever, the term has been used by creationists in discussing the creation\u2013evolution controversy. For example, the Institute for Creation Research, in order to imply placement of evolution in the category of 'religions', including atheism, fascism, humanism and occultism, commonly uses the words \"evolutionism\" and \"evolutionist\" to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief. The BioLogos Foundation, an organization that promotes the idea of theistic evolution, uses the term \"evolutionism\" to describe \"the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse.\" It views this as a subset of scientism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It asks for an algorithm that considers an inputted statement and answers \"yes\" or \"no\" according to whether it is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure. Such an algorithm was proven to be impossible by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936.\nCompleteness theorem.\nBy the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced using logical rules and axioms, so the \"\" can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable using the rules of logic.\nIn 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers showing that a general solution to the \"\" is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of \"effectively calculable\" is captured by the functions computable by a Turing machine (or equivalently, by those expressible in the lambda calculus). This assumption is now known as the Church\u2013Turing thesis.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the goes back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the seventeenth century, after having constructed a successful mechanical calculating machine, dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements. He realized that the first step would have to be a clean formal language, and much of his subsequent work was directed toward that goal. In 1928, David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann posed the question in the form outlined above.\nIn continuation of his \"program\", Hilbert posed three questions at an international conference in 1928, the third of which became known as \"Hilbert's \". In 1929, Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel published one paper on special cases of the decision problem, that was prepared by Paul Bernays.\nAs late as 1930, Hilbert believed that there would be no such thing as an unsolvable problem.\nNegative answer.\nBefore the question could be answered, the notion of \"algorithm\" had to be formally defined. This was done by Alonzo Church in 1935 with the concept of \"effective calculability\" based on his \u03bb-calculus, and by Alan Turing the next year with his concept of Turing machines. Turing immediately recognized that these are equivalent models of computation.\nA negative answer to the was then given by Alonzo Church in 1935\u201336 (Church's theorem) and independently shortly thereafter by Alan Turing in 1936 (Turing's proof). Church proved that there is no computable function that decides, for two given \u03bb-calculus expressions, whether they are equivalent or not. He relied heavily on earlier work by Stephen Kleene. Turing reduced the question of the existence of an 'algorithm' or 'general method' able to solve the to the question of the existence of a 'general method' that decides whether any given Turing machine halts or not (the halting problem). If 'algorithm' is understood as meaning a method that can be represented as a Turing machine, and with the answer to the latter question negative (in general), the question about the existence of an algorithm for the also must be negative (in general). In his 1936 paper, Turing says: \"Corresponding to each computing machine 'it' we construct a formula 'Un(it)' and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether 'Un(it)' is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether 'it' ever prints 0\".\nThe work of both Church and Turing was heavily influenced by Kurt G\u00f6del's earlier work on his incompleteness theorem, especially by the method of assigning numbers (a G\u00f6del numbering) to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.\nThe \"\" is related to Hilbert's tenth problem, which asks for an algorithm to decide whether Diophantine equations have a solution. The non-existence of such an algorithm, established by the work of Yuri Matiyasevich, Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and Hilary Putnam, with the final piece of the proof in 1970, also implies a negative answer to the \"Entscheidungsproblem\".\nGeneralizations.\nUsing the deduction theorem, the encompasses the more general problem of deciding whether a given first-order sentence is a logical consequence of a given finite set of sentences, but validity in first-order theories with infinitely many axioms cannot be directly reduced to the . Such more general decision problems are of practical interest. Some first-order theories are algorithmically decidable; examples of this include Presburger arithmetic, real closed fields, and static type systems of many programming languages. On the other hand, the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition and multiplication expressed by Peano's axioms cannot be decided with an algorithm.\nFragments.\nBy default, the citations in the section are from Pratt-Hartmann (2023).\nThe classical \"Entscheidungsproblem\" asks, given a first-order formula, whether it is true in all models. The finitary problem asks whether it is true in all finite models. Trakhtenbrot's theorem shows that this is also undecidable.\nSome notations: formula_1 means the problem of deciding whether there exists a model for a set of logical formulas formula_2. formula_3 is the same problem, but for \"finite\" models. The formula_4-problem for a logical fragment is called decidable if there exists a program that can decide, for each formula_2 finite set of logical formulas in the fragment, whether formula_1 or not.\nThere is a hierarchy of decidabilities. On the top are the undecidable problems. Below it are the decidable problems. Furthermore, the decidable problems can be divided into a complexity hierarchy.\nAristotelian and relational.\nAristotelian logic considers 4 kinds of sentences: \"All p are q\", \"All p are not q\", \"Some p is q\", \"Some p is not q\". We can formalize these kinds of sentences as a fragment of first-order logic:formula_7where formula_8 are atomic predicates, and formula_9. Given a finite set of Aristotelean logic formulas, it is NLOGSPACE-complete to decide its formula_4. It is also NLOGSPACE-complete to decide formula_4 for a slight extension (Theorem 2.7):formula_12Relational logic extends Aristotelean logic by allowing a relational predicate. For example, \"Everybody loves somebody\" can be written as formula_13. Generally, we have 8 kinds of sentences:formula_14It is NLOGSPACE-complete to decide its formula_4 (Theorem 2.15). Relational logic can be extended to 32 kinds of sentences by allowing formula_16, but this extension is EXPTIME-complete (Theorem 2.24).\nArity.\nThe first-order logic fragment where the only variable names are formula_17 is NEXPTIME-complete (Theorem 3.18). With formula_18, it is co-RE-complete to decide its formula_4, and RE-complete to decide formula_20 (Theorem 3.15), thus undecidable.\nThe monadic predicate calculus is the fragment where each formula contains only 1-ary predicates and no function symbols. Its formula_4 is NEXPTIME-complete (Theorem 3.22).\nQuantifier prefix.\nAny first-order formula has a prenex normal form. For each possible quantifier prefix to the prenex normal form, we have a fragment of first-order logic. For example, the Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel class, formula_22, is the class of first-order formulas with quantifier prefix formula_23, equality and relation symbols, and no function symbols.\nFor example, Turing's 1936 paper (p. 263) observed that since the halting problem for each Turing machine is equivalent to a first-order logical formula of form formula_24, the problem formula_25 is undecidable.\nThe precise boundaries are known, sharply:\nB\u00f6rger et al. (2001) describes the level of computational complexity for every possible fragment with every possible combination of quantifier prefix, functional arity, predicate arity, and equality/no-equality.\nPractical decision procedures.\nHaving practical decision procedures for classes of logical formulas is of considerable interest for program verification and circuit verification. Pure Boolean logical formulas are usually decided using SAT-solving techniques based on the DPLL algorithm.\nFor more general decision problems of first-order theories, conjunctive formulas over linear real or rational arithmetic can be decided using the simplex algorithm, formulas in linear integer arithmetic (Presburger arithmetic) can be decided using Cooper's algorithm or William Pugh's Omega test. Formulas with negations, conjunctions and disjunctions combine the difficulties of satisfiability testing with that of decision of conjunctions; they are generally decided nowadays using SMT-solving techniques, which combine SAT-solving with decision procedures for conjunctions and propagation techniques. Real polynomial arithmetic, also known as the theory of real closed fields, is decidable; this is the Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem, which has been implemented in computers by using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9674", "revid": "7436027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9674", "title": "Einhard", "text": "Frankish scholar and courtier (c. 775 \u2013 840)\nEinhard (also Eginhard or Einhart; ; c. 775 \u2013 14 March 840) was a Frankish scholar and courtier. Einhard was a dedicated servant of Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the \"Vita Karoli Magni\", \"one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages\".\nPublic life.\nEinhard was from the eastern German-speaking part of the Frankish Kingdom. Born into a family of landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of Fulda, one of the most impressive centers of learning in the Frank lands. Perhaps due to his small stature, which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies on scholarship, especially the mastering of Latin. He was accepted into the hugely wealthy court of Charlemagne around 791 or 792. Charlemagne actively sought to amass scholarly men around him and established a royal school led by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin. Einhard was evidently a talented builder and construction manager, because Charlemagne put him in charge of the completion of several palace complexes including Aachen and Ingelheim. Despite the fact that Einhard was on intimate terms with Charlemagne, he never achieved office in his reign. In 814, on Charlemagne's death, his son Louis the Pious made Einhard his private secretary. Einhard retired from court during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830.\nHe died at Seligenstadt in 840.\nPrivate life.\nEinhard was married to Emma, of whom little is known. There is a possibility that their marriage bore a son, Vussin. Their marriage also appears to have been exceptionally liberal for the period, with Emma being as active as Einhard, if not more so, in the handling of their property. It is said that in the later years of their marriage Emma and Einhard abstained from sexual relations, choosing instead to focus their attentions on their many religious commitments. Though he was undoubtedly devoted to her, Einhard wrote nothing of his wife until after her death on 13 December 835, when he wrote to a friend that he was reminded of her loss in \u2018every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities\u2019.\nReligious beliefs.\nEinhard made numerous references to himself as a \"sinner\" according to his strong Christian faith. He erected churches at both of his estates in Michelstadt and Mulinheim. In Michelstadt, he also saw fit to build a basilica completed in 827 and then sent a servant, Ratleic, to Rome with an end to find relics for the new building. Once in Rome, Ratleic robbed a catacomb of the bones of the Martyrs Marcellinus and Peter and had them translated to Michelstadt. Once there, the relics made it known they were unhappy with their new tomb and thus had to be moved again to Mulinheim. Once established there, they proved to be miracle workers. Although unsure as to why these saints should choose such a \"sinner\" as their patron, Einhard nonetheless set about ensuring they continued to receive a resting place fitting of their honour. Between 831 and 834 he founded a Benedictine Monastery and, after the death of his wife, served as its Abbot until his own death in 840.\nLocal lore.\nLocal lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of Charlemagne's daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Oberm\u00fchlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name \"Seligenstadt\" by folk etymology. Einhard and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at Erbach in the Odenwald.\nWorks.\nThe most famous of Einhard's works is his biography of Charlemagne, the \"Vita Karoli Magni\", \"The Life of Charlemagne\" (c. 817\u2013836), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne's life and character, written sometime between 817 and 830. In composing this he relied heavily upon the Royal Frankish Annals. Einhard's literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian Suetonius, the \"Lives of the Caesars\", though it is important to stress that the work is very much Einhard's own, that is to say he adapts the models and sources for his own purposes. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father (\"nutritor\") and to whom he was a debtor \"in life and death\". The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters; by contrast, other issues are curiously not glossed over, like his concubines. \nEinhard is also responsible for three other extant works: a collection of letters, \"On the Translations and the Miracles of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus\", and \"On the Adoration of the Cross\". The latter dates from c.\u2009830 and was not rediscovered until 1885, when Ernst D\u00fcmmler identified a text in a manuscript in Vienna as the missing \"Libellus de adoranda cruce\", which Einhard had dedicated to his pupil Lupus Servatus.\nArch of Einhard.\nThe Arch of Einhard was a reliquary made by Einhard, which reproduced on a small scale a Roman triumphal arch that represented the victory of Christianity.

These compounds contain a distinctive functional group. Analogues derived from oxygen replaced by other chalcogens belong to the ester category as well. According to some authors, organyl derivatives of acidic hydrogen of other acids are esters as well (e.g. amides), but not according to the IUPAC.\nGlycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol; they are important in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids and comprising the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Lactones are cyclic carboxylic esters; naturally occurring lactones are mainly 5- and 6-membered ring lactones. Lactones contribute to the aroma of fruits, butter, cheese, vegetables like celery and other foods.\nEsters can be formed from oxoacids (e.g. esters of acetic acid, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, xanthic acid), but also from acids that do not contain oxygen (e.g. esters of thiocyanic acid and trithiocarbonic acid). An example of an ester formation is the substitution reaction between a carboxylic acid () and an alcohol (), forming an ester (), where R stands for any group (typically hydrogen or organyl) and R\u2032 stands for organyl group.\nOrganyl esters of carboxylic acids typically have a pleasant smell; those of low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and are found in essential oils and pheromones. They perform as high-grade solvents for a broad array of plastics, plasticizers, resins, and lacquers, and are one of the largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market. Polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties. Esters of phosphoric acid form the backbone of DNA molecules. Esters of nitric acid, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties.\nThere are compounds in which an acidic hydrogen of acids mentioned in this article are not replaced by an organyl, but by some other group. According to some authors, those compounds are esters as well, especially when the first carbon atom of the organyl group replacing acidic hydrogen, is replaced by another atom from the group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb); for example, according to them, trimethylstannyl acetate (or trimethyltin acetate) is a trimethylstannyl ester of acetic acid, and dibutyltin dilaurate is a dibutylstannylene ester of lauric acid, and the Phillips catalyst is a trimethoxysilyl ester of chromic acid ().\nNomenclature.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"ester\" was coined in 1848 by German chemist Leopold Gmelin, probably as a contraction of the German , \"acetic ether\".\nIUPAC nomenclature.\nThe names of esters that are formed from an alcohol and an acid, are derived from the parent alcohol and the parent acid, where the latter may be organic or inorganic. Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"trivial names\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate, and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix \"-oate\". For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl caprylate, has the formula .\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters formed from carboxylic acids and alcohols usually take the form or RCOOR', where R and R' are the organyl parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively, and R can be a hydrogen in the case of esters of formic acid. For example, butyl acetate (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from butanol and acetic acid (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written . Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and .\nCyclic esters are called lactones, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or inorganic acid. One example of an organic lactone is \u03b3-valerolactone.\nOrthoesters.\nAn uncommon class of esters are the orthoesters. One of them are the esters of orthocarboxylic acids. Those esters have the formula , where R stands for any group (organic or inorganic) and R\u2032 stands for organyl group. For example, triethyl orthoformate () is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from esterification of orthoformic acid () with ethanol.\nEsters of inorganic acids.\nEsters can also be derived from inorganic acids.\nInorganic acids that exist as tautomers form two or more types of esters.\nSome inorganic acids that are unstable or elusive form stable esters.\nIn principle, a part of metal and metalloid alkoxides, of which many hundreds are known, could be classified as esters of the corresponding acids (e.g., aluminium triethoxide () could be classified as an ester of aluminic acid which is aluminium hydroxide, tetraethyl orthosilicate () could be classified as an ester of orthosilicic acid, and titanium ethoxide () could be classified as an ester of orthotitanic acid).\nStructure and bonding.\nEsters derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols contain a carbonyl group C=O, which is a divalent group at C atom, which gives rise to 120\u00b0 C\u2013C\u2013O and O\u2013C\u2013O angles. Unlike amides, carboxylic acid esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C\u2013O\u2013C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides. The p\"K\"a of the alpha-hydrogens on esters of carboxylic acids is around 25 (alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen bound to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O) of carboxylate esters).\nMany carboxylic acid esters have the potential for conformational isomerism, but they tend to adopt an \"S\"-\"cis\" (or \"Z\") conformation rather than the \"S\"-\"trans\" (or \"E\") alternative, due to a combination of hyperconjugation and dipole minimization effects. The preference for the \"Z\" conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present. Lactones with small rings are restricted to the \"s\"-trans (i.e. \"E\") conformation due to their cyclic structure.\nPhysical properties and characterization.\nEsters derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols are more polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols. They participate in hydrogen bonds as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than carboxylic acids of similar molecular weight.\nCharacterization and analysis.\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. IR spectra for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730\u20131750\u00a0cm\u22121 assigned to \"\u03bd\"C=O. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjunction with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30\u00a0cm\u22121.\nApplications and occurrence.\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, fats are, in general, triesters derived from glycerol and fatty acids. Esters are responsible for the aroma of many fruits, including apples, durians, pears, bananas, pineapples, and strawberries. Several billion kilograms of polyesters are produced industrially annually, important products being polyethylene terephthalate, acrylate esters, and cellulose acetate.\nPreparation.\nEsterification is the general name for a chemical reaction in which two reactants (typically an alcohol and an acid) form an ester as the reaction product. Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the fragrance and flavor industry. Ester bonds are also found in many polymers.\nEsterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols.\nThe classic synthesis is the Fischer esterification, which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a dehydrating agent:\nThe equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate. The reaction is slow in the absence of a catalyst. Sulfuric acid is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as polymeric sulfonic acids. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using Le Chatelier's principle:\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the Steglich esterification, which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in peptide synthesis, where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer catalyst.\nAnother method for the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids is the Mitsunobu reaction:\nCarboxylic acids can be esterified using diazomethane:\nUsing this diazomethane, mixtures of carboxylic acids can be converted to their methyl esters in near quantitative yields, e.g., for analysis by gas chromatography. The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large-scale applications.\nEsterification of carboxylic acids with epoxides.\nCarboxylic acids are esterified by treatment with epoxides, giving \u03b2-hydroxyesters:\nThis reaction is employed in the production of vinyl ester resin from acrylic acid.\nAlcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides.\nAlcohols react with acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides to give esters:\n\nThe reactions are irreversible simplifying work-up. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give amides are less sensitive because amines are stronger nucleophiles and react more rapidly than does water. This method is employed only for laboratory-scale procedures, as it is expensive.\nAlkylation of carboxylic acids and their salts.\nTrimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate can be used for esterification of carboxylic acids under conditions where acid-catalyzed reactions are infeasible:\nAlthough rarely employed for esterifications, carboxylate salts (often generated \"in situ\") react with electrophilic alkylating agents, such as alkyl halides, to give esters. Anion availability can inhibit this reaction, which correspondingly benefits from phase transfer catalysts or such highly polar aprotic solvents as DMF. An additional iodide salt may, via the Finkelstein reaction, catalyze the reaction of a recalcitrant alkyl halide. Alternatively, salts of a coordinating metal, such as silver, may improve the reaction rate by easing halide elimination.\nTransesterification.\nTransesterification, which involves changing one ester into another one, is widely practiced:\nLike the hydrolysation, transesterification is catalysed by acids and bases. The reaction is widely used for degrading triglycerides, e.g. in the production of fatty acid esters and alcohols. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) is produced by the transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol: \nA subset of transesterification is the alcoholysis of diketene. This reaction affords 2-ketoesters.\nCarbonylation.\nAlkenes undergo carboalkoxylation in the presence of metal carbonyl catalysts. Esters of propanoic acid are produced commercially by this method:\nA preparation of methyl propionate is one illustrative example. \nThe carbonylation of methanol yields methyl formate, which is the main commercial source of formic acid. The reaction is catalyzed by sodium methoxide:\nAddition of carboxylic acids to alkenes and alkynes.\nIn hydroesterification, alkenes and alkynes insert into the bond of carboxylic acids. Vinyl acetate is produced industrially by the addition of acetic acid to acetylene in the presence of zinc acetate catalysts:\nVinyl acetate can also be produced by palladium-catalyzed reaction of ethylene, acetic acid, and oxygen:\nSilicotungstic acid is used to manufacture ethyl acetate by the alkylation of acetic acid by ethylene:\nFrom aldehydes.\nThe Tishchenko reaction involves disproportionation of an aldehyde in the presence of an anhydrous base to give an ester. Catalysts are aluminium alkoxides or sodium alkoxides. Benzaldehyde reacts with sodium benzyloxide (generated from sodium and benzyl alcohol) to generate benzyl benzoate. The method is used in the production of ethyl acetate from acetaldehyde.\nReactions.\nEsters are less reactive than acid halides and anhydrides. As with more reactive acyl derivatives, they can react with ammonia and primary and secondary amines to give amides, although this type of reaction is not often used, since acid halides give better yields. \nTransesterification.\nEsters can be converted to other esters in a process known as transesterification. Transesterification can be either acid- or base-catalyzed, and involves the reaction of an ester with an alcohol. Unfortunately, because the leaving group is also an alcohol, the forward and reverse reactions will often occur at similar rates. Using a large excess of the reactant alcohol or removing the leaving group alcohol (e.g. via distillation) will drive the forward reaction towards completion, in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle.\nHydrolysis and saponification.\nAcid-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters is also an equilibrium process \u2013 essentially the reverse of the Fischer esterification reaction. Because an alcohol (which acts as the leaving group) and water (which acts as the nucleophile) have similar p\"K\"a values, the forward and reverse reactions compete with each other. As in transesterification, using a large excess of reactant (water) or removing one of the products (the alcohol) can promote the forward reaction.\nBasic hydrolysis of esters, known as saponification, is not an equilibrium process; a full equivalent of base is consumed in the reaction, which produces one equivalent of alcohol and one equivalent of a carboxylate salt. The saponification of esters of fatty acids is an industrially important process, used in the production of soap.\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the Fischer esterification. Under basic conditions, hydroxide acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, saponification, is the basis of soap making.\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as ammonia or primary or secondary amines to give amides (ammonolysis reaction):\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to isocyanates through intermediate hydroxamic acids in the Lossen rearrangement.\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\nReduction.\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are relatively resistant to reduction. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to fatty alcohols.\nA typical catalyst is copper chromite. Prior to the development of catalytic hydrogenation, esters were reduced on a large scale using the Bouveault\u2013Blanc reduction. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.\nEspecially for fine chemical syntheses, lithium aluminium hydride is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. DIBAH reduces esters to aldehydes.\nDirect reduction to give the corresponding ether is difficult as the intermediate hemiacetal tends to decompose to give an alcohol and an aldehyde (which is rapidly reduced to give a second alcohol). The reaction can be achieved using triethylsilane with a variety of Lewis acids.\nClaisen condensation and related reactions.\nEsters can undergo a variety of reactions with carbon nucleophiles. They react with an excess of a Grignard reagent to give tertiary alcohols. Esters also react readily with enolates. In the Claisen condensation, an enolate of one ester (1) will attack the carbonyl group of another ester (2) to give tetrahedral intermediate 3. The intermediate collapses, forcing out an alkoxide (R'O\u2212) and producing \u03b2-keto ester 4.\nCrossed Claisen condensations, in which the enolate and nucleophile are different esters, are also possible. An intramolecular Claisen condensation is called a Dieckmann condensation or Dieckmann cyclization, since it can be used to form rings. Esters can also undergo condensations with ketone and aldehyde enolates to give \u03b2-dicarbonyl compounds. A specific example of this is the Baker\u2013Venkataraman rearrangement, in which an aromatic \"ortho\"-acyloxy ketone undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution and subsequent rearrangement to form an aromatic \u03b2-diketone. The Chan rearrangement is another example of a rearrangement resulting from an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction.\nOther ester reactivities.\nEsters react with nucleophiles at the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C\u2013H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms adducts.\nAs for aldehydes, the hydrogen atoms on the carbon adjacent (\"\u03b1 to\") the carboxyl group in esters are sufficiently acidic to undergo deprotonation, which in turn leads to a variety of useful reactions. Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as alkoxides. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic enolate, which can further react, e.g., the Claisen condensation and its intramolecular equivalent, the Dieckmann condensation. This conversion is exploited in the malonic ester synthesis, wherein the diester of malonic acid reacts with an electrophile (e.g., alkyl halide), and is subsequently decarboxylated. Another variation is the Fr\u00e1ter\u2013Seebach alkylation.\nProtecting groups.\nAs a class, esters serve as protecting groups for carboxylic acids. Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional amino acids. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the \"t\"-butyl ester tends to be more expensive. However, \"t\"-butyl esters are particularly useful because, under strongly acidic conditions, the \"t\"-butyl esters undergo elimination to give the carboxylic acid and isobutylene, simplifying work-up.\nList of ester odorants.\nMany esters have distinctive fruit-like odors, and many occur naturally in the essential oils of plants. This has also led to their common use in artificial flavorings and fragrances which aim to mimic those odors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically, the two organisms are in a mutualistic relationship. Examples are nitrogen-fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), which live in the root nodules of legumes, single-cell algae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to insects.\nEndosymbiosis played key roles in the development of eukaryotes and plants. Roughly 2.3 billion years ago an archaeon (likely within the Asgard superphylum) absorbed an alphaproteobacterium through phagocytosis, that eventually became the mitochondria that provide energy to almost all living eukaryotic cells. Approximately 1 billion years ago, some of those cells absorbed cyanobacteria that eventually became chloroplasts, organelles that produce energy from sunlight. Approximately 100 million years ago, a lineage of amoeba in the genus \"Paulinella\" independently engulfed a cyanobacterium that evolved to be functionally synonymous with traditional chloroplasts, called chromatophores.\nSome 100 million years ago, UCYN-A, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, became an endosymbiont of the marine alga \"Braarudosphaera bigelowii\", eventually evolving into a nitroplast, which fixes nitrogen. Similarly, diatoms in the family \"Rhopalodiaceae\" have cyanobacterial endosymbionts, called spheroid bodies or diazoplasts, which have been proposed to be in the early stages of organelle evolution.\nSymbionts are either obligate (require their host to survive) or facultative (can survive independently). The most common examples of obligate endosymbiosis are mitochondria and chloroplasts; however, they do not reproduce via mitosis in tandem with their host cells. Instead, they replicate via binary fission, a replication process uncoupled from the host cells in which they reside. Some human parasites, e.g. \"Wuchereria bancrofti\" and \"Mansonella perstans\", thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with \"Wolbachia\" spp. They can both be eliminated by treatments that target their bacterial host.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nEndosymbiosis comes from the Greek: \u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \"endon\" \"within\", \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd \"syn\" \"together\" and \u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \"biosis\" \"living\".\nSymbiogenesis.\nSymbiogenesis theory holds that eukaryotes evolved via absorbing prokaryotes. Typically, one organism envelopes a bacterium and the two evolve a mutualistic relationship. The absorbed bacterium (the endosymbiont) eventually lives exclusively within the host cells. This fits the concept of observed organelle development.\nTypically the endosymbiont's genome shrinks, discarding genes whose roles are displaced by the host. For example, the \"Hodgkinia\" genome of \"Magicicada\" cicadas is much different from that of the prior freestanding bacteria. The cicada life cycle involves years of stasis underground. The symbiont produces many generations during this phase, experiencing little selection pressure, allowing their genomes to diversify. Selection is episodic (when the cicadas reproduce). The original \"Hodgkinia\" genome split into three much simpler endosymbionts, each encoding only a few genes\u2014an instance of punctuated equilibrium producing distinct lineages. The host requires all three symbionts.\nTransmission.\nSymbiont transmission is the process where the host acquires its symbiont. Since symbionts are not produced by host cells, they must find their own way to reproduce and populate daughter cells as host cells divide. Horizontal, vertical, and mixed-mode (hybrid of horizontal and vertical) transmission are the three paths for symbiont transfer.\nHorizontal.\nHorizontal symbiont transfer (horizontal transmission) is a process where a host acquires a facultative symbiont from the environment or another host. The Rhizobia-Legume symbiosis (bacteria-plant endosymbiosis) is a prime example of this modality. The Rhizobia-legume symbiotic relationship is important for processes such as the formation of root nodules. It starts with flavonoids released by the legume host, which causes the rhizobia species (endosymbiont) to activate its \"Nod\" genes. These \"Nod\" genes generate lipooligosaccharide signals that the legume detects, leading to root nodule formation. This process bleeds into other processes such as nitrogen fixation in plants. The evolutionary advantage of such an interaction allows genetic exchange between both organisms involved to increase the propensity for novel functions as seen in the plant-bacterium interaction (holobiont formation).\nVertical.\nVertical transmission takes place when the symbiont moves directly from parent to offspring. In horizontal transmission each generation acquires symbionts from the environment. An example is nitrogen-fixing bacteria in certain plant roots, such as pea aphid symbionts. A third type is mixed-mode transmission, where symbionts move horizontally for some generations, after which they are acquired vertically.\n\"Wigglesworthia,\" a tsetse fly symbiont, is vertically transmitted (via mother's milk). In vertical transmission, the symbionts do not need to survive independently, often leading them to have a reduced genome. For instance, pea aphid symbionts have lost genes for essential molecules and rely on the host to supply them. In return, the symbionts synthesize essential amino acids for the aphid host. When a symbiont reaches this stage, it begins to resemble a cellular organelle, similar to mitochondria or chloroplasts. Such dependent hosts and symbionts form a holobiont. In the event of a bottleneck, a decrease in symbiont diversity could compromise host-symbiont interactions, as deleterious mutations accumulate.\nHosts.\nInvertebrates.\nThe best-studied examples of endosymbiosis are in invertebrates. These symbioses affect organisms with global impact, including \"Symbiodinium\" (corals), or \"Wolbachia\" (insects). Many insect agricultural pests and human disease vectors have intimate relationships with primary endosymbionts.\nInsects.\nScientists classify insect endosymbionts as Primary or Secondary. Primary endosymbionts (P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their insect hosts for millions of years (from ten to several hundred million years). They form obligate associations and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts more recently associated with their hosts, may be horizontally transferred, live in the hemolymph of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.\nPrimary.\nAmong primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the pea aphid (\"Acyrthosiphon pisum\") and its endosymbiont \"Buchnera sp.\" APS, the tsetse fly \"Glossina morsitans morsitans\" and its endosymbiont \"Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis\" and the endosymbiotic protists in lower termites. As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate. Nutritionally enhanced diets allow symbiont-free specimens to survive, but they are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.\nIn some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called bacteriocytes (also called \"mycetocytes\"), and are maternally transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the egg, as in \"Buchnera\"; in others like \"Wigglesworthia\", they are transmitted via milk to the embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through trophallaxis among colony members.\nPrimary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing essential nutrients or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of \"Buchnera\" is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its diet of plant sap. The primary role of \"Wigglesworthia\" is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from the blood that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.\nBacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to predators and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.\nPrimary endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have lost many genes commonly found in closely related bacteria. One theory claimed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel phylogeny of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the assumption that primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically.\nAttacking obligate bacterial endosymbionts may present a way to control their hosts, many of which are pests or human disease carriers. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism \"Trypanosoma brucei\" that causes African sleeping sickness. Studying insect endosymbionts can aid understanding the origins of symbioses in general, as a proxy for understanding endosymbiosis in other species.\nThe best-studied ant endosymbionts are \"Blochmannia\" bacteria, which are the primary endosymbiont of \"Camponotus\" ants. In 2018 a new ant-associated symbiont, \"Candidatus Westeberhardia Cardiocondylae,\" was discovered in \"Cardiocondyla\". It is reported to be a primary symbiont.\nSecondary.\nThe pea aphid (\"Acyrthosiphon pisum\") contains at least three secondary endosymbionts, \"Hamiltonella defensa\", \"Regiella insecticola\", and \"Serratia symbiotica\". \"Hamiltonella defensa\" defends its aphid host from parasitoid wasps. This symbiosis replaces lost elements of the insect's immune response.\nOne of the best-understood defensive symbionts is the spiral bacteria \"Spiroplasma poulsonii\". \"Spiroplasma sp.\" can be reproductive manipulators, but also defensive symbionts of \"Drosophila\" flies. In \"Drosophila neotestacea\", \"S. poulsonii\" has spread across North America owing to its ability to defend its fly host against nematode parasites. This defence is mediated by toxins called \"ribosome-inactivating proteins\" that attack the molecular machinery of invading parasites. These toxins represent one of the first understood examples of a defensive symbiosis with a mechanistic understanding for defensive symbiosis between an insect endosymbiont and its host.\n\"Sodalis glossinidius\" is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies do not report a correlation between evolution of \"Sodalis\" and tsetse. Unlike \"Wigglesworthia,\" \"Sodalis\" has been cultured \"in vitro\".\n\"Cardinium\" is another clade of vertically transmitted bacterial endosymbionts that occurs in a range of arthropod hosts and often manipulates host reproductive biology to favor females that transmit the endosymbiont.\nMarine.\nExtracellular endosymbionts are represented in all four extant classes of Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea, and Holothuroidea). Little is known of the nature of the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but phylogenetic analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the class Alphaproteobacteria, relating them to \"Rhizobium\" and \"Thiobacillus\". Other studies indicate that these subcuticular bacteria may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms.\nSome marine oligochaeta (e.g., \"Olavius algarvensis\" and \"Inanidrillus spp.\") have obligate extracellular endosymbionts that fill the entire body of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria lacking any digestive or excretory system (no gut, mouth, or nephridia).\nThe sea slug \"Elysia chlorotica's\" endosymbiont is the algae \"Vaucheria litorea.\" The jellyfish \"Mastigias\" have a similar relationship with an algae. \"Elysia chlorotica\" forms this relationship intracellularly with the algae's chloroplasts. These chloroplasts retain their photosynthetic capabilities and structures for several months after entering the slug's cells.\n\"Trichoplax\" have two bacterial endosymbionts. Ruthmannia lives inside the animal's digestive cells. Grellia lives permanently inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first known symbiont to do so.\n\"Paracatenula\" is a flatworm which have lived in symbiosis with an endosymbiotic bacteria for 500 million years. The bacteria produce numerous small, droplet-like vesicles that provide the host with needed nutrients.\nDinoflagellates.\nDinoflagellate endosymbionts of the genus \"Symbiodinium\", commonly known as zooxanthellae, are found in corals, mollusks (esp. giant clams, the \"Tridacna\"), sponges, and the unicellular foraminifera. These endosymbionts capture sunlight and provide their hosts with energy via carbonate deposition.\nPreviously thought to be a single species, molecular phylogenetic evidence reported diversity in \"Symbiodinium\". In some cases, the host requires a specific \"Symbiodinium\" clade. More often, however, the distribution is ecological, with symbionts switching among hosts with ease. When reefs become environmentally stressed, this distribution is related to the observed pattern of coral bleaching and recovery. Thus, the distribution of \"Symbiodinium\" on coral reefs and its role in coral bleaching is an important in coral reef ecology.\nPhytoplankton.\nIn marine environments, endosymbiont relationships are especially prevalent in oligotrophic or nutrient-poor regions of the ocean like that of the North Atlantic. In such waters, cell growth of larger phytoplankton such as diatoms is limited by (insufficient) nitrate concentrations. Endosymbiotic bacteria fix nitrogen for their hosts and in turn receive organic carbon from photosynthesis. These symbioses play an important role in global carbon cycling.\nOne known symbiosis between the diatom \"Hemialus\" spp. and the cyanobacterium \"Richelia intracellularis\" has been reported in North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific waters. \"Richelia\" is found within the diatom frustule of \"Hemiaulus\" spp., and has a reduced genome.\u00a0A 2011 study measured nitrogen fixation by the cyanobacterial host \"Richelia intracellularis\" well above intracellular requirements, and found the cyanobacterium was likely fixing nitrogen for its host.\u00a0Additionally, both host and symbiont cell growth were much greater than free-living \"Richelia intracellularis\" or symbiont-free \"Hemiaulus\" spp.\u00a0The \"Hemaiulus\"-\"Richelia\" symbiosis is not obligatory, especially in nitrogen-replete areas.\n\"Richelia intracellularis\" is also found in \"Rhizosolenia\" spp., a diatom found in oligotrophic oceans. Compared to the \"Hemaiulus\" host, the endosymbiosis with \"Rhizosolenia\" is much more consistent, and \"Richelia intracellularis\" is generally found in \"Rhizosolenia\". There are some asymbiotic (occurs without an endosymbiont) Rhizosolenia, however there appears to be mechanisms limiting growth of these organisms in low nutrient conditions. Cell division for both the diatom host and cyanobacterial symbiont can be uncoupled and mechanisms for passing bacterial symbionts to daughter cells during cell division are still relatively unknown.\nOther endosymbiosis with nitrogen fixers in open oceans include \"Calothrix\" in \"Chaetoceros\" spp. and UNCY-A in prymnesiophyte microalga. The \"Chaetoceros\"-\"Calothrix\" endosymbiosis is hypothesized to be more recent, as the \"Calothrix\" genome is generally intact. While other species like that of the UNCY-A symbiont and Richelia have reduced genomes.\u00a0This reduction in genome size occurs within nitrogen metabolism pathways indicating endosymbiont species are generating nitrogen for their hosts and losing the ability to use this nitrogen independently.\u00a0This endosymbiont reduction in genome size, might be a step that occurred in the evolution of organelles (above).\nProtists.\n\"Mixotricha paradoxa\" is a protozoan that lacks mitochondria. However, spherical bacteria live inside the cell and serve the function of the mitochondria. \"Mixotricha\" has three other species of symbionts that live on the surface of the cell.\n\"Paramecium bursaria\", a species of ciliate, has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with green alga called \"Zoochlorella\". The algae live in its cytoplasm.\n\"Platyophrya chlorelligera\" is a freshwater ciliate that harbors \"Chlorella\" that perform photosynthesis.\n\"Strombidium purpureum\" is a marine ciliate that uses endosymbiotic, purple, non-sulphur bacteria for anoxygenic photosynthesis.\n\"Paulinella chromatophora\" is a freshwater amoeboid that has a cyanobacterium endosymbiont.\nMany foraminifera are hosts to several types of algae, such as red algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates and chlorophyta. These endosymbionts can be transmitted vertically to the next generation via asexual reproduction of the host, but because the endosymbionts are larger than the foraminiferal gametes, they need to acquire algae horizontally following sexual reproduction.\nSeveral species of radiolaria have photosynthetic symbionts. In some species the host digests algae to keep the population at a constant level.\n\"Hatena arenicola\" is a flagellate protist with a complicated feeding apparatus that feeds on other microbes. When it engulfs a green \"Nephroselmis\" alga, the feeding apparatus disappears and it becomes photosynthetic. During mitosis the algae is transferred to only one of the daughter cells, while the other cell restarts the cycle.\nIn 1966, biologist Kwang W. Jeon found that a lab strain of \"Amoeba proteus\" had been infected by bacteria that lived inside the cytoplasmic vacuoles. This infection killed almost all of the infected protists. After the equivalent of 40 host generations, the two organisms become mutually interdependent. A genetic exchange between the prokaryotes and protists occurred.\nVertebrates.\nThe spotted salamander (\"Ambystoma maculatum\") lives in a relationship with the algae \"Oophila amblystomatis\", which grows in its egg cases.\nPlants.\nAll vascular plants harbor endosymbionts or endophytes in this context. They include bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa and even microalgae. Endophytes aid in processes such as growth and development, nutrient uptake, and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses like drought, salinity, heat, and herbivores.\nPlant symbionts can be categorized into epiphytic, endophytic, and mycorrhizal. These relations can also be categorized as beneficial, mutualistic, neutral, and pathogenic. Microorganisms living as endosymbionts in plants can enhance their host's primary productivity either by producing or capturing important resources. These endosymbionts can also enhance plant productivity by producing toxic metabolites that aid plant defenses against herbivores.\nPlants are dependent on plastid or chloroplast organelles. The chloroplast is derived from a cyanobacterial primary endosymbiosis that began over one billion years ago. An oxygenic, photosynthetic free-living cyanobacterium was engulfed and kept by a heterotrophic protist and eventually evolved into the present intracellular organelle. \nMycorrhizal endosymbionts appear only in fungi.\nTypically, plant endosymbiosis studies focus on a single category or species to better understand their individual biological processes and functions.\nFungal endophytes.\nFungal endophytes can be found in all plant tissues. Fungi living below the ground amidst plant roots are known as mycorrhiza, but are further categorized based on their location inside the root, with prefixes such as ecto, endo, arbuscular, ericoid, etc. Fungal endosymbionts that live in the roots and extend their extraradical hyphae into the outer rhizosphere are known as ectendosymbionts.\nArbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF).\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or AMF are the most diverse plant microbial endosymbionts. With exceptions such as the Ericaceae family, almost all vascular plants harbor AMF endosymbionts as endo and ecto as well. AMF plant endosymbionts systematically colonize plant roots and help the plant host acquire soil nutrients such as nitrogen. In return it absorbs plant organic carbon products. Plant root exudates contain diverse secondary metabolites, especially flavonoids and strigolactones that act as chemical signals and attracts the AMF. AMF \"Gigaspora margarita\" lives as a plant endosymbiont and also harbors further endosymbiont intracytoplasmic bacterium-like organisms. AMF generally promote plant health and growth and alleviate abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, heat, poor nutrition, and metal toxicity. Individual AMF species have different effects in different hosts \u2013 introducing the AMF of one plant to another plant can reduce the latter's growth.\nEndophytic fungi.\nEndophytic fungi in mutualistic relations directly benefit and benefit from their host plants. They also can help their hosts succeed in polluted environments such as those contaminated with toxic metals. Fungal endophytes are taxonomically diverse and are divided into categories based on mode of transmission, biodiversity, in planta colonization and host plant type. Clavicipitaceous fungi systematically colonize temperate season grasses. Non-clavicipitaceous fungi colonize higher plants and even roots and divide into subcategories. \"Aureobasidium\u00a0\"and \"preussia\" species of endophytic fungi isolated from \"Boswellia sacra\" produce indole acetic acid hormone to promote plant health and development.\nAphids can be found in most plants. Carnivorous ladybirds are aphid predators and are used in pest control. Plant endophytic fungus \"Neotyphodium lolii\" produces alkaloid mycotoxins in response to aphid invasions. In response, ladybird predators exhibited reduced fertility and abnormal reproduction, suggesting that the mycotoxins are transmitted along the food chain and affect the predators.\nEndophytic bacteria.\nEndophytic bacteria belong to a diverse group of plant endosymbionts characterized by systematic colonization of plant tissues. The most common genera include \"Pseudomonas\", \"Bacillus\", \"Acinetobacter\", \"Actinobacteria\", \"Sphingomonas.\" Some endophytic bacteria, such as \"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\", a seed-born endophytic bacteria, produce plant growth by producing gibberellins, which are potent plant growth hormones. \"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\" promotes the taller height of transgenic dwarf rice plants. Some endophytic bacteria genera additionally belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Endophytic bacteria typically colonize the leaf tissues from plant roots, but can also enter the plant through the leaves through leaf stomata. Generally, the endophytic bacteria are isolated from the plant tissues by surface sterilization of the plant tissue in a sterile environment. Passenger endophytic bacteria eventually colonize inner tissue of plant by stochastic events while True endophytes possess adaptive traits because of which they live strictly in association with plants. The \"in vitro-\"cultivated endophytic bacteria association with plants is considered a more intimate relationship that helps plants acclimatize to conditions and promotes health and growth. Endophytic bacteria are considered to be plant's essential endosymbionts because virtually all plants harbor them, and these endosymbionts play essential roles in host survival. This endosymbiotic relation is important in terms of ecology, evolution and diversity. Endophytic bacteria such as \"Sphingomonas\" sp. and \"Serratia\" sp. that are isolated from arid land plants regulate endogenous hormone content and promote growth.\nArchaea endosymbionts.\nArchaea are members of most microbiomes. While archaea are abundant in extreme environments, they are less abundant and diverse in association with eukaryotic hosts. Nevertheless, archaea are a substantial constituent of plant-associated ecosystems in the aboveground and belowground phytobiome, and play a role in host plant's health, growth and survival amid biotic and abiotic stresses. However, few studies have investigated the role of archaea in plant health and its symbiotic relationships. Most plant endosymbiosis studies focus on fungal or bacteria using metagenomic approaches.\nThe characterization of archaea includes crop plants such as rice and maize, but also aquatic plants. The abundance of archaea varies by tissue type; for example archaea are more abundant in the rhizosphere than the phyllosphere and endosphere. This archaeal abundance is associated with plant species type, environment and the plant's developmental stage. In a study on plant genotype-specific archaeal and bacterial endophytes, 35% of archaeal sequences were detected in overall sequences (achieved using amplicon sequencing and verified by real time-PCR). The archaeal sequences belong to the phyla \"Thaumarchaeota\", \"Crenarchaeota,\" and \"Euryarchaeota\".\nBacteria.\nSome Betaproteobacteria have Gammaproteobacteria endosymbionts.\nFungi.\nFungi host endohyphal bacteria; the effects of the bacteria are not well studied. Many such fungi in turn live within plants. These fungi are otherwise known as fungal endophytes. It is hypothesized that the fungi offers a safe haven for the bacteria, and the diverse bacteria that they attract create a micro-ecosystem.\nThese interactions may impact the way that fungi interact with the environment by modulating their phenotypes. The bacteria do this by altering the fungi's gene expression. For example, \"Luteibacter\" sp. has been shown to naturally infect the ascomycetous endophyte \"Pestalotiopsis\" sp. isolated from \"Platycladus orientalis.\" The \"Luteibacter\" sp. influences the auxin and enzyme production within its host, which, in turn, may influence the effect the fungus has on its plant host\".\" Another interesting example of a bacterium living in symbiosis with a fungus is the fungus \"Mortierella.\" This soil-dwelling fungus lives in close association with a toxin-producing bacteria, \"Mycoavidus\", which helps the fungus defend against nematodes.\nIn 2024, researchers injected individual cells of the bacterium \"Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica\" into cells of the fungus \"Rhizopus microsporus\" and were able to propagate the pair of cells for ten rounds using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to select fungal cells containing the bacterium. They found that the fungus's DNA changed during the rounds of propagation. This was claimed to be the first time that endosymbiosis was artificially induced in a laboratory.\nVirus endosymbionts.\nThe Human Genome Project found several thousand endogenous retroviruses, endogenous viral elements in the genome that closely resemble and can be derived from retroviruses, organized into 24 families.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The exponential of a variable &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with the two notations used interchangeably. It is called \"exponential\" because its argument can be seen as an exponent to which a constant number \"e\" \u2248 2.718, the base, is raised. There are several other definitions of the exponential function, which are all equivalent although being of very different nature.\nThe exponential function converts sums to products: it maps the additive identity 0 to the multiplicative identity 1, and the exponential of a sum is equal to the product of separate exponentials, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Its inverse function, the natural logarithm, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, converts products to sums: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe exponential function is occasionally called the natural exponential function, matching the name \"natural logarithm\", for distinguishing it from some other functions that are also commonly called \"exponential functions\". These functions include the functions of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which is exponentiation with a fixed base &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. More generally, and especially in applications, functions of the general form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are also called exponential functions. They grow or decay exponentially in that the rate that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; changes when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is increased is \"proportional\" to the current value of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe exponential function can be generalized to accept complex numbers as arguments. This reveals relations between multiplication of complex numbers, rotations in the complex plane, and trigonometry. Euler's formula &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; expresses and summarizes these relations.\nThe exponential function can be even further generalized to accept other types of arguments, such as matrices and elements of Lie algebras.\nGraph.\nThe graph of formula_1 is upward-sloping, and increases faster than every power of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The graph always lies above the x-axis, but becomes arbitrarily close to it for large negative x; thus, the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. The equation formula_2 means that the slope of the tangent to the graph at each point is equal to its height (its y-coordinate) at that point.\nDefinitions and fundamental properties.\nThere are several equivalent definitions of the exponential function, although of very different nature.\nDifferential equation.\nOne of the simplest definitions is: The \"exponential function\" is the \"unique\" differentiable function that equals its derivative, and takes the value 1 for the value 0 of its variable.\nThis \"conceptual\" definition requires a uniqueness proof and an existence proof, but it allows an easy derivation of the main properties of the exponential function.\n\"Uniqueness: \"If &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are two functions satisfying the above definition, then the derivative of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is zero everywhere because of the quotient rule. It follows that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is constant; this constant is 1 since &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\n\"Existence\" is proved in each of the two following sections.\nInverse of natural logarithm.\n\"The exponential function is the inverse function of the natural logarithm.\" The inverse function theorem implies that the natural logarithm has an inverse function, that satisfies the above definition. This is a first proof of existence. Therefore, one has \nformula_3\nfor every real number formula_4 and every positive real number formula_5\nPower series.\n\"The exponential function is the sum of the power series\" \nformula_6\nwhere formula_7 is the factorial of n (the product of the n first positive integers). This series is absolutely convergent for every formula_4 per the ratio test. So, the derivative of the sum can be computed by term-by-term differentiation, and this shows that the sum of the series satisfies the above definition. This is a second existence proof, and shows, as a byproduct, that the exponential function is defined for every &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and is everywhere the sum of its Maclaurin series.\nFunctional equation.\n\"The exponential satisfies the functional equation:\"\nformula_9\nThis results from the uniqueness and the fact that the function\nformula_10 satisfies the above definition.\nIt can be proved that a function that satisfies this functional equation has the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if it is either continuous or monotonic. It is thus differentiable, and equals the exponential function if its derivative at 0 is 1.\nLimit of integer powers.\nThe exponential function is the limit, as the integer n goes to infinity,\nformula_11\nBy continuity of the logarithm, this can be proved by taking logarithms and proving \nformula_12\nfor example with Taylor's theorem.\nProperties.\n\"Reciprocal:\" The functional equation implies &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Therefore &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for every &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and \nformula_13\n\"Positiveness:\" &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for every real number &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This results from the intermediate value theorem, since &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and, if one would have &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for some &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, there would be an &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; between &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Since the exponential function equals its derivative, this implies that the exponential function is monotonically increasing.\n\"Extension of exponentiation to positive real bases:\" Let b be a positive real number. The exponential function and the natural logarithm being the inverse each of the other, one has formula_14 If n is an integer, the functional equation of the logarithm implies \nformula_15\nSince the right-most expression is defined if n is any real number, this allows defining &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for every positive real number b and every real number x:\nformula_16\nIn particular, if b is the Euler's number formula_17 one has formula_18 (inverse function) and thus formula_19 This shows the equivalence of the two notations for the exponential function.\nGeneral exponential functions.\nA function is commonly called \"an exponential function\"\u2014with an indefinite article\u2014if it has the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, that is, if it is obtained from exponentiation by fixing the base and letting the \"exponent\" vary.\nMore generally and especially in applied contexts, the term \"exponential function\" is commonly used for functions of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This may be motivated by the fact that, if the values of the function represent quantities, a change of measurement unit changes the value of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and so, it is nonsensical to impose &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThese most general exponential functions are the differentiable functions that satisfy the following equivalent characterizations.\nThe \"base\" of an exponential function is the \"base\" of the exponentiation that appears in it when written as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, namely &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The base is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in the second characterization, formula_26 in the third one, and formula_27 in the last one.\nIn applications.\nThe last characterization is important in empirical sciences, as allowing a direct experimental test whether a function is an exponential function.\nExponential growth or exponential decay\u2014where the variable change is proportional to the variable value\u2014are thus modeled with exponential functions. Examples are unlimited population growth leading to Malthusian catastrophe, continuously compounded interest, and radioactive decay.\nIf the modeling function has the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or, equivalently, is a solution of the differential equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the constant &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is called, depending on the context, the \"decay constant\", \"disintegration constant\", \"rate constant\", or \"transformation constant\".\nEquivalence proof.\nFor proving the equivalence of the above properties, one can proceed as follows.\nThe two first characterizations are equivalent, since, if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, one has \nformula_28\nThe basic properties of the exponential function (derivative and functional equation) implies immediately the third and the last condition.\nSuppose that the third condition is verified, and let &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; be the constant value of formula_29 Since formula_30 the quotient rule for derivation\nimplies that\nformula_31 and thus that there is a constant &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; such that formula_32\nIf the last condition is verified, let formula_33 which is independent of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Using &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, one gets\nformula_34\nTaking the limit when &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; tends to zero, one gets that the third condition is verified with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. It follows therefore that &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; for some &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; As a byproduct, one gets that \nformula_35\nis independent of both &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nCompound interest.\nThe earliest occurrence of the exponential function was in Jacob Bernoulli's study of compound interests in 1683.\nThis is this study that led Bernoulli to consider the number\nformula_36\nnow known as Euler's number and denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe exponential function is involved as follows in the computation of continuously compounded interests.\nIf a principal amount of 1 earns interest at an annual rate of \"x\" compounded monthly, then the interest earned each month is times the current value, so each month the total value is multiplied by (1 + ), and the value at the end of the year is (1 + )12. If instead interest is compounded daily, this becomes (1 + )365. Letting the number of time intervals per year grow without bound leads to the limit definition of the exponential function,\nformula_37\nfirst given by Leonhard Euler.\nDifferential equations.\nExponential functions occur very often in solutions of differential equations.\nThe exponential functions can be defined as solutions of differential equations. Indeed, the exponential function is a solution of the simplest possible differential equation, namely &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Every other exponential function, of the form &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, is a solution of the differential equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and every solution of this differential equation has this form.\nThe solutions of an equation of the form \nformula_38 \ninvolve exponential functions in a more sophisticated way, since they have the form\nformula_39 \nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is an arbitrary constant and the integral denotes any antiderivative of its argument.\nMore generally, the solutions of every linear differential equation with constant coefficients can be expressed in terms of exponential functions and, when they are not homogeneous, antiderivatives. This holds true also for systems of linear differential equations with constant coefficients.\nComplex exponential.\nThe exponential function can be naturally extended to a complex function, which is a function with the complex numbers as domain and codomain, such that its restriction to the reals is the above-defined exponential function, called \"real exponential function\" in what follows. This function is also called \"the exponential function\", and also denoted &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. For distinguishing the complex case from the real one, the extended function is also called complex exponential function or simply complex exponential.\nMost of the definitions of the exponential function can be used verbatim for definiting the complex exponential function, and the proof of their equivalence is the same as in the real case.\nThe complex exponential function can be defined in several equivalent ways that are the same as in the real case.\nThe \"complex exponential\" is the unique complex function that equals its complex derivative and takes the value &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for the argument &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;:\nformula_40\nThe \"complex exponential function\" is the sum of the series\nformula_41\nThis series is absolutely convergent for every complex number &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. So, the complex differential is an entire function.\nThe complex exponential function is the limit\nformula_42\nAs with the real exponential function (see above), the complex exponential satisfies the functional equation\nformula_43\nAmong complex functions, it is the unique solution which is holomorphic at the point &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and takes the derivative &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; there.\nThe complex logarithm is a right-inverse function of the complex exponential:\nformula_44\nHowever, since the complex logarithm is a multivalued function, one has\nformula_45\nand it is difficult to define the complex exponential from the complex logarithm. On the opposite, this is the complex logarithm that is often defined from the complex exponential.\nThe complex exponential has the following properties:\nformula_46\nand\nformula_47\nIt is periodic function of period &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; that is \nformula_48\nThis results from Euler's identity &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and the functional identity.\nThe complex conjugate of the complex exponential is \nformula_49\nIts modulus is\nformula_50\nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; denotes the real part of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nRelationship with trigonometry.\nComplex exponential and trigonometric functions are strongly related by Euler's formula:\nformula_51\nThis formula provides the decomposition of complex exponentials into real and imaginary parts:\nformula_52\nThe trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of complex exponentials:\nformula_53\nIn these formulas, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are commonly interpreted as real variables, but the formulas remain valid if the variables are interpreted as complex variables. These formulas may be used to define trigonometric functions of a complex variable.\nPlots.\nConsidering the complex exponential function as a function involving four real variables:\nformula_54\nthe graph of the exponential function is a two-dimensional surface curving through four dimensions.\nStarting with a color-coded portion of the formula_55 domain, the following are depictions of the graph as variously projected into two or three dimensions.\nThe second image shows how the domain complex plane is mapped into the range complex plane:\nThe third and fourth images show how the graph in the second image extends into one of the other two dimensions not shown in the second image.\nThe third image shows the graph extended along the real formula_4 axis. It shows the graph is a surface of revolution about the formula_4 axis of the graph of the real exponential function, producing a horn or funnel shape.\nThe fourth image shows the graph extended along the imaginary formula_58 axis. It shows that the graph's surface for positive and negative formula_58 values doesn't really meet along the negative real formula_57 axis, but instead forms a spiral surface about the formula_58 axis. Because its formula_58 values have been extended to \u00b12\"\u03c0\", this image also better depicts the 2\u03c0 periodicity in the imaginary formula_58 value.\nMatrices and Banach algebras.\nThe power series definition of the exponential function makes sense for square matrices (for which the function is called the matrix exponential) and more generally in any unital Banach algebra \"B\". In this setting, \"e\"0 = 1, and \"e\"\"x\" is invertible with inverse \"e\"\u2212\"x\" for any \"x\" in \"B\". If \"xy\" = \"yx\", then \"e\"\"x\" + \"y\" = \"e\"\"x\"\"e\"\"y\", but this identity can fail for noncommuting \"x\" and \"y\".\nSome alternative definitions lead to the same function. For instance, \"e\"\"x\" can be defined as\nformula_67\nOr \"e\"\"x\" can be defined as \"f\"\"x\"(1), where \"f\"\"x\" : R \u2192 \"B\" is the solution to the differential equation (\"t\") = \"x\u200a\n f\"\"x\"(\"t\"), with initial condition \"f\"\"x\"(0) = 1; it follows that \"f\"\"x\"(\"t\") = \"e\"\"tx\" for every t in R.\nLie algebras.\nGiven a Lie group \"G\" and its associated Lie algebra formula_68, the exponential map is a map formula_68 \u21a6 \"G\" satisfying similar properties. In fact, since R is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all positive real numbers under multiplication, the ordinary exponential function for real arguments is a special case of the Lie algebra situation. Similarly, since the Lie group GL(\"n\",R) of invertible \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices has as Lie algebra M(\"n\",R), the space of all \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices, the exponential function for square matrices is a special case of the Lie algebra exponential map.\nThe identity formula_70 can fail for Lie algebra elements \"x\" and \"y\" that do not commute; the Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula supplies the necessary correction terms.\nTranscendency.\nThe function \"e\"\"z\" is a transcendental function, which means that it is not a root of a polynomial over the ring of the rational fractions formula_71\nIf \"a\"1, ..., \"a\"\"n\" are distinct complex numbers, then \"e\"\"a\"1\"z\", ..., \"e\"\"a\"\"n\"\"z\" are linearly independent over formula_72, and hence \"e\"\"z\" is transcendental over formula_72.\nComputation.\nThe Taylor series definition above is generally efficient for computing (an approximation of) formula_74. However, when computing near the argument formula_75, the result will be close to 1, and computing the value of the difference formula_76 with floating-point arithmetic may lead to the loss of (possibly all) significant figures, producing a large relative error, possibly even a meaningless result.\nFollowing a proposal by William Kahan, it may thus be useful to have a dedicated routine, often called codice_1, which computes \"ex\" \u2212 1 directly, bypassing computation of \"e\"\"x\". For example,\none may use the Taylor series:\nformula_77\nThis was first implemented in 1979 in the Hewlett-Packard HP-41C calculator, and provided by several calculators, operating systems (for example Berkeley UNIX 4.3BSD), computer algebra systems, and programming languages (for example C99).\nIn addition to base \"e\", the IEEE 754-2008 standard defines similar exponential functions near 0 for base 2 and 10: formula_78 and formula_79.\nA similar approach has been used for the logarithm; see log1p.\nAn identity in terms of the hyperbolic tangent,\nformula_80\ngives a high-precision value for small values of \"x\" on systems that do not implement expm1(\"x\").\nContinued fractions.\nThe exponential function can also be computed with continued fractions.\nA continued fraction for \"e\"\"x\" can be obtained via an identity of Euler:\nformula_81\nThe following generalized continued fraction for \"e\"\"z\", also due to Euler\nconverges more quickly:\nformula_82\nor, by applying the substitution \"z\" =:\nformula_83\nwith a special case for \"z\" = 2:\nformula_84\nThis formula also converges, though more slowly, for \"z\" &gt; 2. For example:\nformula_85\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Renowned as one of the greatest military commanders of his era, Prince Eugene also rose to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in Vienna, spending six decades in the service of three emperors.\nBorn in Paris, to the son of a French count and a niece of Cardinal Mazarin, Eugene was raised at the court of King Louis\u00a0XIV. Initially destined for the priesthood as the youngest son of a noble family, he chose to pursue a military career at 19. Due to his poor physique and possibly a scandal involving his mother, Louis\u00a0XIV denied him a commission in the French Royal Army and forbade him from enlisting elsewhere. Embittered, Eugene fled France and entered the service of Emperor Leopold\u00a0I, cousin and rival of Louis XIV, in whose service his elder brother Louis Julius had just fallen in battle.\nAt 20, Prince Eugene of Savoy distinguished himself during the Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683. Commanding troops at Budapest (1686) and Belgrade (1688), he became a field marshal by age 25. In the Nine Years' War, he fought alongside his distant cousin, the Duke of Savoy. As commander-in-chief in Hungary, Eugene's decisive victory at the Battle of Zenta (1697) ended the Ottoman threat for nearly 20 years. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714), he served Emperor Leopold\u00a0I, achieving victories in Italy and forming a crucial partnership with the Duke of Marlborough, securing wins at Blenheim (1704), Oudenaarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709). His success continued in Italy, notably at Turin (1706). Renewed Austro-Turkish conflicts saw Eugene triumph at Petrovaradin (1716) and Belgrade (1717), solidifying his legacy as one of Europe's greatest military commanders and securing peace in 1718.\nThroughout the late 1720s, Eugene's diplomatic skills secured powerful allies for the Emperor in dynastic struggles with the Bourbon powers. Physically and mentally fragile in his later years, Eugene saw less success as commander-in-chief during the War of the Polish Succession (1733\u20131735). Despite his opposition to the conflict, he loyally led a defensive campaign, preventing enemy invasion of Bavaria. During his peaceful years, Eugene accumulated a vast collection of art and literature and corresponded with contemporary artists, scientists, and philosophers. His architectural legacy includes Baroque palaces like the Belvedere in Vienna. He died on 21 April 1736, aged 72.\nEarly years (1663\u20131699).\nH\u00f4tel de Soissons.\nPrince Eugene was born at the H\u00f4tel de Soissons in Paris on 18 October 1663. His mother, Olympia Mancini, was one of Cardinal Mazarin's nieces whom the Cardinal had brought to Paris from Rome in 1647 to further his (and, to a lesser extent, their) ambitions. The Mancinis were raised at the Palais-Royal along with the young Louis\u00a0XIV, with whom Olympia formed an intimate relationship. Yet to her great disappointment, her chance to become queen passed by, and in 1657 she married Eugene Maurice, Count of Soissons, Count of Dreux and Prince of Savoy.\nTogether they had had five sons (Eugene being the youngest) and three daughters, but neither parent spent much time with the children: the father, a French general officer, spent much of his time away campaigning, while Olympia's passion for court intrigue meant the children received little attention from her. The King remained strongly attached to Olympia, so much so that many believed them to be lovers; but her scheming eventually led to her downfall. After falling out of favour at court, Olympia turned to Catherine Deshayes (known as \"La Voisin\"), and to the arts of black magic and astrology. It proved a fatal relationship. She became embroiled in the \"Affaire des poisons\"; suspicions abounded of her involvement in her husband's premature death in 1673, and even implicated her in a plot to kill the King himself. Whatever the truth, Olympia, rather than face trial, subsequently fled France for Brussels in January 1680, leaving Eugene in the care of his paternal grandmother, Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons, and of his paternal aunt, Louise Christine of Savoy, Princess of Baden consort to the heir apparent Ferdinand Maximilian, and mother of Prince Louis of Baden.\nFrom the age of ten, Eugene had been brought up for a career in the church, in line with expectations for the youngest son. Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans, known for her satirical letters and her hostility toward those who opposed the French crown, described him unfavourably, writing that he was \"never good looking\" and criticising his features. In the same retrospective commentary, she claimed he had lived a life of \"debauchery\" and associated with what she described as an \"effeminate\u201d circle\", including figures such as the Abb\u00e9 de Choisy. These remarks were made decades later, after Eugene had entered the service of France\u2019s principal enemy, the Habsburgs.\nIn February 1683, to the surprise of his family, the 19-year-old Eugene declared his intention of joining the army. Eugene applied directly to Louis\u00a0XIV for command of a company in French service, but the King who was said to dislike Eugene's appearance and who had shown no compassion for Olympia's children since her disgrace\u2014refused him out of hand. \"The request was modest, not so the petitioner\", he remarked. \"No one else ever presumed to stare me out so insolently.\" Whatever the case, Louis\u00a0XIV's choice would cost him dearly twenty years later, for it would be precisely Eugene, in collaboration with the Duke of Marlborough, who would defeat the French army at Blenheim, a decisive battle which checked French military supremacy and political power.\nDenied a military career in France, Eugene decided to seek service abroad. One of Eugene's brothers, Louis Julius, had entered Imperial service the previous year, but he had been immediately killed fighting the Ottoman Empire in 1683. As soon as news of his death reached Paris, Eugene decided to immediately travel to Austria in the hope of taking over his brother's command. It was not an unnatural decision: his first cousin, Louis of Baden, was already a leading general in the Imperial army, as was a more distant cousin, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. 13 days after his brother's death, on the night of 26 July 1683, Eugene left Paris and headed east. Some accounts state that Eugene travelled in disguise, reportedly dressed as a woman, and was accompanied by his cousin Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti. Years later, in his memoirs, Eugene recalled his early years in France:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some future historians, good or bad, will perhaps take the trouble to enter into the details of my youth, of which, I scarcely recollect anything. They will certainly speak of my mother; somewhat too intriguing indeed, driven from the court, exiled from Paris, and suspected, I believe, of sorcery, by people who were not, themselves, very great conjurors.\nThey will tell, how I was born in France and how I quitted it, my heart swelling with enmity against Louis\u00a0XIV who refused me a company of horse, because, said he, I was of too delicate a constitution; and an abbey, because he thought, (from I know not what evil discourse respecting me, or what false anecdotes current in the gallery of Versailles,) that I was more formed for pleasure than for piety. There is not a Huguenot, expelled by the revocation of the edict of Nantz who hated him more than I did. Therefore when Louvois, hearing of my departure, said, \"So much the better; he will never return into this country again,\"\u2014 I swore never to enter it but with arms in my hands. I HAVE KEPT MY WORD.I have penetrated into it on many sides, and it is not my fault that I have not gone further. But for the English, I had given law in the capital of the \"Grand Monarque\", and made his MAINTENON shut herself up in a convent for life.\u2014\u200a\nGreat Turkish War.\nBy May 1683, the Ottoman threat to Emperor Leopold\u00a0I's capital, Vienna, was very evident. The Grand Vizier, Kara Mustafa Pasha\u2014encouraged by Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly's Magyar rebellion\u2014had invaded Hungary with between 100,000 and 200,000 men; within two months approximately 90,000 were beneath Vienna's walls. With the 'Turks at the gates', the Emperor fled for the safe refuge of Passau up the Danube. It was at Leopold\u00a0I's camp that Eugene arrived in mid-August.\nAlthough Eugene was not of Austrian extraction, he did have Habsburg antecedents. His grandfather, Thomas Francis, founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy, was the son of Catherine Michaela of Spain\u2014a daughter of Philip II of Spain\u2014and the great-grandson of the Emperor Charles\u00a0V. But of more immediate consequence to Leopold\u00a0I was the fact that Eugene was a relative of Victor Amadeus\u00a0II, the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France. These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold\u00a0I), ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service. Though French was his favoured language, he communicated with Leopold\u00a0in Italian, as the Emperor (though he knew it perfectly) disliked French. But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something that helped him much in the military.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I will devote all my strength, all my courage, and if need be, my last drop of blood, to the service of your Imperial Majesty.\u2014\u200a\nEugene had no doubt as to where his new allegiance lay, and this loyalty was immediately put to the test. By September, the Imperial forces under the Duke of Lorraine, together with a powerful Polish army under King John\u00a0III Sobieski, were poised to strike the Sultan's army. On the morning of 12 September, the Christian forces drew up in line of battle on the south-eastern slopes of the Vienna Woods, looking down on the massed enemy camp. The day-long Battle of Vienna resulted in the lifting of the 60-day siege, and the Sultan's forces were routed. Serving under Baden, as a twenty-year-old volunteer, Eugene distinguished himself in the battle, earning commendation from Lorraine and the Emperor; he later received the nomination for the colonelcy and was awarded the Kufstein regiment of dragoons by Leopold\u00a0I.\nHoly League.\nIn March 1684, Leopold\u00a0I formed the Holy League with Poland and Venice to counter the Ottoman threat. For the next two years, Eugene continued to perform with distinction on campaign and establish himself as a dedicated, professional soldier; by the end of 1685, still only 22 years old, he was made a Major-General. Little is known of Eugene's life during these early campaigns. Contemporary observers make only passing comments of his actions, and his own surviving correspondence, largely to his cousin Victor Amadeus, are typically reticent about his own feelings and experiences. Nevertheless, it is clear that Baden was impressed with Eugene's qualities\u2014\"This young man will, with time, occupy the place of those whom the world regards as great leaders of armies.\"\nIn June 1686, the Duke of Lorraine besieged Buda (Budapest), the centre of Ottoman Hungary and the old royal capital. After resisting for 78 days, the city fell on 2 September, and Turkish resistance collapsed throughout the region as far away as Transylvania and Serbia. Further success followed in 1687, where, commanding a cavalry brigade, Eugene made an important contribution to the victory at the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs on 12 August. Such was the scale of their defeat that the Ottoman army mutinied\u2014a revolt which spread to Constantinople. The Grand Vizier, Sar\u0131 S\u00fcleyman Pasha, was executed and Sultan Mehmed IV, deposed. Once again, Eugene's courage earned him recognition from his superiors, who granted him the honour of personally conveying the news of victory to the Emperor in Vienna. For his services, Eugene was promoted to Lieutenant-General in November 1687. He was also gaining wider recognition. King Charles\u00a0II of Spain bestowed upon him the Order of the Golden Fleece, while his cousin, Victor Amadeus, provided him with money and two profitable abbeys in Piedmont. Eugene's military career suffered a temporary setback in 1688 when, on 6 September, the Prince suffered a severe wound to his knee by a musket ball during the Siege of Belgrade, and did not return to active service until January 1689.\nInterlude in the west: Nine Years' War.\nJust as Belgrade was falling to Imperial forces under Max Emmanuel in the east, French troops in the west were crossing the Rhine into the Holy Roman Empire. Louis\u00a0XIV had hoped that a show of force would lead to a quick resolution to his dynastic and territorial disputes with the princes of the Empire along his eastern border, but his intimidatory moves only strengthened German resolve, and in May 1689, Leopold\u00a0I and the Dutch signed an offensive compact aimed at repelling French aggression.\nThe Nine Years' War was professionally and personally frustrating for the prince. Initially fighting on the Rhine with Max Emmanuel\u2014receiving a slight head wound at the Siege of Mainz in 1689\u2014Eugene subsequently transferred himself to Piedmont after Victor Amadeus joined the Alliance against France in 1690. Promoted to general of cavalry, he arrived in Turin with his friend the Prince of Commercy; but it proved an inauspicious start. Against Eugene's advice, Amadeus insisted on engaging the French at Staffarda and suffered a serious defeat\u2014only Eugene's handling of the Savoyard cavalry in retreat saved his cousin from disaster. Eugene remained unimpressed with the men and their commanders throughout the war in Italy. \"The enemy would long ago have been beaten\", he wrote to Vienna, \"if everyone had done their duty.\" So contemptuous was he of the Imperial commander, Count Carafa, he threatened to leave Imperial service.\nIn Vienna, Eugene's attitude was dismissed as the arrogance of a young upstart, but so impressed was the Emperor by his passion for the Imperial cause, he promoted him to Field-Marshal in 1693. When Carafa's replacement, Count Caprara, was himself transferred in 1694, it seemed that Eugene's chance for command and decisive action had finally arrived. But Amadeus, doubtful of victory and now more fearful of Habsburg influence in Italy than he was of French, had begun secret dealings with Louis\u00a0XIV aimed at extricating himself from the war. By 1696, the deal was done, and Amadeus transferred his troops and his loyalty to the enemy. Eugene was never to fully trust his cousin again; although he continued to pay due reverence to the Duke as head of his family, their relationship would forever after remain strained.\nMilitary honours in Italy undoubtedly belonged to the French commander Marshal Catinat, but Eugene, the one Allied general determined on action and decisive results, did well to emerge from the Nine Years' War with an enhanced reputation. With the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick in September/October 1697, the desultory war in the west was finally brought to an inconclusive end, and Leopold\u00a0I could once again devote all his martial energies into defeating the Ottoman Turks in the east.\nBattle of Zenta.\nThe distractions of the war against Louis\u00a0XIV had enabled the Turks to recapture Belgrade in 1690. In August 1691, the Austrians, under Louis of Baden, regained the advantage by heavily defeating the Turks at the Battle of Slankamen on the Danube, securing Habsburg possession of Hungary and Transylvania. When Baden was transferred west to fight the French in 1692, his successors, first Caprara, then from 1696, Augustus the Strong, the Elector of Saxony, proved incapable of delivering the final blow. On the advice of the President of the Imperial War Council, Ernst R\u00fcdiger von Starhemberg, thirty-four-year old Eugene was offered supreme command of Imperial forces in April 1697. This was Eugene's first truly independent command\u2014no longer need he suffer under the excessively cautious generalship of Caprara and Carafa, or be thwarted by the deviations of Victor Amadeus. But on joining his army, he found it in a state of 'indescribable misery'. Confident and self-assured, the Prince of Savoy (ably assisted by Commercy and Guido Starhemberg) set about restoring order and discipline.\nLeopold\u00a0I had warned Eugene that \"he should act with extreme caution, forgo all risks and avoid engaging the enemy unless he has overwhelming strength and is practically certain of being completely victorious\", but when the Imperial commander learnt of Sultan Mustafa\u00a0II's march on Transylvania, Eugene abandoned all ideas of a defensive campaign and moved to intercept the Turks as they crossed the River Tisza at Zenta on 11 September 1697.\nIt was late in the day before the Imperial army struck. The Ottoman cavalry had already crossed the river so Eugene decided to attack immediately, arranging his men in a half-moon formation. The vigour of the assault wrought terror and confusion among the Turks, and by nightfall, the battle was won. For the loss of some 2,000 dead and wounded, Eugene had inflicted an overwhelming defeat upon the enemy with approximately 25,000 Turks killed\u2014including the Grand Vizier, Elmas Mehmed Pasha, the pashas of Adana, Anatolia, and Bosnia, plus more than thirty aghas of the Janissaries, sipahis, and silihdars, as well as seven horsetails (symbols of high authority), 100 pieces of heavy artillery, 423 banners, and the revered seal which the sultan always entrusted to the Grand Vizier on an important campaign, Eugene had annihilated the Ottoman army and brought to an end the War of the Holy League. Although the Ottomans lacked western organization and training, the Savoyard prince had revealed his tactical skill, his capacity for bold decision, and his ability to inspire his men to excel in battle against a dangerous foe.\nAfter a brief terror-raid into Ottoman Bosnia, culminating in the sack of Sarajevo, Eugene returned to Vienna in November to a triumphal reception. His victory at Zenta had turned him into a European hero, and with victory came reward. Land in Hungary, given him by the Emperor, yielded a good income, enabling the Prince to cultivate his newly acquired tastes in art and architecture (see below); but for all his newfound wealth and property, he was, nevertheless, without personal ties or family commitments. Of his four brothers, only one was still alive at this time. His fourth brother, Emmanuel, had died aged 14 in 1676; his third, Louis Julius (already mentioned) had died on active service in 1683, and his second brother, Philippe, died of smallpox in 1693. Eugene's remaining brother, Louis Thomas, ostracized for incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV, travelled Europe in search of a career, before arriving in Vienna in 1699. With Eugene's help, Louis found employment in the Imperial army, only to be killed in action against the French in 1702. Of Eugene's sisters, the youngest had died in childhood. The other two, Marie Jeanne-Baptiste and Louise Philiberte, led dissolute lives. Expelled from France, Marie joined her mother in Brussels, before eloping with a renegade priest to Geneva, living with him unhappily until her premature death in 1705. Of Louise, little is known after her early salacious life in Paris, but in due course, she lived for a time in a convent in Savoy before her death in 1726.\nThe Battle of Zenta proved to be the decisive victory in the long war against the Turks. With Leopold I's interests now focused on Spain and the imminent death of Charles II, the Emperor terminated the conflict with the Sultan; he signed the Treaty of Karlowitz on 26 January 1699.\nMiddle life (1700\u201320).\nWar of the Spanish Succession.\nWith the death of the infirm and childless Charles\u00a0II of Spain on 1 November 1700, the succession of the Spanish throne and subsequent control over her empire once again embroiled Europe in war\u2014the War of the Spanish Succession. On his deathbed Charles\u00a0II had bequeathed the entire Spanish inheritance to Louis\u00a0XIV's grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou. This threatened to unite the Spanish and French kingdoms under the House of Bourbon\u2014something unacceptable to England, the Dutch Republic, and Leopold\u00a0I, who had himself a claim to the Spanish throne. From the beginning, the Emperor had refused to accept the will of Charles\u00a0II, and he did not wait for England and the Dutch Republic to begin hostilities. Before a new Grand Alliance could be concluded Leopold\u00a0I prepared to send an expedition to seize the Spanish lands in Italy.\nEugene crossed the Alps with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701. After a series of brilliant manoeuvres the Imperial commander defeated Catinat at the Battle of Carpi on 9 July. \"I have warned you that you are dealing with an enterprising young prince\", wrote Louis\u00a0XIV to his commander, \"he does not tie himself down to the rules of war.\" On 1 September Eugene defeated Catinat's successor, Marshal Villeroi, at the Battle of Chiari, in a clash as destructive as any in the Italian theatre. But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts\u2014the enemy in the field and the government in Vienna.\nStarved of supplies, money, and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy. During a daring raid on Cremona on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief. Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the Duke of Vend\u00f4me, whose talents far exceeded Villeroi's, became the theatre's new commander. Villeroi's capture caused a sensation in Europe and had a galvanizing effect on English public opinion. \"The surprise at Cremona\", wrote the diarist John Evelyn, \"... was the great discourse of this week\"; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a 'lucky hit'. The resulting Battle of Luzzara on 15 August proved inconclusive. Although Eugene's forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vend\u00f4me trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps. With his army routing away, and personally grieving for his long-standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703.\nPresident of the Imperial War Council.\nEugene's European reputation was growing (Cremona and Luzzara had been celebrated as victories throughout the Allied capitals), yet because of the condition and morale of his troops the 1702 campaign had not been a success. Austria itself was now facing the direct threat of invasion from across the border in Bavaria where the state's Elector, Maximilian Emanuel, had declared for the Bourbons in August the previous year. Meanwhile, in Hungary a small-scale revolt had broken out in May and was fast gaining momentum. With the monarchy at the point of complete financial breakdown Leopold I was at last persuaded to change the government. At the end of June 1703 Gundaker Starhemberg replaced Gotthard Salaburg as President of the Treasury, and Prince Eugene succeeded Henry Mansfeld as the new President of the Imperial War Council (\"Hofkriegsratspr\u00e4sident\").\nAs head of the war council Eugene was now part of the Emperor's inner circle, and the first president since Raimondo Montecuccoli to remain an active commander. Immediate steps were taken to improve efficiency within the army: encouragement and, where possible, money, was sent to the commanders in the field; promotion and honours were distributed according to service rather than influence; and discipline improved. But the Austrian monarchy faced severe peril on several fronts in 1703: by June the Duke of Villars had reinforced the Elector of Bavaria on the Danube thus posing a direct threat to Vienna, while Vend\u00f4me remained at the head of a large army in northern Italy opposing Guido Starhemberg's weak Imperial force. Of equal alarm was Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's revolt which, by the end of the year, had reached as far as Moravia and Lower Austria.\nBlenheim.\nDissension between Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had prevented an assault on Vienna in 1703, but in the Courts of Versailles and Madrid, ministers confidently anticipated the city's fall. The Imperial ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, had pressed for Anglo-Dutch assistance on the Danube as early as February 1703, but the crisis in southern Europe seemed remote from the Court of St. James's where colonial and commercial considerations were more to the fore of men's minds. Only a handful of statesmen in England or the Dutch Republic realized the true implications of Austria's peril; foremost among these was the English Captain-General, the Duke of Marlborough.\nBy early 1704 Marlborough had resolved to march south and rescue the situation in southern Germany and on the Danube, personally requesting the presence of Eugene on campaign so as to have \"a supporter of his zeal and experience\". The Allied commanders met for the first time at the small village of Mundelsheim on 10 June, and immediately formed a close rapport\u2014the two men becoming, in the words of Thomas Lediard, 'Twin constellations in glory'. This professional and personal bond ensured mutual support on the battlefield, enabling many successes during the Spanish Succession war. The first of these victories, and the most celebrated, came on 13 August 1704 at the Battle of Blenheim. Eugene commanded the right wing of the Allied army, holding the Elector of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's superior forces, while Marlborough broke through the Marshal Tallard's center, inflicting over 30,000 casualties. The battle proved decisive: Vienna was saved and Bavaria was knocked out of the war. Both Allied commanders were full of praise for each other's performance. Eugene's holding operation, and his pressure for action leading up to the battle, proved crucial for the Allied success.\nIn Europe Blenheim is regarded as much a victory for Eugene as it is for Marlborough, a sentiment echoed by Sir Winston Churchill (Marlborough's descendant and biographer), who pays tribute to \"the glory of Prince Eugene, whose fire and spirit had exhorted the wonderful exertions of his troops.\" France now faced the real danger of invasion, but Leopold I in Vienna was still under severe strain: R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's revolt was a major threat; and Guido Starhemberg and Victor Amadeus (who had once again switched loyalties and rejoined the Grand Alliance in 1703) had been unable to halt the French under Vend\u00f4me in northern Italy. Only Amadeus' capital, Turin, held on.\nTurin and Toulon.\nEugene returned to Italy in April 1705, but his attempts to move west towards Turin were thwarted by Vend\u00f4me's skilful manoeuvres. Lacking boats and bridging materials, and with desertion and sickness rife within his army, the outnumbered Imperial commander was helpless. Leopold I's assurances of money and men had proved illusory, but desperate appeals from Amadeus and criticism from Vienna goaded the Prince into action, resulting in the Imperialists' bloody defeat at the Battle of Cassano on 16 August. Following Leopold I's death and the accession of Joseph I to the Imperial throne in May 1705, Eugene began to receive the personal backing he desired. Joseph I proved to be a strong supporter of Eugene's supremacy in military affairs; he was the most effective emperor the Prince served and the one he was happiest under. Promising support, Joseph I persuaded Eugene to return to Italy and restore Habsburg honour.\nThe Imperial commander arrived in theatre in mid-April 1706, just in time to organize an orderly retreat of what was left of Count Reventlow's inferior army following his defeat by Vend\u00f4me at the Battle of Calcinato on 19 April. Vend\u00f4me now prepared to defend the lines along the River Adige, determined to keep Eugene cooped to the east while the Marquis of La Feuillade threatened Turin. Feigning attacks along the Adige, Eugene descended south across the river Po in mid-July, outmanoeuvring the French commander and gaining a favourable position from which he could at last move west towards Piedmont and relieve Savoy's capital.\nEvents elsewhere now had major consequences for the war in Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis\u00a0XIV recalled Vend\u00f4me north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was \"now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success (in Italy) ... for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war.\" The Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vend\u00f4me, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies\u2014\"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;\" wrote Marlborough, \"for I not only esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days.\"\nThe Imperial victory in Italy marked the beginning of Austrian rule in Lombardy, and earned Eugene the Governorship of Milan. But the following year was to prove a disappointment for the Prince and the Grand Alliance as a whole. The Emperor and Eugene (whose main goal after Turin was to take Naples and Sicily from Philip duc d'Anjou's supporters), reluctantly agreed to Marlborough's plan for an attack on Toulon\u2014the seat of French naval power in the Mediterranean. Disunion between the Allied commanders\u2014Victor Amadeus, Eugene, and the English Admiral Cloudesley Shovell\u2014doomed the Toulon enterprise to failure. Although Eugene favoured some sort of attack on France's south-eastern border it was clear he felt the expedition impractical, and showed none of the \"alacrity which he had displayed on other occasions.\" Substantial French reinforcements finally brought an end to the venture, and on 22 August 1707, the Imperial army began its retirement. The subsequent capture of Susa could not compensate for the total collapse of the Toulon expedition and with it any hope of an Allied war-winning blow that year.\nOudenarde and Malplaquet.\nAt the beginning of 1708 Eugene successfully evaded calls for him to take charge in Spain (in the end Guido Starhemberg was sent), thus enabling him to take command of the Imperial army on the Moselle and once again unite with Marlborough in the Spanish Netherlands. Eugene (without his army) arrived at the Allied camp at Assche, west of Brussels, in early July, providing a welcome boost to morale after the early defection of Bruges and Ghent to the French. \" ... our affairs improved through God's support and Eugene's aid\", wrote the Prussian General Natzmer, \"whose timely arrival raised the spirits of the army again and consoled us.\" Heartened by the Prince's confidence, the Allied commanders devised a bold plan to engage the French army under Vend\u00f4me and the Duke of Burgundy. On 10 July the Anglo-Dutch army made a forced march to surprise the French, reaching the River Scheldt just as the enemy was crossing to the north. The ensuing battle on 11 July\u2014more a contact action rather than a set-piece engagement\u2014ended in a resounding success for the Allies, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders. While Marlborough remained in overall command, Eugene had led the crucial right flank and centre. Once again the Allied commanders had co-operated remarkably well. \"Prince Eugene and I\", wrote the Duke, \"shall never differ about our share of the laurels.\"\nMarlborough now favoured a bold advance along the coast to bypass the major French fortresses, followed by a march on Paris. But fearful of unprotected supply-lines, the Dutch and Eugene favoured a more cautious approach. Marlborough acquiesced and resolved upon the siege of Vauban's great fortress, Lille. While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town which surrendered on 22 October but Marshal Boufflers did not yield the citadel until 10 December. Yet for all the difficulties of the siege (Eugene was badly wounded above his left eye by a musket ball, and even survived an attempt to poison him), the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success. The French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands. \"He who has not seen this\", wrote Eugene, \"has seen nothing.\"\nThe recent defeats, together with the severe winter of 1708\u201309, had caused extreme famine and privation in France. Louis\u00a0XIV was close to accepting Allied terms, but the conditions demanded by the leading Allied negotiators, Anthonie Heinsius, Charles Townshend, Marlborough, and Eugene\u2014principally that Louis\u00a0XIV should use his own troops to force Philip\u00a0V off the Spanish throne\u2014proved unacceptable to the French. Neither Eugene nor Marlborough had objected to the Allied demands at the time, but neither wanted the war with France to continue, and would have preferred further talks to deal with the Spanish issue. But the French King offered no further proposals. Lamenting the collapse of the negotiations, and aware of the vagaries of war, Eugene wrote to the Emperor in mid-June 1709. \"There can be no doubt that the next battle will be the biggest and bloodiest that has yet been fought.\"\nAfter the fall of Tournai on 3 September (itself a major undertaking), the Allied generals turned their attention towards Mons. Marshal Villars, recently joined by Boufflers, moved his army south-west of the town and began to fortify his position. Marlborough and Eugene favoured an engagement before Villars could render his position impregnable; but they also agreed to wait for reinforcements from Tournai which did not arrive until the following night, thus giving the French further opportunity to prepare their defences. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the attack, the Allied generals did not shrink from their original determination. The subsequent Battle of Malplaquet, fought on 11 September 1709, was the bloodiest engagement of the war. On the left flank, the Prince of Orange led his Dutch infantry in desperate charges only to have it cut to pieces; on the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely. But sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, thus enabling Marlborough to break through and claim victory. Villars was unable to save Mons, which subsequently capitulated on 21 October, but his resolute defence at Malplaquet\u2014inflicting up to 25% casualties on the Allies\u2014may have saved France from destruction.\nFinal campaigning: Eugene alone.\nIn August 1709 Eugene's chief political opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince Salm, retired as court chamberlain. Eugene and Wratislaw were now the undisputed leaders of the Austrian government: all major departments of state were in their hands or those of their political allies. Another attempt at a negotiated settlement at Geertruidenberg in April 1710 failed, largely because the English Whigs still felt strong enough to refuse concessions, while Louis\u00a0XIV saw little reason to accept what he had refused the previous year. Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at the breakdown of the talks. There was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured Douai. This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France's protective ring of fortresses. Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together.\nFollowing the death of Joseph I on 17 April 1711 his brother, Charles, the pretender to the Spanish throne, became emperor. In England the new Tory government (the 'peace party' who had deposed the Whigs in October 1710) declared their unwillingness to see Charles\u00a0VI become Emperor as well as King of Spain, and had already begun secret negotiations with the French. In January 1712 Eugene arrived in England hoping to divert the government away from its peace policy, but despite the social success the visit was a political failure: Queen Anne and her ministers remained determined to end the war regardless of the Allies. Eugene had also arrived too late to save Marlborough who, seen by the Tories as the main obstacle to peace, had already been dismissed on charges of embezzlement. Elsewhere the Austrians had made some progress\u2014the Hungarian revolt had finally came to end. Although Eugene would have preferred to crush the rebels the Emperor had offered lenient conditions, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Szatm\u00e1r on 30 April 1711.\nHoping to influence public opinion in England and force the French into making substantial concessions, Eugene prepared for a major campaign. But on 21 May 1712\u2014when the Tories felt they had secured favourable terms with their unilateral talks with the French\u2014the Duke of Ormonde (Marlborough's successor) received the so-called 'restraining orders', forbidding him to take part in any military action. Eugene took the fortress of Le Quesnoy in early July, before besieging Landrecies, but Villars, taking advantage of Allied disunity, outmanoeuvred Eugene and defeated the Earl of Albermarle's Dutch garrison at the Battle of Denain on 24 July. The French followed the victory by seizing the Allies' main supply magazine at Marchiennes, before reversing their earlier losses at Douai, Le Quesnoy and Bouchain. In one summer the whole forward Allied position laboriously built up over the years to act as the springboard into France had been precipitously abandoned.\nWith the death in December of his friend and close political ally, Count Wratislaw, Eugene became undisputed 'first minister' in Vienna. His position was built on his military successes, but his actual power was expressed through his role as president of the war council, and as \"de facto\" president of the conference which dealt with foreign policy. In this position of influence Eugene took the lead in pressing Charles\u00a0VI towards peace. The government had come to accept that further war in the Netherlands or Spain was impossible without the aid of the Maritime Powers; yet the Emperor, still hoping that somehow he could place himself on the throne in Spain, refused to make peace at the Utrecht conference along with the other Allies. Reluctantly, Eugene prepared for another campaign, but lacking troops, finance, and supplies his prospects in 1713 were poor. Villars, with superior numbers, was able to keep Eugene guessing as to his true intent. Through successful feints and stratagems Landau fell to the French commander in August, followed in November by Freiburg. Eugene was reluctant to carry on the war, and wrote to the Emperor in June that a bad peace would be better than being 'ruined equally by friend and foe'. With Austrian finances exhausted and the German states reluctant to continue the war, Charles\u00a0VI was compelled to enter into negotiations. Eugene and Villars (who had been old friends since the Turkish campaigns of the 1680s) initiated talks on 26 November. Eugene proved an astute and determined negotiator, and gained favourable terms by the Treaty of Rastatt signed on 7 March 1714 and the Treaty of Baden signed on 7 September 1714. Despite the failed campaign in 1713 the Prince was able to declare that, \"in spite of the military superiority of our enemies and the defection of our Allies, the conditions of peace will be more advantageous and more glorious than those we would have obtained at Utrecht.\"\nAustro-Turkish War.\nEugene's main reason for desiring peace in the west was the growing danger posed by the Turks in the east. Turkish military ambitions had revived after 1711 when they had mauled Peter the Great's army on the River Pruth (Pruth River Campaign): in December 1714 Sultan Ahmed III's forces attacked the Venetians in the Kingdom of the Morea. To Vienna it was clear that the Turks intended to attack Hungary and undo the whole Karlowitz settlement of 1699. After the Sublime Porte rejected an offer of mediation in April 1716, Charles\u00a0VI despatched Eugene to Hungary to lead his relatively small but professional army. Of all Eugene's wars this was the one in which he exercised most direct control; it was also a war which, for the most part, Austria fought and won on her own. Eugene left Vienna in early June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000 and 90,000 men. By early August 1716 the Ottoman Turks, some 200,000 men under the sultan's son-in-law, the Grand Vizier Damat Ali Pasha, were marching from Belgrade towards Eugene's position on the north bank of the Danube west of the fortress of Petrovaradin. The Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no chance to do so. After resisting calls for caution and forgoing a council of war, the Prince decided to attack immediately on the morning of 5 August with approximately 70,000 men. The Turkish janissaries had some initial success, but after an Imperial cavalry attack on their flank, Ali Pasha's forces fell into confusion. Although the Imperials lost almost 5,000 dead or wounded, the Turks, who retreated in disorder to Belgrade, seem to have lost double that amount, including the Grand Vizier himself who had entered the m\u00eal\u00e9e and subsequently died of his wounds.\nEugene proceeded to take the Banat fortress of Temeswar in mid-October 1716 (thus ending 164 years of Turkish rule), before turning his attention to the next campaign and to what he considered the main goal of the war, Belgrade. Situated at the confluence of the Rivers Danube and Sava, Belgrade held a garrison of 30,000 men under Serasker Mustapha Pasha.\nImperial troops besieged the place in mid-June 1717, and by the end of July large parts of the city had been destroyed by artillery fire. By the first days of August, however, a huge Turkish field army (150,000\u2013200,000 strong), under the new Grand Vizier Hac\u0131 Halil Pasha had arrived on the plateau east of the city to relieve the garrison. News spread through Europe of Eugene's imminent destruction; but he had no intention of lifting the siege. With his men suffering from dysentery, and continuous bombardment from the plateau, Eugene, aware that a decisive victory alone could extricate his army, decided to attack the relief force. On the morning of 16 August, 40,000 Imperial troops marched through the fog, caught the Turks unaware, and routed Halil Pasha's army; a week later Belgrade surrendered, effectively bringing an end to the war. The victory was the crowning point of Eugene's military career and had confirmed him as the leading European general. His ability to snatch victory at the moment of defeat had shown the prince at his best.\nThe principal objectives of the war had been achieved: the task Eugene had begun at Zenta was complete, and the Karlowitz settlement secured. By the terms of the Treaty of Passarowitz, signed on 21 July 1718, the Turks surrendered the Banat of Temeswar, along with Belgrade and most of Serbia, although they regained the Morea from the Venetians. The war had dispelled the immediate Turkish threat to Hungary and was a triumph for Austria and for Eugene personally.\nQuadruple Alliance.\nWhile Eugene fought the Turks in the east, unresolved issues following the Utrecht/Rastatt settlements led to hostilities between the Emperor and Philip\u00a0V of Spain in the west. Charles\u00a0VI had refused to recognise Philip\u00a0V as King of Spain, a title which he himself claimed; in return, Philip\u00a0V had refused to renounce his claims to Naples, Milan, and the Netherlands, all of which had transferred to the House of Austria following the Spanish Succession war. Philip\u00a0V was roused by his influential wife, Elisabeth Farnese, daughter of the Hereditary Prince of Parma, who personally held dynastic claims in the name of her son, Charles, to the duchies of Tuscany, Parma and Piacenza. Representatives from a newly formed Anglo-French alliance\u2014who were desirous of European peace for their own dynastic securities and trade opportunities\u2014called on both parties to recognise each other's sovereignty. Yet Philip\u00a0V remained intractable, and on 22 August 1717 his chief minister, Alberoni, effected the invasion of Austrian Sardinia in what seemed like the beginning of the reconquest of Spain's former Italian empire.\nEugene returned to Vienna from his recent victory at Belgrade (before the conclusion of the Turkish war) determined to prevent an escalation of the conflict, complaining that, \"two wars cannot be waged with one army\"; only reluctantly did the Prince release some troops from the Balkans for the Italian campaign. Rejecting all diplomatic overtures Philip\u00a0V unleashed another assault in June 1718, this time against Savoyard Sicily as a preliminary to attacking the Italian mainland. Realizing that only the British fleet could prevent further Spanish landings, and that pro-Spanish groups in France might push the regent, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, into war against Austria, Charles\u00a0VI had no option but to sign the Quadruple Alliance on 2 August 1718, and formally renounce his claim to Spain. Despite the Spanish fleet's destruction off Cape Passaro, Philip\u00a0V and Elisabeth remained resolute, and rejected the treaty.\nAlthough Eugene could have gone south after the conclusion of the Turkish war, he chose instead to conduct operations from Vienna; but Austria's military effort in Sicily proved derisory, and Eugene's chosen commanders, Zum Jungen, and later Count Mercy, performed poorly. It was only from pressure exerted by the French army advancing into the Basque provinces of northern Spain in April 1719, and the British Navy's attacks on the Spanish fleet and shipping, that compelled Philip\u00a0V and Elisabeth to dismiss Alberoni and join the Quadruple Alliance on 25 January 1720. Nevertheless, the Spanish attacks had strained Charles\u00a0VI's government, causing tension between the Emperor and his Spanish Council on the one hand, and the conference, headed by Eugene, on the other. Despite Charles\u00a0VI's own personal ambitions in the Mediterranean it was clear to the Emperor that Eugene had put the safeguarding of his conquests in Hungary before everything else, and that military failure in Sicily also had to rest on Eugene. Consequently, the Prince's influence over the Emperor declined considerably.\nLater life (1721\u201336).\nGovernor-General of the Austrian Netherlands.\nEugene had become governor of the Austrian Netherlands\u2014in June 1716, but he was an absent ruler, directing policy from Vienna through his chosen representative the Marquis of Pri\u00e9. Pri\u00e9 proved unpopular with the local population and the guilds who, following the Barrier Treaty of 1715, were obliged to meet the financial demands of the administration and the Dutch barrier garrisons; with Eugene's backing and encouragement, civil disturbances in Antwerp and Brussels were forcibly suppressed. After displeasing the Emperor over his initial opposition to the formation of the Ostend Company, Pri\u00e9 also lost the support of the native nobility from within his own council of state in Brussels, particularly from the Marquis de M\u00e9rode-Westerloo. One of Eugene's former favourites, General Bonneval, also joined the noblemen in opposition to Pri\u00e9, further undermining the Prince. When Pri\u00e9's position became untenable, Eugene felt compelled to resign his post as governor of the Austrian Netherlands on 16 November 1724. As compensation, Charles\u00a0VI conferred on him the honorary position as vicar-general of Italy, worth 140,000 gulden a year, and an estate at Siebenbrunn in Lower Austria said to be worth double that amount. But his resignation distressed him, and to compound his concerns Eugene caught a severe bout of influenza that Christmas, marking the beginning of permanent bronchitis and acute infections every winter for the remaining twelve years of his life.\n'Cold war'.\nThe 1720s saw rapidly changing alliances between the European powers and almost constant diplomatic confrontation, largely over unsolved issues regarding the Quadruple Alliance. The Emperor and the Spanish king continued to use each other's titles, and Charles\u00a0VI still refused to remove the remaining legal obstacles to Don Charles' eventual succession to the duchies of Parma and Tuscany. Yet in a surprise move Spain and Austria moved closer with the signing of the Treaty of Vienna in April/May 1725. In response Britain, France, and Prussia joined in the Alliance of Hanover to counter the danger to Europe of an Austro-Spanish hegemony. For the next three years there was the continual threat of war between the Hanover Treaty powers and the Austro-Spanish bloc.\nFrom 1726, Eugene gradually began to regain his political influence. With his many contacts throughout Europe Eugene, backed by Gundaker Starhemberg and Count Sch\u00f6nborn, the Imperial vice-chancellor, managed to secure powerful allies and strengthen the Emperor's position\u2014his skill in managing the vast secret diplomatic network over the coming years was the main reason why Charles\u00a0VI once again came to depend upon him. In August 1726 Russia acceded to the Austro-Spanish alliance, and in October Frederick William I of Prussia followed suit by defecting from the Allies with the signing of a mutual defensive treaty with the Emperor.\nDespite the conclusion of the brief Anglo-Spanish conflict, manoeuvring between the European powers persisted throughout 1727\u201328. In 1729 Elisabeth Farnese abandoned the Austro-Spanish alliance. Realizing that Charles\u00a0VI could not be drawn into the marriage pact she wanted, Elisabeth concluded that the best way to secure her son's succession to Parma and Tuscany now lay with Britain and France. To Eugene it was 'an event that which is seldom to be found in history'. Following the Prince's determined lead to resist all pressure, Charles\u00a0VI sent troops into Italy to prevent the entry of Spanish garrisons into the contested duchies. By the beginning of 1730 Eugene, who had remained bellicose throughout the whole period, was again in control of Austrian policy.\nIn Britain there now emerged a new political re-alignment as the Anglo-French \"entente\" became increasingly defunct. Believing that a resurgent France now posed the greatest danger to their security, Robert Walpole led British ministers in moving to reform the Anglo-Austrian Alliance, leading to the signing of the Second Treaty of Vienna on 16 March 1731. Eugene had been the Austrian minister most responsible for the alliance, believing once again it would provide security against France and Spain. The treaty compelled Charles\u00a0VI to sacrifice the Ostend Company and accept, unequivocally, the accession of Don Charles to Parma and Tuscany. In return King George\u00a0II as King of Great Britain and Elector of Electorate of Hanover guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction, the device to secure the rights of the Emperor's daughter, Maria Theresa, to the entire Habsburg inheritance. It was largely through Eugene's diplomacy that in January 1732 the Imperial diet also guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction which, together with the Treaties with Britain, Russia, and Prussia, marked the culmination of the Prince's diplomacy. But the Treaty of Vienna had infuriated the court of King Louis XV: the French had been ignored and the Pragmatic Sanction guaranteed, thus increasing Habsburg influence and confirming Austria's vast territorial size. The Emperor also intended Maria Theresa to marry Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine which would present an unacceptable threat on France's border. By the beginning of 1733 the French army was ready for war: all that was needed was the excuse.\nWar of the Polish Succession.\nIn 1733 the Polish King and Elector of Saxony, Augustus the Strong, died. There were two candidates for his successor: first, Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, the father-in-law of Louis XV; second, the Elector of Saxony's son, Augustus, supported by Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The Polish succession had afforded Louis XV's chief minister, Fleury, the opportunity to attack Austria and take Lorraine from Francis Stephen. To gain Spanish support France backed the succession of Elisabeth Farnese's sons to further Italian lands.\nEugene entered the War of the Polish Succession as President of the Imperial War Council and commander-in-chief of the army, but he was severely handicapped by the quality of his troops and the shortage of funds; now in his seventies, the Prince was also burdened by rapidly declining physical and mental powers. France declared war on Austria on 10 October 1733, but without the funds from the Maritime Powers \u2013 who, despite the Vienna treaty, remained neutral throughout the war \u2013 Austria could not hire the necessary troops to wage an offensive campaign. \"The danger to the monarchy\", wrote Eugene to the Emperor in October, \"cannot be exaggerated\". By the end of the year French forces had seized Lorraine and Milan; by early 1734 Spanish troops had taken Sicily.\nEugene took command on the Rhine in April 1734, but vastly outnumbered he was forced onto the defensive. In June Eugene set out to relieve Philippsburg, yet his former drive and energy was now gone. Accompanying Eugene was a young prince Frederick of Prussia, sent by his father to learn the art of war. Frederick gained considerable knowledge from Eugene, recalling in later life his great debt to his Austrian mentor, but the Prussian prince was aghast at Eugene's condition, writing later, \"his body was still there but his soul had gone.\" Eugene conducted another cautious campaign in 1735, once again pursuing a sensible defensive strategy on limited resources; but his short-term memory was by now practically non-existent, and his political influence disappeared completely\u2014Gundaker Starhemberg and Johann Christoph von Bartenstein now dominated the conference in his place. Fortunately for Charles\u00a0VI, Fleury was determined to limit the scope of the war, and in October 1735 he granted generous peace preliminaries to the Emperor.\nLater years and death.\nEugene returned to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was too ill to attend. After playing cards at Countess Batthy\u00e1ny's on the evening of 20 April until nine in the evening, he returned home to the Stadtpalais, his attendant offered him to take his prescribed medicine which Eugene declined.\nWhen his servants arrived to wake him the next morning on 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after passing away quietly during the night. It has been said that on the same morning he was discovered dead, the great lion in his menagerie was also found dead.\nEugene's heart was buried with the ashes of his ancestors in Turin, in the Basilica of Superga. His remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where his embalmed body was buried in the \"Kreuzkapelle\". It is said that the emperor himself attended as a mourner without anybody's knowledge.\nThe Prince's niece Maria Anna Victoria, whom he had never met, inherited Eugene's immense possessions. Within a few years she sold off the palaces, the country estates and the art collection of a man who had become one of the wealthiest in Europe, after arriving in Vienna as a refugee with empty pockets.\nPersonal life.\nBeing an Italian by descent, a Frenchman by birth, and a German by adoption, Prince Eugene signed his name using the trilingual form \u201cEugenio von Savoye\u201d (Italian: Eugenio, German: von, French: Savoye).\nEugene never married. He was reported to have said that a woman was a hindrance in war and that a soldier should not marry. Some contemporaries attributed his defeat at the 1712 Battle of Denain to the presence of an Italian lady accompanying him on campaign, a claim repeated by Voltaire, who said he had met the woman in question. He was sometimes described as \"Mars without Venus\" for his lifelong bachelorhood. Winston Churchill, in his biography of the John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, wrote that Eugene was \"a bachelor, almost a misogynist, disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosity against Louis\u00a0XIV\".\nFor the final two decades of his life, Eugene was closely associated with Hungarian Countess Eleonore Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann, the widowed daughter of Theodor von Strattman, a former . Although Eugene left no personal papers beyond official correspondence, he and Eleonore were constant companions. They met almost daily for dinner, receptions, and card games, and were widely assumed by diplomats to be lovers. One earlier reference exists to another woman, Countess Maria Th\u00fcrheim, but there is no further evidence of a relationship. The precise beginning of Eugene and Eleonore's relationship is unknown, though their estates in Hungary near Rechnitz Castle made them neighbours after the Battle of Zenta. In diplomatic correspondence of the early 18th century, she was referred to as \u201cEugen\u2019s Egeria\u201d and eventually as his constant companion. When asked if she and the prince would marry, Eleonore reportedly replied, \u201cI love him too well for that, I would rather have a bad reputation than deprive him of his.\u201d\nAllegations concerning Eugene\u2019s private life circulated in later court correspondence, most notably from Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans, a prolific letter-writer and wife of Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, a noted court figure known for male companions and brother to Louis\u00a0XIV. In her correspondence, she alleged that Eugene had engaged in \u201cyouthful indiscretions\u201d with lackeys and pages, and claimed that he was denied an ecclesiastical benefice due to \u201cdepravity\u201d. Eugene\u2019s biographer Helmut Oehler attributed these comments to her personal hostility. Eugene himself mocked the claims in his memoirs as \u201cthe invented anecdotes from the gallery of Versailles\u201d. These allegations were made many years later, after Eugene had inflicted military defeats on her brother-in-law Louis XIV. No further contemporary accusations regarding Eugene\u2019s private life were recorded. According to historians Kramar and Mayrhofer, reflecting the attitudes of a time when such allegations were framed as discrediting or defamatory, \u201cthere was never again an observer or a malicious diplomat who accused Eugene of homosexual inclinations\u201d.\nEugene\u2019s high standing at court also attracted criticism. Guido Starhemberg, a former subordinate, became a vocal critic. Montesquieu described him as Eugene\u2019s chief rival at the Habsburg court. Another rival, Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, who had served under Eugene during the War of the Spanish Succession, criticised him in a letter, writing: He \"has no idea but to fight whenever the opportunity offers\". and adding that he \u201cloves .\u201d Eugene\u2019s principal biographer, Max Braubach, interpreted the phrase as referring to general sexual indulgence, such as fornication or whoring. As Governor-General of the Austrian Netherlands, Eugene was linked to an exclusive brothel on Amsterdam\u2019s Prinsengracht. The establishment, operated by a woman known as Madame Therese, was reportedly frequented by Eugene, who is said to have once brought the English consul as a guest. A drawing by Cornelis Troost, held by the Rijksmuseum, depicts Eugene inspecting a line-up of prostitutes \u201cas he did his own troops\u201d. According to the museum, the image was based on a contemporary anecdote. \nEugene\u2019s closest personal relationships also shaped his legacy. He was especially close to the papal nuncio, Domenico Silvio Passionei, who later delivered his funeral oration. Without a direct family of his own, Eugene arranged the marriage of his only surviving nephew, Emmanuel Thomas, son of his brother Louis Thomas, to Princess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein, Duchess of Troppau. Emmanuel died of smallpox in 1729. Eugene then turned to his grand-nephew, Eugene Jean, Count of Soissons, Emmanuel\u2019s only son and Eugene\u2019s last male heir. Seeking to establish a second Savoy principality in central Italy, Eugene arranged a marriage between Eugene Jean and the child sovereign of the Duchy of Massa and Carrara, Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, then under regency. He secured the approval of Charles\u00a0VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Charles Emmanuel\u00a0III of Sardinia. Though matrimonial agreements were signed in 1732, the marriage never took place due to Eugene Jean's early death in 1734 in Mannheim while he was serving in the imperial army.\nWith Eugene Jean\u2019s death, Prince Eugene\u2019s closest relative was Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy, daughter of Louis Thomas and Eugene Jean\u2019s aunt. Though Eugene never met her, and reportedly showed no interest in doing so, she became his legal heiress in the absence of a will. She was preferred over his cousin, Victor Amadeus I, Prince of Carignano, head of the cadet branch of the House of Savoy bearing that name.\nPatron of the arts.\nEugene's rewards for his victories, his share of booty, his revenues from his abbeys in Savoy, and a steady income from his Imperial offices and governorships, enabled him to contribute to the landscape of Baroque architecture Eugene spent most of his life in Vienna at his Winter Palace, the Stadtpalais, built by Fischer von Erlach. The palace acted as his official residence and home, but for reasons that remain speculative the Prince's association with Fischer ended before the building was complete, favouring instead Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt as his chief architect. Eugene first employed Hildebrandt to finish the Stadtpalais before commissioning him to prepare plans for a palace on his Danubian island at R\u00e1ckeve, the Savoy Castle in R\u00e1ckeve. Begun in 1701 the single-story building took twenty years to complete; yet, probably because of the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi revolt, the Prince seems to have visited it only once\u2014after the siege of Belgrade in 1717.\nOf more importance was the grandiose complex of the two Belvedere palaces in Vienna. The single-storey Lower Belvedere, with its exotic gardens and zoo, was completed in 1716. The Upper Belvedere, completed between 1720 and 1722, is a more substantial building; with sparkling white stucco walls and copper roof, it became a wonder of Europe. Eugene and Hildebrandt also converted an existing structure on his Marchfeld estate into a country seat, the Schloss Hof, situated between the Rivers Danube and Morava. The building, completed in 1729, was far less elaborate than his other projects but it was strong enough to serve as a fortress in case of need. Eugene spent much of his spare time there in his last years accommodating large hunting parties.\nIn the years following the Peace of Rastatt Eugene became acquainted with a large number of scholarly men. Given his position and responsiveness, they were keen to meet him: few could exist without patronage and this was probably the main reason for Gottfried Leibniz's association with him in 1714. Eugene also befriended the French writer Jean-Baptiste Rousseau who, by 1716, was receiving financial support from Eugene. Rousseau stayed on attached to the Prince's household, probably helping in the library, until he left for the Netherlands in 1722. Another acquaintance, Montesquieu, already famous for his \"Persian Letters\" when he arrived in Vienna in 1728, favourably recalled his time spent at the Prince's table. Nevertheless, Eugene had no literary pretensions of his own, and was not tempted like Maurice de Saxe or Marshal Villars to write his memoirs or books on the art of war. He did, however, become a collector on the grandest scale: his picture galleries were filled with 16th- and 17th-century Italian, Dutch and Flemish art; his library at the Stadtpalais crammed with over 15,000 books, 237 manuscripts as well as a huge collection of prints (of particular interest were books on natural history and geography). \"It is hardly believable\", wrote Rousseau, \"that a man who carries on his shoulders the burden of almost all the affairs of Europe ... should find as much time to read as though he had nothing else to do.\"\nAt Eugene's death his possessions and estates, except those in Hungary which the crown reclaimed, went to his niece, Princess Maria Anna Victoria, who at once decided to sell everything. The artwork was bought by Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. Eugene's library, prints and drawings were purchased by the Emperor in 1737 and have since passed into Austrian national collections.\nHistorical reputation and legacy.\nNapoleon considered Eugene one of the eight greatest commanders of history. Although later military critics have disagreed with that assessment, Eugene was undoubtedly the greatest Austrian general. He was no military innovator, but he had the ability to make an inadequate system work. He was equally adept as an organiser, strategist, and tactician, believing in the primacy of battle and his ability to seize the opportune moment to launch a successful attack. \"The important thing\", wrote Maurice de Saxe in his \"Reveries\", \"is to see the opportunity and to know how to use it. Prince Eugene possessed this quality which is the greatest in the art of war and which is the test of the most elevated genius.\" This fluidity was key to his battlefield successes in Italy and in his wars against the Turks. Nevertheless, in the Low Countries, particularly after the battle of Oudenarde in 1708, Eugene, like his cousin Louis of Baden, tended to play safe and become bogged down in a conservative strategy of sieges and defending supply lines. After the attempt on Toulon in 1707, he also became very wary of combined land/sea operations. To historian Derek McKay the main criticism of him as a general is his legacy\u2014he left no school of officers nor an army able to function without him.\nEugene was a disciplinarian\u2014when ordinary soldiers disobeyed orders he was prepared to shoot them himself\u2014but he rejected blind brutality, writing \"you should only be harsh when, as often happens, kindness proves useless\".\nOn the battlefield Eugene demanded courage in his subordinates, and expected his men to fight where and when he wanted; his criteria for promotion were based primarily on obedience to orders and courage on the battlefield rather than social position. On the whole, his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them. His position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful. Following the long period of peace after the Austro-Turkish War, the idea of creating a separate field army or providing garrison troops with effective training for them to be turned into such an army quickly was never considered by Eugene. By the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force. For this Eugene was largely to blame\u2014in his view (unlike the drilling and manoeuvres carried out by the Prussians which to Eugene seemed irrelevant to real warfare) the time to create actual fighting men was when war came.\nAlthough Frederick II of Prussia had been struck by the muddle of the Austrian army and its poor organisation during the Polish Succession war, he later amended his initial harsh judgements. \"If I understand anything of my trade\", commented Frederick in 1758, \"especially in the more difficult aspects, I owe that advantage to Prince Eugene. From him I learnt to hold grand objectives constantly in view, and direct all my resources to those ends.\" To historian Christopher Duffy it was this awareness of the 'grand strategy' that was Eugene's legacy to Frederick.\nTo his responsibilities, Eugene attached his own personal values \u2013 physical courage, loyalty to his sovereign, honesty, self-control in all things \u2013 and he expected these qualities from his commanders. Eugene's approach was dictatorial, but he was willing to co-operate with someone he regarded as his equal, such as Baden or Marlborough. Yet the contrast with his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war was stark. According to Churchill, \"Marlborough was the model husband and father, concerned with building up a home, founding a family, and gathering a fortune to sustain it\", whereas Eugene, the bachelor, was \"disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosities against Louis\u00a0XIV\".\nThe result was an austere figure, inspiring respect and admiration rather than affection.\nSicco van Goslinga, one of the Dutch field deputies who worked very close with Eugene during his campaigns with Marlborough, described him in his memoires as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He had untameable courage and outdid himself during battle and in all undertakings where vigorous action was required. But he was less skilled in matters requiring brainwork, perseverance, prudence and constant attention, like when it was necessary to take up a defensive position, carefully supply it with everything necessary for its preservation and watch over its security. He was unable to concern himself with [logistical] ancillary matters, which are so necessary for the security of an army. It was said that he needed a new army every year, implying that he had little concern for the lives of soldiers.\nMemorials.\nWarships.\nSeveral ships have been named in Eugene's honour:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9683", "revid": "17304657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9683", "title": "Emanuel Leutze", "text": "German-American painter\nEmanuel Gottlieb Leutze (May 24, 1816\u00a0\u2013 July 18, 1868) was a German-born American history painter, best known for his 1851 painting \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\". He is associated with the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting.\nBiography.\nLeutze was born in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. He was brought to the United States as a child in 1825. His parents settled first in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and then at Philadelphia. The first development of his artistic talent occurred while he was attending the sickbed of his father, when he attempted drawing to occupy the long hours of waiting. His father died in 1831. At 14, he was painting portraits for $5 apiece. Through such work, he supported himself after the death of his father. In 1834, he received his first instruction in art at the classes of John Rubens Smith, a portrait painter in Philadelphia. He soon became skilled, and promoted a plan for publishing, in Washington, portraits of eminent American statesmen; however, he was met with slight encouragement.\nEurope.\nIn 1840, one of his paintings attracted attention and gave him several orders, which enabled him to attend the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf in his native Germany. Due to his anti-academic attitude, he studied only one year at the academy, in the class of Director Schadow. Leutze was mostly influenced by the painter Karl Friedrich Lessing. In 1842, he went to Munich, studying the works of Cornelius and Kaulbach, and, while there, finished his \"Columbus before the Queen\". The following year he visited Venice and Rome, making studies from Titian and Michelangelo. His first work, \"Columbus before the Council of Salamanca\" (1841) was purchased by the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Union. A companion picture, \"Columbus in Chains\", procured him the gold medal of the Brussels Art Exhibition, and was subsequently purchased by the Art Union in New York; it was the basis of the 1893 $2 Columbian Issue stamp. In 1845, after a tour in Italy, he returned to D\u00fcsseldorf, marrying Juliane Lottner and making his home there for 14 years.\nDuring his years in D\u00fcsseldorf, he was a resource for visiting Americans: he found them places to live and work, provided introductions, and gave them emotional and even financial support. For many years, he was the president of the D\u00fcsseldorf Artists' Association; in 1848, he was an early promoter of the \"Malkasten\" art association; and in 1857, he led the call for a gathering of artists which originated the founding of the Allgemeine deutsche Kunstgenossenschaft.\nA strong supporter of Europe's Revolutions of 1848, Leutze decided to paint an image that would encourage Europe's liberal reformers with the example of the American Revolution. Using American tourists and art students as models and assistants, Leutze finished a first version of \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" in 1850. Just after it was completed, the first version was damaged by fire in his studio, subsequently restored, and acquired by the Kunsthalle Bremen. On September 5, 1942, during World War II, it was destroyed in a bombing raid by the Allied forces. The second painting, a replica of the first, only larger, was ordered in 1850 by the Parisian art trader Adolphe Goupil for his New York branch and placed on exhibition on Broadway in October 1851. It is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1854, Leutze finished his depiction of the Battle of Monmouth, \"Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth\", commissioned by an important patron, the banker David Leavitt of New York City and Great Barrington, Massachusetts.\nNew York City and Washington, D.C..\nIn 1859, Leutze returned to the United States and opened a studio in New York City. He divided his time between New York City and Washington, D.C. In 1859, he painted a portrait of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, which hangs in the Harvard Law School. In a 1992 opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia described the portrait of Taney, made two years after Taney's infamous decision in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\", as showing Taney \"in black, sitting in a shadowed red armchair, left hand resting upon a pad of paper in his lap, right hand hanging limply, almost lifelessly, beside the inner arm of the chair. He sits facing the viewer and staring straight out. There seems to be on his face, and in his deep-set eyes, an expression of profound sadness and disillusionment.\"\nLeutze also executed other portraits, including one of fellow painter William Morris Hunt. That portrait was owned by Hunt's brother Leavitt Hunt, a New York attorney and sometime Vermont resident, and was shown at an exhibition devoted to William Morris Hunt's work at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1878.\nIn 1860, Leutze was commissioned by the U.S. Congress to decorate a stairway in the Capitol Building in Washington, DC, for which he painted a large composition, \"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\", which is also commonly known as \"Westward Ho!\".\nLate in life, he became a member of the National Academy of Design. He was also a member of the Union League Club of New York, which has a number of his paintings. At age 52, he died in Washington, D.C. of heat stroke. He was interred at Glenwood Cemetery. At the time of his death, a painting, \"The Emancipation of the Slaves\", was in preparation. Leutze's portraits are known for the artistic quality of their patriotic romanticism, and his epic \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" ranks in the utmost echelon of American national iconography.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional References:"}

Although his father Tilemann Alber was a schoolmaster, his early education was neglected.\nUltimately in 1518, he found his way to the University of Wittenberg, where he studied theology. He had the good fortune to attract the attention of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, and subsequently became one of Luther's most active helpers in the Protestant Reformation.\nNot only did he fight for the Protestant cause as a preacher and theologian, but he was almost the only member of Luther's party who was able to confront the Roman Catholics with the weapon of literary satire. In 1542 he published a prose satire to which Luther wrote the preface, \"Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alkoran,\" a parodic adaptation of the \"Liber conformitatum\" of the Franciscan Bartolommeo Rinonico of Pisa, in which the Franciscan order is held up to ridicule. This drew reactions from Catholic scholars such as Henricus Sedulius, who published the \"Apologeticus aduersus Alcoranum Franciscanorum, pro Libro Conformitatum,\" which criticized Alberus' arguments in this satire.\nOf higher literary value is the didactic and satirical \"Buch von der Tugend und Weisheit\" (1550), a collection of forty-nine fables in which Alberus embodies his views on the relations of Church and State. His satire is incisive, but in a scholarly and humanistic way; it does not appeal to popular passions with the fierce directness which enabled the master of Catholic satire, Thomas Murner, to inflict such telling blows.\nSeveral of Alberus's hymns, all of which show the influence of his master Luther, have been retained in the German Protestant hymnal.\nAfter Luther's death, Alberus was for a time a deacon in Wittenberg; he became involved, however, in the political conflicts of the time, and was in Magdeburg in 1550\u20131551, while that town was besieged by Maurice, Elector of Saxony. In 1552 he was appointed General Superintendent at Neubrandenburg in Mecklenburg, where he died on 5 May 1553.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:"}

The algorithm, named after its inventor Jay Earley, is a chart parser that uses dynamic programming; it is mainly used for parsing in computational linguistics. It was first introduced in his dissertation in 1968 (and later appeared in abbreviated, more legible form in a journal).\nEarley parsers are appealing because they can parse all context-free languages, unlike LR parsers and LL parsers, which are more typically used in compilers but which can only handle restricted classes of languages. The Earley parser executes in cubic time in the general case formula_1, where \"n\" is the length of the parsed string, quadratic time for unambiguous grammars formula_2, and linear time for all deterministic context-free grammars. It performs particularly well when the rules are written left-recursively.\nEarley recogniser.\nThe following algorithm describes the Earley recogniser. The recogniser can be modified to create a parse tree as it recognises, and in that way can be turned into a parser.\nThe algorithm.\nIn the following descriptions, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 represent any string of terminals/nonterminals (including the empty string), X and Y represent single nonterminals, and \"a\" represents a terminal symbol.\nEarley's algorithm is a top-down dynamic programming algorithm. In the following, we use Earley's dot notation: given a production X \u2192 \u03b1\u03b2, the notation X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 \u03b2 represents a condition in which \u03b1 has already been parsed and \u03b2 is expected.\nInput position 0 is the position prior to input. Input position \"n\" is the position after accepting the \"n\"th token. (Informally, input positions can be thought of as locations at token boundaries.) For every input position, the parser generates a \"state set\". Each state is a tuple (X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 \u03b2, \"i\"), consisting of\nA state is finished when its current position is the last position of the right side of the production, that is, when there is no symbol to the right of the dot \u2022 in the visual representation of the state.\nThe state set at input position \"k\" is called S(\"k\"). The parser is seeded with S(0) consisting of only the top-level rule. The parser then repeatedly executes three operations: \"prediction\", \"scanning\", and \"completion\".\nDuplicate states are not added to the state set, only new ones. These three operations are repeated until no new states can be added to the set. The set is generally implemented as a queue of states to process, with the operation to be performed depending on what kind of state it is.\nThe algorithm accepts if (X \u2192 \u03b3 \u2022, 0) ends up in S(\"n\"), where (X \u2192 \u03b3) is the top level-rule and \"n\" the input length, otherwise it rejects.\nPseudocode.\nAdapted from Speech and Language Processing by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin, \nDECLARE ARRAY S;\nfunction INIT(words)\n S \u2190 CREATE_ARRAY(LENGTH(words) + 1)\n for k \u2190 from 0 to LENGTH(words) do\n S[k] \u2190 EMPTY_ORDERED_SET\nfunction EARLEY_PARSE(words, grammar)\n INIT(words)\n ADD_TO_SET((\u03b3 \u2192 \u2022S, 0), S[0])\n for k \u2190 from 0 to LENGTH(words) do\n for each state in S[k] do // S[k] can expand during this loop\n if not FINISHED(state) then\n if NEXT_ELEMENT_OF(state) is a nonterminal then\n PREDICTOR(state, k, grammar) // non_terminal\n else do\n SCANNER(state, k, words) // terminal\n else do\n COMPLETER(state, k)\n end\n end\n return chart\nprocedure PREDICTOR((A \u2192 \u03b1\u2022B\u03b2, j), k, grammar)\n for each (B \u2192 \u03b3) in GRAMMAR_RULES_FOR(B, grammar) do\n ADD_TO_SET((B \u2192 \u2022\u03b3, k), S[k])\n end\nprocedure SCANNER((A \u2192 \u03b1\u2022a\u03b2, j), k, words)\n if j &lt; LENGTH(words) and a \u2282 PARTS_OF_SPEECH(words[k]) then\n ADD_TO_SET((A \u2192 \u03b1a\u2022\u03b2, j), S[k+1])\n end\nprocedure COMPLETER((B \u2192 \u03b3\u2022, x), k)\n for each (A \u2192 \u03b1\u2022B\u03b2, j) in S[x] do\n ADD_TO_SET((A \u2192 \u03b1B\u2022\u03b2, j), S[k])\n end\nExample.\nConsider the following simple grammar for arithmetic expressions:\n&lt;P&gt; ::= &lt;S&gt; # the start rule\n&lt;S&gt; ::= &lt;S&gt; \"+\" &lt;M&gt; | &lt;M&gt;\n&lt;M&gt; ::= &lt;M&gt; \"*\" &lt;T&gt; | &lt;T&gt;\n&lt;T&gt; ::= \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\"\nWith the input:\n 2 + 3 * 4\nThis is the sequence of state sets:\nThe state (P \u2192 S \u2022, 0) represents a completed parse. This state also appears in S(3) and S(1), which are complete sentences.\nConstructing the parse forest.\nEarley's dissertation briefly describes an algorithm for constructing parse trees by adding a set of pointers from each non-terminal in an Earley item back to the items that caused it to be recognized. But Tomita noticed that this does not take into account the relations between symbols, so if we consider the grammar S \u2192 SS | b and the string bbb, it only notes that each S can match one or two b's, and thus produces spurious derivations for bb and bbbb as well as the two correct derivations for bbb.\nAnother method is to build the parse forest as you go, augmenting each Earley item with a pointer to a shared packed parse forest (SPPF) node labelled with a triple (s, i, j) where s is a symbol or an LR(0) item (production rule with dot), and i and j give the section of the input string derived by this node. A node's contents are either a pair of child pointers giving a single derivation, or a list of \"packed\" nodes each containing a pair of pointers and representing one derivation. SPPF nodes are unique (there is only one with a given label), but may contain more than one derivation for ambiguous parses. So even if an operation does not add an Earley item (because it already exists), it may still add a derivation to the item's parse forest.\nSPPF nodes are never labeled with a completed LR(0) item: instead they are labelled with the symbol that is produced so that all derivations are combined under one node regardless of which alternative production they come from.\nOptimizations.\nPhilippe McLean and R.

This is usually in the form of \"wat,\" a thick stew, served on top of \"injera\" (), a large sourdough flatbread, which is about in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour. Ethiopians usually eat with their right hands, using pieces of to pick up bites of entr\u00e9es and side dishes.\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes a number of fasting periods known as \"tsom\" ( \"\u1e63\u014dm\"), including all Wednesdays and Fridays and the whole Lenten season (including fifteen days outside Lent proper). Per Oriental Orthodox tradition, the faithful may not consume any kind of animal products (including dairy products and eggs) during fasts; therefore, Ethiopian cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan.\nOverview.\nA typical dish consists of accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, lamb, vegetables and various types of legumes (such as lentils), and is traditionally consumed on the mesob basket. The cuisines of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region and the Sidama region also make use of the false banana plant (, Ge'ez: \u12a5\u1295\u1230\u1275 \"\u00efnset\"), a type of ensete. The plant is pulverized and fermented to make various foods, including a bread-like food called \"kocho\" (Ge'ez: \u1246\u132e \"\u1e33\u014d\u010d\u0323\u014d\"), which is eaten with kitfo. The root of this plant may be powdered and prepared as a hot drink called \"bulla\" (Ge'ez: \u1261\u120b \"b\u016bl\u0101\"), which is often given to those who are tired or ill. Another typical Gurage preparation is coffee with butter (\"kebbeh\"). \"Kita\" herb bread is also baked. \"Quanta\" (or \"quwanta\"), is an air-dried beef jerky with traditional spices; it is eaten on its own as a snack, or as an ingredient in stews and other dishes.\nDue in part to the brief Italian occupation, pasta is popular and frequently available throughout Ethiopia, including rural areas. Coffee is also a large part of Ethiopian culture and cuisine. After every meal, a coffee ceremony is enacted and coffee is served.\nHistory.\nThe history of Ethiopian cuisine is influenced by the agricultural heritage of the nation. A key component of tradition is \"injera\" \u2013 a tangy and soft flatbread crafted from \"teff\", an ancient grain native to Ethiopia. In dining settings, \"injera\" is commonly paired with an assortment of \"wot\" dishes featuring vegetables, legumes, and meat; one type, \"doro wot\", a spicy chicken stew accentuated with \"berbere\", a spice blend comprising chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and an array of spices, is the national dish of Ethiopia.\nThroughout history, Ethiopian cuisine has developed through connections and trading with other nations, along with religious practices. For example, the enduring Christian beliefs in Ethiopia have impacted the development of plant-based meals due to fasting periods that forbid eating meat. Likewise, Islamic customs have influenced meat dishes during some celebrations like Eid.\nEthiopian food has been influenced by the country\u2019s geography and its rich agricultural resources, such as lentils, beans, coffee, and various spices. The customary Ethiopian coffee ritual entails roasting, brewing, and serving coffee with great importance, as it is thought to have originated in Ethiopia. Ethiopian cuisine goes beyond mere nourishment, playing a key role in communal dining and cultural representation.\nRestrictions of certain meats.\nEthiopian Orthodox Christians avoid pork for cultural reasons as well as religious reasons, while Ethiopian Jews and Ethiopian Muslims avoid eating pork or shellfish for religious reasons; pork is forbidden in Judaism and Islam. Most Ethiopian Protestants or P'ent'ay also abstain from eating food that the Orthodox abstain from. Many Ethiopians abstain from eating certain meats, eating mostly vegetarian foods, partially from the religious fasting period.\nTraditional ingredients.\n\"Berbere\", a combination of powdered chili pepper and other spices (cardamom, fenugreek, coriander, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, cumin and allspice) is an important ingredient used to add flavor to many varied dishes like chicken stews and baked fish dishes. Also essential is \"niter kibbeh\", a clarified butter infused with ginger, garlic, and several spices.\n\"Mitmita\" (, ) is a powdered seasoning mix used in Ethiopian cuisine. It is orange-red in color and contains ground birdseye chili peppers (piri-piri), cardamom seed, cloves and salt. It occasionally contains other spices including cinnamon, cumin and ginger.\nIn their adherence to strict fasting, Ethiopian cooks have developed a rich array of cooking oil sources\u2014besides sesame and safflower\u2014for use as a substitute for animal fats which are forbidden during fasting periods. Ethiopian cuisine also uses \"nug\" (also spelled \"noog\", also known as \"niger seed\").\nDishes.\nWat.\n\"Wat\" begins with a large amount of chopped red onion, which is simmered or sauteed in a pot. Once the onions have softened, \"niter kebbeh\" (or, in the case of vegan dishes, vegetable oil) is added. Following this, \"berbere\" is added to make a spicy \"keiy wat\" or \"keyyih tsebhi\". Turmeric is used instead of \"berbere\" for a milder \"alicha wat\" or both spices are omitted when making vegetable stews, such as \"atkilt wat\". Meat such as beef (\"\u1225\u130b\", \"s\u0259ga\"), chicken (\"\u12f6\u122e\", \"doro\" or \"derho\"), fish (\"\u12d3\u1223\", \"asa\"), goat or lamb (\"\u1260\u130d\", \"beg\" or \"beggi\") is also added. Legumes such as split peas (\"\u12ad\u12ad\", \"k\u0259k\" or \"kikki\") and lentils (\"\u121d\u1235\u122d\", \"m\u0259s\u0259r\" or \"birsin\"); or vegetables such as potatoes (\"\u12f5\u1295\u127d\", \"D\u0259n\u0259ch\"), carrots and chard (\u1246\u1235\u1323) are also used instead in vegan dishes.\nEach variation is named by appending the main ingredient to the type of \"wat\" (e.g. ). However, the word \"keiy\" is usually not necessary, as the spicy variety is assumed when it is omitted (e.g. \"doro wat\"). The term which simply means 'vegetable' is sometimes used to refer to all vegetable dishes, but a more specific name can also be used (as in , which translates to \"potatoes and carrots stew\"; but the word \"atkilt\" is usually omitted when using the more specific term).\nTibs.\nMeat along with vegetables are saut\u00e9ed to make \"tibs\" (also \"tebs\", \"t'ibs\", \"tibbs\", etc., Ge'ez: \u1325\u1265\u1235 \"\u1e6d\u00efbs\"). \"Tibs\" is served in a variety of manners, and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. There are many variations of the delicacy, depending on type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used. Beef, mutton, and goat are the most common meats used in the preparation of \"tibs\".\nThe mid-18th-century European visitor to Ethiopia Remedius Prutky describes \"tibs\" as a portion of grilled meat served \"to pay a particular compliment or show especial respect to someone.\" It may still be seen this way; today the dish is prepared to commemorate special events and holidays.\nKinche (qinch'e).\n\"Kinche\" (\"qinch\u2019e\"), a porridge, is a very common Ethiopian breakfast or supper. It is simple, inexpensive, and nutritious. It is made from cracked wheat, Ethiopian oats, barley or a mixture of those. It can be boiled in either milk or water with a little salt. The flavor of \"kinche\" comes from the \"nit'ir qibe\", which is a spiced butter. Once cooked, kinche is combined in the pan with clarified spiced butter, oil, and fried onions, though it can also be enjoyed plain without any additional seasonings.\nSalads.\nAzifa is an Ethiopian lentil salad made with mustard seed, jalape\u00f1os, and onions, and it is a dish often served cold. Buticha is an Ethiopian chickpea salad which is often served cold, and is sometimes compared to hummus. Timatim (tomato) salad is also common.\nEthnic dishes.\nAmhara dishes.\nThe Amharas' cuisine features a wide variety of dishes and beverages, often centered around injera, a sourdough flatbread made from teff flour. The cuisine is known for its use of spices, rich stews, and traditional cooking methods.\nOromo dishes.\nThe Oromos' cuisine consists of various vegetable or meat side dishes and entr\u00e9es. As part of a long-established custom, practice, or belief, people do not eat pork in Oromia.\nGurage dishes.\nKitfo.\nAnother distinctively Ethiopian dish is \"kitfo\" (frequently spelled \"ketfo\"). It consists of raw (or rare) beef mince marinated in \"mitmita\" (Ge'ez: \u121a\u1325\u121a\u1323 \"m\u012b\u1e6dm\u012b\u1e6d\u0101\" a very spicy chili powder similar to ) and . \"Gored gored\" is very similar to , but uses cubed rather than ground beef.\nAyibe.\n (or \"ayeb\") is a local cheese made from the curds of buttermilk that is mild and crumbly, close in texture to crumbled feta. Although not quite pressed, the whey has been drained and squeezed out. It is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food. It has little to no distinct taste of its own. However, when served separately, is often mixed with a variety of mild or hot spices typical of Gurage cuisine.\nGomen kitfo.\n\"Gomen kitfo\" is another typical Gurage dish. Collard greens (\u130e\u1218\u1295 \"g\u014dmen\") are boiled, dried and then finely chopped and served with butter, chili and spices. It is a dish specially prepared for the occasion of Meskel, a holiday marking the discovery of the True Cross. It is served along with or sometimes even \"kitfo\" in this tradition called .\nSidama dishes.\nWassa.\nThe enset plant (called \"wesse\" in the Sidamo language) is central to Sidama cuisine and after grinding and fermenting the root to produce \"wassa\", it is used in the preparation of several foods.\nBorasaame.\n\"Borasaame\" is a cooked mixture of \"wassa\" and butter sometimes eaten with Ethiopian mustard greens and/or beans. It is traditionally eaten by hand using a false banana leaf and is served in a ', a vase-like ceramic vessel. A common variant of \"borasaame\" uses maize flour instead of \"wassa\" and is called \"badela borasaame\". \"Borasaame\" is typically paired with a seasoned yogurt drink called \"w\u00e4t\u00e4t\". Both are common foods for funerals and the celebration of \"Fichee Chambalaalla\", the Sidama new year.\nAmulcho.\n is an enset flatbread used similarly to to eat wats made from beef, mushrooms, beans, gomen, or pumpkin.\nGomen ba siga.\nGomen ba siga (\u130e\u1218\u1295 \u1260\u1235\u130b, Amharic: \"cabbage with meat\") is a stewed mixture of beef and Ethiopian mustard served under a layer of bread.\nMaize.\nA commonly grown crop in Sidama, maize (\"badela\" in Sidaamu; also known as \"corn\" in North America) is often eaten as a snack with coffee. It can be ground into flour to make bread, roasted on the cob, or the kernels can be picked off to make \"bokolo\", which is served either boiled or roasted.\nBreakfast.\n\"Fit-fit\" or \"fir-fir\" is a common breakfast dish. It is made from shredded \"\" or \"kitcha\" stir-fried with spices or \"wat\". Another popular breakfast food is , a large fried pancake made with flour, often with a layer of egg, eaten with honey.\n\"Chechebsa\" (or \"kita firfir\") resembles a pancake covered with \"berbere\" and \"niter kibbeh\", or other spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. \"Genfo\" is a kind of porridge, which is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served in a large bowl with a dug-out made in the middle of the genfo and filled with spiced \"niter kibbeh\".\nA variation of \"ful\", a fava bean stew with condiments, served with baked rolls instead of , is also common for breakfast.\nSnacks.\nTypical Ethiopian snacks are \"dabo kolo\" (small pieces of baked bread that are similar to pretzels), or \"kolo\" (roasted barley sometimes mixed with other local grains). \"Kolo\" made from roasted and spiced barley, safflower kernels, chickpeas and/or peanuts are often sold by kiosks and street vendors, wrapped in a paper cone. \"Halewa\" is made with peanuts. Snacking on popcorn and traditional lentil samosas is also common.\nBeverages.\nTraditional alcoholic beverages.\nThere are many different traditional alcoholic drinks which are home made and of natural ingredients.\nTella.\n\"Tella\" is a home-brewed beer served in \"tella bet\" (\"tella houses\") which specialize in serving only \"tella\". \"Tella\" is the most common beverage made and served in households during holidays.\nIt is an alcoholic drink which is prepared from \"bikil\" (barley) as main ingredient and \"gesho\" (\"Rhamnus prinoides\") for fermentation purpose.\nIn Oromiffaa, the drink is called \"farso\" and in Tigrinya \"siwa\".\nTej (honey wine).\n\"Tej\" is a potent honey wine. It is similar to mead, and is frequently served in bars, particularly in a \"tej bet\" or \"\"tej\" house\".\nIt is prepared from honey and gesho. It has a sweet taste and the alcoholic content is relatively higher than \"tella\". This drink can be stored for a long time; the longer it is stored, the higher the alcohol content, and the stronger the taste.\nAreki (katikala).\n\"Areki\", also known as \"katikala\", is probably the strongest alcoholic drink of Ethiopia. It is a home distilled spirit that is often filtered through charcoal to remove off tastes or flavored by smoking or infusion with garlic.\nNon-alcoholic beverages.\nEthiopians have diverse traditional non-alcoholic drinks which include natural and healthy ingredients.\nKenetto (keribo).\n\"Kenetto\", also known as \"keribo\", is a non-alcoholic traditional drink. It is mostly used as substitute for \"tella\" for those who do not drink alcohol.\nBorde.\n\"Borde\" is a cereal-based traditional fermented beverage famous in southern Ethiopia.\nManufactured drinks.\nJust like the rest of the world, Ethiopians also enjoy several locally manufactured beers, wine and non-alcoholic products like Coca-Cola and other similar products.\nAmbo Mineral Water or \"Ambo wuha\" is a bottled carbonated mineral water, sourced from the springs in Ambo Senkele near the town of Ambo.\nNon-alcoholic brews (hot drinks).\nAtmet.\n\"Atmet\" is a barley- and oat-flour based drink that is cooked with water, sugar and \"kibe\" (Ethiopian clarified butter) until the ingredients have combined to create a consistency slightly thicker than eggnog. Though this drink is often given to women who are nursing, the sweetness and smooth texture make it a comfort drink for anyone who enjoys its flavor.\nCoffee.\nAccording to some sources, drinking of coffee (\"buna\") is likely to have originated in Ethiopia. A key national beverage, it is an important part of local commerce.\nThe coffee ceremony is the traditional serving of coffee, usually after a big meal. It often involves the use of a \"jebena\" (\u1300\u1260\u1293), a clay coffee pot in which the coffee is boiled. The preparer roasts the coffee beans in front of guests, then walks around wafting the smoke throughout the room so participants may sample the scent of coffee. Then the preparer grinds the coffee beans in a traditional tool called a . The coffee is put into the \"jebena\", boiled with water, and then served in small cups called \"si'ni\". Coffee is usually served with sugar, but is also served with salt in many parts of Ethiopia. In some parts of the country, \"niter kibbeh\" is added instead of sugar or salt.\nSnacks, such as popcorn or toasted barley (or \"kolo\"), are often served with the coffee. In most homes, a dedicated coffee area is surrounded by fresh grass, with special furniture for the coffee maker. A complete ceremony has three rounds of coffee (\"abol\", \"tona\" and \"bereka\") and is accompanied by the burning of frankincense.\nTea (shai).\nTea will most likely be served if coffee is declined. Tea is grown in Ethiopia at Gumaro and Wushwush.\nBoiled coffee leaves.\nAcross southern Ethiopia, many groups drink boiled coffee leaves, called \"kuti\" among the Harari in the east and \"kaari\" among the Majang in the west. This is often made with widely varying seasonings and spices, such as sugar, salt, rue, hot peppers, ginger. The Ethiopian Food Safety Authority has registered the safety of coffee leaf infusions with the European Union.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9688", "revid": "44260906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9688", "title": "Epistle of James", "text": "Book of the New Testament\nThe Epistle of James is a general epistle and one of the 21 epistles (didactic letters) in the New Testament. It was written originally in Koine Greek. The epistle aims to reach a wide Jewish audience. It survives in manuscripts from the 3rd century onward and is dated between the mid-1st and mid-2nd century AD.\nJames 1:1 identifies the author as \"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ\" who is writing to \"the twelve tribes scattered abroad.\u201d Traditionally, the epistle is attributed to James the brother of Jesus (James the Just). This has been widely debated, with some early church figures affirming the connection and modern scholars often viewing the letter as pseudonymous due to its sophisticated Greek, possible dependence on later texts, and the lack of evidence for James\u2019 Greek education. During the last decades, the epistle of James has attracted increasing scholarly interest due to a surge in the quest for the historical James, his role in early Christianity, his beliefs, and his relationships and views. This James revival is also associated with an increasing level of awareness of the Jewish grounding of both the epistle and early Christianity.\nThe Epistle of James is a public letter modeled on Jewish diaspora epistles and wisdom literature, blending moral exhortation with possible influences from Jesus\u2019 sayings and Greco-Roman philosophical and rhetorical traditions. The historical context of the Epistle of James is debated, with some viewing it as a response to Pauline theology while others see it as rooted in a Jewish-Christian milieu marked by tensions between rich and poor, emerging divisions between Jews and Christians, and ethical concerns for marginalized groups. The epistle emphasizes perseverance in the face of trials and encourages readers to live in accordance with the teachings they have received. The letter addresses a range of moral and ethical concerns, including pride, hypocrisy, favoritism, and slander. It advocates for humility, the pursuit of wisdom aligned with spiritual values rather than worldly ones, and the practice of prayer in all circumstances.\nThe Epistle of James was disputed and sparsely cited in early Christianity, gained wider recognition only by the late 4th century, and was criticized by Martin Luther during the Reformation for its teachings on faith and works, though it remained part of the New Testament canon. It emphasizes that true faith must be demonstrated through works, teaching that faith without works is dead, and highlighting care for the poor, ethical living, and communal practices like anointing the sick.\nAuthorship.\nThe author is identified as \"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ\" (James 1:1). James (Jacob, , ) was an extremely common name in antiquity, and a number of early Christian figures are named James, including: James the son of Zebedee, James the Less, James the son of Alphaeus, and James the brother of Jesus (reported to also be the son of Alphaeus). Of these, James the brother of Jesus has the most prominent role in the early church, and is often understood as either the author of the epistle, or the implied author.\nThe earliest recorded references to the Epistle of James highlight the contentious nature of the epistle's authorship. Origen may be the first person to link the epistle to \"James the brother of Lord\", though this is only preserved in Rufinus's Latin translation of Origen. Eusebius writes that \"James, who is said to be the author of the first of the so-called catholic epistles. But it is to be observed that it is disputed\". Jerome reported that the Epistle of James \"is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority\".\nTraditional authorship.\nThe link between James the brother of Jesus and the epistle continued to strengthen, and is now considered the traditional view on the authorship of the work. The traditional view can be divided into at least three further positions that relate also to the date of the epistle:\nMany who affirm traditional authorship think James had a sufficient proficiency in Greek education to write the letter himself. Some argue that James the brother of Jesus made use of an amanuensis, which explains the quality of Greek in the letter. Dan McCartney notes this position has garnered little support. Others have advocated for a two-stage composition theory, in which many sayings in the epistle originate with James the brother of Jesus. They were collected by James' disciples and redacted into the current form of the letter.\nJohn Calvin and others suggested that the author was the James, son of Alphaeus, who is referred to as James the Less (often identified as James the \"brother\" of Jesus). Martin Luther denied it was the work of an apostle and termed it an \"epistle of straw\", placing it in a second tier of canonical New Testament books.\nThe Holy Tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that the Book of James was \"written not by either of the apostles, but by the 'brother of the Lord' who was the first bishop of the Church in Jerusalem.\"\nPseudonymous authorship.\nA prevalent view within scholarship considers the Epistle of James to be pseudonymous. The real author chose to write under the name James, intending that the audience perceive James the brother of Jesus as the author. Scholars who maintain pseudonymous authorship differ on whether this was a deceitful or pious practice.\nThe following arguments are often cited in support of pseudepigraphy:\nDating and surviving manuscripts.\nThe original manuscript of the Epistle of James is lost. The earliest extant manuscripts of James date to the mid-to-late 3rd century.\nAccording to Josephus, James the brother of Jesus was killed in 62\u00a0CE, during the high priesthood of Ananus, although Clement of Alexandria and Hegesippus provide a different account of James' death, c. 69 CE.\nThose who maintain that the epistle is pseudonymous generally date the epistle later, from the late first to mid-second century. This is based on a number of considerations, including the epistle's potential dependence on 1 Peter, potential response to Paul's writings or Paul's later followers, late attestation in the historical record, and the 3rd and 4th century disputes concerning the epistle's authorship.\nThe historiographic debate currently seems to be leaning to the side of those in favor of early dating, although not through irrefutable evidence but through indications and probabilities.\nSome of the oldest surviving manuscripts that contain some or all of this letter include:\nAn ancient manuscript containing this chapter in the Coptic language is Papyrus 6 (c. 350 CE). In Latin, the epistle is preserved in the Le\u00f3n palimpsest (7th century).\nGenre.\nThe Epistle of James is a public letter (epistle), and includes an epistolary prescript that identifies the sender (\"James\") and the recipients (\"to the twelve tribes in the diaspora\") and provides a greeting (James 1:1). The epistle resembles the form of a Diaspora letter, written to encourage Jewish-Christian communities living outside of Israel amid the hardships of diaspora life. James stands in the tradition of the Jewish genre of \"Letters to the Diaspora\", including the letters of the members of the family of Gamaliel, the one preserved in 2 Maccabees 1:1\u20139, or some copied by Josephus, all of which are characterised by a double opening and an abrupt ending.\nMany consider James to have affinities to Jewish wisdom literature: \"like Proverbs and Sirach, it consists largely of moral exhortations and precepts of a traditional and eclectic nature\". The epistle also has affinities with many of the sayings of Jesus which are found in the gospels of Luke and Matthew (i.e., those attributed to the hypothetical Q source, in the two-source hypothesis). Some scholars have argued that the author of James is familiar with a version of Q rather than Luke or Matthew.\nOther scholars have noted the epistle's affinities with Greco-Roman philosophical literature. The author's use and transformation of Q materials resembles the Hellenistic practice of , in which the author must \"rival and vie [] with the original in the expression of the same thoughts\". Other studies have analysed sections of James in light of Greco-Roman rhetorical conventions.\nStructure.\nSome view the epistle as having no overarching outline: \"James may have simply grouped together small 'thematic essays' without having more linear, Greco-Roman structures in mind.\" That view is generally supported by those who believe that the epistle may not be a true piece of correspondence between specific parties but an example of wisdom literature, formulated as a letter for circulation. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" says, \"the subjects treated of in the Epistle are many and various; moreover, St. James not infrequently, whilst elucidating a certain point, passes abruptly to another, and presently resumes once more his former argument.\"\nOthers view the letter as having only broad topical or thematic structure. They generally organize James under three (in the views of Ralph Martin) to seven (in the views of Luke Johnson) general key themes or segments.\nA third group believes that James was more purposeful in structuring his letter, linking each paragraph theologically and thematically:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;James, like the gospel writers, can be seen as a purposeful theologian, carefully weaving his smaller units together into larger fabrics of thought and using his overall structure to prioritize his key themes.\u2014\u200a\nThe third view of the structuring of James is a historical approach that is supported by scholars who are not content with leaving the book as \"New Testament wisdom literature, like a small book of proverbs\" or \"like a loose collection of random pearls dropped in no particular order onto a piece of string.\"\nA fourth group uses modern discourse analysis or Greco-Roman rhetorical structures to describe the structure of James.\nThe United Bible Societies' \"Greek New Testament\" divides the letter into the following sections:\nHistorical context.\nThe exact historical circumstances that occasioned the epistle are unknown. Those who understand James 2 as a polemic against Paul or Paul's followers suggest an occasion for the letter aimed at opposing Pauline justification. Others have argued that James' discussion on faith and works does not have Pauline categories in view.\nSome scholars have suggested that the epistle was written to both Christian and non-Christian Jews, who continued to worship together before the parting of the ways between Christianity and Judaism. The warning against cursing people (James 3:9\u201310) has been read in light of this historical reconstruction, and Dale Allison has argued that \"James reflects an environment in which some Jews, unhappy with Jewish Christians, were beginning to use the or something very much like it\" to curse Christians.\nPoverty and wealth are key concerns throughout the epistle, and these issues are likely to reflect the epistle's historical context. The author shows concern for vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as \"orphans and widows\" (James 1:27), believers who are \"poorly clothed and lacking in daily food\" (James 2:15), and the oppressed waged-worker (James 5:4). He writes strongly against the rich (James 1:10; 5:1\u20136) and those who show partiality towards them (James 2:1\u20137).\nDoctrine.\nJustification.\nThe epistle contains the following famous passage concerning salvation and justification:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, \"Go in peace, be warmed and filled,\" without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, \"You have faith and I have works.\" Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe\u2014and shudder!\nDo you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness\"\u2014and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. \nAnd in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.\u2014\u200a\nThis passage has been contrasted with the teachings of Paul the Apostle on justification. Some scholars even believe that the passage is a response to Paul. One issue in the debate is the meaning of the Greek word (\"dikai\u03cc\u014d\"), 'render righteous or such as he ought to be'), with some among the participants taking the view that James is responding to a misunderstanding of Paul.\nRoman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy have historically argued that the passage disproves simplistic versions of the doctrine of justification by faith alone ().\nThe early Protestants resolved the apparent conflict between James and Paul regarding faith and works in alternate ways from the Catholics and Orthodox. One modern American Protestant explanation pre-supposes that James taught :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Paul was dealing with one kind of error while James was dealing with a different error. The errorists Paul was dealing with were people who said that works of the law were needed to be added to faith in order to help earn God's favor. Paul countered this error by pointing out that salvation was by faith alone apart from deeds of the law (Galatians 2:16; Romans 3:21\u201322). Paul also taught that saving faith is not dead but alive, showing thanks to God in deeds of love (Galatians 5:6 ['...since in Christ Jesus it is not being circumcised or being uncircumcised that can effect anything \u2013 only faith working through love.']). James was dealing with errorists who said that if they had faith they didn't need to show love by a life of faith (James 2:14\u201317). James countered this error by teaching that faith is alive, showing itself to be so by deeds of love (James 2:18,26). James and Paul both teach that salvation is by faith alone and also that faith is never alone but shows itself to be alive by deeds of love that express a believer's thanks to God for the free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus.\u2014\u200a\nAccording to Ben Witherington III, differences exist between the Apostle Paul and James, but both used the law of Moses, the teachings of Jesus and other Jewish and non-Jewish sources, and \"Paul was not anti-law any more than James was a legalist\". A more recent article suggests that the current confusion regarding the Epistle of James about faith and works resulted from Augustine of Hippo's anti-Donatist polemic in the early fifth century. This approach reconciles the views of Paul and James on faith and works.\nAnointing of the sick.\nThe epistle is also the chief biblical text for the anointing of the sick. James wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\u2014\u200a\nG. A. Wells suggested that the passage was evidence of late authorship of the epistle, on the grounds that the healing of the sick being done through an official body of presbyters (elders) indicated a considerable development of ecclesiastical organisation \"whereas in Paul's day to heal and work miracles pertained to believers indiscriminately (I Corinthians, XII:9).\"\nWorks, deeds and care for the poor.\nJames and the M Source material in Matthew, alone within the New Testament canon, maintain a stand against the rejection of works and deeds. According to E. P. Sanders, traditional Christian theology wrongly divested the term \"works\" of its ethical grounding, part of the effort to characterize Judaism as legalistic. However, for James and for all Jews, faith is alive only through Torah observance. In other words, belief demonstrates itself through practice and manifestation. For James, claims about belief are empty, unless they are alive in action, works and deeds.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it\u2014not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it\u2014they will be blessed in what they do.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.\u2014\u200a\nThe epistle emphasizes the importance of acts of charity or works to go along with having the Christian faith by means the following three verses in chapter 2:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\u2014\u200a\nTorah observance.\nJames is unique in the canon by its explicit and wholehearted support of Torah observance (the Law). According to Bibliowicz, not only is this text a unique view into the milieu of the Jewish founders \u2013 its inclusion in the canon signals that as canonization began (fourth century onward) Torah observance among believers in Jesus was still authoritative. According to modern scholarship James, Q, Matthew, the Didache, and the pseudo-Clementine literature reflect a similar ethos, ethical perspective, and stand on, or assume, Torah observance. James call to Torah observance (James 1:22-27) ensures salvation (James 2:12\u201313, 14\u201326). Hartin is supportive of the focus on Torah observance and concludes that these texts support faith through action and sees them as reflecting the milieu of the Jewish followers of Jesus. Hub van de Sandt sees Matthew's and James' Torah observance reflected in a similar use of the Jewish Two Ways theme which is detectable in the Didache too (Didache 3:1\u20136). McKnight thinks that Torah observance is at the heart of James's ethics. A strong message against those advocating the rejection of Torah observance characterizes, and emanates from, this tradition: \"Some have attempted while I am still alive, to transform my words by certain various interpretations, in order to teach the dissolution of the law; as though I myself were of such a mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which God forbid! For such a thing were to act in opposition to the law of God which was spoken by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in respect of its eternal continuance; for thus he spoke: 'The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law.'\"\nJames seem to propose a more radical and demanding interpretation of the law than mainstream Judaism. According to John Painter, there is nothing in James to suggest any relaxation of the demands of the law. \"No doubt James takes for granted his readers' observance of the whole law, while focusing his attention on its moral demands.\"\nCanonicity.\nThe first explicit references to the Epistle of James are found in the writings of Origen of Alexandria (e.g. \"Comm. on John.,\" 19.23) in the third century. Scholars have generally rejected the possible second-century allusions to James in the Apostolic Fathers and Irenaeus of Lyons' \"Against Heresies\". Neither is James mentioned by Tertullian (c. 155\u2013220 CE) or Cyprian (c. 210\u2013258 CE), and its authenticity of the epistle doubted by Theodore of Mopsuestia (c. 350\u2013428 CE). In \"Historia ecclesiae\" 2.23.25, Eusebius classes James among the Antilegomena or disputed works, stating, \"it is to be observed that it is disputed; at least, not many of the ancients have mentioned it, as is the case likewise with the epistle that bears the name of Jude, which is also one of the seven so-called catholic epistles. Nevertheless we know that these also, with the rest, have been read publicly in very many churches.\"\nIts late recognition in the Church, especially in the West, was a consequence primarily of its sparse attestation by earlier Christian authors and its disputed authorship. Jerome reported that the Epistle of James \"is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority\" (\"De viris illustribus\" 2).\nThe Epistle of James is missing from the Muratorian fragment (poss. 2nd to 4th century), the Cheltenham list (c. 360 CE), but was listed with the twenty-seven New Testament books by Athanasius of Alexandria in his \"Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle\" (367 CE), and subsequently affirmed by the Councils of Laodicea (c. 363 CE), of Rome (382 CE) and of Carthage (397 and 419).\nDuring the Reformation era, Martin Luther took issue with the epistle on theological grounds, finding James' description of faith and works incompatible with his understanding of justification. Reportedly, he once went as far as to assert \"I almost feel like throwing Jimmy into the stove\", a metaphor for his being tempted to remove the Epistle of James from the Bible. Luther nonetheless chose to include James in his German translation, though he moved it (along with Hebrews, Jude, and Revelation) to the end of the Bible.\nSignificance.\nLatter Day Saint history.\nJames 1:5 has particular importance in the Latter Day Saint tradition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u2014\u200a\nJoseph Smith claims that the reading and contemplation of this verse inspired him to ask God for wisdom, leading to his First Vision, and thus to what his followers consider to be the Restoration, i.e. the creation of the Church of the Latter Day Saints.\nOption for the poor.\nPope Leo XIV refers to James 2:2-4 in exhorting the church to become \"a place where the poor have a privileged place\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9689", "revid": "23146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9689", "title": "Epistle of Jude", "text": "Book of the New Testament\nThe Epistle of Jude is the penultimate book of the New Testament and of the Christian Bible. The Epistle of Jude claims authorship by Jude, identified as a servant of Jesus and brother of James (and possibly Jesus), though there is scholarly debate about his exact identity, literacy, and the letter's date. It was most likely written in the late first century, with some considering its authorship pseudepigraphical.\nJude urges believers to defend the faith against false teachers and warns of their destructive consequences by recalling examples of divine judgment on the unbelieving and rebellious. He encourages steadfastness in God's love despite scoffers, uses vivid imagery to describe these opponents, and supports his message by quoting the Book of Enoch. The Epistle of Jude references both canonical books like Zechariah and non-canonical works such as the Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses, indicating its author's familiarity with a range of writings. The Epistle of Jude condemns vague opponents\u2014variously interpreted as rebellious leaders, heretics rejecting divine or ecclesiastical authority, proto-Gnostics, or critics of Pauline teachings\u2014but their exact identity remains uncertain due to the epistle's ambiguous and limited descriptions. The Epistle of Jude, a brief, combative, and impassioned letter of 25 verses likely intended as a circular letter to Jewish Christians familiar with Hebrew Bible and Enochian references. It concludes with a doxology. \nThe one aspect of the potential ideology discussed in the letter is that these opponents denigrate angels and their role. If this was indeed a part of the ideology of this group the author opposed, then the epistle is possibly a counterpoint to the Epistle to the Colossians. Colossians condemns those who give angels undue prominence and worship them; this implies the two letters might be part of an early Christian debate on Christian angelology. The phrase \"heap abuse on celestial beings\" may reflect early Christian tensions between more Jewish-aligned figures like James and Jude and the Pauline tradition, which emphasized believers' authority over angels and rejected strict adherence to Jewish law.\nMany scholars believe that the strong similarities between Jude and 2 Peter\u2014particularly in 2 Peter 2 and Jude 4\u201318\u2014indicate that one borrowed from the other or both used a common source, with most favoring Jude as the earlier text, though conservative objections exist. The Epistle of Jude was disputed but gradually accepted as canonical by most churches by the late second century, despite early doubts about its authorship and content due to its rare citation and use of apocryphal sources. Its formal inclusion in the New Testament canon was solidified by the late fourth century.\nAuthorship.\nThe epistle introduces itself with a simple claim of authorship: \"Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James\". \"James\" is generally taken to mean James, brother of Jesus, a prominent leader in the early church. Introductions would typically refer to a father in the era, so the use of a brother suggests that this would only be done if the brother was famous within the community. Little is known about Jude himself. As the brother of James, it has traditionally meant Jude was also a brother of Jesus, since James is described as being the brother of Jesus. This is why Clement of Alexandria (c.\u00a0150\u2013215 AD) wrote in his work \"Comments on the Epistle of Jude\" that Jude, the author, was a son of Joseph and a brother of Jesus. However, there is a dispute as to whether \"brother\" means someone who has the same father and mother, or a half-brother, cousin, or more distant familial relationship. This dispute over the true meaning of \"brother\" grew as the doctrine of the Virgin Birth evolved. For example, Saint Jerome believed that not only Mary but also Joseph were virgins their entire lives, and thus James and by extension Jude were cousins.\nOutside the book of Jude, a \"Jude\" is mentioned five times in the New Testament: three times as Jude the Apostle, and twice as Jude the brother of Jesus (aside from references to Judas Iscariot and Judah, the son of the patriarch Jacob). Debate continues as to whether the author of the epistle is the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither. Scholars have argued that since the author of the letter has not identified himself as an apostle and also refers to the apostles as a third party, he cannot be identified with Jude the Apostle. Other scholars have drawn the opposite conclusion, which is that, as an apostle, he would not have made a claim of apostleship on his own behalf. Scholars who have defended the authorship of the brother of James as plausible include Richard Bauckham.\nA reason to doubt that a relative of Jesus wrote the book is that they are unlikely to have been literate. Jesus's family were common laborers from Aramaic-speaking Galilee, and literary composition skills were overwhelmingly concentrated in the elite in antiquity. Few knew how to read, fewer how to write, and fewer still how to write complicated literary treatises. Jesus himself may have been able to read, presumably in Hebrew, but he was also exceptional and the star of the family. Even if somehow Jude had learned a little of how to read Hebrew, the epistle is written in excellent, complicated Koine Greek, with knowledge of common forms of rhetoric and argument of the era, as well as seeming knowledge of the scriptures in Hebrew. All this would be exceptional for a countryside Galilean. Scholars who support the authorship of Jude generally assume that he must have embarked upon extensive travel and missionary work among Hellenized Jews to master Greek as the author did. Ultimately, it is impossible to know more details of Jude's life for sure. One early Christian tradition states that Jude's grandchildren were brought before Emperor Domitian and interrogated; in the story, they defended themselves as not rebels and mere poor laborers eking out what they could from a single patch of land. While the story is clearly apocryphal \u2013 Roman emperors did not generally interrogate Galilean peasants \u2013 it does suggest that early Christians remembered Jude's family as lower-class laborers, not literate elites.\nIf the Jude writing the letter was not Jude the Apostle mentioned in the gospels, then he was possibly an unknown Christian who happened to share the name and coincidentally also had a brother named James. A final possibility is that the epistle is pseudepigrapha \u2013 that the author intentionally hinted to readers that it was from the more famous Jude, but only as a false attribution to give the letter more authority.\nDate.\nThe date of composition is not known, but is loosely speculated to be between the years 50 and 110. If the epistle was written by the Jude mentioned in the gospels, that would place it sometime in the early apostolic age of c.\u200950\u201370 before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem; if the letter reflects \"early catholicism\" and the beginnings of an organized church, then a date of the last decade of the first century or the early second century (c.\u200990\u2013110) is indicated; and if the letter is an attack on Gnosticism, then a much later date is indicated, perhaps around 150 AD. Scholars who consider the letter a pseudonymous work generally favor the later dates due to the letter's references to the apostles (as if they lived in the past) and to an authoritative tradition, and because of its competent Greek style. Bo Reicke suggests around 90 AD; Heikki R\u00e4is\u00e4nen concurs and believes that it may have been written at the end of the first century. Bart Ehrman also agrees that toward the end of the first century is the most likely, due to use of certain terminology in ways similar to the pastoral epistles that match a late first century date.\nContent.\nJude urges his readers to \"contend for the faith\" which was delivered \"once and for all\", against \"certain intruders [who] have stolen in among you\". He warns about false teachers who twist the grace of Christ as a pretext for wantonness. Jude asks the reader to recall how even after the Lord saved his own people out of the land of Egypt, he did not hesitate to destroy those who fell into unbelief, much as he punished the angels who fell from their original exalted status and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. He also paraphrases (verse 9) an incident apparently from the Assumption of Moses that has since been lost about Satan and Michael the Archangel quarreling over the body of Moses.\nContinuing the analogy from Israel's history, he says that the false teachers have followed in the way of Cain, have rushed after reward into the error of Balaam, and have perished in the rebellion of Korach. He describes in vivid terms the opponents he warns of, calling them \"clouds without rain\", \"trees without fruit\", \"foaming waves of the sea\", and \"wandering stars\". He exhorts believers to remember the words spoken by the Apostles, using language similar to the second epistle of Peter to answer concerns that the Lord seemed to tarry: \"In the last time there will be scoffers, indulging their own ungodly lusts,\" and to keep themselves in God's love, before delivering a doxology to God.\nJude quotes directly from the Book of Enoch, a widely distributed work among the Old Testament pseudepigrapha, citing a section of 1 Enoch 1:8 that is based on Deuteronomy 33:2.\nStyle and audience.\nConsisting of just one chapter with 25 verses, the Epistle of Jude is among the shortest books of the Bible. The Epistle to Philemon also contains 25 verses, while the 21-verse Book of Obadiah, the 14-verse 3 John, and the 13-verse 2 John are shorter.\nThe wording and syntax of this epistle in its original Greek demonstrates that the author was capable and fluent. The epistle's style is combative, impassioned, and rushed. Many examples of evildoers and warnings about their fates are given in rapid succession.\nThe epistle concludes with a doxology, which is considered by Peter H. Davids to be one of the highest in quality contained in the Bible. Reicke describes it as \"grand and soul-stirring\".\nIt may have been composed as an encyclical letter\u2014that is, one not directed to the members of one church in particular, but intended rather to be circulated and read in all churches. While addressed to the Christian Church as a whole, the references to Old Testament figures such as Michael, Cain, and Korah's sons, the Book of Enoch, and the invocation of James as head of the church of Jerusalem suggest a Jewish Christian main audience who would be familiar with Enochian literature and revere James.\nCanonical status.\nThe letter of Jude was one of the disputed books of the biblical canon of the New Testament. Despite some opposition, it seems to have been accepted by most churches around the end of the second century. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and the Muratorian canon considered the letter canonical. The letter was eventually accepted as part of the canon by later Church Fathers such as Athanasius of Alexandria. The canon listed by the Council of Carthage (c. 397) included the epistle of Jude.\nThe first historical record of doubts as to authorship are found in the writings of Origen of Alexandria, who spoke of the doubts held by some in the early third century. Eusebius classified it with the \"disputed writings, the \"antilegomena\"\" in the early fourth century. Eusebius doubted its authenticity, partly because it was rarely quoted among ancient sources, although he acknowledges it was read in many churches. The links between the Epistle and 2 Peter and its use of the biblical apocrypha raised concern: Saint Jerome wrote in 392 AD that the book was \"rejected by many\" since it quotes the Book of Enoch. Even to the extent that the letter was accepted as canonical and useful, it likely circulated as an independent letter in the 2nd and 3rd centuries; it and the other general epistles only appear to have become part of somewhat standardized collections in manuscripts of the fourth century and afterward.\nThe oldest surviving versions of the Syriac Peshitta from the 5th- and 6th- centuries do not include Jude; nor 2 John, 3 John, 2 Peter, or Revelation. These works were added to the Syrian canon in the 6th century and afterward.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nEarly manuscripts containing the text of the epistle of Jude include:\nIdentity of the opponents.\nThe epistle fiercely condemns the opponents it warns of and declares that God will judge and punish them, despite them being a part of the Christian community. However, the exact nature of these opponents has been a continuing question, as the epistle does not describe them in any more detail than calling them corrupt and ungodly. Several theories have been proposed. The most specific verse describing the opponents is verse 8:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.\u2014\u200a\nThe rejection of \"authority\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1, \"kyriot\u0113ta\"; alternative translations include \"dominion\" or \"lordship\") could mean several things. The most direct would be rejection of civil or ecclesiastical authority: the opponents were ignoring guidance from leaders. Martin Luther and Jean Calvin agreed with this interpretation, and it is the most common one. Another possibility is that this specifically referred to rejecting the authority of Jesus or God, which would agree with verse 4 and be reinforcing the claim that these opponents are not true Christians. A third possibility is that this is the singular of \"kyriot\u0113tes\" (Dominions), a class of angels. This would fit with the final part of the sentence of \"heap abuse on celestial beings\", but it is unusual that the singular is used. Versions of Jude vary, and some manuscripts such as the Codex Sinaiticus indeed use the plural form.\n\"Heap abuse on celestial beings\" is also a relevant statement, as it stands in some tension with the works of Paul the Apostle as well as the Epistle to the Hebrews. Paul's undisputed works indicate that believers are already on the same level as angels, that all existing powers are subject to Christ, and believers are the future judges of angels. Later writings attributed to Paul such as Colossians and Ephesians go even further, with Colossians decrying the alleged worship of angels. A hypothesis is thus that the author may have been attacking forms of Pauline Christianity that were not suitably deferential to angels in their opinion. \"Rejecting authority\" may be a reference to Paul's preaching that gentiles did not need to comply with Jewish Law. As James was known to be a major figure among Jewish Christians, this might indicate tension between the more Jewish strands of early Christianity represented by James and Jude set against Paul's message to the gentiles.\nAnother hypothesis is that the opponents may have been proto-Gnostics, argued for by scholars such as Hermann Werdermann. Proposed evidence in support of this includes that in verse 19, the opponents are called \"worldly\" (\"psychikoi\"), a term also used in relation to Gnosticism in other literature. While it does seem that Jude may have been used to attack Gnostics in later centuries, other scholars think this was unlikely to be the original intent, as the opponents are not described as having the signature doctrines of Gnosticism, and Gnosticism does not seem to have been a major force in first century Christianity. Richard Bauckham, arguing against such a connection, writes that \"If [Jude]'s polemic is really aimed against Gnosticism it is singularly inept.\"\nThe inherent vagueness of the epistle means that the identities of these opponents may never be known.\nSimilarity to 2 Peter.\nPart of Jude is very similar to 2 Peter (mainly 2 Peter chapter 2); so much so that most scholars agree that either one letter used the other directly, or they both drew on a common source. Comparing the Greek text portions of 2 Peter 2:1\u20133:3 (426 words) to Jude 4\u201318 (311 words) results in 80 words in common and 7 words of substituted synonyms.\nBecause this epistle is much shorter than 2 Peter, and due to various stylistic details, most scholars consider Jude the source for the similar passages of 2 Peter. 2 Peter omits the reference to the non-canonical book of Enoch, or apocalyptic Jewish works in general; perhaps an indication of shifting attitudes of the early 2nd century, in the view where 2 Peter came later.\nAdvocates of the reverse are generally traditionalists who assign an early date to 2 Peter, such that it was published during Peter's lifetime. \nThey argue that Jude 18 quotes as past tense, and consider Jude to have come after 2 Peter.\nReferences to other books.\nThe Epistle of Jude references at least three other books, with two (Book of Zechariah and 2 Peter) being canonical in all churches, and the other (Book of Enoch) non-canonical in most churches.\nVerse 9 refers to a dispute between Michael the Archangel and the devil about the body of Moses. Some interpreters understand this reference to be an allusion to the events described in Zechariah 3:1\u20132. The classical theologian Origen, as well as Clement of Alexandria, Didymus the Blind, and others, attributes this reference to the non-canonical Assumption of Moses. However, no extant copies of the Assumption of Moses contain this story, leading most scholars to conclude the section covering this dispute has been lost \u2013 perhaps a lost ending, since a story involving Moses's body would logically occur at the end. Some scholars disagree; James Charlesworth argues that the Assumption of Moses never contained any such content, and other ancient Church writers supported a different origin.\nVerses 14\u201315 contain a direct quotation of a prophecy from 1 Enoch 1:9. The title \"Enoch, the seventh from Adam\" is also sourced from 1 En. 60:1. Most commentators assume that this indicates that Jude accepts the antediluvian patriarch Enoch as the author of the Book of Enoch which contains the same quotation. An alternative explanation is that Jude quotes the Book of Enoch aware that verses 14\u201315 are an expansion of the words of Moses from Deuteronomy 33:2.\nThe Book of Enoch is not considered canonical by most churches, although it is by the Ethiopian Orthodox church. According to Western scholars, the older sections of the Book of Enoch (mainly in the \"Book of the Watchers\") date from about 300 BC and the latest part (\"Book of Parables\") probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BC. 1 Enoch 1:9, mentioned above, is part of the pseudepigrapha and is among the Dead Sea Scrolls [4Q Enoch (4Q204[4QENAR]) COL I 16\u201318]. It is largely accepted by scholars that the author of the Epistle of Jude was familiar with the Book of Enoch and was influenced by it in thought and diction. The reference to fallen angels suggests the possibility the author was familiar with related literature to Enoch such as the Book of Jubilees and 2 Baruch as well.\nThe epistle also closely mirrors the Epistle of James, with many similar sentences and borrowed phrases.\nInfluence.\nIn general, Jude did not have much influence in later Christianity, not appearing often in sermons preached to laypeople nor in treatises by Christian theologians. The Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon used verse 19 as his text for at least one sermon. In Catholic theology, the words of verse 3, \"once and for all\", form part of the approach to sacred tradition set out in the Second Vatican Council's declaration that \"what was handed on by the Apostles includes everything which contributes toward the holiness of life and increase in faith of the peoples of God\".\nDouglas Rowston, an Australian New Testament scholar, observed in 1971 that \"Only its benediction may be familiar to an average churchgoer\" and that \"New Testament theologians have ignored the book\". The Presbyterian writer Hywel Jones later observed that since Rowston's article was published, a \"flurry\" of academic studies of the letter emerged.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Barrett, in the \"Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements\", specifies that are now \"those independent bishops who collect several different lines of transmission of apostolic succession, and who will happily (and sometimes for a fee) consecrate anyone who requests it\". Those described as wandering bishops often see the term as pejorative. The general term for \"wandering\" clerics, as were common in the Middle Ages, is ; the general term for those recognising no leader is .\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church\" mentions as the main lines of succession deriving from in the 20th century those founded by Arnold Mathew, Joseph Ren\u00e9 Vilatte and Leon Chechemian.\nHistory.\nAccording to Buchanan, \"the real rise of the problem\" happened in the 19th century, in the \"wake of the Anglo-Catholic movement\", \"through mischievous activities of a tiny number of independently acting bishops\". They exist worldwide, he writes, \"mostly without congregations\", and \"many in different stages of delusion and fantasy, not least in the Episcopal titles they confer on themselves\"; \"the distinguishing mark\" to \"specifically identif[y]\" an \"episcopus vagans\" is \"the lack of a true see or the lack of a real church life to oversee\".\nPaul Halsall, on the Internet History Sourcebooks Project, did not list a single church edifice of independent bishops, in a 1996\u20131998 New York City building architecture survey of religious communities, which maintain bishops claiming apostolic succession and claim cathedral status but noted there \"are now literally hundreds of these \", of lesser or greater spiritual probity. They seem to have a tendency to call living room sanctuaries 'cathedrals';\" those buildings were not perceived as cultural symbols and did not meet the survey criteria. David V. Barrett wrote, in \"A Brief Guide to Secret Religions\", that \"one hallmark of such bishops is that they often collect as many lineages as they can to strengthen their Episcopal legitimacy\u2014at least in their own eyes\", and adds that their groups have more clergy than members.\nBarrett wrote that leaders \"of some esoteric movements, are also priests or bishops in small non-mainstream Christian Churches\"; he explains, this type of \"independent or autocephalous\" group has \"little in common with the Church it developed from, the Old Catholic Church, and even less in common with the Roman Catholic Church\" but still claims its authority from apostolic succession.56\nBuchanan writes that based the criteria of having \"a true see\" or having \"a real church life to oversee\", the bishops of most forms of the Continuing Anglican movement are not necessarily classified as vagantes, but \"are always in danger of becoming such\".\nTheological issues.\nCatholic.\nA Latin Church or Eastern Catholic ordained to the episcopacy without a mandate from the Pope is automatically excommunicated and is thereby forbidden to celebrate the sacraments under Catholic canon law. However, in light of the sacramental character of the episcopacy in Catholic theology and of the doctrine of \"ex opere operato\" (according to which the efficacy of a sacrament does not depend on the merits of the person who performs or who receives the sacrament) such an ordination is considered \"valid but illicit\". This means that, although excommunicated and forbidden from carrying out any ministry under the authority of the Catholic Church, an individual thus ordained is regarded as having the full sacramental powers of a bishop, including the power to ordain other bishops.\nOn the other hand, the view expressed by the International Bishops' Conference of the Old Catholic Church with regard to the ordinations by Arnold Mathew is that the episcopacy exists for service within a specific Christian church and, therefore, that an ordination ceremony that concerns only the individual himself does not make him truly a bishop. The Vatican has not commented on whether it concurs with this interpretation, but it has declared with regard to ordinations of this kind carried out, for example, by Emmanuel Milingo upon Peter Paul Brennan and others, that the Catholic Church \"does not recognize and does not intend to recognize in the future those ordinations or any of the ordinations derived from them and therefore the canonical state of the alleged bishops remains that in which they were before the ordination conferred by Mr Milingo\".\nEastern Orthodox.\nVlassios Pheidas, on an official Church of Greece site, uses the canonical language of the Eastern Orthodox tradition, to describe the conditions in ecclesial praxis when sacraments, including Holy Orders, are real, valid, and efficacious. He notes language is itself part of the ecclesiological problem.ch. 1\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the Independent Catholic churches, but also of all other Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East. Through strict adherence to the law superseding economy by their Cyprian understanding, in this instance, there may be questionably valid sacraments outside of the Eastern Orthodox Church, yet they lack any efficacy. However, some mainstream Eastern Orthodox bodies recognize Roman Catholic orders and don't conditionally ordain clergy as each autocephalous church determines the validity and efficacy of another's ordination. There have also been several canonically disputed or independent Eastern Orthodox clergy received into the mainstream or canonical Eastern Orthodox Church in certain instances\u2014also without conditional ordination, whose predecessors were either once part of or remained outside of canonical Eastern Orthodoxy\u2014in contrast with Pheidas' statement on economy.\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople likewise teaches that through \"extreme oikonomia [economy]\", those who are baptized in the Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Old Catholic, Moravian, Anglican, Methodist, Reformed, Presbyterian, Church of the Brethren, Assemblies of God, or Baptist traditions can be received into the Eastern Orthodox Church through the sacrament of Chrismation and not through re-baptism.\nThe predominant view, however, continues to reject those raised to the episcopacy outside of the mainstream or canonical Eastern Orthodox Church as valid bishops in holy orders.\nLutheran.\nThe \"Concordia Theological Monthly\" stated that \"episcopi vagantes\" are a concern in Lutheranism. The Lutheran priest Arthur Carl Piepkorn wrote that Gustavus Adolphus Glinz and Friedrich Heiler were consecrated bishops in 1930 by Pierre Gaston Vigu\u00e9. Heiler then ordained several men as priests who sent on to serve in Lutheran parishes. \"Episcopi vagantes\", according to Piepkorn, approach clergy with a claim to be aligned with Lutheran doctrine and the promise of \"incontestably valid and apostolic\" priestly ordination or episcopal consecration.\nAnglican.\nAnglican bishop Colin Buchanan, in the \"Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism\", says that the Anglican Communion has held an Augustinian view of orders, by which \"the validity of Episcopal ordinations (to whichever order) is based solely upon the historic succession in which the ordaining bishop stands, irrespective of their contemporary ecclesial context\". He describes the circumstances of Archbishop Matthew Parker's consecration as one of the reasons why this theory is \"generally held\". Parker was chosen by Queen Elizabeth I of England to be the first Church of England Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of the previous office holder, Cardinal Reginald Pole, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. Buchanan notes the Roman Catholic Church also focuses on issues of intention and not just breaks in historical succession. He does not explain whether intention has an ecclesiological role, for Anglicans, in conferring or receiving sacraments.\nAccording to the Church of England's canon law, \"no person who has been admitted to the order of bishop, priest, or deacon can ever be divested of the character of his order\". The Anglican understanding can be summarised as: \"once a bishop, always a bishop\". In the 39 Articles of Religion, the 26th article suggests the sacraments cannot be invalided by unworthy ministers. Anglican theologian Gerald Bray argued: \"If it were, no ministry would be valid, because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. The validity of a sacrament does not lie in the spiritual state of the minister, which is usually unknown and probably unknowable, but in the promises that the sacrament contains\".\nThe American Episcopal Church's \"An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church\" states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the same way, medieval scholastics held that confirmation and ordination conferred indelible character. Contemporary Anglican theology appears to reject this view in the case of Confirmation, recognizing no separate character of Confirmation apart from the baptismal character. Although the Episcopal Church makes no such specific claim about ordination, it acts as though ordination were indelible. One who has abandoned or renounced the ordained ministry, or even been deposed from it, is not reordained if he or she is reinstated. Instead, the person is formally restored to the order already held.\nParticular consecrations.\nOld Catholics and Old Roman Catholics.\nArnold Mathew, according to Buchanan, \"lapsed into the vagaries of an \"\"\".335 Stephen Edmonds, in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", wrote that in 1910 Mathew's wife separated from him; that same year, he declared himself and his church seceded from the Union of Utrecht. Within a few months, on 2 November 1911, he was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church. He later sued \"The Times\" for libel based on the words \"pseudo-bishop\" used to describe him in the newspaper's translation from the Latin text \"\", and, lost his case in 1913.\nHenry R.T. Brandreth wrote, in \"Episcopi Vagantes and the Anglican Church\", \"[o]ne of the most regrettable features of Mathew's episcopate was the founding of the Order of Corporate Reunion (OCR) in 1908. This claimed to be a revival of Frederick George Lee's movement, but was in fact unconnected with it\". Brandreth thought it \"seems still to exist in a shadowy underground way\" in 1947, but disconnected.18 Colin Holden, in \"Ritualist on a Tricycle\", places Mathew and his OCR into perspective, he wrote Mathew was an \", lived in a cottage provided for him, and performed his conditional OCR acts, sometimes called according to Holden \"bedroom ordinations\", in his cottage. Mathew questioned the validity of Anglican ordinations and became involved with the OCR, in 1911 according to Edmonds, and he openly advertised his offer to reordain Anglican clergy who requested it. This angered the Church of England.\nIn 1912, D. J. Scannell O'Neill wrote in \"The Fortnightly Review\" that London \"seems to have more than her due share of bishops\" and enumerates what he refers to as \"these hireling shepherds\". He also announces that one of them, Mathew, revived the OCR and published \"The Torch\", a monthly review, advocating the reconstruction of Western Christianity and reunion with Eastern Christianity. \"The Torch\" stated \"that the ordinations of the Church of England are not recognized by any church claiming to be Catholic\" so the promoters involved Mathew to conditionally ordain group members who are \"clergy of the Established Church\" and \"sign a profession of the Catholic Faith\". It stipulated Mathew's services were not a system of simony and given without simoniac expectations. The group sought to enroll \"earnest-minded Catholics who sincerely desire to help forward the work of [c]orporate [r]eunion with the Holy See\". Nigel Yates, in \"Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910\", described it as \"an even more bizarre scheme to promote a Catholic Uniate Church in Britain\" than Lee and Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle's Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom. It was editorialized by O'Neill that the \"most charitable construction to be placed on this latest move of Mathew is that he is not mentally sound. Being an Irishman, it is strange that he has not sufficient humor to see the absurdity of falling away from the Catholic Church in order to assist others to unite with the Holy See\". Edmonds reports that \"anything between 4 and 265 was suggested\" as to how many took up his offer of reordination.\nEastern Orthodox.\nWithin the Eastern Orthodox Church, Aftimios Ofiesh was consecrated by Archbishop Evodkim Meschersky. He later, with Metropolitan Platon of the present-day Orthodox Church in America, established the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Through Ofiesh and the American Orthodox Catholic Church, men such as Sophronios Beshara, Ignatius Nichols (considered also an Independent Old Catholic wandering bishop), and Joseph Zuk were consecrated.\nBeshara continued to lead the American Orthodox Catholic Church\u2014whose canonical status was disputed and rejected\u2014and Nichols was deposed, continuing to work with Independent Catholics and consecrating others. Notably, one of the many men consecrated by Nichols was Bishop Alexander Turner, who was received into the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch after an eight-year probationary period. He would be one of the principal founders of the Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate. Zuk would later become a bishop of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA, which would later join under the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Christopher Contogeorge, consecrated by Beshara in the American Orthodox Catholic Church, would also serve in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and as exarch for the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is known for being the first woman to qualify in Britain as a physician and surgeon and as a co-founder and dean of the London School of Medicine for Women, which was the first medical school in Britain to train women as doctors. She was the first female dean of a British medical school, the first woman in Britain to be elected to a school board and, as mayor of Aldeburgh, the first female mayor in Britain.\nEarly life.\nElizabeth was born in Whitechapel, London, and was the second of eleven children of Newson Garrett (1812\u20131893), from Leiston, Suffolk, and his wife, Louisa (born Dunnell; c. 1813\u20131903), from London.\nHer paternal ancestors had been ironworkers in East Suffolk since the early seventeenth century. Newson was the youngest of three sons and not academically inclined, although he possessed the family's entrepreneurial spirit. When he finished school, Newson found few opportunities in Leiston, so he moved to London to make his fortune. There, he fell in love with his brother's sister-in-law, Louisa Dunnell, the daughter of an innkeeper of Suffolk origin. After their wedding, the couple went to live in a pawnbroker's shop at 1 Commercial Road, Whitechapel. The Garretts had their first three children in quick succession: Louisa, Elizabeth, and a son, Dunnell, who died at the age of six months. When Garrett was three years old, the family moved to 142 Long Acre, where they lived for two years, while one more child was born and her father advanced in his career, becoming not only the manager of a larger pawnbroker's shop, but also a silversmith. Garrett's grandfather, owner of the family engineering works, Richard Garrett &amp; Sons, had died in 1837, leaving the business to his eldest son, Garrett's uncle. Despite his lack of capital, Newson was determined to be successful and in 1841, at the age of 29, he moved his family to Suffolk, where he bought a barley and coal merchants business in Snape, constructing Snape Maltings from 1846.\nThe Garretts lived in a square Georgian house opposite the church in Aldeburgh until 1852. Newson's malting business expanded and more children were born, Edmund (1840), Alice (1842), Agnes (1845), Millicent (1847), who was to become a leader in the constitutional campaign for women's suffrage, Sam (1850), Josephine (1853) and George (1854). By 1850, Newson was a prosperous businessman and was able to build Alde House, a mansion on a hill behind Aldeburgh. A \"by-product of the industrial revolution\", Garrett grew up in an atmosphere of \"triumphant economic pioneering\" and the Garrett children were to grow up to become achievers in the professional classes of late-Victorian England. Elizabeth was encouraged to take an interest in local politics and, contrary to practices at the time, was allowed the freedom to explore the town with its nearby salt-marshes, beach and the small port of Slaughden with its boatbuilders' yards and sailmakers' lofts.\nEarly education.\nThere was no school in Aldeburgh, so Garrett learned reading, writing, and arithmetic from her mother. When she was 10 years old, a governess, Miss Edgeworth, a poor gentlewoman, was employed to educate Garrett and her sister. Mornings were spent in the schoolroom; there were regimented afternoon walks; educating the young ladies continued at mealtimes when Edgeworth ate with the family; at night, the governess slept in a curtained off area in the girls' bedroom. Garrett reportedly despised her governess and sought to outwit the teacher in the classroom. When Garrett was 13 and her sister 15, they were sent to a private school, the Boarding School for Ladies in Blackheath, London, which was run by the step aunts of the poet Robert Browning. There, English literature, French, Italian and German as well as deportment, were taught.\nLater in life, Garrett recalled the stupidity of her teachers there, though her schooling there did help establish a love of reading. Her main complaint about the school was the lack of science and mathematics instruction. Her reading there included works of Tennyson, Wordsworth, Milton, Coleridge, Trollope, Thackeray and George Eliot. Elizabeth and Louie were known as \"the bathing Garretts\", as their father had insisted they be allowed a hot bath once a week. However, they made what were to be lifelong friends there. When they finished in 1851, they were sent on a short tour abroad, ending with a memorable visit to the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London.\nAfter this formal education, Garrett spent the next nine years tending to domestic duties, but she continued to study Latin and arithmetic in the mornings and also read widely. Her sister Millicent recalled Garrett's weekly lectures, \"Talks on Things in General\", when her younger siblings would gather while she discussed politics and current affairs from Garibaldi to Macaulay's \"History of England\". In 1854, when she was eighteen, Garrett and her sister went on a long visit to their school friends, Jane and Anne Crow, in Gateshead where she met Emily Davies, the early feminist and future co-founder of Girton College, Cambridge. Davies was to be a lifelong friend and confidante, always ready to give sound advice during the important decisions of Garrett's career. It may have been in the \"English Woman's Journal\", first issued in 1858, that Garrett first read of Elizabeth Blackwell, who had become the first female doctor in the United States in 1849. When Blackwell visited London in 1859, Garrett travelled to the capital. By then, her sister Louie was married and living in London. Garrett joined the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, which organised Blackwell's lectures on \"Medicine as a Profession for Ladies\" and set up a private meeting between Garrett and the doctor. It is said that during a visit to Alde House around 1860, one evening while sitting by the fireside, Garrett and Davies selected careers for advancing the frontiers of women's rights; Garrett was to open the medical profession to women, Davies the doors to a university education for women, while 13-year-old Millicent was allocated politics and votes for women. At first Newson was opposed to the radical idea of his daughter becoming a physician but came round and agreed to do all in his power, both financially and otherwise, to support Garrett.\nMedical education.\nAfter an initial unsuccessful visit to leading doctors in Harley Street, Garrett decided to first spend six months as a surgery nurse at Middlesex Hospital, London in August 1860. On proving to be a good nurse, she was allowed to attend an outpatients' clinic, then her first operation. She unsuccessfully attempted to enroll in the hospital's Medical School but was allowed to attend private tuition in Latin, Greek and pharmacology with the hospital's apothecary, while continuing her work as a nurse. She also employed a tutor to study anatomy and physiology three evenings a week. Eventually she was allowed into the dissecting room and the chemistry lectures. Gradually, Garrett became an unwelcome presence among the male students, who in 1861 presented a memorial to the school against her admittance as a fellow student, despite the support she enjoyed from the administration. She was obliged to leave the Middlesex Hospital but she did so with an honours certificate in chemistry and \"materia medica\". Garrett then applied to several medical schools, including Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and the Royal College of Surgeons, all of which refused her admittance.\nA companion to Garrett in this effort was the lesser known Sophia Jex-Blake. While both are considered \"outstanding\" medical figures of the late 19th century, Garrett was able to obtain her credentials by way of a \"side door\" through a loophole in admissions at the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Having privately obtained a certificate in anatomy and physiology, she was admitted in 1862 by the Society of Apothecaries who, as a condition of their charter, could not legally exclude her on account of her sex. She was the only woman in the Apothecaries Hall who sat the exam that year. Among the 51 male candidates was William Heath Strange, who went on to found the Hampstead General Hospital, which was on the site now occupied by the Royal Free Hospital. She continued her battle to qualify by studying privately with various professors, including some at the University of St Andrews, the Edinburgh Royal Maternity and the London Hospital Medical School.\nIn 1865, Garrett finally took her exam and obtained a licence (LSA) from the Society of Apothecaries to practise medicine, the first woman qualified in Britain to do so openly (previously there was Dr James Barry who was born and raised female but presented as male from the age of 20). On the day, three out of seven candidates passed the exam, Garrett with the highest marks. The Society of Apothecaries immediately amended its regulations to prevent other women obtaining a licence meaning that Jex-Blake could not follow this same path; the new rule disallowed privately educated women to be eligible for examination. It was not until 1876 that the new Medical Act (39 and 40 Vict, Ch. 41) passed, which allowed British medical authorities to license all qualified applicants whatever their gender.\nCareer.\nThough she was now a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, as a woman, Garrett could not hold a medical post in any hospital. So in late 1865, Garrett opened her own practice at 20 Upper Berkeley Street, London. At first patients were scarce, but the practice gradually grew. After six months in practice, she wished to open an outpatients dispensary, to enable poor women to obtain medical help from a qualified practitioner of their own gender. In 1865, there was an outbreak of cholera in Britain, affecting both rich and poor, and in their panic, some people forgot any prejudices they had in relation to a female physician. The first death due to cholera occurred in 1866, but by then Garrett had already opened St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children, at 69 Seymour Place. In the first year, she tended to 3,000 new patients, who made 9,300 outpatient visits to the dispensary. On hearing that the Dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Sorbonne, Paris was in favour of admitting women as medical students, Garrett studied French so that she could apply for a medical degree, which she obtained in 1870 after some difficulty.\nThe same year she was elected to the first London School Board, an office newly opened to women; Garrett's was the highest vote among all the candidates. Also in that year, she was made a visiting physician of the East London Hospital for Children (later the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children), becoming the first woman in Britain to be appointed to a medical post, but she found the duties of these two positions to be incompatible with her principal work in her private practice and the dispensary, as well as her role as a new mother, so she resigned from these posts by 1873. In 1872, the dispensary became the New Hospital for Women and Children, treating women from all over London for gynaecological conditions; the hospital moved to new premises in Marylebone Street in 1874. Around this time, Garrett also entered into discussion with male medical views regarding women. In 1874, Henry Maudsley's article on Sex and Mind in Education appeared, which argued that education for women caused over-exertion and thus reduced their reproductive capacity, sometimes causing \"nervous and even mental disorders\". Garrett's counter-argument was that the real danger for women was not education but boredom and that fresh air and exercise were preferable to sitting by the fire with a novel. In the same year, she co-founded the London School of Medicine for Women with Sophia Jex-Blake and became a lecturer in what was then the only teaching hospital in Britain to offer courses for women. She continued to work there for the rest of her career and was dean of the school from 1883 to 1902. This school was later called the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, and became part of the medical school of University College London.\nBMA membership.\nIn 1873, Garrett gained membership of the British Medical Association (BMA). In 1878, a motion was proposed to exclude women following the election of Garrett Anderson and Frances Hoggan. The motion was opposed by Dr Norman Kerr who maintained the equal rights of members. This was \"one of several instances where Garrett, uniquely, was able to enter a hitherto all male medical institution which subsequently moved formally to exclude any women who might seek to follow her.\" In 1892, women were again admitted to the British Medical Association following a long campaign by Anderson and others. She, along with Dr Sarah Gray and Dr Eliza Walker Dunbar attended the BMA meeting at Nottingham that year, lobbying successfully for the readmission of women to the association. In 1897, Garrett Anderson was elected president of the East Anglian branch of the BMA.\nGarrett Anderson worked steadily at the development of the New Hospital for Women and Children and in 1874 co-founded and served as dean of the London School of Medicine for Women (LSMW). Both institutions were handsomely and suitably housed and equipped. The New Hospital for Women commissioned a building in the Euston Road; the architect was J. M. Brydon, who took into his employment Anderson's sister Agnes Garrett and her cousin Rhoda Garrett, who contributed to its design. For many years, the hospital was staffed entirely by medical women. The schools (in Hunter Street, WC1) had over 200 students, most of them preparing for the medical degree of London University, which was opened to women in 1877.\nWomen\u2019s suffrage movement.\nGarrett Anderson was also active in the women's suffrage movement. In 1866, Garrett Anderson and Davies presented petitions with more than 1,500 signatures asking that female heads of household be given the right to vote. That year, Garrett Anderson joined the first British Women's Suffrage Committee. She was not as active as her sister, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, though Garrett Anderson became a member of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1889. After her husband's death in 1907, she became more active. As mayor of Aldeburgh, she gave speeches for suffrage, before the increasing militant activity in the movement led to her withdrawal in 1911. Her daughter Louisa, also a physician, was more active and more militant, spending time in prison in 1912 for her suffrage activities.\nPersonal life.\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson once remarked that \"a doctor leads two lives, the professional and the private, and the boundaries between the two are never traversed\". In 1871, she married James George Skelton Anderson (died 1907) of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, but she did not give up her medical practice. She had three children, Louisa (1873\u20131943), Margaret (1874\u20131875), who died of meningitis, and Alan (1877\u20131952). Louisa also became a pioneering doctor of medicine and feminist activist.\nThey retired to Aldeburgh in 1902, moving to Alde House in 1903, after the death of Elizabeth's mother. Skelton died of a stroke in 1907. She enjoyed a happy marriage and in later life, devoted time to Alde House, gardening, and travelling with younger members of the extended family.\nOn 9 November 1908, she was elected mayor of Aldeburgh, the first female mayor in England. Her father had been mayor in 1889.\nShe died in 1917 and is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul's Church, Aldeburgh.\nLegacy.\nThe New Hospital for Women was renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in 1918 and amalgamated with the Obstetric Hospital in 2001 to form the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital before relocating to become the University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing at UCH.\nThe former Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital buildings are incorporated into the new National Headquarters for the public service trade union UNISON. The Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Gallery, a permanent installation set within the restored hospital building, uses a variety of media to set the story of Garrett Anderson, her hospital, and women's struggle to achieve equality in the field of medicine within the wider framework of 19th and 20th century social history.\nThe critical care centre at Ipswich Hospital was named the Garrett Anderson Centre in her honour and in recognition of her connection to the county of Suffolk.\nThe new medical school at the University of Worcester, due to accept its first students in 2023, is to be called the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Building.\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson School, a secondary school for girls in Islington, London, is named after her.\nThe archives of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson are held at the Women's Library at the London School of Economics. The archives of the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital (formerly the New Hospital for Women) are held at the London Metropolitan Archives.\nOn 9 June 2016, Google Doodle commemorated her 180th birthday.\nThe Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Programme of the NHS Leadership Academy is a master's degree in leadership and management.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9696", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9696", "title": "Erosion", "text": "Natural processes removing soil and rock\nErosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that removes soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust and then transports it to another location where it is deposited. Erosion is distinct from weathering which involves no movement. Removal of rock or soil as clastic sediment is referred to as \"physical\" or \"mechanical\" erosion; this contrasts with \"chemical\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by dissolution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres.\nAgents of erosion include rainfall; bedrock wear in rivers; coastal erosion by the sea and waves; glacial plucking, abrasion, and scour; areal flooding; wind abrasion; groundwater processes; and mass movement processes in steep landscapes like landslides and debris flows. The rates at which such processes act control how fast a surface is eroded. Typically, physical erosion proceeds the fastest on steeply sloping surfaces, and rates may also be sensitive to some climatically controlled properties including amounts of water supplied (e.g., by rain), storminess, wind speed, wave fetch, or atmospheric temperature (especially for some ice-related processes). Feedbacks are also possible between rates of erosion and the amount of eroded material that is already carried by, for example, a river or glacier. The transport of eroded materials from their original location is followed by deposition, which is arrival and emplacement of material at a new location.\nWhile erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10\u201340 times the rate at which soil erosion is occurring globally. At agriculture sites in the Appalachian Mountains, intensive farming practices have caused erosion at up to 100 times the natural rate of erosion in the region. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both \"on-site\" and \"off-site\" problems. On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers. In some cases, this leads to desertification. Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems worldwide.\nIntensive agriculture, deforestation, roads, anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion. However, there are many prevention and remediation practices that can curtail or limit erosion of vulnerable soils.\nPhysical processes.\nRainfall and surface runoff.\nRainfall, and the surface runoff which may result from rainfall, produces four main types of soil erosion: \"splash erosion\", \"sheet erosion\", \"rill erosion\", and \"gully erosion\". Splash erosion is generally seen as the first and least severe stage in the soil erosion process, which is followed by sheet erosion, then rill erosion and finally gully erosion (the most severe of the four).\nIn \"splash erosion\", the impact of a falling raindrop creates a small crater in the soil, ejecting soil particles. The distance these soil particles travel can be as much as vertically and horizontally on level ground.\nIf the soil is saturated, or if the rainfall rate is greater than the rate at which water can infiltrate into the soil, surface runoff occurs. If the runoff has sufficient flow energy, it will transport loosened soil particles (sediment) down the slope. \"Sheet erosion\" is the transport of loosened soil particles by overland flow.\n\"Rill erosion\" refers to the development of small, ephemeral concentrated flow paths which function as both sediment source and sediment delivery systems for erosion on hillslopes. Generally, where water erosion rates on disturbed upland areas are greatest, rills are active. Flow depths in rills are typically of the order of a few centimetres (about an inch) or less and along-channel slopes may be quite steep. This means that rills exhibit hydraulic physics very different from water flowing through the deeper, wider channels of streams and rivers.\n\"Gully erosion\" occurs when runoff water accumulates and rapidly flows in narrow channels during or immediately after heavy rains or melting snow, removing soil to a considerable depth. A gully is distinguished from a rill based on a critical cross-sectional area of at least one square foot, i.e. the size of a channel that can no longer be erased via normal tillage operations.\nExtreme gully erosion can progress to formation of badlands. These form under conditions of high relief on easily eroded bedrock in climates favorable to erosion. Conditions or disturbances that limit the growth of protective vegetation (rhexistasy) are a key element of badland formation.\nRivers and streams.\n\"Valley\" or \"stream erosion\" occurs with continued water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both downward, deepening the valley, and headward, extending the valley into the hillside, creating head cuts and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical V-shaped cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some base level is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream meanders across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, pebbles, and boulders can also act erosively as they traverse a surface, in a process known as \"traction\".\n\"Bank erosion\" is the wearing away of the banks of a stream or river. This is distinguished from changes on the bed of the watercourse, which is referred to as \"scour\". Erosion and changes in the form of river banks may be measured by inserting metal rods into the bank and marking the position of the bank surface along the rods at different times.\n\"Thermal erosion\" is the result of melting and weakening permafrost due to moving water. It can occur both along rivers and at the coast. Rapid river channel migration observed in the Lena River of Siberia is due to thermal erosion, as these portions of the banks are composed of permafrost-cemented non-cohesive materials. Much of this erosion occurs as the weakened banks fail in large slumps. Thermal erosion also affects the Arctic coast, where wave action and near-shore temperatures combine to undercut permafrost bluffs along the shoreline and cause them to fail. Annual erosion rates along a segment of the Beaufort Sea shoreline averaged per year from 1955 to 2002.\nMost river erosion happens nearer to the mouth of a river. On a river bend, the longest least sharp side has slower moving water. Here deposits build up. On the narrowest sharpest side of the bend, there is faster moving water so this side tends to erode away mostly.\nRapid erosion by a large river can remove enough sediments to produce a river anticline, as isostatic rebound raises rock beds unburdened by erosion of overlying beds.\nCoastal erosion.\nShoreline erosion, which occurs on both exposed and sheltered coasts, primarily occurs through the action of currents and waves but sea level (tidal) change can also play a role.\n\"Hydraulic action\" takes place when the air in a joint is suddenly compressed by a wave closing the entrance of the joint. This then cracks it. \"Wave pounding\" is when the sheer energy of the wave hitting the cliff or rock breaks pieces off. \"Abrasion\" or \"corrasion\" is caused by waves launching sea load at the cliff. It is the most effective and rapid form of shoreline erosion (not to be confused with \"corrosion\"). \"Corrosion\" is the dissolving of rock by carbonic acid in sea water. Limestone cliffs are particularly vulnerable to this kind of erosion. \"Attrition\" is where particles/sea load carried by the waves are worn down as they hit each other and the cliffs. This then makes the material easier to wash away. The material ends up as shingle and sand. Another significant source of erosion, particularly on carbonate coastlines, is boring, scraping and grinding of organisms, a process termed \"bioerosion\".\nSediment is transported along the coast in the direction of the prevailing current (longshore drift). When the upcurrent supply of sediment is less than the amount being carried away, erosion occurs. When the upcurrent amount of sediment is greater, sand or gravel banks will tend to form as a result of deposition. These banks may slowly migrate along the coast in the direction of the longshore drift, alternately protecting and exposing parts of the coastline. Where there is a bend in the coastline, quite often a buildup of eroded material occurs forming a long narrow bank (a spit). Armoured beaches and submerged offshore sandbanks may also protect parts of a coastline from erosion. Over the years, as the shoals gradually shift, the erosion may be redirected to attack different parts of the shore.\nErosion of a coastal surface, followed by a fall in sea level, can produce a distinctive landform called a raised beach.\nChemical erosion.\nChemical erosion is the loss of matter in a landscape in the form of solutes. Chemical erosion is usually calculated from the solutes found in streams. Anders Rapp pioneered the study of chemical erosion in his work about K\u00e4rkevagge published in 1960.\nFormation of sinkholes and other features of karst topography is an example of extreme chemical erosion.\nGlaciers.\nGlaciers erode predominantly by three different processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, in addition to the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations. In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved channel cross-section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide a numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped U-shaped valley\u2014approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of over deepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.\nGlaciers can also cause pieces of bedrock to crack off in the process of plucking. In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. This method produced some of the many thousands of lake basins that dot the edge of the Canadian Shield. Differences in the height of mountain ranges are not only being the result tectonic forces, such as rock uplift, but also local climate variations. Scientists use global analysis of topography to show that glacial erosion controls the maximum height of mountains, as the relief between mountain peaks and the snow line are generally confined to altitudes less than 1500\u00a0m. The erosion caused by glaciers worldwide erodes mountains so effectively that the term \"glacial buzzsaw\" has become widely used, which describes the limiting effect of glaciers on the height of mountain ranges. As mountains grow higher, they generally allow for more glacial activity (especially in the accumulation zone above the glacial equilibrium line altitude), which causes increased rates of erosion of the mountain, decreasing mass faster than isostatic rebound can add to the mountain. This provides a good example of a negative feedback loop. Ongoing research is showing that while glaciers tend to decrease mountain size, in some areas, glaciers can actually reduce the rate of erosion, acting as a \"glacial armor\". Ice can not only erode mountains but also protect them from erosion. Depending on glacier regime, even steep alpine lands can be preserved through time with the help of ice. Scientists have proved this theory by sampling eight summits of northwestern Svalbard using Be10 and Al26, showing that northwestern Svalbard transformed from a glacier-erosion state under relatively mild glacial maxima temperature, to a glacier-armor state occupied by cold-based, protective ice during much colder glacial maxima temperatures as the Quaternary ice age progressed.\nThese processes, combined with erosion and transport by the water network beneath the glacier, leave behind glacial landforms such as moraines, drumlins, ground moraine (till), glaciokarst, kames, kame deltas, moulins, and glacial erratics in their wake, typically at the terminus or during glacier retreat.\nThe best-developed glacial valley morphology appears to be restricted to landscapes with low rock uplift rates (less than or equal to 2mm per year) and high relief, leading to long-turnover times. Where rock uplift rates exceed 2mm per year, glacial valley morphology has generally been significantly modified in postglacial time. Interplay of glacial erosion and tectonic forcing governs the morphologic impact of glaciations on active orogens, by both influencing their height, and by altering the patterns of erosion during subsequent glacial periods via a link between rock uplift and valley cross-sectional shape.\nFloods.\nAt extremely high flows, kolks, or vortices are formed by large volumes of rapidly rushing water. Kolks cause extreme local erosion, plucking bedrock and creating pothole-type geographical features called rock-cut basins. Examples can be seen in the flood regions result from glacial Lake Missoula, which created the channeled scablands in the Columbia Basin region of eastern Washington.\nWind erosion.\nWind erosion is a major geomorphological force, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also a major source of land degradation, evaporation, desertification, harmful airborne dust, and crop damage\u2014especially after being increased far above natural rates by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture.\nWind erosion is of two primary varieties: \"deflation\", where the wind picks up and carries away loose particles; and \"abrasion\", where surfaces are worn down as they are struck by airborne particles carried by wind. Deflation is divided into three categories: (1) \"surface creep\", where larger, heavier particles slide or roll along the ground; (2) \"saltation\", where particles are lifted a short height into the air, and bounce and saltate across the surface of the soil; and (3) \"suspension\", where very small and light particles are lifted into the air by the wind, and are often carried for long distances. Saltation is responsible for the majority (50\u201370%) of wind erosion, followed by suspension (30\u201340%), and then surface creep (5\u201325%).\nWind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.\nMass wasting.\n\"Mass wasting\" or \"mass movement\" is the downward and outward movement of rock and sediments on a sloped surface, mainly due to the force of gravity.\nMass wasting is an important part of the erosional process and is often the first stage in the breakdown and transport of weathered materials in mountainous areas. It moves material from higher elevations to lower elevations where other eroding agents such as streams and glaciers can then pick up the material and move it to even lower elevations. Mass-wasting processes are always occurring continuously on all slopes; some mass-wasting processes act very slowly; others occur very suddenly, often with disastrous results. Any perceptible down-slope movement of rock or sediment is often referred to in general terms as a landslide. However, landslides can be classified in a much more detailed way that reflects the mechanisms responsible for the movement and the velocity at which the movement occurs. One of the visible topographical manifestations of rapid rockfall activity is a scree slope, which consists of accumulated loose rock debris at the base of cliffs or steep slopes.\n\"Slumping\" happens on steep hillsides, occurring along distinct fracture zones, often within materials like clay that, once released, may move quite rapidly downhill. They will often show a spoon-shaped isostatic depression, in which the material has begun to slide downhill. In some cases, the slump is caused by water beneath the slope weakening it. In many cases it is simply the result of poor engineering along highways where it is a regular occurrence.\n\"Surface creep\" is the slow movement of soil and rock debris by gravity which is usually not perceptible except through extended observation. However, the term can also describe the rolling of dislodged soil particles in diameter by wind along the soil surface.\nSubmarine sediment gravity flows.\nOn the continental slope, erosion of the ocean floor to create channels and submarine canyons can result from the rapid downslope flow of sediment gravity flows, bodies of sediment-laden water that move rapidly downslope as turbidity currents. Where erosion by turbidity currents creates oversteepened slopes it can also trigger underwater landslides and debris flows. Turbidity currents can erode channels and canyons into substrates ranging from recently deposited unconsolidated sediments to hard crystalline bedrock. Almost all continental slopes and deep ocean basins display such channels and canyons resulting from sediment gravity flows and submarine canyons act as conduits for the transfer of sediment from the continents and shallow marine environments to the deep sea. Turbidites, which are the sedimentary deposits resulting from turbidity currents, comprise some of the thickest and largest sedimentary sequences on Earth, indicating that the associated erosional processes must also have played a prominent role in Earth's history.\nFactors affecting erosion rates.\nClimate.\nThe amount and intensity of precipitation is the main climatic factor governing soil erosion by water. The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by vegetation. This might be during periods when agricultural activities leave the soil bare, or in semi-arid regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion.\nIn some areas of the world (e.g. the mid-western US), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity (for a definition of \"erosivity\" check,) with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water. The size and velocity of rain drops is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater kinetic energy, and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops.\nIn other regions of the world (e.g. western Europe), runoff and erosion result from relatively low intensities of stratiform rainfall falling onto the previously saturated soil. In such situations, rainfall amount rather than intensity is the main factor determining the severity of soil erosion by water. According to the climate change projections, erosivity will increase significantly in Europe and soil erosion may increase by 13\u201322.5% by 2050 \nIn Taiwan, where typhoon frequency increased significantly in the 21st century, a strong link has been drawn between the increase in storm frequency with an increase in sediment load in rivers and reservoirs, highlighting the impacts climate change can have on erosion.\nVegetative cover.\nVegetation acts as an interface between the atmosphere and the soil. It increases the permeability of the soil to rainwater, thus decreasing runoff. It shelters the soil from winds, which results in decreased wind erosion, as well as advantageous changes in microclimate. The roots of the plants bind the soil together, and interweave with other roots, forming a more solid mass that is less susceptible to both water and wind erosion. The removal of vegetation increases the rate of surface erosion.\nTopography.\nThe topography of the land determines the velocity at which surface runoff will flow, which in turn determines the erosivity of the runoff. Longer, steeper slopes (especially those without adequate vegetative cover) are more susceptible to very high rates of erosion during heavy rains than shorter, less steep slopes. Steeper terrain is also more prone to mudslides, landslides, and other forms of gravitational erosion processes.\nTectonics.\nTectonic processes control rates and distributions of erosion at the Earth's surface. If the tectonic action causes part of the Earth's surface (e.g., a mountain range) to be raised or lowered relative to surrounding areas, this must necessarily change the gradient of the land surface. Because erosion rates are almost always sensitive to the local slope (see above), this will change the rates of erosion in the uplifted area. Active tectonics also brings fresh, unweathered rock towards the surface, where it is exposed to the action of erosion.\nHowever, erosion can also affect tectonic processes. The removal by erosion of large amounts of rock from a particular region, and its deposition elsewhere, can result in a lightening of the load on the lower crust and mantle. Because tectonic processes are driven by gradients in the stress field developed in the crust, this unloading can in turn cause tectonic or isostatic uplift in the region. In some cases, it has been hypothesised that these twin feedbacks can act to localize and enhance zones of very rapid exhumation of deep crustal rocks beneath places on the Earth's surface with extremely high erosion rates, for example, beneath the extremely steep terrain of Nanga Parbat in the western Himalayas. Such a place has been called a \"tectonic aneurysm\".\nDevelopment.\nHuman land development, in forms including agricultural and urban development, is considered a significant factor in erosion and sediment transport, which aggravate food insecurity. In Taiwan, increases in sediment load in the northern, central, and southern regions of the island can be tracked with the timeline of development for each region throughout the 20th century. The intentional removal of soil and rock by humans is a form of erosion that has been named \"lisasion\".\nErosion at various scales.\nMountain ranges.\nMountain ranges take millions of years to erode to the degree they effectively cease to exist. Scholars Pitman and Golovchenko estimate that it takes probably more than 450 million years to erode a mountain mass similar to the Himalaya into an almost-flat peneplain if there are no significant sea-level changes. Erosion of mountains massifs can create a pattern of equally high summits called summit accordance. It has been argued that extension during post-orogenic collapse is a more effective mechanism of lowering the height of orogenic mountains than erosion.\nExamples of heavily eroded mountain ranges include the Timanides of Northern Russia. Erosion of this orogen has produced sediments that are now found in the East European Platform, including the Cambrian Sablya Formation near Lake Ladoga. Studies of these sediments indicate that it is likely that the erosion of the orogen began in the Cambrian and then intensified in the Ordovician.\nSoils.\nIf the erosion rate exceeds soil formation, erosion destroys the soil. Lower rates of erosion can prevent the formation of soil features that take time to develop. Inceptisols develop on eroded landscapes that, if stable, would have supported the formation of more developed Alfisols.\nWhile erosion of soils is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10\u201340 times the rate at which erosion occurs globally. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both \"on-site\" and \"off-site\" problems. On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers. In some cases, the eventual result is desertification. Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems.\nOften in the United States, farmers cultivating highly erodible land must comply with a conservation plan to be eligible for agricultural assistance.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9697", "revid": "26394783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9697", "title": "Euclidean space", "text": "Fundamental space of geometry\nEuclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry, intended to represent physical space. Originally, in Euclid's \"Elements\", it was the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, but in modern mathematics there are \"Euclidean spaces\" of any positive integer dimension \"n\", which are called Euclidean \"n\"-spaces when one wants to specify their dimension. For \"n\" equal to one or two, they are commonly called respectively Euclidean lines and Euclidean planes. The qualifier \"Euclidean\" is used to distinguish Euclidean spaces from other spaces that were later considered in physics and modern mathematics.\nAncient Greek geometers introduced Euclidean space for modeling the physical space. Their work was collected by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in his \"Elements\", with the great innovation of \"proving\" all properties of the space as theorems, by starting from a few fundamental properties, called \"postulates\", which either were considered as evident (for example, there is exactly one straight line passing through two points), or seemed impossible to prove (parallel postulate).\nAfter the introduction at the end of the 19th century of non-Euclidean geometries, the old postulates were re-formalized to define Euclidean spaces through axiomatic theory. Another definition of Euclidean spaces by means of vector spaces and linear algebra has been shown to be equivalent to the axiomatic definition. It is this definition that is more commonly used in modern mathematics, and detailed in this article. In all definitions, Euclidean spaces consist of points, which are defined only by the properties that they must have for forming a Euclidean space.\nThere is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension; that is, all Euclidean spaces of a given dimension are isomorphic. Therefore, it is usually possible to work with a specific Euclidean space, denoted formula_1 or formula_2, which can be represented using Cartesian coordinates as the real n-space formula_3 equipped with the standard dot product.\nDefinition.\nHistory of the definition.\nEuclidean space was introduced by ancient Greeks as an abstraction of our physical space. Their great innovation, appearing in Euclid's \"Elements\", was to build and \"prove\" all geometry by starting from a few very basic properties, which are abstracted from the physical world, and cannot be mathematically proved because of the lack of more basic tools. These properties are called postulates, or axioms in modern language. This way of defining Euclidean space is still in use under the name of synthetic geometry.\nIn 1637, Ren\u00e9 Descartes introduced Cartesian coordinates, and showed that these allow reducing geometric problems to algebraic computations with numbers. This reduction of geometry to algebra was a major change in point of view, as, until then, the real numbers were defined in terms of lengths and distances.\nEuclidean geometry was not applied in spaces of dimension more than three until the 19th century. Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli generalized Euclidean geometry to spaces of dimension n, using both synthetic and algebraic methods, and discovered all of the regular polytopes (higher-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids) that exist in Euclidean spaces of any dimension.\nDespite the wide use of Descartes' approach, which was called analytic geometry, the definition of Euclidean space remained unchanged until the end of 19th century. The introduction of abstract vector spaces allowed their use in defining Euclidean spaces with a purely algebraic definition. This new definition has been shown to be equivalent to the classical definition in terms of geometric axioms. It is this algebraic definition that is now most often used for introducing Euclidean spaces.\nMotivation of the modern definition.\nOne way to think of the Euclidean plane is as a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angles. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the plane. One is translation, which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is rotation around a fixed point in the plane, in which all points in the plane turn around that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections (see below).\nIn order to make all of this mathematically precise, the theory must clearly define what is a Euclidean space, and the related notions of distance, angle, translation, and rotation. Even when used in physical theories, Euclidean space is an abstraction detached from actual physical locations, specific reference frames, measurement instruments, and so on. A purely mathematical definition of Euclidean space also ignores questions of units of length and other physical dimensions: the distance in a \"mathematical\" space is a number, not something expressed in inches or metres.\nThe standard way to mathematically define a Euclidean space, as carried out in the remainder of this article, is as a set of points on which a real vector space acts \u2013 the \"space of translations\" which is equipped with an inner product. The action of translations makes the space an affine space, and this allows defining lines, planes, subspaces, dimension, and parallelism. The inner product allows defining distance and angles.\nThe set formula_3 of n-tuples of real numbers equipped with the dot product is a Euclidean space of dimension n. Conversely, the choice of a point called the \"origin\" and an orthonormal basis of the space of translations is equivalent with defining an isomorphism between a Euclidean space of dimension n and formula_3 viewed as a Euclidean space.\nIt follows that everything that can be said about a Euclidean space can also be said about formula_6 Therefore, many authors, especially at elementary level, call formula_3 the standard Euclidean space of dimension n, or simply \"the\" Euclidean space of dimension n.\nA reason for introducing such an abstract definition of Euclidean spaces, and for working with formula_2 instead of formula_3 is that it is often preferable to work in a \"coordinate-free\" and \"origin-free\" manner (that is, without choosing a preferred basis and a preferred origin). Another reason is that there is no standard origin nor any standard basis in the physical world.\nTechnical definition.\nA &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Euclidean vector space is a finite-dimensional inner product space over the real numbers.\nA Euclidean space is an affine space over the reals such that the associated vector space is a Euclidean vector space. Euclidean spaces are sometimes called \"Euclidean affine spaces\" to distinguish them from Euclidean vector spaces.\nIf E is a Euclidean space, its associated vector space (Euclidean vector space) is often denoted formula_10 The \"dimension\" of a Euclidean space is the dimension of its associated vector space.\nThe elements of E are called \"points\", and are commonly denoted by capital letters. The elements of formula_11 are called \"Euclidean vectors\" or \"free vectors\". They are also called \"translations\", although, properly speaking, a translation is the geometric transformation resulting from the action of a Euclidean vector on the Euclidean space.\nThe action of a translation v on a point P provides a point that is denoted \"P\" + \"v\". This action satisfies\nformula_12\nNote: The second + in the left-hand side is a vector addition; each other + denotes an action of a vector on a point. This notation is not ambiguous, as, to distinguish between the two meanings of +, it suffices to look at the nature of its left argument.\nThe fact that the action is free and transitive means that, for every pair of points (\"P\", \"Q\"), there is exactly one displacement vector v such that \"P\" + \"v\" = \"Q\". This vector v is denoted \"Q\" \u2212 \"P\" or formula_13\nAs previously explained, some of the basic properties of Euclidean spaces result from the structure of affine space. They are described in and its subsections. The properties resulting from the inner product are explained in and its subsections.\nPrototypical examples.\nFor any vector space, the addition acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. Thus a Euclidean vector space can be viewed as a Euclidean space that has itself as the associated vector space.\nA typical case of Euclidean vector space is formula_3 viewed as a vector space equipped with the dot product as an inner product. The importance of this particular example of Euclidean space lies in the fact that every Euclidean space is isomorphic to it. More precisely, given a Euclidean space E of dimension n, the choice of a point, called an \"origin\" and an orthonormal basis of formula_11 defines an isomorphism of Euclidean spaces from E to formula_6\nAs every Euclidean space of dimension n is isomorphic to it, the Euclidean space formula_3 is sometimes called the \"standard Euclidean space\" of dimension n.\nAffine structure.\nSome basic properties of Euclidean spaces depend only on the fact that a Euclidean space is an affine space. They are called affine properties and include the concepts of lines, subspaces, and parallelism, which are detailed in next subsections.\nSubspaces.\nLet E be a Euclidean space and formula_11 its associated vector space.\nA \"flat\", \"Euclidean subspace\" or \"affine subspace\" of E is a subset F of E such that\nformula_19\nas the associated vector space of F is a linear subspace (vector subspace) of formula_10 A Euclidean subspace F is a Euclidean space with formula_21 as the associated vector space. This linear subspace formula_21 is also called the \"direction\" of F.\nIf P is a point of F then\nformula_23\nConversely, if P is a point of E and formula_24 is a linear subspace of formula_25 then\nformula_26\nis a Euclidean subspace of direction formula_24. (The associated vector space of this subspace is formula_24.)\nA Euclidean vector space formula_11 (that is, a Euclidean space that is equal to formula_11) has two sorts of subspaces: its Euclidean subspaces and its linear subspaces. Linear subspaces are Euclidean subspaces and a Euclidean subspace is a linear subspace if and only if it contains the zero vector.\nLines and segments.\nIn a Euclidean space, a \"line\" is a Euclidean subspace of dimension one. Since a vector space of dimension one is spanned by any nonzero vector, a line is a set of the form\nformula_31\nwhere P and Q are two distinct points of the Euclidean space as a part of the line.\nIt follows that \"there is exactly one line that passes through (contains) two distinct points.\" This implies that two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.\nA more symmetric representation of the line passing through P and Q is\nformula_32\nwhere O is an arbitrary point (not necessary on the line).\nIn a Euclidean vector space, the zero vector is usually chosen for O; this allows simplifying the preceding formula into\nformula_33\nA standard convention allows using this formula in every Euclidean space, see .\nThe \"line segment\", or simply \"segment\", joining the points P and Q is the subset of points such that 0 \u2264 \"\ud835\udf06\" \u2264 1 in the preceding formulas. It is denoted PQ or QP; that is\nformula_34\nParallelism.\nTwo subspaces S and T of the same dimension in a Euclidean space are \"parallel\" if they have the same direction (i.e., the same associated vector space). Equivalently, they are parallel, if there is a translation vector v that maps one to the other:\nformula_35\nGiven a point P and a subspace S, there exists exactly one subspace that contains P and is parallel to S, which is formula_36 In the case where S is a line (subspace of dimension one), this property is Playfair's axiom.\nIt follows that in a Euclidean plane, two lines either meet in one point or are parallel.\nThe concept of parallel subspaces has been extended to subspaces of different dimensions: two subspaces are parallel if the direction of one of them is contained in the direction to the other.\nMetric structure.\nThe vector space formula_11 associated to a Euclidean space E is an inner product space. This implies a symmetric bilinear form\nformula_38\nthat is positive definite (that is formula_39 is always positive for \"x\" \u2260 0).\nThe inner product of a Euclidean space is often called \"dot product\" and denoted \"x\" \u22c5 \"y\". This is specially the case when a Cartesian coordinate system has been chosen, as, in this case, the inner product of two vectors is the dot product of their coordinate vectors. For this reason, and for historical reasons, the dot notation is more commonly used than the bracket notation for the inner product of Euclidean spaces. This article will follow this usage; that is formula_40 will be denoted \"x\" \u22c5 \"y\" in the remainder of this article.\nThe Euclidean norm of a vector x is\nformula_41\nThe inner product and the norm allows expressing and proving metric and topological properties of Euclidean geometry. The next subsection describe the most fundamental ones. \"In these subsections,\" E \"denotes an arbitrary Euclidean space, and formula_11 denotes its vector space of translations.\"\nDistance and length.\nThe \"distance\" (more precisely the \"Euclidean distance\") between two points of a Euclidean space is the norm of the translation vector that maps one point to the other; that is\nformula_43\nThe \"length\" of a segment \"PQ\" is the distance \"d\"(\"P\", \"Q\") between its endpoints \"P\" and \"Q\". It is often denoted formula_44.\nThe distance is a metric, as it is positive definite, symmetric, and satisfies the triangle inequality\nformula_45\nMoreover, the equality is true if and only if a point R belongs to the segment \"PQ\". This inequality means that the length of any edge of a triangle is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the other edges. This is the origin of the term \"triangle inequality\".\nWith the Euclidean distance, every Euclidean space is a complete metric space.\nOrthogonality.\nTwo nonzero vectors u and v of formula_11 (the associated vector space of a Euclidean space E) are \"perpendicular\" or \"orthogonal\" if their inner product is zero:\nformula_47\nTwo linear subspaces of formula_11 are orthogonal if every nonzero vector of the first one is perpendicular to every nonzero vector of the second one. This implies that the intersection of the linear subspaces is reduced to the zero vector.\nTwo lines, and more generally two Euclidean subspaces (A line can be considered as one Euclidean subspace.) are orthogonal if their directions (the associated vector spaces of the Euclidean subspaces) are orthogonal. Two orthogonal lines that intersect are said \"perpendicular\".\nTwo segments \"AB\" and \"AC\" that share a common endpoint \"A\" are \"perpendicular\" or \"form a right angle\" if the vectors formula_49 and formula_50 are orthogonal.\nIf \"AB\" and \"AC\" form a right angle, one has\nformula_51\nThis is the Pythagorean theorem. Its proof is easy in this context, as, expressing this in terms of the inner product, one has, using bilinearity and symmetry of the inner product:\nformula_52\nHere, formula_53 is used since these two vectors are orthogonal.\nAngle.\nThe (non-oriented) \"angle\" \u03b8 between two nonzero vectors x and y in formula_11 is\nformula_55\nwhere arccos is the principal value of the arccosine function. By Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, the argument of the arccosine is in the interval [\u22121, 1]. Therefore \u03b8 is real, and 0 \u2264 \"\u03b8\" \u2264 \"\u03c0\" (or 0 \u2264 \"\u03b8\" \u2264 180 if angles are measured in degrees).\nAngles are not useful in a Euclidean line, as they can be only 0 or \u03c0.\nIn an oriented Euclidean plane, one can define the \"oriented angle\" of two vectors. The oriented angle of two vectors x and y is then the opposite of the oriented angle of y and x. In this case, the angle of two vectors can have any value modulo an integer multiple of 2\"\u03c0\". In particular, a reflex angle \"\u03c0\" &lt; \"\u03b8\" &lt; 2\"\u03c0\" equals the negative angle \u2212\"\u03c0\" &lt; \"\u03b8\" \u2212 2\"\u03c0\" &lt; 0.\nThe angle of two vectors does not change if they are multiplied by positive numbers. More precisely, if x and y are two vectors, and \u03bb and \u03bc are real numbers, then\nformula_56\nIf A, B, and C are three points in a Euclidean space, the angle of the segments \"AB\" and \"AC\" is the angle of the vectors formula_57 and formula_58 As the multiplication of vectors by positive numbers do not change the angle, the angle of two half-lines with initial point A can be defined: it is the angle of the segments \"AB\" and \"AC\", where B and C are arbitrary points, one on each half-line. Although this is less used, one can define similarly the angle of segments or half-lines that do not share an initial point.\nThe angle of two lines is defined as follows. If \u03b8 is the angle of two segments, one on each line, the angle of any two other segments, one on each line, is either \u03b8 or \"\u03c0\" \u2212 \"\u03b8\". One of these angles is in the interval [0, \"\u03c0\"/2], and the other being in [\"\u03c0\"/2, \"\u03c0\"]. The \"non-oriented angle\" of the two lines is the one in the interval [0, \"\u03c0\"/2]. In an oriented Euclidean plane, the \"oriented angle\" of two lines belongs to the interval [\u2212\"\u03c0\"/2, \"\u03c0\"/2].\nCartesian coordinates.\nEvery Euclidean vector space has an orthonormal basis (in fact, infinitely many in dimension higher than one, and two in dimension one), that is a basis formula_59 of unit vectors (formula_60) that are pairwise orthogonal (formula_61 for \"i\" \u2260 \"j\"). More precisely, given any basis formula_62 the Gram\u2013Schmidt process computes an orthonormal basis such that, for every i, the linear spans of formula_63 and formula_64 are equal.\nGiven a Euclidean space E, a \"Cartesian frame\" is a set of data consisting of an orthonormal basis of formula_25 and a point of E, called the \"origin\" and often denoted O. A Cartesian frame formula_66 allows defining Cartesian coordinates for both E and formula_11 in the following way.\nThe Cartesian coordinates of a vector v of formula_11 are the coefficients of v on the orthonormal basis formula_69 For example, the Cartesian coordinates of a vector formula_70 on an orthonormal basis formula_71 (that may be named as formula_72 as a convention) in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space is formula_73 if formula_74. As the basis is orthonormal, the i-th coefficient formula_75 is equal to the dot product formula_76\nThe Cartesian coordinates of a point P of E are the Cartesian coordinates of the vector formula_77\nOther coordinates.\nAs a Euclidean space is an affine space, one can consider an affine frame on it, which is the same as a Euclidean frame, except that the basis is not required to be orthonormal. This define affine coordinates, sometimes called \"skew coordinates\" for emphasizing that the basis vectors are not pairwise orthogonal.\nAn affine basis of a Euclidean space of dimension n is a set of \"n\" + 1 points that are not contained in a hyperplane. An affine basis define barycentric coordinates for every point.\nMany other coordinates systems can be defined on a Euclidean space E of dimension n, in the following way. Let f be a homeomorphism (or, more often, a diffeomorphism) from a dense open subset of E to an open subset of formula_6 The \"coordinates\" of a point x of E are the components of \"f\"(\"x\"). The polar coordinate system (dimension 2) and the spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems (dimension 3) are defined this way.\nFor points that are outside the domain of f, coordinates may sometimes be defined as the limit of coordinates of neighbour points, but these coordinates may be not uniquely defined, and may be not continuous in the neighborhood of the point. For example, for the spherical coordinate system, the longitude is not defined at the pole, and on the antimeridian, the longitude passes discontinuously from \u2013180\u00b0 to +180\u00b0.\nThis way of defining coordinates extends easily to other mathematical structures, and in particular to manifolds.\nIsometries.\nAn isometry between two metric spaces is a bijection preserving the distance, that is\nformula_79\nIn the case of a Euclidean vector space, an isometry that maps the origin to the origin preserves the norm\nformula_80\nsince the norm of a vector is its distance from the zero vector. It preserves also the inner product\nformula_81\nsince\nformula_82\nAn isometry of Euclidean vector spaces is a linear isomorphism.\nAn isometry formula_83 of Euclidean spaces defines an isometry formula_84 of the associated Euclidean vector spaces. This implies that two isometric Euclidean spaces have the same dimension. Conversely, if E and F are Euclidean spaces, \"O\" \u2208 \"E\", \"O\"\u2032 \u2208 \"F\", and formula_85 is an isometry, then the map formula_83 defined by\nformula_87\nis an isometry of Euclidean spaces.\nIt follows from the preceding results that an isometry of Euclidean spaces maps lines to lines, and, more generally Euclidean subspaces to Euclidean subspaces of the same dimension, and that the restriction of the isometry on these subspaces are isometries of these subspaces.\nIsometry with prototypical examples.\nIf E is a Euclidean space, its associated vector space formula_11 can be considered as a Euclidean space. Every point \"O\" \u2208 \"E\" defines an isometry of Euclidean spaces\nformula_89\nwhich maps O to the zero vector and has the identity as associated linear map. The inverse isometry is the map\nformula_90\nA Euclidean frame &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; allows defining the map\nformula_91\nwhich is an isometry of Euclidean spaces. The inverse isometry is\nformula_92\n\"This means that, up to an isomorphism, there is exactly one Euclidean space of a given dimension.\"\nThis justifies that many authors talk of formula_3 as \"the\" Euclidean space of dimension n.\nEuclidean group.\nAn isometry from a Euclidean space onto itself is called \"Euclidean isometry\", \"Euclidean transformation\" or \"rigid transformation\". The rigid transformations of a Euclidean space form a group (under composition), called the \"Euclidean group\" and often denoted E(\"n\").\nThe simplest Euclidean transformations are translations\nformula_94\nThey are in bijective correspondence with vectors. This is a reason for calling \"space of translations\" the vector space associated to a Euclidean space. The translations form a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group.\nA Euclidean isometry f of a Euclidean space E defines a linear isometry formula_95 of the associated vector space (by \"linear isometry\", it is meant an isometry that is also a linear map) in the following way: denoting by \"Q\" \u2212 \"P\" the vector formula_96 if O is an arbitrary point of E, one has\nformula_97\nIt is straightforward to prove that this is a linear map that does not depend from the choice of O.\nThe map formula_98 is a group homomorphism from the Euclidean group onto the group of linear isometries, called the orthogonal group. The kernel of this homomorphism is the translation group, showing that it is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group.\nThe isometries that fix a given point P form the stabilizer subgroup of the Euclidean group with respect to P. The restriction to this stabilizer of above group homomorphism is an isomorphism. So the isometries that fix a given point form a group isomorphic to the orthogonal group.\nLet P be a point, f an isometry, and t the translation that maps P to \"f\"(\"P\"). The isometry formula_99 fixes P. So formula_100 and \"the Euclidean group is the semidirect product of the translation group and the orthogonal group.\"\nThe special orthogonal group is the normal subgroup of the orthogonal group that preserves handedness. It is a subgroup of index two of the orthogonal group. Its inverse image by the group homomorphism formula_98 is a normal subgroup of index two of the Euclidean group, which is called the \"special Euclidean group\" or the \"displacement group\". Its elements are called \"rigid motions\" or \"displacements\".\nRigid motions include the identity, translations, rotations (the rigid motions that fix at least a point), and also screw motions.\nTypical examples of rigid transformations that are not rigid motions are reflections, which are rigid transformations that fix a hyperplane and are not the identity. They are also the transformations consisting in changing the sign of one coordinate over some Euclidean frame.\nAs the special Euclidean group is a subgroup of index two of the Euclidean group, given a reflection r, every rigid transformation that is not a rigid motion is the product of r and a rigid motion. A glide reflection is an example of a rigid transformation that is not a rigid motion or a reflection.\nAll groups that have been considered in this section are Lie groups and algebraic groups.\nTopology.\nThe Euclidean distance makes a Euclidean space a metric space, and thus a topological space. This topology is called the Euclidean topology. In the case of formula_102 this topology is also the product topology.\nThe open sets are the subsets that contains an open ball around each of their points. In other words, open balls form a base of the topology.\nThe topological dimension of a Euclidean space equals its dimension. This implies that Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic. Moreover, the theorem of invariance of domain asserts that a subset of a Euclidean space is open (for the subspace topology) if and only if it is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space of the same dimension.\nEuclidean spaces are complete and locally compact. That is, a closed subset of a Euclidean space is compact if it is bounded (that is, contained in a ball). In particular, closed balls are compact.\nAxiomatic definitions.\nThe definition of Euclidean spaces that has been described in this article differs fundamentally of Euclid's one. In reality, Euclid did not define formally the space, because it was thought as a description of the physical world that exists independently of human mind. The need of a formal definition appeared only at the end of 19th century, with the introduction of non-Euclidean geometries.\nTwo different approaches have been used. Felix Klein suggested to define geometries through their symmetries. The presentation of Euclidean spaces given in this article, is essentially issued from his Erlangen program, with the emphasis given on the groups of translations and isometries.\nOn the other hand, David Hilbert proposed a set of axioms, inspired by Euclid's postulates. They belong to synthetic geometry, as they do not involve any definition of real numbers. Later G. D. Birkhoff and Alfred Tarski proposed simpler sets of axioms, which use real numbers (see Birkhoff's axioms and Tarski's axioms).\nIn \"Geometric Algebra\", Emil Artin has proved that all these definitions of a Euclidean space are equivalent. It is rather easy to prove that all definitions of Euclidean spaces satisfy Hilbert's axioms, and that those involving real numbers (including the above given definition) are equivalent. The difficult part of Artin's proof is the following. In Hilbert's axioms, congruence is an equivalence relation on segments. One can thus define the \"length\" of a segment as its equivalence class. One must thus prove that this length satisfies properties that characterize nonnegative real numbers. Artin proved this with axioms equivalent to those of Hilbert.\nUsage.\nSince the ancient Greeks, Euclidean space has been used for modeling shapes in the physical world. It is thus used in many sciences, such as physics, mechanics, and astronomy. It is also widely used in all technical areas that are concerned with shapes, figure, location and position, such as architecture, geodesy, topography, navigation, industrial design, or technical drawing.\nSpace of dimensions higher than three occurs in several modern theories of physics; see Higher dimension. They occur also in configuration spaces of physical systems.\nBeside Euclidean geometry, Euclidean spaces are also widely used in other areas of mathematics. Tangent spaces of differentiable manifolds are Euclidean vector spaces. More generally, a manifold is a space that is locally approximated by Euclidean spaces. Most non-Euclidean geometries can be modeled by a manifold, and embedded in a Euclidean space of higher dimension. For example, an elliptic space can be modeled by an ellipsoid. It is common to represent in a Euclidean space mathematical objects that are \"a priori\" not of a geometrical nature. An example among many is the usual representation of graphs.\nOther geometric spaces.\nSince the introduction, at the end of 19th century, of non-Euclidean geometries, many sorts of spaces have been considered, about which one can do geometric reasoning in the same way as with Euclidean spaces. In general, they share some properties with Euclidean spaces, but may also have properties that could appear as rather strange. Some of these spaces use Euclidean geometry for their definition, or can be modeled as subspaces of a Euclidean space of higher dimension. When such a space is defined by geometrical axioms, embedding the space in a Euclidean space is a standard way for proving consistency of its definition, or, more precisely for proving that its theory is consistent, if Euclidean geometry is consistent (which cannot be proved).\nAffine space.\nA Euclidean space is an affine space equipped with a metric. Affine spaces have many other uses in mathematics. In particular, as they are defined over any field, they allow doing geometry in other contexts.\nAs soon as non-linear questions are considered, it is generally useful to consider affine spaces over the complex numbers as an extension of Euclidean spaces. For example, a circle and a line have always two intersection points (possibly not distinct) in the complex affine space. Therefore, most of algebraic geometry is built in complex affine spaces and affine spaces over algebraically closed fields. The shapes that are studied in algebraic geometry in these affine spaces are therefore called affine algebraic varieties.\nAffine spaces over the rational numbers and more generally over algebraic number fields provide a link between (algebraic) geometry and number theory. For example, the Fermat's Last Theorem can be stated \"a Fermat curve of degree higher than two has no point in the affine plane over the rationals.\"\nGeometry in affine spaces over a finite fields has also been widely studied. For example, elliptic curves over finite fields are widely used in cryptography.\nProjective space.\nOriginally, projective spaces have been introduced by adding \"points at infinity\" to Euclidean spaces, and, more generally to affine spaces, in order to make true the assertion \"two coplanar lines meet in exactly one point\". Projective space share with Euclidean and affine spaces the property of being isotropic, that is, there is no property of the space that allows distinguishing between two points or two lines. Therefore, a more isotropic definition is commonly used, which consists as defining a projective space as the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension one more.\nAs for affine spaces, projective spaces are defined over any field, and are fundamental spaces of algebraic geometry.\nNon-Euclidean geometries.\n\"Non-Euclidean geometry\" refers usually to geometrical spaces where the parallel postulate is false. They include elliptic geometry, where the sum of the angles of a triangle is more than 180\u00b0, and hyperbolic geometry, where this sum is less than 180\u00b0. Their introduction in the second half of 19th century, and the proof that their theory is consistent (if Euclidean geometry is not contradictory) is one of the paradoxes that are at the origin of the foundational crisis in mathematics of the beginning of 20th century, and motivated the systematization of axiomatic theories in mathematics.\nCurved spaces.\nA manifold is a space that in the neighborhood of each point resembles a Euclidean space. In technical terms, a manifold is a topological space, such that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space. Manifolds can be classified by increasing degree of this \"resemblance\" into topological manifolds, differentiable manifolds, smooth manifolds, and analytic manifolds. However, none of these types of \"resemblance\" respect distances and angles, even approximately.\nDistances and angles can be defined on a smooth manifold by providing a smoothly varying Euclidean metric on the tangent spaces at the points of the manifold (these tangent spaces are thus Euclidean vector spaces). This results in a Riemannian manifold. Generally, straight lines do not exist in a Riemannian manifold, but their role is played by geodesics, which are the \"shortest paths\" between two points. This allows defining distances, which are measured along geodesics, and angles between geodesics, which are the angle of their tangents in the tangent space at their intersection. So, Riemannian manifolds behave locally like a Euclidean space that has been bent.\nEuclidean spaces are trivially Riemannian manifolds. An example illustrating this well is the surface of a sphere. In this case, geodesics are arcs of great circle, which are called orthodromes in the context of navigation. More generally, the spaces of non-Euclidean geometries can be realized as Riemannian manifolds.\nPseudo-Euclidean space.\nAn inner product of a real vector space is a positive definite bilinear form, and so characterized by a positive definite quadratic form. A pseudo-Euclidean space is an affine space with an associated real vector space equipped with a non-degenerate quadratic form (that may be indefinite).\nA fundamental example of such a space is the Minkowski space, which is the space-time of Einstein's special relativity. It is a four-dimensional space, where the metric is defined by the quadratic form\nformula_103\nwhere the last coordinate (\"t\") is temporal, and the other three (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") are spatial.\nTo take gravity into account, general relativity uses a pseudo-Riemannian manifold that has Minkowski spaces as tangent spaces. The curvature of this manifold at a point is a function of the value of the gravitational field at this point.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He flourished at the beginning of what is now referred to as the \"golden age\" of illustration, and is best known for his drawings and paintings of Shakespearean and Victorian subjects, as well as for his painting of Edward VII's coronation. His most famous set of murals, \"The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail\", adorns the Boston Central Library.\nEarly life and education.\nAbbey was born in Philadelphia, on April 1, 1852, to commercial broker William Maxwell Abbey and Margery Ann Kiple. He studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia under Christian Schussele.\nCareer.\nAbbey began as an illustrator, producing numerous illustrations and sketches magazines, including \"Harper's Weekly\" (1871\u20131874) and \"Scribner's Magazine\". His illustrations began appearing in Harper's Weekly before Abbey was twenty years old. He moved to New York City in 1871. His illustrations were strongly influenced by French and German black and white art: Adolf Menzel and Daniel Vierge; and by English artists. He illustrated several best-selling books, including \"Christmas Stories\" by Charles Dickens (1875), \"Selections from the Poetry of Robert Herrick\" (1882), and \"She Stoops to Conquer\" by Oliver Goldsmith (1887). Abbey also illustrated a four-volume set of \"The Comedies of Shakespeare\" for Harper &amp; Brothers in 1896.\nIn 1878, he moved to England at the request of his employers to gather material for illustrations of the poems of Robert Herrick, published in 1882, and he settled permanently there in 1883.\nIn 1883, he was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours. About this time, he was appraised critically by the American writer, S.G.W. Benjamin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It must be taken into consideration that he is still very young; that he now for the first time visits the studios and galleries of Europe; that his advantages for a regular art education have been very moderate, and that he is practically self-educated. And then compare with these disadvantages the amount and the quality of the illustrations he has turned out, and we see represented in him genius of a high order, combining almost inexhaustible creativeness, clearness and vividness of conception, a versatile fancy, a poetic perception of beauty, a quaint, delicate humor, a wonderful grasp of whatever is weird and mysterious, and admirable chiaro-oscuro, drawing, and composition. When we note such a rare combination of qualities, we cease to be surprised at the cordial recognition awarded his genius by the best judges, both in London and Paris, even before he had left this country.\nHe also created illustrations for Goldsmith's \"She Stoops to Conquer\" (1887), for a volume of \"Old Songs\" (1889), and for the comedies (and a few of the tragedies) of Shakespeare. Among his water-colours are \"The Evil Eye\" (1877), \"The Rose in October\" (1879), \"An Old Song\" (1886), \"The Visitors\" (1890), and \"The Jongleur\" (1892). Possibly his best known pastels are \"Beatrice\", \"Phyllis\", and \"Two Noble Kinsmen\".\nIn 1890, he made his first appearance with an oil painting, \"A May Day Morn\", at the Royal Academy in London. He exhibited \"Richard duke of Gloucester and the Lady Anne\" there in 1896, and in that year was elected A.R.A., becoming a full member in 1898. He received a gold medal at the Pan-American Exposition and was commissioned to paint the coronation of King Edward VII in 1901; in the next year, he was chosen to paint the coronation. It was the official painting of the occasion and, hence, resides at Buckingham Palace. He did receive a knighthood, although some say he refused it in 1907. Friendly with other expatriate American artists, he summered at Broadway, Worcestershire, England, where he painted and vacationed alongside John Singer Sargent at the home of Francis Davis Millet.\nHe completed murals for the Boston Central Library in the 1890s. The frieze for the Library was titled \"The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail\". It took Abbey eleven years to complete this series of murals in his England studio. In 1897 he received the honorary degree of A.M. from Yale university. In 2024, the Yale University Art Gallery completed restoration of his \"Study for the Apotheosis of Pennsylvania\" using a technique known as \"mist lining\" which repaired structural defects in the canvas.\nIn 1904 he painted a mural for the Royal Exchange, London \"Reconciliation of the Skinners &amp; Merchant Taylors' Companies by Lord Mayor Billesden, 1484\".\nPennsylvania State Capitol.\nIn 1908\u201309, Abbey began an ambitious program of murals and other artworks for the newly completed Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. These included allegorical medallion murals representing \"Science\", \"Art\", \"Justice\", and \"Religion\" for the dome of the Rotunda, four large lunette murals beneath the dome, and multiple works for the House and Senate Chambers. For the Senate chamber he finished only one painting, \"Von Steuben Training the American Soldiers at Valley Forge\", and he was working on the \"Reading of the Declaration of Independence\" mural in early 1911, when his health began to fail. He was diagnosed with cancer. Studio assistant William Simmonds continued work on the mural with little supervision from Abbey, and with small contributions by John Singer Sargent.\nDeath.\nOn August 11, 1911, Abbey died in London. William Simmonds travelled from England to install the completed murals with Abbey's widow Gertrude. The remaining two rooms, which Abbey had been unable to finish, were given to Violet Oakley, who completed the commission using her own designs.\nLegacy.\nAbbey was elected to the National Academy of Design, in 1902, and The American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was honorary member of the Royal Bavarian Society and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and was made a chevalier of the French Legion of Honour. He was a prolific illustrator, and attention to detail, including historical accuracy, influenced successive generations of illustrators.\nEdwin had been a keen supporter of the newly founded British School at Rome (BSR), so, in his memory, his widow donated \u00a36000 to assist in building the artists' studio block and, in 1926, founded the Incorporated Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Scholarships. The scholarships were established to enable British and American painters to pursue their practice. Recipients of Abbey funding \u2013 Scholars and, more recently, Fellows \u2013 devote their scholarship to working in the studios at the BSR, where there has, ever since, been at least one Abbey-funded artist in residence. Previous award holders include Stephen Farthing, Chantal Joffe and Spartacus Chetwynd. The Abbey Fellowships (formerly 'Awards') were established in their present form in 1990, and the Abbey studios also host the BSR's other Fine Art residencies, such as the Derek Hill Foundation Scholarship and the Sainsbury Scholarship in Painting and Drawing. A bust of Edwin Abbey, by Sir Thomas Brock, stands in the courtyard of the BSR.\nEdwin also left works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and to the National Gallery in London.\nAbbey is buried in the churchyard of Old St Andrew's Church in Kingsbury, London. His grave is Grade II listed.\nFamily.\nIn 1890, Edwin married (Mary) Gertrude Mead, the daughter of Frederick Mead, a New York merchant. She encouraged her husband to secure more ambitious commissions. The marriage remained childless.\nAfter her husband's death, Gertrude was active in preserving her husband's legacy, writing about his work and giving her substantial collection and archive to Yale. In 1932, through the Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Fund for Mural Painting, she endowed the Abbey Mural Prize to support the creation and restoration of public murals in the United States. It is awarded each year by a jury of National Academicians through the National Academy of Design. She was a sponsor of the Survey of London.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9703", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9703", "title": "Evolutionary psychology", "text": "Branch of psychology\nEvolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in psychology that examines cognition and behavior from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify human psychological adaptations with regard to the ancestral problems they evolved to solve. In this framework, psychological traits and mechanisms are either functional products of natural and sexual selection or non-adaptive by-products of other adaptive traits.\nAdaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and the liver, is common in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking in psychology, arguing that just as the heart evolved to pump blood, the liver evolved to detoxify poisons, and the kidneys evolved to filter turbid fluids, there is modularity of mind in that different psychological mechanisms evolved to solve different adaptive problems. These evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.\nSome evolutionary psychologists argue that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology.\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations, including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment. The theories and findings of evolutionary psychology have applications in many fields, including economics, environment, health, law, management, psychiatry, politics, and literature.\nCriticism of evolutionary psychology involves questions of testability, cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as modular functioning of the brain, and large uncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, as well as political and ethical issues due to interpretations of research results.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nScope.\nPrinciples.\nIts central assumption is that the human brain is composed of a large number of specialized mechanisms that were shaped by natural selection over a vast period of time to solve the recurrent information-processing problems faced by our ancestors. These problems involve food choices, social hierarchies, distributing resources to offspring, and selecting mates. Proponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology (evolutionary theory), and thus understanding psychology as a branch of biology. Anthropologist John Tooby and psychologist Leda Cosmides note:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJust as human physiology and evolutionary physiology have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent \"human physiological nature,\" the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent \"human psychological nature.\" According to Steven Pinker, it is \"not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses\" and a term that \"has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity.\" Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the computational theory of mind. It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any domain-general learning is impossible because of the combinatorial explosion. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction.\nWhile philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline sees the human brain as having evolved specialized functions, called cognitive modules, or \"psychological adaptations\" which are shaped by natural selection. Examples include language-acquisition modules, incest-avoidance mechanisms, cheater-detection mechanisms, intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed \"domain-specific\", deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history. \"Domain-general\" mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.\nEvolutionary psychology has roots in cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology but also draws on behavioral ecology, artificial intelligence, genetics, ethology, anthropology, archaeology, biology, ecopsychology and zoology. It is closely linked to sociobiology, but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on \"domain-specific\" rather than \"domain-general\" mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current fitness, the importance of mismatch theory, and psychology rather than behavior.\nNikolaas Tinbergen's four categories of questions can help to clarify the distinctions between several different, but complementary, types of explanations. Evolutionary psychology focuses primarily on the \"why?\" questions, while traditional psychology focuses on the \"how?\" questions.\nPremises.\nEvolutionary psychology is founded on several core premises.\nHistory.\nEvolutionary psychology has its historical roots in Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. In \"On The Origin of Species\", Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.\nOnce the \"Origin\" was complete, Darwin turned to developing an evolution-based psychology, for, from the inception of his theory of evolution in the late 1830s, Darwin had seen the task of developing an evolutionary account of the higher human faculties as his most important challenge. He devoted more than a decade to study of the evolutionary origins of key aspects of human behaviour, in particular: the human intellect; rationality; human sexual behaviour; emotional expressions; moral behaviour; language; culture; and conscience\u2014several of which Darwin argued had originated due to the unusual ways natural selection operates in social animals, that is, by different kinds of group selection, including kin selection and reciprocal altruism.\nInitially conceived as groundwork for one book, Darwin's psychological project became so large and fruitful that he split it into two parts, the first being published as \"The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex\" in 1871 and the second as \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\" in 1872. Darwin also published pathbreaking evolutionary monographs on insect and invertebrate behaviour, and\u2014believing that infant behaviour gives us privileged access to humans' evolutionary endowment\u2014a seminal case-study of his baby son William's behaviour, containing many observations confirmed by recent research, including those on: infant-adult communication and meta-communication; infant emotional expressions; early reasoning; the experimental study of infant jealousy; and the origins of self-knowledge.\nDarwin's evolutionary psychological publications inspired many of the founders of modern psychology, including: Sigmund Freud and his theories of psychoanalysis, particularly as relating to the Oedipus complex and group psychology; both the physiological and folk psychologies of Wilhelm Wundt; William James's functionalist approach to psychology; the genetic psychology of James Mark Baldwin and thus, indirectly, Jean Piaget; the social behaviourism or symbolic interactionism of George Herbert Mead which set out from Mead's appropriation of Darwin's treatment of gesture and attitude in his book on \"Expression\"; and the study of evolved 'instinctive' behaviour in animals\u2014a major topic in \"On the Origin of Species\"\u2014known today as ethology and pioneered by Konrad Lorenz, Karl von Frisch and Niko Tinbergen. More recently, Darwin's research on his baby son inspired Colwyn Trevarthen's observational approach to infancy and his theory of innate intersubjectivity. Overall, Darwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided and continue to provide many insights into why minds and brains function the way they do.\n20th century evolutionary psychologies mostly bypass Darwin's extensive evolutionary treatment of human psychology, drawing instead from: the biological sciences of their day\u2014especially 20th century evolutionary theory as it is imagined to relate to ancient human environments; the study of paleoanthropology; ethology; and various human sciences, most obviously cognitive psychology. For example, writing from a gene-centred perspective on evolution, W.D. Hamilton's (1964) papers on inclusive fitness and Robert Trivers's (1972) theories on reciprocity and parental investment helped to re-establish evolutionary thinking in psychology and the other social sciences, though without reference to the place of parental investment, reciprocal altruism and kin selection in Darwin's psychology. Likewise, in 1975, Edward O. Wilson combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, principally referencing the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book \"\".\nIn the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal \"social\" behavior (including humans) generated sociobiology, defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O. Wilson in 1975 as \"the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior\" and in 1978 as \"the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.\" Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on \"social\" behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and human behavior.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term \"evolutionary biology\" in their titles. The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by Donald Symons' 1979 book \"The Evolution of Human Sexuality\" and Leda Cosmides and John Tooby's 1992 book \"The Adapted Mind\". David Buller observed that the term \"evolutionary psychology\" is sometimes seen as denoting research based on the specific methodological and theoretical commitments of certain researchers from the Santa Barbara school (University of California), thus some evolutionary psychologists prefer to term their work \"human ecology\", \"human behavioural ecology\" or \"evolutionary anthropology\" instead.\nFrom psychology there are the primary streams of developmental, social and cognitive psychology. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of behavioral genetics and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior. Dual inheritance theory (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution. DIT is seen by some as a \"middle-ground\" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation.\nTheoretical foundations.\nThe theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.\nEvolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating. For male mammals, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females. For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates. Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of altruistic (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was argued to be a weak explanation by those who adopted the 20th century's individualistic gene-centred view of evolution, because it was thought that in any loosely-bonded group which lacked strong in-group dynamics (of the kind assumed by Darwin), less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.\nIn 1964, the evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton proposed inclusive fitness theory, emphasizing a gene-centered view of evolution. Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives). According to Hamilton's rule, self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including evolutionary game theory, tit-for-tat reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).\nSeveral mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level, in a similar way to the Baldwin effect.\nEvolved psychological mechanisms.\nEvolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has a functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction.\nEvolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history. These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances. In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.\nAnother example would be the evolved mechanism in depression. Clinical depression is maladaptive and should have evolutionary approaches so it can become adaptive. Over the centuries animals and humans have gone through hard times to stay alive, which made our fight or flight senses evolve tremendously. For instances, mammalians have separation anxiety from their guardians which causes distress and sends signals to their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, and emotional/behavioral changes. Going through these types of circumstances helps mammals cope with separation anxiety.\nHistorical topics.\nProponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of research. Historian Lynn Hunt says that the historians complained that the researchers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims.\nHunt states that \"the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions.\" She concludes that, as of 2014, the \"'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing.\"\nProducts of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation.\nNot all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptations. As noted in the table below, traits may also be exaptations, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called \"spandrels\"), or random variation between individuals.\nPsychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn and to manifest in cultures worldwide. For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write requires extensive training, and presumably involves the repurposing of cognitive capacities that evolved in response to selection pressures unrelated to written language. However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different outputs.\nOne of the tasks of evolutionary psychology is to identify which psychological traits are likely to be adaptations, byproducts or random variation. George C. Williams suggested that an \"adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary.\" As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality.\nObligate and facultative adaptations.\nA question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation). The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like \"if-then\" statements. For example, The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.\nCultural universals.\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology. Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned).\nBasic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women, are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females. It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics.\nEvolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the \"standard social science model,\" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture.\nEnvironment of evolutionary adaptedness.\nEvolutionary psychology argues that to properly understand the functions of the brain, one must understand the properties of the environment in which the brain evolved. That environment is often referred to as the \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\".\nThe idea of an \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\" was first explored as a part of attachment theory by John Bowlby. This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation.\nHumans, the genus \"Homo\", appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the Pleistocene 2.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by stabilizing selection during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology, therefore, proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments. In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.\nThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society. The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning. Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they have been pushed out of the best land and into harsh environments, so it is not clear how closely they reflect ancestral culture. However, all around the world small-band hunter-gatherers offer a similar developmental system for the young (\"hunter-gatherer childhood model,\" Konner, 2005; \n\"evolved developmental niche\" or \"evolved nest;\" Narvaez et al., 2013). The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregivers. Initial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes.\nEvolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior.\nMismatches.\nSince an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatch. Because humans are mostly adapted to Pleistocene environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit \"mismatches\" to the modern environment. One example is the fact that although over 20,000 people are murdered by guns in the US annually, whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers. A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not. There is thus a mismatch between humans' evolved fear-learning psychology and the modern environment.\nThis mismatch also shows up in the phenomena of the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats, and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an environment of evolutionary adaptedness where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient. The psychologist Mark van Vugt recently argued that modern organizational leadership is a mismatch. His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.\nResearch methods.\nEvolutionary theory is heuristic in that it may generate hypotheses that might not be developed from other theoretical approaches. One of the main goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variations. As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to be presented as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above). Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed \"mental mechanisms\" or \"psychological adaptations\") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs. Evolutionary developmental psychology, or \"evo-devo,\" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life-history trajectories.\nEvolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011) notes that these methods include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\"Cross-cultural Consistency.\" Characteristics that have been demonstrated to be cross-cultural human universals such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations. Several evolutionary psychologists have collected massive datasets from cultures around the world to assess cross-cultural universality.\n\"Function to Form (or \"problem to solution\").\" The fact that males, but not females, risk potential misidentification of genetic offspring (referred to as \"paternity uncertainty\") led evolutionary psychologists to hypothesize that, compared to females, male jealousy would be more focused on sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity.\n\"Form to Function (reverse-engineering \u2013 or \"solution to problem\").\" Morning sickness, and associated aversions to certain types of food, during pregnancy seemed to have the characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). Margie Profet hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy non-pregnant women).\n\"Corresponding Neurological Modules.\" Evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuropsychology are mutually compatible \u2013 evolutionary psychology helps to identify psychological adaptations and their ultimate, evolutionary functions, while neuropsychology helps to identify the proximate manifestations of these adaptations.\n\"Current Evolutionary Adaptiveness.\" In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.&lt;/poem&gt;\nEvolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human products.\nRecently, additional methods and tools have been introduced based on fictional scenarios, mathematical models, and multi-agent computer simulations.\nMain areas of research.\nFoundational areas of research in evolutionary psychology can be divided into broad categories of adaptive problems that arise from evolutionary theory itself: survival, mating, parenting, family and kinship, interactions with non-kin, and cultural evolution.\nSurvival and individual-level psychological adaptations.\nProblems of survival are clear targets for the evolution of physical and psychological adaptations. Major problems the ancestors of present-day humans faced included food selection and acquisition; territory selection and physical shelter; and avoiding predators and other environmental threats.\nConsciousness.\nConsciousness meets George Williams' criteria of species universality, complexity, and functionality, and it is a trait that apparently increases fitness.\nIn his paper \"Evolution of consciousness,\" John Eccles argues that special anatomical and physical adaptations of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness. In contrast, others have argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive, having evolved initially in pre-mammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social \"and\" natural environments by providing an energy-saving \"neutral\" gear in an otherwise energy-expensive motor output machine. Once in place, this recursive circuitry may well have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms, as outlined by Bernard J. Baars. Richard Dawkins suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought. Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches. Consistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimpanzees and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.\nThe concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place seemingly outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.\nEvolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.\nSleep may have evolved to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season.\nSensation and perception.\nMany experts, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action. For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space. Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.\nBuilding and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness. More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness. Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.\nScientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worlds. Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear the very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present-day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.\nEvolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks. For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain have the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia). Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.\nLearning and facultative adaptations.\nIn evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations. Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment. Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development. For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation. Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods. The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions. For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships. Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water. Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes. In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problems faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development. The same might be true of humans.\nEmotion and motivation.\nMotivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.\nMotivation has a neurobiological basis in the reward system of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an inherent or unavoidable trade-off in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration.\nCognition.\nCognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processing. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not \"general purpose\". Cognition uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced in their lives. For example, present-day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms. Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events and lived under simpler life terms, present-day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. \"Gamblers' Fallacy\" is one example of this. Gamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a \"lucky streak\" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials. Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting Tails. Humans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages. This could be due to the ancestors of present-day humans living in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available and experienced less random occurrences in their lives.\nPersonality.\nEvolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle. (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance. However, understanding the concept of heritability can be tricky \u2013 heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.)\nPersonality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral polymorphisms), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum. Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed \"behavioral morphs\" \u2013 alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population. For example, if most of the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a \"cheater\" (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageous. Finally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative \u2013 sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development. For example, later-born children are more likely than firstborns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure.\nShared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors. However, shared environmental influences often decrease to near zero after adolescence but do not completely disappear.\nLanguage.\nAccording to Steven Pinker, who builds on the work by Noam Chomsky, the universal human ability to learn to talk between the ages of 1 \u2013 4, basically without training, suggests that language acquisition is a distinctly human psychological adaptation (see, in particular, Pinker's \"The Language Instinct\"). Pinker and Bloom (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.\nPinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction. Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called spandrel. But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gopnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the KE family of Britain. This gene turned out to be a mutation of the FOXP2 gene. Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans. However, the once-popular idea that FOXP2 is a 'grammar gene' or that it triggered the emergence of language in \"Homo sapiens\" is now widely discredited.\nCurrently, several competing theories about the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus. Researchers of language acquisition in primates and humans such as Michael Tomasello and Talmy Giv\u00f3n, argue that the innatist framework has understated the role of imitation in learning and that it is not at all necessary to posit the existence of an innate grammar module to explain human language acquisition. Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggest that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.\nOn the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist W. Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \"Language has evolved as an adaptation\" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in \"The Symbolic Species\" argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.\nIf the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.\nMating.\nGiven that sexual reproduction is the means by which genes are propagated into future generations, sexual selection plays a large role in human evolution. Human mating, then, is of interest to evolutionary psychologists who aim to investigate evolved mechanisms to attract and secure mates. Several lines of research have stemmed from this interest, such as studies of mate selection mate poaching, mate retention, mating preferences and conflict between the sexes.\nIn 1972 Robert Trivers published an influential paper on sex differences that is now referred to as parental investment theory. The size differences of gametes (anisogamy) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes \u2013 sperm) and females (large gametes \u2013 ova). Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the sexual selection of different reproductive strategies between the sexes and to sexual conflict. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their inclusive fitness. Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in mate choice, intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and courtship displays. In mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.e. gestation followed by childbirth and lactation). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.\nBuss and Schmitt's (1993) sexual strategies theory proposed that, due to differential parental investment, humans have evolved sexually dimorphic adaptations related to \"sexual accessibility, fertility assessment, commitment seeking and avoidance, immediate and enduring resource procurement, paternity certainty, assessment of mate value, and parental investment.\" Their strategic interference theory suggested that conflict between the sexes occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other sex, resulting in the activation of emotional responses such as anger or jealousy.\nWomen are generally more selective when choosing mates, especially under long-term mating conditions. However, under some circumstances, engaging in multiple sexual relationships can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing the risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring.\nDue to male paternity uncertainty, sex differences have been found in the domains of sexual jealousy. Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity. This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves. This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to the propagation of their own genes.\nAnother interesting line of research is that which examines women's mate preferences across the ovulatory cycle. The theoretical underpinning of this research is that ancestral women would have evolved mechanisms to select mates with certain traits depending on their hormonal status. Known as the ovulatory shift hypothesis, the theory posits that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10\u201315 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and bear a healthy offspring than a woman who mated with a male with low genetic quality. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes. Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.\nParenting.\nReproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output.\nParental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one offspring at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972). Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future reproduction, and inclusive fitness through aid to kin (Hamilton, 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.\nThe benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival, and ultimately, on the reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of the parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring, and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.\nThe Cinderella effect is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterparts. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters. Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: \"Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide \u2013 the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness. The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision-making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments\u2026. Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage\"(Daly &amp; Wilson, 1996, pp.\u00a064\u201365). However, they note that not all stepparents will \"want\" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuse. They see step parental care as primarily \"mating effort\" towards the genetic parent.\nFamily and kin.\nInclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others. The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).\nFrom the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.\nHamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:\nformula_1\nwhere\nThe concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an \"altruism gene\" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descent. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in \"The Selfish Gene\" (Chapter 6) and \"The Extended Phenotype\", this must be distinguished from the green-beard effect.\nAlthough it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see kin recognition), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.), while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors was discussed in Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007)\nWhatever the proximate mechanisms of kin recognition there is substantial evidence that humans act generally more altruistically to close genetic kin compared to genetic non-kin.\nInteractions with non-kin / reciprocity.\nAlthough interactions with non-kin are generally less altruistic compared to those with kin, cooperation can be maintained with non-kin via mutually beneficial reciprocity as was proposed by Robert Trivers. If there are repeated encounters between the same two players in an evolutionary game in which each of them can choose either to \"cooperate\" or \"defect\", then a strategy of mutual cooperation may be favored even if it pays each player, in the short term, to defect when the other cooperates. Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n w &gt; c/b\nReciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared. Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged. Indirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone's reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n q &gt; c/b\nOne important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.\nTrivers argues that friendship and various social emotions evolved in order to manage reciprocity. Liking and disliking, he says, evolved to help present-day humans' ancestors form coalitions with others who reciprocated and to exclude those who did not reciprocate. Moral indignation may have evolved to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters, and gratitude may have motivated present-day humans' ancestors to reciprocate appropriately after benefiting from others' altruism. Likewise, present-day humans feel guilty when they fail to reciprocate. These social motivations match what evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of reciprocity.\nEvolutionary psychologists say that humans have psychological adaptations that evolved specifically to help us identify non-reciprocators, commonly referred to as \"cheaters.\" In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would \"cheat\", based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction. In a 1996 experiment, for example, Linda Mealey and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating (such as embezzling money from a church).\nStrong reciprocity (or \"tribal reciprocity\").\nHumans may have an evolved set of psychological adaptations that predispose them to be more cooperative than otherwise would be expected with members of their tribal in-group, and more nasty to members of tribal out groups. These adaptations may have been a consequence of tribal warfare. Humans may also have predispositions for \"altruistic punishment\" \u2013 to punish in-group members who violate in-group rules, even when this altruistic behavior cannot be justified in terms of helping those you are related to (kin selection), cooperating with those who you will interact with again (direct reciprocity), or cooperating to better your reputation with others (indirect reciprocity).\nEvolutionary psychology and culture.\nThough evolutionary psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable work has been done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what cultural material is learned or taught. As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: \"the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, to be used as a rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect.\" (Tooby and Cosmides 1989).\nBiological explanations of human culture also brought criticism to evolutionary psychology: Evolutionary psychologists see the human psyche and physiology as a genetic product and assume that genes contain the information for the development and control of the organism and that this information is transmitted from one generation to the next via genes. Evolutionary psychologists thereby see physical and psychological characteristics of humans as genetically programmed. Even then, when evolutionary psychologists acknowledge the influence of the environment on human development, they understand the environment only as an activator or trigger for the programmed developmental instructions encoded in genes. Evolutionary psychologists, for example, believe that the human brain is made up of innate modules, each of which is specialised only for very specific tasks, e.\u00a0g. an anxiety module. According to evolutionary psychologists, these modules are given before the organism actually develops and are then activated by some environmental event. Critics object that this view is reductionist and that cognitive specialisation only comes about through the interaction of humans with their real environment, rather than the environment of distant ancestors. Interdisciplinary approaches are increasingly striving to mediate between these opposing points of view and to highlight that biological and cultural causes need not be antithetical in explaining human behaviour and even complex cultural achievements.\nIn psychology sub-fields.\nDevelopmental psychology.\nAccording to Paul Baltes, the benefits granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age. Natural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, such as Alzheimer disease. If it were a disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds this might have been a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago. Thus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities of aging and as the benefits of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases.\nSocial psychology.\nAs humans are a highly social species, there are many adaptive problems associated with navigating the social world (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making). Researchers in the emerging field of evolutionary social psychology have made many discoveries pertaining to topics traditionally studied by social psychologists, including person perception, social cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, group dynamics, leadership, motivation, prejudice, intergroup relations, and cross-cultural differences.\nWhen endeavouring to solve a problem humans at an early age show determination while chimpanzees have no comparable facial expression. Researchers suspect the human determined expression evolved because when a human is determinedly working on a problem other people will frequently help.\nAbnormal psychology.\nAdaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies between physiological and psychological dysfunctions, as noted in the table below. Prominent theorists and evolutionary psychiatrists include Michael T. McGuire, Anthony Stevens, and Randolph M. Nesse. They, and others, suggest that mental disorders are due to the interactive effects of both nature and nurture, and often have multiple contributing causes.\nEvolutionary psychologists have suggested that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may reflect a side-effect of genes with fitness benefits, such as increased creativity. (Some individuals with bipolar disorder are especially creative during their manic phases and the close relatives of people with schizophrenia have been found to be more likely to have creative professions.) A 1994 report by the American Psychiatry Association found that people with schizophrenia at roughly the same rate in Western and non-Western cultures, and in industrialized and pastoral societies, suggesting that schizophrenia is not a disease of civilization nor an arbitrary social invention. Sociopathy may represent an evolutionarily stable strategy, by which a small number of people who cheat on social contracts benefit in a society consisting mostly of non-sociopaths. Mild depression may be an adaptive response to withdraw from, and re-evaluate, situations that have led to disadvantageous outcomes (the \"analytical rumination hypothesis\") (see Evolutionary approaches to depression).\nTrofimova reviewed the most consistent psychological and behavioural sex differences in psychological abilities and disabilities and linked them to the Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex (ETS). She pointed out that a pattern of consistent sex differences in physical, verbal and social dis/abilities corresponds to the idea of the ETS considering sex dimorphism as a functional specialization of a species. Sex differentiation, according to the ETS, creates two partitions within a species, (1) conservational (females), and (2) variational (males). In females, superiority in verbal abilities, higher rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness can be presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority is mostly noted in exploratory abilities - in risk- and sensation seeking, spacial orientation, physical strength and higher rates in physical aggression. In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, but at the same time to preserve the beneficial properties of the species. Moreover, Trofimova suggested a \"redundancy pruning\" hypothesis as an upgrade of the ETS theory. She pointed out to higher rates of psychopathy, dyslexia, autism and schizophrenia in males, in comparison to females. She suggested that the variational function of the \"male partition\" might also provide irrelevance/redundancy pruning of an excess in a bank of beneficial characteristics of a species, with a continuing resistance to any changes from the norm-driven conservational partition of species. This might explain a contradictory allocation of a high drive for social status/power in the male sex with their lower (among two sexes) abilities for social interaction. The high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy in males might facilitate their higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations and their insensitivity to social disapproval, when they deliberately do not follow social norms.\nSome of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity.\nAntisocial and criminal behavior.\nEvolutionary psychology has been applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried are associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period. Some sociologists have underlined differential exposure to androgens as the cause of these behaviors, notably Lee Ellis in his evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory.\nMany conflicts that result in harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults. Steven Pinker in his book \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans developing instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation (\"honor\"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.\nRape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progeny. Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise are unlikely to be appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high-status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further. The sociobiological theories of rape are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds.\nPsychology of religion.\nAdaptationist perspectives on religious belief suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are a product of the human brain. As with all other organ functions, cognition's functional structure has been argued to have a genetic foundation, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and sexual selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments. However, evolutionary psychologists remain divided on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations, or a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations.\nCoalitional psychology.\nCoalitional psychology is an approach to explain political behaviors between different coalitions and the conditionality of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective. This approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status. Human beings thus naturally think and act in a way that manages and negotiates group dynamics.\nCoalitional psychology offers falsifiable ex ante prediction by positing five hypotheses on how these psychological adaptations operate:\nReception and criticism.\nCritics of evolutionary psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, pan-adaptationism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when proximate explanations are superior, and malevolent political or moral ideas.\nEthical implications.\nCritics have argued that evolutionary psychology might be used to justify existing social hierarchies and reactionary policies. It has also been suggested by critics that evolutionary psychologists' theories and interpretations of empirical data rely heavily on ideological assumptions about race and gender.\nIn response to such criticism, evolutionary psychologists often caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy \u2013 the assumption that \"what is natural\" is necessarily a moral good. However, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions.\nContradictions in models.\nSome criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychology. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific essential nutrients so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes. It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after the removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networking. The model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time. In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by bartering food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk-taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead of making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection. A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed).\nStandard social science model.\nEvolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on nature versus nurture. Evolutionary psychologists typically contrast evolutionary psychology with what they call the standard social science model (SSSM). They characterize the SSSM as the \"blank slate\", \"relativist\", \"social constructionist\", and \"cultural determinist\" perspective that they say dominated the social sciences throughout the 20th century and assumed that the mind was shaped almost entirely by culture.\nCritics have argued that evolutionary psychologists created a false dichotomy between their own view and the caricature of the SSSM. Other critics regard the SSSM as a rhetorical device or a straw man and suggest that the scientists whom evolutionary psychologists associate with the SSSM did not believe that the mind was a blank state devoid of any natural predispositions.\nReductionism and determinism.\nSome critics view evolutionary psychology as a form of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.\nTestability of hypotheses.\nA frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. Thus because there are a potentially infinite number of alternative explanations for why a trait evolved, critics contend that it is impossible to determine the exact explanation. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert that it is not impossible. Part of the critique of the scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA). Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which \"Homo sapiens\" evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc. Edward Hagen argues that the human past environments were not radically different in the same sense as the Carboniferous or Jurassic periods and that the animal and plant taxa of the era were similar to those of the modern world, as was the geology and ecology. Hagen argues that few would deny that other organs evolved in the EEA (for example, lungs evolving in an oxygen rich atmosphere) yet critics question whether or not the brain's EEA is truly knowable, which he argues constitutes selective scepticism. Hagen also argues that most evolutionary psychology research is based on the fact that females can get pregnant and males cannot, which Hagen observes was also true in the EEA.\nJohn Alcock describes this as the \"No Time Machine Argument\", as critics are arguing that since it is not possible to travel back in time to the EEA, then it cannot be determined what was going on there and thus what was adaptive. Alcock argues that present-day evidence allows researchers to be reasonably confident about the conditions of the EEA and that the fact that so many human behaviours are adaptive in the \"current\" environment is evidence that the ancestral environment of humans had much in common with the present one, as these behaviours would have evolved in the ancestral environment. Thus Alcock concludes that researchers can make predictions on the adaptive value of traits. Similarly, Dominic Murphy argues that alternative explanations cannot just be forwarded but instead need their own evidence and predictions - if one explanation makes predictions that the others cannot, it is reasonable to have confidence in that explanation. In addition, Murphy argues that other historical sciences also make predictions about modern phenomena to come up with explanations about past phenomena, for example, cosmologists look for evidence for what we would expect to see in the modern-day if the Big Bang was true, while geologists make predictions about modern phenomena to determine if an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. Murphy argues that if other historical disciplines can conduct tests without a time machine, then the onus is on the critics to show why evolutionary psychology is untestable if other historical disciplines are not, as \"methods should be judged across the board, not singled out for ridicule in one context.\"\nModularity of mind.\nEvolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations, although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or \"generality,\" of some modules. It has been suggested that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, it would have conferred an advantage in terms of fitness and because connection costs are lower.\nIn contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processes. Moreover, empirical support for the domain-specific theory stems almost entirely from performance on variations of the Wason selection task which is extremely limited in scope as it only tests one subtype of deductive reasoning.\nCultural rather than genetic development of cognitive tools.\nPsychologist Cecilia Heyes has argued that the picture presented by some evolutionary psychology of the human mind as a collection of cognitive instincts\u00a0\u2013 organs of thought shaped by genetic evolution over very long time periods\u00a0\u2013 does not fit research results. She posits instead that humans have cognitive gadgets\u00a0\u2013 \"special-purpose organs of thought\" built in the course of development through social interaction. Similar criticisms are articulated by Subrena E. Smith of the University of New Hampshire.\nResponse by evolutionary psychologists.\nEvolutionary psychologists have addressed many of their critics (e.g. in books by Segerstr\u00e5le (2000), Barkow (2005), and Alcock (2001)). Among their rebuttals are that some criticisms are straw men, or are based on an incorrect nature versus nurture dichotomy or on basic misunderstandings of the discipline.\nRobert Kurzban suggested that \"...critics of the field, when they err, are not slightly missing the mark. Their confusion is deep and profound. It's not like they are marksmen who can't quite hit the center of the target; they're holding the gun backwards.\" Many have written specifically to correct basic misconceptions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9705", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9705", "title": "Languages of Europe", "text": "There are over 250 languages indigenous to Europe, and most belong to the Indo-European language family. Out of a total European population of 744 million as of 2018, some 94% are native speakers of an Indo-European language. The three largest phyla of the Indo-European language family in Europe are Romance, Germanic, and Slavic; they have more than 200 million speakers each, and together account for close to 90% of Europeans.\nSmaller phyla of Indo-European found in Europe include Hellenic (Greek, c. 13 million), Baltic (c. 4.5 million), Albanian (c. 7.5 million), Celtic (c. 4 million), and Armenian (c. 4 million). Indo-Aryan, though a large subfamily of Indo-European, has a relatively small number of languages in Europe, and a small number of speakers (Romani, c. 1.5 million). However, a number of Indo-Aryan languages not native to Europe are spoken in Europe today.\nOf the approximately 45 million Europeans speaking non-Indo-European languages, most speak languages within either the Uralic or Turkic families. Still smaller groups \u2014 such as Basque (language isolate), Semitic languages (Maltese, c. 0.5 million), and various languages of the Caucasus \u2014 account for less than 1% of the European population among them. Immigration has added sizeable communities of speakers of African and Asian languages, amounting to about 4% of the population, with Arabic being the most widely spoken of them.\nFive languages have more than 50 million native speakers in Europe: Russian, German, French, Italian, and English. Russian is the most-spoken native language in Europe, and English has the largest number of speakers in total, including some 200 million speakers of English as a second or foreign language. (See English language in Europe.)\nIndo-European languages.\nThe Indo-European language family is descended from Proto-Indo-European, which is believed to have been spoken thousands of years ago. Early speakers of Indo-European daughter languages most likely expanded into Europe with the incipient Bronze Age, around 4,000 years ago (Bell-Beaker culture).\nGermanic.\nThe Germanic languages make up the predominant language family in Western, Northern and Central Europe. It is estimated that over 500 million Europeans are speakers of Germanic languages, the largest groups being German (c. 95 million), English (c. 400 million), Dutch (c. 24 million), Swedish (c. 10 million), Danish (c. 6 million), Norwegian (c. 5 million) and Limburgish (c. 1.3 million).\nThere are two extant major sub-divisions: \"West Germanic\" and \"North Germanic\". A third group, East Germanic, is now extinct; the only known surviving East Germanic texts are written in the Gothic language. West Germanic is divided into Anglo-Frisian (including English), Low German, Low Franconian (including Dutch) and High German (including Standard German).\nAnglo-Frisian.\nThe Anglo-Frisian language family is now mostly represented by English (Anglic), descended from the Old English language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons:\nThe Frisian languages are spoken by about 400,000 (as of 2015[ [update]]) Frisians, who live on the southern coast of the North Sea in the Netherlands and Germany. These languages include West Frisian, East Frisian (of which the only surviving dialect is Saterlandic) and North Frisian.\nDutch.\nDutch is spoken throughout the Netherlands, the northern half of Belgium, as well as the Nord-Pas de Calais region of France. The traditional dialects of the Lower Rhine region of Germany are linguistically more closely related to Dutch than to modern German. In Belgian and French contexts, Dutch is sometimes referred to as Flemish. Dutch dialects are numerous and varied.\nGerman.\nGerman is spoken throughout Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, much of Switzerland, northern Italy (South Tyrol), Luxembourg, the East Cantons of Belgium and the Alsace and Lorraine regions of France.\nThere are several groups of German dialects:\nLow German.\nLow German is spoken in various regions throughout Northern Germany and the northern and eastern parts of the Netherlands. It may be separated into West Low German and East Low German.\nNorth Germanic (Scandinavian).\nThe \"North Germanic languages\" are spoken in Nordic countries and include \nSwedish (Sweden and parts of Finland), \nDanish (Denmark), \nNorwegian (Norway), \nIcelandic (Iceland),\nFaroese (Faroe Islands), \nand Elfdalian (in a small part of central Sweden).\nEnglish has a long history of contact with Scandinavian languages, given the immigration of Scandinavians early in the history of Britain, and shares various features with the Scandinavian languages. Even so, especially Dutch and Swedish, but also Danish and Norwegian, have strong vocabulary connections to the German language.\nRomance.\nRoughly 215 million Europeans (primarily in Southern and Western Europe) are native speakers of Romance languages, the largest groups including:\nFrench (c. 72 million),\nItalian (c. 65 million),\nSpanish (c. 40 million), \nRomanian (c. 24 million),\nPortuguese (c. 10 million),\nCatalan (c. 7 million),\nNeapolitan (c. 6 million), \nSicilian (c. 5 million), \nVenetian (c. 4 million),\nGalician (c. 2 million),\nSardinian (c. 1 million),\nOccitan (c. 500,000), besides numerous smaller communities.\nThe Romance languages evolved from varieties of Vulgar Latin spoken in the various parts of the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity. Latin was itself part of the (otherwise extinct) Italic branch of Indo-European. Romance languages are divided phylogenetically into \"Italo-Western\", \"Eastern Romance\" (including Romanian) and \"Sardinian\". The Romance-speaking area of Europe is occasionally referred to as \"Latin Europe\".\nItalo-Western can be further broken down into the \"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" (sometimes grouped with Eastern Romance), including the Tuscan-derived Italian and numerous local Romance languages in Italy as well as Dalmatian, and the \"Western Romance languages\". The Western Romance languages in turn separate into the Gallo-Romance languages, including Langues d'o\u00efl such as French, the Francoprovencalic languages Arpitan and Faetar, the Rhaeto-Romance languages, and the Gallo-Italic languages; the Occitano-Romance languages, grouped with either Gallo-Romance or East Iberian, including Occitanic languages such as Occitan and Gardiol, and Catalan; Aragonese, grouped in with either Occitano-Romance or West Iberian, and finally the West Iberian languages, including the Astur-Leonese languages, the Galician-Portuguese languages, and the Castilian languages.\nSlavic.\nSlavic languages are spoken in large areas of Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. An estimated 315 million people speak a Slavic language, the largest groups being \nRussian (c. 110 million in European Russia and adjacent parts of Eastern Europe, Russian forming the largest linguistic community in Europe),\nPolish (c. 40 million),\nUkrainian (c. 33 million), \nSerbo-Croatian (c. 18 million),\nCzech (c. 11 million),\nBulgarian (c. 8 million), \nSlovak (c. 5 million),\nBelarusian (c. 3.7 million), Slovene (c. 2.3 million)\nand Macedonian (c. 1.6 million).\nPhylogenetically, Slavic is divided into three subgroups:\n Continental Celtic languages had previously been spoken across Europe from Iberia and Gaul to Asia Minor, but became extinct in the first millennium CE.\nUralic languages.\nThe Uralic language family is native to northern Eurasia.\nFinnic languages include Finnish (c. 5 million) and Estonian (c. 1 million), as well as smaller languages such as Kven (c. 8,000). Other languages of the Finno-Permic branch of the family include e.g. Mari (c. 400,000), and the Sami languages (c. 30,000).\nThe Ugric branch of the language family is represented in Europe by the Hungarian language (c. 13 million), historically introduced with the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin of the 9th century.\nThe Samoyedic Nenets language is spoken in Nenets Autonomous Okrug of Russia, located in the far northeastern corner of Europe (as delimited by the Ural Mountains).\nOther languages.\nSign languages.\nSeveral dozen manual languages exist across Europe, with the most widespread sign language family being the Francosign languages, with its languages found in countries from Iberia to the Balkans and the Baltics. Accurate historical information of sign and tactile languages is difficult to come by, with folk histories noting the existence signing communities across Europe hundreds of years ago. British Sign Language (BSL) and French Sign Language (LSF) are probably the oldest confirmed, continuously used sign languages. Alongside German Sign Language (DGS) according to Ethnologue, these three have the most numbers of signers, though very few institutions take appropriate statistics on contemporary signing populations, making legitimate data hard to find.\nNotably, few European sign languages have overt connections with the local majority/oral languages, aside from standard language contact and borrowing, meaning grammatically the sign languages and the oral languages of Europe are quite distinct from one another. Due to (visual/aural) modality differences, most sign languages are named for the larger ethnic nation in which they are spoken, plus the words \"sign language\", rendering what is spoken across much of France, Wallonia and Romandy as French Sign Language or LSF for: \"langue des signes fran\u00e7aise\".\nRecognition of non-oral languages varies widely from region to region. Some countries afford legal recognition, even to official on a state level, whereas others continue to be actively suppressed.\nThough \"there is a widespread belief\u2014among both Deaf people and sign language linguists\u2014that there \"are\" sign language families,\" the actual relationship between sign languages is difficult to ascertain. Concepts and methods used in historical linguistics to describe language families for written and spoken languages are not easily mapped onto signed languages. Some of the current understandings of sign language relationships, however, provide some reasonable estimates about potential sign language families:\nHistory of standardization.\nLanguage and identity, standardization processes.\nIn the Middle Ages the two most important defining elements of Europe were \"Christianitas\" and \"Latinitas\".\nThe earliest dictionaries were glossaries: more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) \"Abrogans\" was among the first. A new wave of lexicography can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the printing press, with the growing interest in standardization of languages).\nThe concept of the nation state began to emerge in the early modern period. Nations adopted particular dialects as their national language. This, together with improved communications, led to official efforts to standardize the national language, and a number of language academies were established: 1582 \"Accademia della Crusca\" in Florence, 1617 \"Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft\" in Weimar, 1635 \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\" in Paris, 1713 \"Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola\" in Madrid. Language became increasingly linked to nation as opposed to culture, and was also used to promote religious and ethnic identity: e.g. different Bible translations in the same language for Catholics and Protestants.\nThe first languages whose standardisation was promoted included Italian (\"questione della lingua\": Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian \u2192 Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (the standard is based on Parisian), English (the standard is based on the London dialect) and (High) German (based on the dialects of the chancellery of Meissen in Saxony, Middle German, and the chancellery of Prague in Bohemia (\"Common German\")). But several other nations also began to develop a standard variety in the 16th century.\nLingua franca.\nEurope has had a number of languages that were considered linguae francae over some ranges for some periods according to some historians. Typically in the rise of a national language the new language becomes a lingua franca to peoples in the range of the future nation until the consolidation and unification phases. If the nation becomes internationally influential, its language may become a lingua franca among nations that speak their own national languages. Europe has had no lingua franca ranging over its entire territory spoken by all or most of its populations during any historical period. Some linguae francae of past and present over some of its regions for some of its populations are:\nLinguistic minorities.\nHistorical attitudes towards linguistic diversity are illustrated by two French laws: the Ordonnance de Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1539), which said that every document in France should be written in French (neither in Latin nor in Occitan) and the Loi Toubon (1994), which aimed to eliminate anglicisms from official documents. States and populations within a state have often resorted to war to settle their differences. There have been attempts to prevent such hostilities: two such initiatives were promoted by the Council of Europe, founded in 1949, which affirms the right of minority language speakers to use their language fully and freely. The Council of Europe is committed to protecting linguistic diversity. Currently all European countries except France, Andorra and Turkey have signed the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, while Greece, Iceland and Luxembourg have signed it, but have not ratified it; this framework entered into force in 1998. Another European treaty, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, was adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe: it entered into force in 1998, and while it is legally binding for 24 countries, France, Iceland, Italy, North Macedonia, Moldova and Russia have chosen to sign without ratifying the convention.\nScripts.\nThe main scripts used in Europe today are the Latin and Cyrillic.\nThe Greek alphabet was derived from the Phoenician alphabet, and Latin was derived from the Greek via the Old Italic alphabet. In the Early Middle Ages, Ogham was used in Ireland and runes (derived from Old Italic script) in Scandinavia. Both were replaced in general use by the Latin alphabet by the Late Middle Ages. The Cyrillic script was derived from the Greek with the first texts appearing around 940\u00a0AD.\nAround 1900 there were mainly two typeface variants of the Latin alphabet used in Europe: Antiqua and Fraktur. Fraktur was used most for German, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Danish whereas Antiqua was used for Italian, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, English, Romanian, Swedish and Finnish. The Fraktur variant was banned by Hitler in 1941, having been described as \"Schwabacher Jewish letters\". Other scripts have historically been in use in Europe, including Phoenician, from which modern Latin letters descend, Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs on Egyptian artefacts traded during Antiquity, various runic systems used in Northern Europe preceding Christianisation, and Arabic during the era of the Ottoman Empire.\nHungarian rov\u00e1s was used by the Hungarian people in the early Middle Ages, but it was gradually replaced with the Latin-based Hungarian alphabet when Hungary became a kingdom, though it was revived in the 20th century and has certain marginal, but growing area of usage since then.\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union (as of 2021) had 27 member states accounting for a population of 447 million, or about 60% of the population of Europe.\nThe European Union has designated by agreement with the member states 24 languages as \"official and working\": Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish. This designation provides member states with two \"entitlements\": the member state may communicate with the EU in any of the designated languages, and view \"EU regulations and other legislative documents\" in that language.\nThe European Union and the Council of Europe have been collaborating in education of member populations in languages for \"the promotion of plurilingualism\" among EU member states. The joint document, \"Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR)\", is an educational standard defining \"the competencies necessary for communication\" and related knowledge for the benefit of educators in setting up educational programs. \nIn a 2005 independent survey requested by the EU's Directorate-General for Education and Culture regarding the extent to which major European languages were spoken in member states. The results were published in a 2006 document, \"Europeans and Their Languages\", or \"Eurobarometer\u00a0243\". In this study, statistically relevant[] samples of the population in each country were asked to fill out a survey form concerning the languages that they spoke with sufficient competency \"to be able to have a conversation\".\nList of languages.\nThe following is a table of European languages. The number of speakers as a first or second language (L1 and L2 speakers) listed are speakers in Europe only; see list of languages by number of native speakers and list of languages by total number of speakers for global estimates on numbers of speakers.\nThe list is intended to include any language variety with an ISO 639 code.

{"id": "9706", "revid": "1588193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9706", "title": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "text": "University in Eindhoven, Netherlands\nThe Eindhoven University of Technology (; TU/e) is a public technical university in the Netherlands, situated in Eindhoven. In 2020\u201321, around 14,000 students were enrolled in its BSc and MSc programs and around 1350 students were enrolled in its PhD and EngD programs. In 2021, the TU/e employed around 3900 people.\nTU/e is the Dutch member of the EuroTech Universities Alliance, a partnership of European universities of science &amp; technology. The other members are Technical University of Denmark (DTU), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), \u00c9cole Polytechnique (L\u2019X), The Technion, and Technical University of Munich (TUM).\nHistory.\nThe Eindhoven University of Technology was founded as the \"Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven\" (THE) on 23 June 1956 by the Dutch government. It was the second institute of its kind in the Netherlands, after the Delft University of Technology.\nUndergraduate education was given in four- or five-year programs until 2002, styled along the lines of the German system of education; graduates of these programs were granted an engineering title and allowed to prefix their name with the title \"ir.\" (an abbreviation of ingenieur; not to be confused with graduates of technical \"hogescholen\", who were engineers abbreviated \"ing.\"). Starting in 2002, following the entry into force of the Bologna Accords, the university switched to the bachelor/master structure (students graduating in 2002 were given both an old-style engineering title and a new master's title). The undergraduate programs are now split into two parts, a three-year bachelor program and a two-year master program.\n2011\u20132020 plans.\nOn 3 January 2011, the university's plans for the period up to 2020, the \"Strategic Plan 2020\", was presented. The plan included establishing a University College with relevance in engineering education; establishing a Graduate School to manage the graduate programs; increasing the student body and annual PhDs awarded by 50 percent; increasing knowledge \"valorisation\" (practical usage) to a campus-wide score of 4.2; increasing the international position of the university to the top 100; and improving the campus, including adding a costly science park.\nOrganization.\nAs a public university of the Netherlands, TU/e's general structure and management is determined by the (Law on Higher Education and Scientific Research). Between that law and the statutes of the university itself, the management of the university is organized according to the following chart:\nExecutive board.\nThe day-to-day running of the university is in the hands of the executive board \"()\". The executive board (EB) monitors the academic departments and service organizations, in addition to the local activities of the Stan Ackermans Institute. The EB consists of the president, the rector magnificus, and the vice president, in addition to a secretary for clerical tasks, who is usually the secretary of the entire university. The rector magnificus is the only member of the EB whose membership is mandated by law. The law allows anyone to be appointed rector, but in practice the university appoints a former department dean as rector. The rector represents the university's academic staff and academic interests of the university. The current president is Koen Janssen, the rector is Silvia Lenaerts, the vice president is Patrick Groothuis, and the secretary is Eric van der Geer-Rutten-Rijswijk.\nOversight of the executive board.\nThere are two bodies that supervise the Executive Board:\nDepartments and service organizations.\nMost of the work at the university is done in the departments and service organizations. In both the departments and the service organizations, the staff (and students) are involved with the running of the body. Both the bodies also have advisory councils.\nThe departments take care of most of the research and education at the university. Each department is run by its professors and headed by a dean. The deans are all members of the executive deliberation meeting, which is a regular meeting of the deans and the rector.\nThe service organizations are involved in further activities that are part of running the university.\nThe university has the following service organizations:\nTU/e Holding B.V..\nTU/e is involved in commercial interests and off-campus ties. These include commercial agreements between the university and external companies, in addition to interests in spinoff companies. In 1997 the TU/e Holding B.V., a limited company, was created to manage these commercial interests.\nAcademics.\nRankings.\nAs of 2018, Eindhoven was ranked between 51 and 141 in the world (the university itself provides a survey), and a top ten technical university in Europe.\nIn a 2003 European Commission report, TU/e was ranked as third among European research universities (after Cambridge and Oxford, tied with TU Munich and thus tied for the highest ranked Technical University in Europe), based on the impact of its scientific research. In the 2011 ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) rankings, TU/e was placed at the 52-75 bracket internationally in the Engineering/Technology and Computer Science (ENG) category and at 34th place internationally in the Computer Science subject field.\nEducation.\nThe scientific departments (or faculties) are the main divisions involved in teaching and research in the university. They employ the majority of the academic staff, are responsible for teaching the students, and sponsor the research schools and institutions.\nThe departments also offer PhD programs () for qualified masters. Unlike in Anglo-Saxon countries, the PhD program is not educational, rather, the university employs those aiming for a PhD as researchers.\nThe TU/e has nine departments:\nHonors programs.\nThe university offers honors programs for both bachelor and master students. At the bachelor level it consists of intensive study within eight possible tracks. At the master level it consists of extra leadership and professional development work.\nPostgraduate doctorate of engineering (PDEng).\nIn 1986, the university, together with two other Dutch technological universities (TU Delft and University of Twente), started various programs for earning a postgraduate doctorate of engineering (PDEng). These programs are managed by the Stan Ackermans Institute on behalf of the 4TU Federation. Nationally, 3,500 students have earned the postgraduate PDEng degree through these programs. There are ten programs at TU/e, each two years long.\nOther educational programs.\nThe university hosts a number of other educational programs that are in some way related to the main educational programs. These include the teacher's program and an MBA program.\nInternational connections.\nThe TU/e has connections with sister institutions in different countries, for example:\nThe TU/e also provides education to foreign students and graduates. According to the 2009 annual report in the academic year 2008\u20132009 there were 490 exchange students, 103 foreign nationals registered in a bachelor program, 430 in a master program, 158 in a professional doctorate program (79% of the total). In 2009 the university employed 37 foreign professors (15.9% of the total) and 16 foreign associate professors (12.8%). Overall, 29.5% of the university staff was non-Dutch.\nAs of 2011/2012, the TU/e had Erasmus agreements with universities in 30 countries across Europe in a range of subjects for student exchanges.\nRegional effect.\nThe TU/e plays a role in the academic, economic and social life of Eindhoven and the surrounding region.\nThe TU/e is important to the economy of the Eindhoven region, as well as the wider areas of BrabantStad and the Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven. It provides skilled labor for local businesses and partners with technology companies in the area.\nRegional history.\nThe university's role in the economy started with the interaction with the Philips company. The university was founded primarily to address Philips's need for local employees with higher levels of education in electronics, physics, chemistry and later computer science. Later that interest spread to DAF and Royal Dutch Shell. Often, senior personnel from these companies were hired to form the academic staff of the university (an Eindhoven joke was said that the university trains the engineers and Philips trains the professors).\nThe relationship changed during the 1980s and 1990s as Philips moved away from the region. The university was forced to seek closer ties with the city of Eindhoven, resulting in the Brainport initiative, a move to draw high tech industry to the region. The university started expending more effort in making practical use of its research and providing support for local companies and startups.\nCurrent effect.\nThe TU/e is host (and in some cases also commissioner) of a number of research schools, including the ESI and the DPI. These research schools are a source of knowledge for tech companies in the area such as ASML, NXP and FEI. As of summer 2010, the TU/e was also host to the Eindhoven Energy Institute (EEI), a co-location of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology's KIC on Sustainable Energy (InnoEnergy). The university also plays a large role in providing knowledge and personnel to other companies in the High Tech Campus Eindhoven and helps support startups through the Eindhoven Twinning Center and The Gate. The valorisation of TU/e has led to various spin-offs, including Lusoco, NC Biomatrix, Taylor, SMART Photonics, EFFECT Photonics and MicroAlign.\nIn the extended region, the TU/e is a part of the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle. The agreement between these three cities from three different countries formed a region that is among the highest in the European Union in terms of investment in technology and knowledge economy. The agreement includes cooperation between the three technical universities in the cities.\nStudent life.\nCommunity.\nThe TU/e has over 110 community bodies for its members. They are related to sports, culture, faith, staff, international students and hobbies, as well as university political parties, student teams, and study associations for each faculty.\nTechnological sports.\nIn addition to the regular sports played by the students and staff, the university has some \"technology sporting efforts\". Some examples include:\nThe university also has another race team, Solar Team Eindhoven (STE), that has entered cars named \"Stella\" into the biannual World Solar Challenge since 2013, winning the \"Cruiser class\" competition both in 2013 and 2015.\nAnother student racing program is the Automotive Technology InMotion team, a collaboration between the TU/e and Fontys University of Applied Sciences. The team has the aim to compete in the 2020 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nStudent teams.\nTU/e has various student teams which work on problems in the fields of sustainability, AI, health and mobility.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9707", "revid": "42195518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9707", "title": "Electronegativity", "text": "Tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons\nElectronegativity, symbolized as \"\u03c7\", is the tendency for an atom of a given chemical element to attract shared electrons (or electron density) when forming a chemical bond. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons. Electronegativity serves as a simple way to quantitatively estimate the bond energy, and the sign and magnitude of a bond's chemical polarity, which characterizes a bond along the continuous scale from covalent to ionic bonding. The loosely defined term electropositivity is the opposite of electronegativity: it characterizes an element's tendency to donate valence electrons.\nOn the most basic level, electronegativity is determined by factors like the nuclear charge (the more protons an atom has, the more \"pull\" it will have on electrons) and the number and location of other electrons in the atomic shells (the more electrons an atom has, the farther from the nucleus the valence electrons will be, and as a result, the less positive charge they will experience\u2014both because of their increased distance from the nucleus and because the other electrons in the lower energy core orbitals will act to shield the valence electrons from the positively charged nucleus).\nThe term \"electronegativity\" was introduced by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius in 1811,\nthough the concept was known before that and was studied by many chemists including Avogadro.\nDespite its long history, an accurate scale of electronegativity was not developed until 1932, when Linus Pauling proposed an electronegativity scale that depends on bond energies, as a development of valence bond theory. It has been shown to correlate with several other chemical properties. Electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties. Several methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of electronegativity, all methods show the same periodic trends between elements.\nThe most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, commonly referred to as the Pauling scale (\"\u03c7\"r), on a relative scale running from 0.79 to 3.98 (hydrogen\u00a0= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as electronegativity in \"Pauling units\".\nAs it is usually calculated, electronegativity is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule. Even so, the electronegativity of an atom is strongly correlated with the first ionization energy. The electronegativity is slightly negatively correlated (for smaller electronegativity values) and rather strongly positively correlated (for most and larger electronegativity values) with the electron affinity. It is to be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment, but it is usually considered to be a transferable property, that is to say, that similar values will be valid in a variety of situations.\nCaesium is the least electronegative element (0.79); fluorine is the most (3.98).\nMethods of calculation.\nPauling electronegativity.\nPauling first proposed the concept of electronegativity in 1932 to explain why the covalent bond between two different atoms (A\u2013B) is stronger than the average of the A\u2013A and the B\u2013B bonds. According to valence bond theory, of which Pauling was a notable proponent, this \"additional stabilization\" of the heteronuclear bond is due to the contribution of ionic canonical forms to the bonding.\nThe difference in electronegativity between atoms A and B is given by:\nformula_1\nwhere the dissociation energies, \"E\"d, of the A\u2013B, A\u2013A and B\u2013B bonds are expressed in electronvolts, the factor (eV)\u2212&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 being included to ensure a dimensionless result. Hence, the difference in Pauling electronegativity between hydrogen and bromine is 0.73 (dissociation energies: H\u2013Br, 3.79\u00a0eV; H\u2013H, 4.52\u00a0eV; Br\u2013Br 2.00\u00a0eV)\nAs only differences in electronegativity are defined, it is necessary to choose an arbitrary reference point to construct a scale. Hydrogen was chosen as the reference, as it forms covalent bonds with a large variety of elements: its electronegativity was fixed first at 0, then in his famous book at 2.1 to avoid negative electronegativity figures, later revised to 2.20 by Allred. It is also necessary to decide which of the two elements is the more electronegative (equivalent to choosing one of the two possible signs for the square root). This is usually done using \"chemical intuition\": in the above example, hydrogen bromide dissolves in water to form H+ and Br\u2212 ions, so it may be assumed that bromine is more electronegative than hydrogen. However, in principle, since the same electronegativities should be obtained for any two bonding compounds, the data are overdetermined, and the signs are unique once a reference point has been fixed (usually, for H or F).\nTo calculate Pauling electronegativity for an element, it is necessary to have data on the dissociation energies of at least two types of covalent bonds formed by that element. A. L. Allred updated Pauling's original values in 1961 to take account of the greater availability of thermodynamic data, and it is these \"revised Pauling\" values of the electronegativity that are most often used.\nThe essential point of Pauling electronegativity is that there is an underlying, quite accurate, semi-empirical formula for dissociation energies, namely:\nformula_2\nor sometimes, a more accurate fit\nformula_3\nThese are approximate equations but they hold with good accuracy. Pauling obtained the first equation by noting that a bond can be approximately represented as a quantum mechanical superposition of a covalent bond and two ionic bond states. The covalent energy of a bond is approximately, by quantum mechanical calculations, the geometric mean of the two energies of covalent bonds of the same molecules, and there is additional energy that comes from ionic factors, i.e. polar character of the bond.\nThe geometric mean is approximately equal to the arithmetic mean\u2014which is applied in the first formula above\u2014when the energies are of a similar value, e.g., except for the highly electropositive elements, where there is a larger difference of two dissociation energies; the geometric mean is more accurate and almost always gives positive excess energy, due to ionic bonding. The square root of this excess energy, Pauling notes, is approximately additive, and hence one can introduce the electronegativity. Thus, it is these semi-empirical formulas for bond energy that underlie the concept of Pauling electronegativity.\nThe formulas are approximate, but this rough approximation is good and gives the right intuition, with the notion of the polarity of the bond and some theoretical grounding in quantum mechanics. The electronegativities are then determined to best fit the data.\nIn more complex compounds, there is an additional error since electronegativity depends on the molecular environment of an atom. Also, the energy estimate can be only used for single, not for multiple bonds. The enthalpy of formation of a molecule containing only single bonds can subsequently be estimated based on an electronegativity table, and it depends on the constituents and the sum of squares of differences of electronegativities of all pairs of bonded atoms. Such a formula for estimating energy typically has a relative error on the order of 10% but can be used to get a rough qualitative idea and understanding of a molecule.\n\u2192 Atomic radius decreases \u2192 Ionization energy increases \u2192 Electronegativity increases \u2192\nSee also: Electronegativities of the elements (data page)&lt;br&gt;There are no reliable sources for Pm, Eu and Yb other than the range of 1.1\u20131.2; see Pauling, Linus (1960). \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond.\" 3rd ed., Cornell University Press, p. 93.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMulliken electronegativity.\nRobert S. Mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy (Ei) and the electron affinity (Eea) should be a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons:\nformula_4\nAs this definition is not dependent on an arbitrary relative scale, it has also been termed absolute electronegativity, with the units of kilojoules per mole or electronvolts. However, it is more usual to use a linear transformation to transform these absolute values into values that resemble the more familiar Pauling values. For ionization energies and electron affinities in electronvolts,\nformula_5\nand for energies in kilojoules per mole,\nformula_6\nThe Mulliken electronegativity can only be calculated for an element whose electron affinity is known. Measured values are available for 72 elements, while approximate values have been estimated or calculated for the remaining elements.\nThe Mulliken electronegativity of an atom is sometimes said to be the negative of the chemical potential. By inserting the energetic definitions of the ionization potential and electron affinity into the Mulliken electronegativity, it is possible to show that the Mulliken chemical potential is a finite difference approximation of the electronic energy with respect to the number of electrons., i.e.,\nformula_7\nAllred\u2013Rochow electronegativity.\nA. Louis Allred and Eugene G. Rochow considered that electronegativity should be related to the charge experienced by an electron on the \"surface\" of an atom: The higher the charge per unit area of atomic surface the greater the tendency of that atom to attract electrons. The effective nuclear charge, \"Z\"eff, experienced by valence electrons can be estimated using Slater's rules, while the surface area of an atom in a molecule can be taken to be proportional to the square of the covalent radius, \"r\"cov. When \"r\"cov is expressed in picometres,\nformula_8\nSanderson electronegativity equalization.\nR.T. Sanderson has also noted the relationship between Mulliken electronegativity and atomic size and has proposed a method of calculation based on the reciprocal of the atomic volume. With a knowledge of bond lengths, Sanderson's model allows the estimation of bond energies in a wide range of compounds. Sanderson's model has also been used to calculate molecular geometry, \"s\"-electron energy, NMR spin-spin coupling constants and other parameters for organic compounds. This work underlies the concept of electronegativity equalization, which suggests that electrons distribute themselves around a molecule to minimize or equalize the Mulliken electronegativity. This behavior is analogous to the equalization of chemical potential in macroscopic thermodynamics.\nAllen electronegativity.\nPerhaps the simplest definition of electronegativity is that of Leland C. Allen, who has proposed that it is related to the average energy of the valence electrons in a free atom,\nformula_9\nwhere \"\u03b5\"s,p are the one-electron energies of s- and p-electrons in the free atom and \"n\"s,p are the number of s- and p-electrons in the valence shell.\nThe one-electron energies can be determined directly from spectroscopic data, and so electronegativities calculated by this method are sometimes referred to as spectroscopic electronegativities. The necessary data are available for almost all elements, and this method allows the estimation of electronegativities for elements that cannot be treated by the other methods, e.g. francium, which has an Allen electronegativity of 0.67. However, it is not clear what should be considered to be valence electrons for the d- and f-block elements, which leads to an ambiguity regarding their electronegativities calculated by the Allen method.\nOn this scale, neon has the highest electronegativity of all elements, followed by fluorine, helium, and oxygen.\nCorrelation of electronegativity with other properties.\nThe wide variety of methods of calculation of electronegativities, which all give results that correlate well with one another, is one indication of the number of chemical properties that might be affected by electronegativity. The most obvious application of electronegativities is in the discussion of bond polarity, for which the concept was introduced by Pauling. In general, the greater the difference in electronegativity between two atoms the more polar the bond that will be formed between them, with the atom having the higher electronegativity being at the negative end of the dipole. Pauling proposed an equation to relate the \"ionic character\" of a bond to the difference in electronegativity of the two atoms, although this has fallen somewhat into disuse.\nSeveral correlations have been shown between infrared stretching frequencies of certain bonds and the electronegativities of the atoms involved: However, this is not surprising as such stretching frequencies depend in part on bond strength, which enters into the calculation of Pauling electronegativities. More convincing are the correlations between electronegativity and chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy or isomer shifts in M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy (see figure). Both these measurements depend on the s-electron density at the nucleus, and so is a good indication that the different measures of electronegativity describe \"the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself\".\nTrends in electronegativity.\nPeriodic trends.\nIn general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements (not counting noble gases), whereas caesium is the least electronegative, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.\nThere are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon, respectively, because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity (see Allred-Rochow electronegativity and Sanderson electronegativity above). The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, in particular, when compared to thallium and bismuth, is an artifact of electronegativity varying with oxidation state: its electronegativity conforms better to trends if it is quoted for the +2 state with a Pauling value of 1.87 instead of the +4 state.\nVariation of electronegativity with oxidation number.\nIn inorganic chemistry, it is common to consider a single value of electronegativity to be valid for most \"normal\" situations. While this approach has the advantage of simplicity, it is clear that the electronegativity of an element is \"not\" an invariable atomic property and, in particular, increases with the oxidation state of the element.\nAllred used the Pauling method to calculate separate electronegativities for different oxidation states of the handful of elements (including tin and lead) for which sufficient data were available. However, for most elements, there are not enough different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known to make this approach feasible.\nThe chemical effects of this increase in electronegativity can be seen both in the structures of oxides and halides and in the acidity of oxides and oxoacids. Hence CrO3 and Mn2O7 are acidic oxides with low melting points, while Cr2O3 is amphoteric and Mn2O3 is a completely basic oxide.\nThe effect can also be seen in the dissociation constants p\"K\"a of the oxoacids of chlorine. The effect is much larger than could be explained by the negative charge being shared among a larger number of oxygen atoms, which would lead to a difference in p\"K\"a of log10(&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444)\u00a0= \u22120.6 between hypochlorous acid and perchloric acid. As the oxidation state of the central chlorine atom increases, more electron density is drawn from the oxygen atoms onto the chlorine, diminishing the partial negative charge of individual oxygen atoms. At the same time, the positive partial charge on the hydrogen increases with a higher oxidation state. This explains the observed increased acidity with an increasing oxidation state in the oxoacids of chlorine.\nElectronegativity and hybridization scheme.\nThe electronegativity of an atom changes depending on the hybridization of the orbital employed in bonding. Electrons in s orbitals are held more tightly than electrons in p orbitals. Hence, a bond to an atom that employs an sp\"x\" hybrid orbital for bonding will be more heavily polarized to that atom when the hybrid orbital has more s character. That is, when electronegativities are compared for different hybridization schemes of a given element, the order \u03c7(sp3) &lt; \u03c7(sp2) &lt; \u03c7(sp) holds (the trend should apply to non-integer hybridization indices as well). \nGroup electronegativity.\nIn organic chemistry, electronegativity is associated more with different functional groups than with individual atoms. The terms group electronegativity and substituent electronegativity are used synonymously. However, it is common to distinguish between the inductive effect and the resonance effect, which might be described as \u03c3- and \u03c0-electronegativities, respectively. There are several linear free-energy relationships that have been used to quantify these effects, of which the Hammett equation is the best known. Kabachnik Parameters are group electronegativities for use in organophosphorus chemistry.\nElectropositivity.\nElectropositivity is a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons, and therefore form positive ions; thus, it is antipode to electronegativity.\nMainly, this is an attribute of metals, meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an element the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the alkali metals are the most electropositive of all. This is because they have a single electron in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low ionization energies.\nWhile electronegativity increases along periods in the periodic table and decreases down groups, electropositivity \"decreases\" along periods (from left to right) and \"increases\" down groups. This means that elements in the upper right of the periodic table of elements (oxygen, sulfur, chlorine, etc.) will have the greatest electronegativity, and those in the lower left (rubidium, caesium, and francium) the greatest electropositivity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, the charter does not provide any criterion or definition for an idiom to be a minority or a regional language, and the classification stays in the hands of the national state.\nThe preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential. The actual charter was written in the Parliamentary Assembly based on the Congress' Recommendations. It only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent immigrants from other states, see immigrant languages), which significantly differ from the majority or official language (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as simply local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as Yiddish, Romani and Lemko, which are used over a wide geographic area).\nSome states, such as Ukraine and Sweden, have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities, which are defined by ethnic, cultural and/or religious criteria, thereby circumventing the Charter's notion of linguistic minority.\nLanguages that are official within regions, provinces or federal units within a State (for example Catalan in Spain) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter. On the other hand, Ireland has been unable to sign the Charter on behalf of the Irish language (although a minority language) as it is defined as the first official language of the state. The United Kingdom has ratified the Charter in respect to (among other languages) Welsh in Wales, Scots and Gaelic in Scotland, and Irish in Northern Ireland. France, although a signatory, has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the languages of France.\nThe charter provides many actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages. There are two levels of protection\u2014all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages. Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection, which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35.\nThe Charter does not provide procedures for reactive judicial processing in case of lack of compliance but rather an elaborate proactive regular monitoring process in which the Committee of Experts drafts formal feedback and recommendations in regard to the situation in countries parties to the charter.\nProtections.\nCountries can ratify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on Part II or Part III of the charter, which contain varying principles. Countries can treat languages differently under the charter, for example, in the United Kingdom, the Welsh language is ratified under the general Part II principles as well as the more specific Part III commitments, while the Cornish language is ratified only under Part II.\nPart II.\nPart II of the Charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which States must base their policies and legislation. They are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned.\nPart III.\nPart III details comprehensive rules, across a number of sectors, by which states agree to abide. Each language to which Part III of the Charter is applied must be named specifically by the government. States must select at least thirty-five of the undertakings in respect to each language. Many provisions contain several options, of varying degrees of stringency, one of which has to be chosen \"according to the situation of each language\". The areas from which these specific undertakings must be chosen are as follows:\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Part of the wider 1639 to 1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the struggle consisted of the First English Civil War and the Second English Civil War. The Anglo-Scottish War of 1650 to 1652 is sometimes referred to as the \"Third English Civil War.\"\nWhile the conflicts in the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland had similarities, each had their own specific issues and objectives. The First English Civil War was fought primarily over the correct balance of power between Parliament and Charles I. It ended in June 1646 with Royalist defeat and the king in custody.\nHowever, victory exposed Parliamentarian divisions over the nature of the political settlement. The vast majority went to war in 1642 to assert Parliament's right to participate in government, not abolish the monarchy, which meant Charles' refusal to make concessions led to a stalemate. Concern over the political influence of radicals within the New Model Army like Oliver Cromwell led to an alliance between moderate Parliamentarians and Royalists, supported by the Covenanter Scots. Royalist defeat in the 1648 Second English Civil War resulted in the execution of Charles I in January 1649, and establishment of the Commonwealth of England.\nIn 1650, Charles II was crowned King of Scotland, in return for agreeing to create a Presbyterian church in both England and Scotland. The subsequent Anglo-Scottish war ended with Parliamentarian victory at Worcester on 3 September 1651. Both Ireland and Scotland were incorporated into the Commonwealth, and the British Isles became a unitary state. This arrangement ultimately proved both unpopular and unviable in the long term, and was dissolved upon the Stuart Restoration in 1660. The outcome of the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course towards a parliamentary monarchy form of government.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular, but historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These were not restricted to England alone, as Wales (having been annexed into the Kingdom of England) was affected by the same political instabilities. The conflicts also involved wars with Scotland and Ireland and civil wars within them. Some historians have favoured the term \"The British Civil Wars\". From the Restoration to the 19th century, the common phrase for the civil wars was \"the rebellion\" or \"the great rebellion\".\nThe wars spanning all four countries are known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In the early 19th century, Walter Scott referred to it as \"The Great Civil War\". The 1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\". Some historians, notably Marxists such as Christopher Hill, favoured the term \"English Revolution\".\nGeography.\nEach side had a geographical stronghold, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The Royalist areas included the countryside, the Shires, the cathedral cities of York, Chester, Worcester and Oxford, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England and Wales. Parliament's strengths spanned the industrial centres, ports, and economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England, including the remaining cathedral cities. Historian Lacey Baldwin Smith wrote: \"the words \"populous, rich, and rebellious\" seemed to go hand in hand\".\nStrategy and tactics.\nMany officers and veteran soldiers had fought in European wars, notably the Eighty Years' War between the Spanish and the Dutch, which began in 1568, as well as earlier phases of the Thirty Years' War which began in 1618 and concluded in 1648.\nThe war was of unprecedented scale for the English. During the campaign seasons, 120,000 to 150,000 soldiers would be in the field, a higher proportion of the population than were fighting in Germany in the Thirty Years' War.\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as pike and shot infantry. The two sides would line up opposite one another, with infantry brigades of musketeers in the centre. These carried matchlock muskets, an inaccurate weapon which nevertheless could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards. Musketeers would assemble three rows deep, the first kneeling, second crouching, and third standing. At times, troops divided into two groups, allowing one to reload while the other fired. Among the musketeers were pike men, carrying pikes of to long, whose main purpose was to protect the musketeers from cavalry charges. Positioned on each side of the infantry were cavalry, with a right wing led by the lieutenant-general and left by the commissary general. Its main aim was to rout the opponents' cavalry, then turn and overpower their infantry.\nThe Royalist cavaliers' skill and speed on horseback led to many early victories. Prince Rupert, commanding the king's cavalry, used a tactic learned while fighting in the Dutch army, where cavalry would charge at full speed into the opponent's infantry, firing their pistols just before impact.\nHowever, with Oliver Cromwell and the introduction of the more disciplined New Model Army, a group of disciplined pike men would stand its ground, which could have a devastating effect. The Royalist cavalry had a tendency to chase down individual targets after the initial charge, leaving their forces scattered and tired, whereas Cromwell's cavalry was slower but better disciplined. Trained to operate as a single unit, it went on to win many decisive victories.\nBackground.\nThe English Civil War broke out in 1642, less than 40 years after the death of Queen Elizabeth I. Elizabeth had been succeeded by her first cousin twice-removed, King James VI of Scotland, as James I of England, creating the first personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms. As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was affronted by the constraints the English Parliament attempted to place on him in exchange for money. Consequently, James's personal extravagance, which resulted in him being perennially short of money, meant that he had to resort to extra-parliamentary sources of income. Moreover, increasing inflation during this period meant that even though Parliament was granting the King the same nominal value of subsidy, the income was actually worth less.\nThis extravagance was tempered by James's peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son Charles I in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, internally and in their relations with each other. Charles followed his father's dream in hoping to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a single kingdom. Many English Parliamentarians were suspicious of such a move, fearing that such a new kingdom might destroy old English traditions that had bound the English monarchy. Because James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, and Charles shared his father's position, the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.\nParliament in an English constitutional framework.\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, it functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a Parliament's continued existence was at the King's pleasure since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\nYet in spite of this limited role, Parliament had acquired over the centuries \"de facto\" powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the 17th century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the gentry was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. So, if the king wanted to ensure smooth revenue collection, he needed the gentry's cooperation. For all of the Crown's legal authority, its resources were limited by any modern standard to the extent that if the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked a practical means of compelling them.\nFrom the thirteenth century, monarchs ordered the election of representatives to sit in the House of Commons, with most voters being the owners of property, although in some potwalloper boroughs every male householder could vote. When assembled along with the House of Lords, these elected representatives formed a Parliament. So the concept of Parliaments allowed representatives of the property-owning class to meet, primarily, at least from the point of view of the monarch, to sanction whatever taxes the monarch wished to collect. In the process, the representatives could debate and enact statutes, or acts. However, Parliament lacked the power to force its will upon the monarch; its only leverage was the threat of withholding the financial means required to implement his plans.\nParliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right.\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage in 1625 to a Roman Catholic French princess, Henrietta Maria. Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French Huguenots, whom French royal troops held besieged in La Rochelle. Such military support for Protestants on the Continent potentially alleviated concerns about the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on giving command of the English force to his unpopular royal favourite George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the 1627 relief expedition proved a fiasco, and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on royal patronage, opened impeachment proceedings against him. Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This saved Buckingham but confirmed the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included Oliver Cromwell, John Hampden, and Edward Coke.) The new Parliament drew up a Petition of Right, which Charles accepted as a concession to obtain his subsidy. The Petition made reference to Magna Carta, but did not grant him the right of tonnage and poundage, which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625. Several more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused outrage; one, John Eliot, subsequently died in prison and came to be seen as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.\nPersonal rule.\nCharles avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"personal rule of Charles I\", or by its critics as the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". During this period, Charles's policies were determined by his lack of money. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the Thirty Years' War. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One was to revive conventions, often outdated. For example, a failure to attend and receive knighthood at Charles's coronation became a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through ship money, demanding in 1634\u20131636 that the inland English counties pay a tax for the Royal Navy to counter the threat of privateers and pirates in the English Channel. Established law supported the policy of coastal counties and inland ports such as London paying ship money in times of need, but it had not been applied to inland counties before.\nAuthorities had ignored it for centuries, and many saw it as yet another extra-Parliamentary, illegal tax, which prompted some prominent men to refuse to pay it. Charles issued a writ against John Hampden for his failure to pay, and although five judges including George Croke supported Hampden, seven judges found in favour of the King in 1638. The fines imposed on people who refused to pay ship money and standing out against its illegality aroused widespread indignation.\nDuring his \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures. He believed in High Anglicanism, a sacramental version of the Church of England, theologically based upon Arminianism, a creed shared with his main political adviser, Archbishop William Laud. In 1633, Charles appointed Laud Archbishop of Canterbury and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden communion tables with stone altars. Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism, and when they complained he had them arrested. In 1637, John Bastwick, Henry Burton, and William Prynne had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views \u2013 a rare penalty for gentlemen, and one that aroused anger. Moreover, the Church authorities revived statutes from the time of Elizabeth I about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican services.\nRebellion in Scotland.\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The Church of Scotland, reluctantly episcopal in structure, had independent traditions. Charles wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English Book of Common Prayer to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted. A riot broke out in Edinburgh, which may have been started in St Giles' Cathedral, according to legend, by Jenny Geddes. In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the National Covenant. This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first tested by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the Bishops' War, but after an inconclusive campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the Pacification of Berwick. This truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in mid-1640. A Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured Newcastle. Charles eventually agreed not to interfere in Scotland's religion.\nRecall of the English Parliament.\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland but had insufficient funds to do so. He needed to seek money from a newly elected English Parliament in 1640. Its majority faction, led by John Pym, used this appeal for money as a chance to discuss grievances against the Crown and oppose the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this \"l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9\" (offence against the ruler) and, after negotiations went nowhere, dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence its name, \"the Short Parliament\".\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying Northumberland and Durham. Meanwhile, another of Charles's chief advisers, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth, had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632, and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland. This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field at their second encounter with the Scots in 1640. Almost the whole of Northern England was occupied and Charles forced to pay \u00a3850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. Had he not done so they would have pillaged and burnt the cities and towns of Northern England.\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial state. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this. Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the Magnum Concilium (the House of Lords, but without the Commons, so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.\nThe Long Parliament.\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against him and his government, with Pym and Hampden in the lead. They took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures \u2013 including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes \u2013 upon him. The members passed a law stating that a new Parliament would convene at least once every three years \u2013 without the King's summons if need be. Other laws passed making it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the King's ministers.\nFinally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. These laws equated to a tremendous increase in Parliamentary power. Ever since, this Parliament has been known as the Long Parliament. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign The Protestation, an oath of allegiance to Charles.\nEarly in the Long Parliament, the house overwhelmingly accused Thomas Wentworth (now Earl of Strafford) of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors. Henry Vane the Younger supplied evidence of Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that he had encouraged the King to use his Ireland-raised forces to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, Henry Vane the Elder, a member of the King's Privy Council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to the Younger Vane to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy Council, discovered by the Younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane. These notes contained evidence that Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"\nPym immediately launched a Bill of Attainder stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that he be put to death. Unlike a guilty verdict in a court case, attainder did not require a legal burden of proof to be met, but it did require the king's approval. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed. Furthermore, the Lords opposed the severity of a death sentence on Strafford. Yet increased tensions and a plot in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.\nOn 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained), and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused his assent. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider. Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May. Strafford was beheaded two days later. In the meantime, both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\nThe Long Parliament then passed the Triennial Act 1640, also known as the Dissolution Act, in May 1641, to which royal assent was readily granted. The Triennial Act required Parliament to be summoned at least once in three years. When the king failed to issue a proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in distraint of knighthood, and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back sharply, the courts of the Star Chamber and High Commission abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640, and the Triennial Act respectively.\nAll remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act 1640. On 3 May, Parliament decreed The Protestation, attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', Parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and Episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.\nCharles and his Parliament hoped that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war, but in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, and Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, struck first, and all Ireland soon descended into chaos. Rumours circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.\nOn 4 January 1642, Charles, followed by 400 soldiers, entered the House of Commons and attempted to arrest five members on a charge of treason. The members had learned that he was coming and escaped. Charles not only failed to arrest them but turned more people against him.\nLocal grievances.\nIn the summer of 1642, these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose from many local grievances. For example, imposed drainage schemes in The Fens disrupted the livelihood of thousands after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts. Many saw the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing much of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it such people as the Edward Montagu, Earl of Manchester and Oliver Cromwell, each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the Robert Bertie, Earl of Lindsey, was to die fighting for the King at the Battle of Edgehill.\nFirst English Civil War (1642\u20131646).\nIn early January 1642, a few days after failing to capture five members of the House of Commons, Charles feared for the safety of his family and retinue and left the London area for the north country.\nFurther frequent negotiations by letter between the King and the Long Parliament, through to early summer, proved fruitless. On 1 June the English Lords and Commons approved a list of proposals known as the Nineteen Propositions. In these demands, the Parliament sought a larger share of power in the governance of the kingdom. Before the end of the month the King rejected the Propositions.\nAs the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth commanded by George Goring declared for the King, but when Charles tried to acquire arms from Kingston upon Hull, the weaponry depository used in the previous Scottish campaigns, John Hotham, the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter the town, and when Charles returned with more men later, Hotham drove them off. Charles issued a warrant for Hotham's arrest as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it. Throughout the summer, tensions rose and there was brawling in several places, the first death from the conflict taking place in Manchester.\n1642 battles.\nAt the outset of the conflict, much of the country remained neutral, though the Royal Navy and most English cities favoured Parliament, while the King found marked support in rural communities. The war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of Clubmen to protect their localities from the worst excesses of the armies of both sides, but most found it impossible to withstand both King and Parliament.\nOn one side, the King and his supporters fought for what they saw as traditional government in church and state. On the other, most Parliamentarians initially took up arms to defend what they viewed as a traditional balance of government in church and state, and which they felt had been undermined by bad advice the King received from his advisers \u2014 such as George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham \u2014 and during his Personal Rule (the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\"). The views of the members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King \u2013 at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's Oxford Parliament than at Westminster \u2014 through to radicals who sought major reforms in religious independence and redistribution of power at a national level.\nAfter the debacle at Hull, Charles moved on to Nottingham, raising the royal standard there on 22 August 1642. At the time, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalry and a small number of Yorkshire infantrymen, and using the archaic system of a Commission of Array, his supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a westerly direction, first to Stafford, then on to Shrewsbury, as support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the Severn valley area and in North Wales. While passing through Wellington, he declared in what became known as the \"Wellington Declaration\" that he would uphold the \"Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament\".\nThe Parliamentarians who opposed the King did not remain passive in this pre-war period. As in Hull, they took measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing to office men sympathetic to their cause. On 9 June they voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers and appointed Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex its commander three days later. He received orders \"to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the Prince [of Wales] and the Duke of York [James II] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them.\" The Lords Lieutenant whom Parliament appointed used the Militia Ordinance to order the militia to join Essex's army.\nTwo weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards Northampton, picking up support along the way (including a detachment of Huntingdonshire cavalry raised and commanded by Oliver Cromwell). By mid-September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4,200 cavalry and dragoons. On 14 September he moved his army to Coventry and then to the north of the Cotswolds, a strategy that placed it between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would meet sooner or later. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a troop of about 1,000 Royalist cavalry under Prince Rupert, a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war, defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under Colonel John Brown at the Battle of Powick Bridge, which crossed the River Teme close to Worcester.\nRupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex's new position near Worcester, or march down the now open road towards London. The Council decided on the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the Earl of Clarendon's words, \"it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that the earl of Essex would put himself in their way.\" Hence, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. This had the desired effect of forcing Essex to move to intercept them.\nThe first pitched battle of the war, at Edgehill on 23 October, proved inconclusive, both Royalists and Parliamentarians claiming victory. The second field action, the stand-off at Turnham Green, saw Charles forced to withdraw to Oxford, which would serve as his base for the rest of the war.\n1643 battles.\nIn 1643, Royalist forces won at Adwalton Moor, gaining control of most of Yorkshire. In the Midlands, a Parliamentary force under John Gell besieged and captured the cathedral city of Lichfield, after the death of the original commander, Lord Brooke. This group then joined forces with William Brereton at the inconclusive Battle of Hopton Heath (19 March), where the Royalist commander, the Earl of Northampton, was killed. John Hampden died after being wounded in the Battle of Chalgrove Field (18 June 1643). Subsequent battles in the west of England at Lansdowne and Roundway Down also went to the Royalists. Prince Rupert could then take Bristol. In the same year, however, Cromwell formed his troop of \"Ironsides\", a disciplined unit that demonstrated his military leadership ability. With their assistance he won a victory at the Battle of Gainsborough in July.\nAt this stage, from 7 to 9 August, there were some popular demonstrations in London \u2013 both for and against war. They were protesting at Westminster. A peace demonstration by London women, which turned violent, was suppressed; the women were beaten and fired upon with live ammunition, leaving several dead. Many were arrested and incarcerated in Bridewell and other prisons. After these August events, the Venetian ambassador in England reported to the doge that the London government took considerable measures to stifle dissent.\nIn general, the early part of the war went well for the Royalists. The turning point came in the late summer and early autumn of 1643, when the Earl of Essex's army forced the king to raise the Siege of Gloucester and then brushed the Royalists aside at the First Battle of Newbury (20 September), to return triumphantly to London. Parliamentarian forces led by the Earl of Manchester besieged the port of King's Lynn, Norfolk, which under Hamon L'Estrange held out until September. Other forces won the Battle of Winceby, giving them control of Lincoln. Political manoeuvring to gain an advantage in numbers led Charles to negotiate a ceasefire in Ireland, freeing up English troops to fight on the Royalist side in England, while Parliament offered concessions to the Scots in return for aid and assistance.\n1644 battles.\nHelped by the Scots, Parliament won at Marston Moor (2 July), gaining York and the north of England. Cromwell's conduct in the battle proved decisive, and showed his potential as a political and as an important military leader. Parliament's defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in Cornwall, however, marked a serious reverse in the south-west of England. Subsequent fighting around Newbury (27 October), though tactically indecisive, strategically gave another check to Parliament.\n1645 battles.\nIn 1645, Parliament reaffirmed its determination to fight the war to a finish. It passed the Self-denying Ordinance, by which all members of either House of Parliament laid down their commands and re-organised its main forces into the New Model Army, under the command of Thomas Fairfax, with Cromwell as his second-in-command and Lieutenant-General of Horse. In two decisive engagements \u2013 the Battle of Naseby on 14 June and the Battle of Langport on 10 July \u2013 the Parliamentarians effectively destroyed Charles's armies.\n1646 battles.\nIn the remains of his English realm, Charles tried to recover a stable base of support by consolidating the Midlands. He began to form an axis between Oxford and Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire. These towns had become fortresses and showed more reliable loyalty to him than others. He took Leicester, which lies between them, but found his resources exhausted. Having little opportunity to replenish them, in May 1646 he sought shelter with a Presbyterian Scottish army at Southwell in Nottinghamshire. Charles was eventually handed over to the English Parliament by the Scots and imprisoned. This marked the end of the First English Civil War.\nInterbellum.\nThe end of the First Civil War, in 1646, left a partial power vacuum in which any combination of the three English factions, Royalists, Independents of the New Model Army (\"the Army\"), and Presbyterians of the English Parliament, as well as the Scottish Parliament allied with the Scottish Presbyterians (the \"Kirk\"), could prove strong enough to dominate the rest. Armed political Royalism was at an end, but despite being a prisoner, Charles I was considered by himself and his opponents (almost to the last) as necessary to ensure the success of whichever group could come to terms with him. Thus, he passed successively into the hands of the Scots, the Parliament and the Army.\nThe King attempted to reverse the verdict of arms by \"coquetting\" with each in turn. On 3 June 1647, Cornet George Joyce of Thomas Fairfax's cavalry seized the King for the New Model Army; following the seizure, the English Presbyterians and the Scots began to prepare for a fresh civil war, less than two years after the conclusion of the first, this time against \"Independency\" as embodied in the Army. After making use of the Army, its opponents attempted to disband it, send it onward to foreign service, and to cut off its arrears of pay.\nThe result was that the Army leadership was exasperated beyond control, and, remembering not merely its grievances but also the principle for which the Army had fought, it soon became the most powerful political force in the realm. From 1646 to 1648 the breach between Army and Parliament widened day by day, until finally the Presbyterian party, combined with the Scots and the remaining Royalists, felt itself strong enough to begin a Second Civil War.\nSecond English Civil War (1648\u20131649).\nCharles I took advantage of the deflection of attention away from himself to negotiate on 28 December 1647 a secret treaty with the Scots, again promising church reform. Under the agreement, called the \"Engagement\", the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles's behalf and restore him to the throne.\nA series of Royalist uprisings throughout England and a Scottish invasion occurred in the summer of 1648. Forces loyal to Parliament put down most of those in England after little more than a skirmish, but uprisings in Kent, Essex and Cumberland, the rebellion in Wales, and the Scottish invasion involved pitched battles and prolonged sieges.\nIn the spring of 1649, unpaid Parliamentarian troops in Wales changed sides. Colonel Thomas Horton defeated the Royalist rebels at the Battle of St Fagans (8 May) and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after a protracted two-month siege of Pembroke. Thomas Fairfax defeated a Royalist uprising in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone on 1 June. Fairfax, after his success at Maidstone and the pacification of Kent, turned north to reduce Essex, where, under an ardent, experienced and popular leader, Charles Lucas, the Royalists had taken up arms in great numbers. Fairfax soon drove the enemy into Colchester, but his first attack on the town met with a repulse and he had to settle down to a long siege.\nIn the North of England, Major-General John Lambert fought a successful campaign against several Royalist uprisings, the largest being that of Marmaduke Langdale in Cumberland. Thanks to Lambert's successes, the Scottish commander, the Duke of Hamilton, had to take a western route through Carlisle in his pro-Royalist Scottish invasion of England. The Parliamentarians under Cromwell engaged the Scots at the Battle of Preston (17\u201319 August). The battle took place largely at Walton-le-Dale near Preston, Lancashire, and resulted in a victory for Cromwell's troops over the Royalists and Scots commanded by Hamilton. This victory marked the end of the Second English Civil War.\nNearly all the Royalists who had fought in the First Civil War had given their word not to bear arms against Parliament, and many, like Lord Astley, were therefore bound by oath not to take any part in the second conflict. So, the victors in the Second Civil War showed little mercy to those who had brought war into the land again. On the evening of the surrender of Colchester, Parliamentarians had Charles Lucas and George Lisle shot. Parliamentary authorities sentenced the leaders of the Welsh rebels, Major-General Rowland Laugharne, Colonel John Poyer and Colonel Rice Powel to death, but executed only Poyer (25 April 1649), having selected him by lot. Of five prominent Royalist peers who had fallen into Parliamentary hands, three \u2013 the Duke of Hamilton, the Henry Rich, Earl of Holland, and Arthur Capell, one of the Colchester prisoners and a man of high character \u2013 were beheaded at Westminster on 9 March.\nTrial of Charles I for treason.\nCharles's secret pacts and encouragement of supporters to break their parole caused Parliament to debate whether to return the King to power at all. Those who still supported Charles's place on the throne, such as the army leader and moderate Fairfax, tried again to negotiate with him. The Army, furious that Parliament continued to countenance Charles as a ruler, then marched on Parliament and conducted \"Pride's Purge\", named after the commanding officer of the operation, Thomas Pride, in December 1648.\nTroops arrested 45 members and kept 146 out of the chamber. They allowed only 75 members in, and then only at the Army's bidding. This Rump Parliament received orders to set up, in the name of the people of England, a High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I for treason. Fairfax, a constitutional monarchist, declined to have anything to do with the trial. He resigned as head of the army, so clearing Cromwell's road to power.\nAt the end of the trial the 59 Commissioners judged Charles I guilty of high treason as a \"tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy\". He was beheaded on a scaffold in front of the Banqueting House of the Palace of Whitehall on 30 January 1649. After the Restoration in 1660, nine of the surviving regicides not living in exile were executed and most others sentenced to life imprisonment.\nAfter the regicide, Charles, Prince of Wales as the eldest son was publicly proclaimed King Charles II in the Royal Square of St. Helier, Jersey, on 17 February 1649 (after a first such proclamation in Edinburgh on 5 February 1649). It took longer for the news to reach the trans-Atlantic colonies, with the Somers Isles (also known as Bermuda) becoming the first to proclaim Charles II King on 5 July 1649.\nThird English Civil War (1649\u20131651).\nIreland.\nIreland had undergone continual war since the rebellion of 1641, with most of the island controlled by the Irish Confederates. Increasingly threatened by the armies of the English Parliament after Charles I's arrest in 1648, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists. The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under James Butler, Duke of Ormonde tried to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin by laying siege in 1649, but their opponents routed them at the Battle of Rathmines (2 August 1649). Admiral Robert Blake, a former Member of Parliament, had blockaded Prince Rupert's fleet in Kinsale, enabling Oliver Cromwell to land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with an army to quell the Royalist alliance.\nCromwell's suppression of the Royalists in Ireland in 1649 is still remembered by many Irish people. After the Siege of Drogheda, the massacre of nearly 3,500 people \u2013 around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and 700 others, including civilians, prisoners, and Catholic priests (all of whom Cromwell claimed had carried arms) \u2013 became one of the historical memories that has driven Irish-English and Catholic-Protestant strife during the last three centuries. The Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland ground on for another four years until 1653, when the last Irish Confederate and Royalist troops surrendered. In the wake of the conquest, the victors confiscated almost all Irish Catholic-owned land and distributed it to Parliament's creditors, to Parliamentary soldiers who served in Ireland, and to English who had settled there before the war.\nScotland.\nThe execution of Charles I altered the dynamics of the Civil War in Scotland, which had raged between Royalists and Covenanters since 1644. By 1649, the struggle had left the Royalists there in disarray and their erstwhile leader, James Graham, Marquess of Montrose, had gone into exile. At first, Charles II encouraged Montrose to raise a Highland army to fight on the Royalist side. When the Scottish Covenanters, who did not agree with the execution of Charles I and who feared for the future of Presbyterianism under the new Commonwealth, offered him the crown of Scotland, Charles abandoned Montrose to his enemies.\nMontrose, who had raised a mercenary force in Norway, had already landed and could not abandon the fight. He did not succeed in raising many Highland clans and the Covenanters defeated his army at the Battle of Carbisdale in Ross-shire on 27 April 1650. The victors captured Montrose shortly afterwards and took him to Edinburgh. On 20 May the Scottish Parliament sentenced him to death and had him hanged the next day.\nCharles II landed in Scotland at Garmouth in Morayshire on 23 June 1650 and signed the 1638 National Covenant and the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant shortly after coming ashore. With his original Scottish Royalist followers and his new Covenanter allies, Charles II became the greatest threat facing the new English republic. In response to the threat, Cromwell left some of his lieutenants in Ireland to continue the suppression of the Irish Royalists and returned to England.\nHe arrived in Scotland on 22 July 1650 and proceeded to lay siege to Edinburgh. By the end of August, disease and a shortage of supplies had reduced his army, and he had to order a retreat towards his base at Dunbar. A Scottish army under the command of David Leslie tried to block the retreat, but Cromwell defeated them at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September. Cromwell's army then took Edinburgh, and by the end of the year his army had occupied much of southern Scotland.\nIn July 1651, Cromwell's forces crossed the Firth of Forth into Fife and defeated the Scots at the Battle of Inverkeithing (20 July 1651). The New Model Army advanced towards Perth, which allowed Charles, at the head of the Scottish army, to move south into England. Cromwell followed Charles into England, leaving George Monck to finish the campaign in Scotland. Monck took Stirling on 14 August and Dundee on 1 September. The next year, 1652, saw a mopping up of the remnants of Royalist resistance, and under the terms of the \"Tender of Union\", the Scots received 30 seats in a united Parliament in London, with General Monck as the military governor of Scotland.\nEngland.\nAlthough Cromwell's New Model Army had defeated a Scottish army at Dunbar, Cromwell could not prevent Charles II from marching from Scotland deep into England at the head of another Royalist army. They marched to the west of England where English Royalist sympathies were strongest, but although some English Royalists joined the army, they were far fewer in number than Charles and his Scottish supporters had hoped. Cromwell finally engaged and defeated the new Scottish king at Worcester on 3 September 1651.\nWales.\nFor several reasons most of Wales was not as engaged in the English Civil Wars to the same degree as other parts of the British Isles. Wales was isolated from England, both physically and linguistically, so the Welsh were not as much engaged as England in the issues between the king and Parliament. The English considered Wales a remote land, with Welsh, not English, as the primary language. Since England had formally assimilated Wales into the kingdom, starting in 1536 formal agreements had been put in place under Henry VIII and continued under Charles I that allowed for Welsh local administrative authority and economic control, which allowed the Welsh to function to some degree independently. Another factor was the Puritan religion, which played a major role in the English Civil Wars but was not widely practised throughout Wales. Welsh Puritan religious dominance was found in northeast Wales near Wrexham, Denbighshire, and an indirect Puritan influence found along the southwestern coast near Haverfordwest, Pembroke, and Tenby due to a combination of a strong influence by the third earl of Essex and their strong trade relations with Bristol, England, a fervent Puritan stronghold. In addition, Wales was comparatively more rural in character than England at this time, and lacked the large number of urban settlements home to mercantile, trade, and manufacturing interests who were a bulwark of support for both Puritanism and eventually the Parliamentarian cause.\nMany of the key Welsh Civil Wars leaders were from the gentry class holding Royalist sympathies, or from the Church. Those Welsh who did participate in the Civil Wars battles were underequipped, underfed, and not properly trained for warfare. The majority of Welsh followed the Protestant faith with a religious perspective that differed from the English puritan zeal. They were also leery of the Irish Catholics invading Wales. The Welsh also did not want to lose what they had, for the gentry were aware of the destruction the Thirty Years' War caused in Europe.\nMost of those English Civil War battles where Wales was impacted occurred near the border with England and in south Wales. Some of the more significant engagements were:\nIn addition to the Civil Wars' impact on the monarchy and the changes in national leadership, unexpected outcomes of the English Civil Wars to Wales included a significant degradation of the country's road system, a deterioration of government administrative functions to the general population, destruction of castles with only the remnants of them remaining, and the desecration of churches.\nImmediate aftermath.\nAfter the Royalist defeat at Worcester, Charles II escaped to France via safe houses and an oak tree. Parliament was left in \"de facto\" control of England. Resistance continued for a time in Ireland and Scotland, but with the pacification of England, resistance elsewhere did not threaten the military supremacy of the New Model Army and its Parliamentary paymasters.\nPolitical control.\nDuring the Wars, the Parliamentarians established a number of successive committees to oversee the war effort. The first, the Committee of Safety set up in July 1642, comprised 15 members of Parliament. After the Anglo-Scottish alliance against the Royalists, the Committee of Both Kingdoms replaced the Committee of Safety between 1644 and 1648. Parliament dissolved the Committee of Both Kingdoms when the alliance ended, but its English members continued to meet as the Derby House Committee. A second Committee of Safety then replaced it.\nEpiscopacy.\nDuring the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and upholders of the established church became a matter of heated political controversy. John Calvin of Geneva had formulated a doctrine of Presbyterianism, which held that the offices of \"presbyter\" and \"episkopos\" in the New Testament were identical; he rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession. Calvin's follower John Knox brought Presbyterianism to Scotland when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy.\nThis vision of at least partial democracy in ecclesiology paralleled the struggles between Parliament and the King. A body within the Puritan movement in the Church of England sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The Martin Marprelate tracts (1588\u20131589), applying the pejorative name of \"prelacy\" to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended Elizabeth I and her Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift. The vestments controversy also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even idolatrous.\nKing James VI, reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan. He tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as King and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his authority. Matters came to a head when Charles I appointed William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full Book of Common Prayer. The controversy eventually led to Laud's impeachment for treason by a bill of attainder in 1645 and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland. The Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the Bishops' Wars in 1639\u20131640.\nDuring the height of Puritan power under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646. The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the Restoration of the monarchy.\nEnglish overseas possessions.\nDuring the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions became highly involved. In the Channel Islands, the island of Jersey and Castle Cornet in Guernsey supported the King until a surrender with honour in December 1651.\nAlthough the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, notably Massachusetts, were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between Royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the Battle of the Severn. The Virginia Company's settlements, Bermuda and Virginia, as well as Antigua and Barbados, were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the Bahamas under William Sayle as the Eleutheran Adventurers. Parliament passed An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego in October 1650, which stated that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any manner of Commerce or Traffic with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all manner of persons, Foreigners, and others, all manner of Commerce, Traffic and Correspondence whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbados, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary privateers to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.\nFar to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. Built-up inside the natural defence of a nearly impassable barrier reef, to fend off the might of Spain, these defences would have been a formidable obstacle for the Parliamentary fleet sent in 1651 under the command of Admiral George Ayscue to subdue the trans-Atlantic colonies, but after the fall of Barbados, the Bermudians made a separate peace that respected the internal status quo. The Parliament of Bermuda avoided the Parliament of England's fate during The Protectorate, becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan Richard Bennett was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's Cavaliers to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy when Charles II dubbed it the \"Old Dominion\".\nCasualties.\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable. Some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars, plus at least 60,000 in Scotland. Historical records count 84,830 combat dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops' wars, a \"conservative\" estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved, out of a total population of about five million. It is estimated that from 1638 to 1651, from a pre-war population of approximately 6 million (5 million in England and Wales and 1 million in Scotland) some 25% of all adult males in Britain served in the military at some point. Deaths amounted to 3.7 per cent of the total population in England and 6 per cent in Scotland.\nAs was typical for the era, most combat deaths occurred in minor skirmishes rather than large, pitched battles. There were a total of 645 engagements throughout the wars: 588 of these involved fewer than 250 casualties in total, with these 588 accounting for 39,838 fatalities (average count of less than 68) or nearly half of the conflict's combat deaths. There were only 9 major pitched battles (at least 1,000 fatalities) which in total accounted for 15% of casualties.\nAn anecdotal example of how high casualties in England may have been perceived is to be found in the posthumously published writing (generally titled \"The History of Myddle\"), by a Shropshire man, Richard Gough (lived 1635\u20131723) of Myddle near Shrewsbury, who, writing in about 1701, commented of men from his rural home parish who joined the Royalist forces: \"And out of these three townes [\"sic\" - ie townships], Myddle, Marton and Newton, there went noe less than twenty men, of which number thirteen were kill'd in the warrs\". After listing those he recalled did not return home, four of whose exact fates were unknown, he concluded: \"And if soe many dyed out of these 3 townes [townships] wee may reasonably guess that many thousands dyed in England in that warre.\"\nFigures for Scotland are less reliable and should be treated with caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the Battle of Worcester were deported to New England, Bermuda and the West Indies to work for landowners as indentured labourers). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved, from a population of about one million.\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly, the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by William Petty, the father of English demography. Petty estimated that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through plague, war and famine, giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead, out of a pre-war population of about one and a half million. Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as tentative; they do not include an estimated 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 4 per cent loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6 per cent, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41 per cent of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation of Ireland in particular. The Great Famine of 1845\u20131852 resulted in a loss of 16 per cent of the population, while during the Soviet famine and Holodomor of 1932\u201333 the population of the Soviet Ukraine fell by 14 per cent.\nPopular gains.\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society in the 1640s to gain personal advantages. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London's transport workers. The old \"status quo\" began a retrenchment after the end of the First Civil War in 1646, and more especially after the Restoration in 1660, but some gains were long-term. The democratic element introduced into the watermen's company in 1642, for example, survived with vicissitudes until 1827. \nParliament adopted a policy of confiscating (\"sequestrating\") the estates of \u201cdelinquents\u201d (active Royalists) in 1643, a policy carried out by local committees. Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of Royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and church hierarchy. Some communities improved their conditions of tenure on such estates.\nAftermath.\nThe wars left England, Scotland, and Ireland among the few countries in Europe without a monarch. In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the Commonwealth of England ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting among various factions in Parliament, Oliver Cromwell ruled over the Protectorate as Lord Protector (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.\nOn Oliver Cromwell's death, his son Richard became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him. After seven months the Army removed Richard. In May 1659 it re-installed the Rump. Military force shortly afterward dissolved this as well. After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed, as the Army's pretense of unity dissolved into factions.\nInto this atmosphere General George Monck, Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland. On 4 April 1660, in the Declaration of Breda, Charles II made known the conditions of his acceptance of the Crown of England. Monck organised the Convention Parliament, which met for the first time on 25 April 1660.\nOn 8 May 1660, it declared that Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I in January 1649. Charles returned from exile on 23 May 1660. On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king. His coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the \"Restoration\".\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, it was still with the consent of Parliament. So the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course towards a parliamentary monarchy form of government. The outcome of this system was that the future Kingdom of Great Britain, formed in 1707 under the Acts of Union, managed to forestall the kind of revolution typical of European republican movements which generally resulted in total abolition of their monarchies. Thus, the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the Glorious Revolution.\nHistorical interpretations.\nHobbes' \"Behemoth\".\nThomas Hobbes gave an early historical account of the English Civil War in his \"Behemoth\", written in 1668 and published in 1681. He assessed the causes of the war to be the conflicting political doctrines of the time. \"Behemoth\" offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also attempted to explain why Charles I could not hold his throne and maintain peace in his kingdom.\nHobbes analysed the following aspects of English thought during the war: the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.\nHobbes attributed the war to the novel theories of intellectuals and divines spread for their own pride of reputation. He held that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the troubles \u2014 \"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\". Hobbes wanted to abolish the independence of the clergy and bring it under the control of the civil state.\nSome scholars suggest that Hobbes's \"Behemoth\" has not received its due as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and under-rated in the shadow of the same author's \"Leviathan\". Its scholarly reputation may have suffered because it takes the form of a dialogue, which, while common in philosophy, is rarely adopted by historians. Other factors that hindered its success include Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' lack of empathy with views different from his own.\nWhig and Marxist views.\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the Whig school was the dominant theoretical view. It explained the Civil War as resulting from centuries of struggle between Parliament (notably the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to dictate law arbitrarily. The major Whig historian, S. R. Gardiner, popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\" that challenged the repressive Stuart Church and prepared the way for religious toleration. Thus, Puritanism was seen as the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the Marxist school, which became popular in the 1940s, and saw the English Civil War as a bourgeois revolution. According to Marxist historian Christopher Hill:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.\nLater views.\nIn the 1970s, revisionist historians challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories, notably in the 1973 anthology \"The Origins of the English Civil War\" (Conrad Russell ed.). These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, returning to the contingency-based historiography of Clarendon's \"History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England\". This, it was claimed, demonstrated that patterns of war allegiance did not fit either Whig or Marxist theories. Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the Glorious Revolution. Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament.\nFrom the 1990s, a number of historians replaced the historical title \"English Civil War\" with \"Wars of the Three Kingdoms\" and \"British Civil Wars\", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood apart from events in other parts of Britain and Ireland. King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but through his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when Charles forced an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the Covenanters, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this need of military funds forced Charles I to call an English Parliament, which was not willing to grant the needed revenue unless he addressed their grievances.\nBy the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near-permanent crisis management, confounded by the demands of the various factions. For example, Charles finally made terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.\nA number of revisionist historians such as William M. Lamont regarded the conflict as a religious war, with John Morrill (1993) stating: 'The English Civil War was not the first European revolution: it was the last of the Wars of Religion.' This view has been criticised by various pre-, post- and anti-revisionist historians. Glen Burgess (1998) examined political propaganda written by the Parliamentarian politicians and clerics at the time, noting that many were or may have been motivated by their Puritan religious beliefs to support the war against the 'Catholic' king Charles I, but tried to express and legitimise their opposition and rebellion in terms of a legal revolt against a monarch who had violated crucial constitutional principles and thus had to be overthrown. They even warned their Parliamentarian allies to not make overt use of religious arguments in making their case for war against the king.\nHowever, in some cases it may be argued that they hid their pro-Anglican and anti-Catholic motives behind legal parlance, for example by emphasising that the Church of England was the \"legally established\" religion: 'Seen in this light, the defences of Parliament's war, with their apparent legal-constitutional thrust, are not at all ways of saying that the struggle was not religious. On the contrary, they are ways of saying that it was.' Burgess concluded: '[T]he Civil War left behind it just the sort of evidence that we could reasonably expect a war of religion to leave.'\nRe-enactments.\nTwo large historical societies exist, The Sealed Knot and The English Civil War Society, which regularly re-enact events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:"}

Here the symbols a, b, and c represent arbitrary numbers, and x is a variable which represents the solution of the equation.\nElementary algebra, also known as high school algebra or college algebra, encompasses the basic concepts of algebra. It is often contrasted with arithmetic: arithmetic deals with specified numbers, whilst algebra introduces numerical variables (quantities without fixed values).\nThis use of variables entails use of algebraic notation and an understanding of the general rules of the operations introduced in arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. Unlike abstract algebra, elementary algebra is not concerned with algebraic structures outside the realm of real and complex numbers.\nIt is typically taught to secondary school students and at introductory college level in the United States, and builds on their understanding of arithmetic. The use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. Many quantitative relationships in science and mathematics are expressed as algebraic equations.\nAlgebraic notation.\nAlgebraic notation describes the rules and conventions for writing mathematical expressions, as well as the terminology used for talking about parts of expressions. For example, the expression formula_4 has the following components:\nA \"coefficient\" is a numerical value, or letter representing a numerical constant, that multiplies a variable (the operator is omitted). A \"term\" is an addend or a summand, a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators. Letters represent variables and constants. By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. formula_5) are typically used to represent constants, and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. formula_6 and z) are used to represent variables. They are usually printed in italics.\nAlgebraic operations work in the same way as arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation, and are applied to algebraic variables and terms. Multiplication symbols are usually omitted, and implied when there is no space between two variables or terms, or when a coefficient is used. For example, formula_7 is written as formula_8, and formula_9 may be written formula_10.\nUsually terms with the highest power (exponent), are written on the left, for example, formula_11 is written to the left of x. When a coefficient is one, it is usually omitted (e.g. formula_12 is written formula_11). Likewise when the exponent (power) is one, (e.g. formula_14 is written formula_15). When the exponent is zero, the result is always 1 (e.g. formula_16 is always rewritten to 1). However formula_17, being undefined, should not appear in an expression, and care should be taken in simplifying expressions in which variables may appear in exponents.\nAlternative notation.\nOther types of notation are used in algebraic expressions when the required formatting is not available, or can not be implied, such as where only letters and symbols are available. As an illustration of this, while exponents are usually formatted using superscripts, e.g., formula_11, in plain text, and in the TeX mark-up language, the caret symbol ^ represents exponentiation, so formula_11 is written as \"x^2\". This also applies to some programming languages such as Lua. In programming languages such as Ada, Fortran, Perl, Python and Ruby, a double asterisk is used, so formula_11 is written as \"x**2\". Many programming languages and calculators use a single asterisk to represent the multiplication symbol, and it must be explicitly used, for example, formula_15 is written \"3*x\".\nConcepts.\nVariables.\nElementary algebra builds on and extends arithmetic by introducing letters called variables to represent general (non-specified) numbers. This is useful for several reasons.\nSimplifying expressions.\nAlgebraic expressions may be evaluated and simplified, based on the basic properties of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation). For example,\nEquations.\nAn equation states that two expressions are equal using the symbol for equality, \n (the equals sign). One of the best-known equations describes Pythagoras' law relating the length of the sides of a right angle triangle:\nformula_41\nThis equation states that formula_42, representing the square of the length of the side that is the hypotenuse, the side opposite the right angle, is equal to the sum (addition) of the squares of the other two sides whose lengths are represented by a and b.\nAn equation is the claim that two expressions have the same value and are equal. Some equations are true for all values of the involved variables (such as formula_43); such equations are called identities. Conditional equations are true for only some values of the involved variables, e.g. formula_44 is true only for formula_45 and formula_46. The values of the variables which make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found through equation solving.\nAnother type of equation is inequality. Inequalities are used to show that one side of the equation is greater, or less, than the other. The symbols used for this are: formula_47 where formula_48 represents 'greater than', and formula_49 where formula_50 represents 'less than'. Just like standard equality equations, numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. The only exception is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be flipped.\nProperties of equality.\nBy definition, equality is an equivalence relation, meaning it is reflexive (i.e. formula_51), symmetric (i.e. if formula_52 then formula_53), and transitive (i.e. if formula_52 and formula_55 then formula_56). It also satisfies the important property that if two symbols are used for equal things, then one symbol can be substituted for the other in any true statement about the first and the statement will remain true. This implies the following properties:\nProperties of inequality.\nThe relations \"less than\" formula_50 and greater than formula_48 have the property of transitivity:\nBy reversing the inequation, formula_50 and formula_48 can be swapped, for example:\nSubstitution.\nSubstitution is replacing the terms in an expression to create a new expression. Substituting 3 for a in the expression \"a\"*5 makes a new expression 3*5 with meaning 15. Substituting the terms of a statement makes a new statement. When the original statement is true independently of the values of the terms, the statement created by substitutions is also true. Hence, definitions can be made in symbolic terms and interpreted through substitution: if formula_84 is meant as the definition of formula_85 as the product of a with itself, substituting 3 for a informs the reader of this statement that formula_86 means 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. Often it's not known whether the statement is true independently of the values of the terms. And, substitution allows one to derive restrictions on the possible values, or show what conditions the statement holds under. For example, taking the statement \"x\" + 1 = 0, if x is substituted with 1, this implies 1 + 1 = 2 = 0, which is false, which implies that if \"x\" + 1 = 0 then x cannot be 1.\nIf \"x\" and \"y\" are integers, rationals, or real numbers, then \"xy\" = 0 implies \"x\" = 0 or \"y\" = 0. Consider \"abc\" = 0. Then, substituting \"a\" for \"x\" and \"bc\" for \"y\", we learn \"a\" = 0 or \"bc\" = 0. Then we can substitute again, letting \"x\" = \"b\" and \"y\" = \"c\", to show that if \"bc\" = 0 then \"b\" = 0 or \"c\" = 0. Therefore, if \"abc\" = 0, then \"a\" = 0 or (\"b\" = 0 or \"c\" = 0), so \"abc\" = 0 implies \"a\" = 0 or \"b\" = 0 or \"c\" = 0.\nIf the original fact were stated as \"\"ab\" = 0 implies \"a\" = 0 or \"b\" = 0\", then when saying \"consider \"abc\" = 0,\" we would have a conflict of terms when substituting. Yet the above logic is still valid to show that if \"abc\" = 0 then \"a\" = 0 or \"b\" = 0 or \"c\" = 0 if, instead of letting \"a\" = \"a\" and \"b\" = \"bc\", one substitutes \"a\" for \"a\" and \"b\" for \"bc\" (and with \"bc\" = 0, substituting \"b\" for \"a\" and \"c\" for \"b\"). This shows that substituting for the terms in a statement isn't always the same as letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted terms. In this situation it's clear that if we substitute an expression \"a\" into the \"a\" term of the original equation, the \"a\" substituted does not refer to the \"a\" in the statement \"\"ab\" = 0 implies \"a\" = 0 or \"b\" = 0.\"\nSolving algebraic equations.\nThe following sections lay out examples of some of the types of algebraic equations that may be encountered.\nLinear equations with one variable.\nLinear equations are so-called, because when they are plotted, they describe a straight line. The simplest equations to solve are linear equations that have only one variable. They contain only constant numbers and a single variable without an exponent. As an example, consider:\n Problem in words: If you double the age of a child and add 4, the resulting answer is 12. How old is the child?\nEquivalent equation: formula_87 where x represent the child's age\nTo solve this kind of equation, the technique is add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of the equation by the same number in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Once the variable is isolated, the other side of the equation is the value of the variable. This problem and its solution are as follows:\nIn words: the child is 4 years old.\nThe general form of a linear equation with one variable, can be written as: formula_88\nFollowing the same procedure (i.e. subtract b from both sides, and then divide by a), the general solution is given by formula_89\nLinear equations with two variables.\nA linear equation with two variables has many (i.e. an infinite number of) solutions. For example:\nProblem in words: A father is 22 years older than his son. How old are they?\nEquivalent equation: formula_90 where y is the father's age, x is the son's age.\nThat cannot be worked out by itself. If the son's age was made known, then there would no longer be two unknowns (variables). The problem then becomes a linear equation with just one variable, that can be solved as described above.\nTo solve a linear equation with two variables (unknowns), requires two related equations. For example, if it was also revealed that:\n In 10 years, the father will be twice as old as his son.\n formula_91\nNow there are two related linear equations, each with two unknowns, which enables the production of a linear equation with just one variable, by subtracting one from the other (called the elimination method):\nformula_92\nformula_93\nIn other words, the son is aged 12, and since the father 22 years older, he must be 34. In 10 years, the son will be 22, and the father will be twice his age, 44. This problem is illustrated on the associated plot of the equations.\nFor other ways to solve this kind of equations, see below, System of linear equations.\nQuadratic equations.\nA quadratic equation is one which includes a term with an exponent of 2, for example, formula_33, and no term with higher exponent. The name derives from the Latin \"quadrus\", meaning square. In general, a quadratic equation can be expressed in the form formula_95, where a is not zero (if it were zero, then the equation would not be quadratic but linear). Because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term formula_96, which is known as the quadratic term. Hence formula_97, and so we may divide by a and rearrange the equation into the standard form\n formula_98\nwhere formula_99 and formula_100. Solving this, by a process known as completing the square, leads to the quadratic formula\nformula_101\nwhere the symbol \"\u00b1\" indicates that both\n formula_102\nare solutions of the quadratic equation.\nQuadratic equations can also be solved using factorization (the reverse process of which is expansion, but for two linear terms is sometimes denoted foiling). As an example of factoring:\n formula_103\nwhich is the same thing as\n formula_104\nIt follows from the zero-product property that either formula_105 or formula_106 are the solutions, since precisely one of the factors must be equal to zero. All quadratic equations will have two solutions in the complex number system, but need not have any in the real number system. For example,\n formula_107\nhas no real number solution since no real number squared equals \u22121.\nSometimes a quadratic equation has a root of multiplicity 2, such as:\n formula_108\nFor this equation, \u22121 is a root of multiplicity 2. This means \u22121 appears twice, since the equation can be rewritten in factored form as\nformula_109\nComplex numbers.\nAll quadratic equations have exactly two solutions in complex numbers (but they may be equal to each other), a category that includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums of real and imaginary numbers. Complex numbers first arise in the teaching of quadratic equations and the quadratic formula. For example, the quadratic equation\nformula_110\nhas solutions\nformula_111\nSince formula_112 is not any real number, both of these solutions for \"x\" are complex numbers.\nExponential and logarithmic equations.\nAn exponential equation is one which has the form formula_113 for formula_114, which has solution\n formula_115\nwhen formula_116. Elementary algebraic techniques are used to rewrite a given equation in the above way before arriving at the solution. For example, if\n formula_117\nthen, by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, and then dividing both sides by 3 we obtain\n formula_118\nwhence\n formula_119\nor\n formula_120\nA logarithmic equation is an equation of the form formula_121 for formula_114, which has solution\n formula_123\nFor example, if\n formula_124\nthen, by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, followed by dividing both sides by 4, we get\n formula_125\nwhence\n formula_126\nfrom which we obtain\n formula_127\nRadical equations.\nformula_128 Radical equation showing two ways to represent the same expression. The triple bar means the equation is true for all values of \"x\"\nA radical equation is one that includes a radical sign, which includes square roots, formula_129 cube roots, formula_130, and \"n\"th roots, formula_131. Recall that an \"n\"th root can be rewritten in exponential format, so that formula_131 is equivalent to formula_133. Combined with regular exponents (powers), then formula_134 (the square root of x cubed), can be rewritten as formula_135. So a common form of a radical equation is formula_136 (equivalent to formula_137) where m and n are integers. It has real solution(s):\nFor example, if:\nformula_138\nthen\n formula_139\nand thus \nformula_140\nSystem of linear equations.\nThere are different methods to solve a system of linear equations with two variables.\nElimination method.\nAn example of solving a system of linear equations is by using the elimination method:\n formula_141\nMultiplying the terms in the second equation by 2:\n formula_142\n formula_143\nAdding the two equations together to get:\n formula_144\nwhich simplifies to\n formula_145\nSince the fact that formula_105 is known, it is then possible to deduce that formula_147 by either of the original two equations (by using \"2\" instead of x ) The full solution to this problem is then\n formula_148\nThis is not the only way to solve this specific system; y could have been resolved before x.\nSubstitution method.\nAnother way of solving the same system of linear equations is by substitution.\n formula_149\nAn equivalent for y can be deduced by using one of the two equations. Using the second equation:\n formula_150\nSubtracting formula_151 from each side of the equation:\n formula_152\nand multiplying by \u22121:\n formula_153\nUsing this y value in the first equation in the original system:\n formula_154\nAdding \"2\" on each side of the equation:\n formula_155\nwhich simplifies to\n formula_156\nUsing this value in one of the equations, the same solution as in the previous method is obtained.\n formula_148\nThis is not the only way to solve this specific system; in this case as well, y could have been solved before x.\nOther types of systems of linear equations.\nInconsistent systems.\nIn the above example, a solution exists. However, there are also systems of equations which do not have any solution. Such a system is called inconsistent. An obvious example is\n formula_158\nAs 0\u22602, the second equation in the system has no solution. Therefore, the system has no solution.\nHowever, not all inconsistent systems are recognized at first sight. As an example, consider the system \n formula_159\nMultiplying by 2 both sides of the second equation, and adding it to the first one results in\n formula_160\nwhich clearly has no solution.\nUndetermined systems.\nThere are also systems which have infinitely many solutions, in contrast to a system with a unique solution (meaning, a unique pair of values for x and y) For example:\n formula_161\nIsolating y in the second equation:\n formula_162\nAnd using this value in the first equation in the system:\n formula_163\nThe equality is true, but it does not provide a value for x. Indeed, one can easily verify (by just filling in some values of x) that for any x there is a solution as long as formula_164. There is an infinite number of solutions for this system.\nOver- and underdetermined systems.\nSystems with more variables than the number of linear equations are called underdetermined. Such a system, if it has any solutions, does not have a unique one but rather an infinitude of them. An example of such a system is\n formula_165\nWhen trying to solve it, one is led to express some variables as functions of the other ones if any solutions exist, but cannot express \"all\" solutions numerically because there are an infinite number of them if there are any.\nA system with a higher number of equations than variables is called overdetermined. If an overdetermined system has any solutions, necessarily some equations are linear combinations of the others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9713", "revid": "1358022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9713", "title": "Ernest Thayer", "text": "American writer and poet (1863\u20131940)\nErnest Lawrence Thayer (; August 14, 1863 \u2013 August 21, 1940) was an American writer and poet who wrote the poem \"Casey\" (or \"Casey at the Bat\"), which is \"the single most famous baseball poem ever written\" according to the Baseball Almanac, and \"the nation\u2019s best-known piece of comic verse\u2014a ballad that began a native legend as colorful and permanent as that of Johnny Appleseed or Paul Bunyan\".\nBiography.\nThayer was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and raised in nearby Worcester. He graduated \"magna cum laude\" in philosophy from Harvard University in 1885, where he had been editor of the \"Harvard Lampoon\" and a member of the theatrical society Hasty Pudding. William Randolph Hearst, a friend from both activities, hired Thayer as humor columnist for the \"San Francisco Examiner\" 1886\u201388.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuring my brief connection with the Examiner, I put out large quantities of nonsense, both prose and verse, sounding the whole newspaper gamut from advertisements to editorials. In general quality \"Casey\" (at least in my judgment) is neither better nor worse than much of the other stuff. Its persistent vogue is simply unaccountable, and it would be hard to say, all things considered, if it has given me more pleasure than annoyance. The constant wrangling about the authorship, from which I have tried to keep aloof, has certainly filled me with disgust.\nErnest Thayer\nThayer's last piece for the \"Examiner\", dated June 3, 1888, was a ballad entitled \"Casey\" (\"Casey at the Bat\") which made him \"a prize specimen of the one-poem poet\" according to \"American Heritage\".\nIt was not until several months after the publication of the poem that Thayer became famous for it, since he was hardly the boastful type and had signed the June 24 poem with the nickname \"Phin\" which he had used since his time as a writer for the \"Harvard Lampoon\". Two mysteries remain about the poem: whether Casey and Mudville were based on a real person or place, and, if so, their actual identities. On March 31, 2007, Katie Zezima of the \"New York Times\" wrote an article called \"In 'Casey' Rhubarb, 2 Cities Cry 'Foul!'\" on the competing claims of two towns to such renown: Stockton, California, and Holliston, Massachusetts.\nOn the possible model for Casey, Thayer dismissed the notion that any single living baseball player was an influence. However, late 1880s Boston star Mike \"King\" Kelly is likely as a model for Casey's baseball situations. Besides being a native of a town close to Boston, Thayer, as a \"San Francisco Examiner\" baseball reporter in the off-season of 1887\u201388, covered exhibition games featuring Kelly. During November 1887, some of his reportage about a Kelly at-bat has the same ring as Casey's famous at-bat in the poem. A 2004 book by Howard W. Rosenberg, \"Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat,\" reprints a 1905 Thayer letter to a Baltimore scribe who was asking about the poem's roots. In the letter, Thayer named Kelly (d. 1894), as having shown \"impudence\" in claiming to have inspired it. Rosenberg argues that if Thayer still felt offended, Thayer may have later denied Kelly as an influence. Kelly had also performed as a vaudeville actor, and recited the poem dozens of times.\nThe first public performance of the poem was on August 14, 1888, by actor De Wolf Hopper, on Thayer's 25th birthday. Thayer recited the poem at a Harvard class reunion in 1895.\nDuring the mid-1890s, Thayer contributed several other comic poems for Hearst's newspaper the \"New York Journal\" and then began overseeing his family's mills in Worcester full-time. Thayer relocated to Santa Barbara in 1912, where he married Rosalind Buel Hammett and retired. He died in 1940, seven days after his 77th birthday.\nThe \"New York Times\"' obituary of Thayer on August 22, 1940, p.\u00a019 quotes comedian DeWolf Hopper, who helped make the poem famous:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Thayer indubitably wrote \"Casey,\" but he could not recite it... I have heard many others give \"Casey.\" Fond mamas have brought their sons to me to hear their childish voices lisp the poem, but Thayer's was the worst of all. In a sweet, dulcet Harvard whisper he implored \"Casey\" to murder the umpire, and gave this cry of mass animal rage all the emphasis of a caterpillar wearing rubbers crawling on a velvet carpet. He was rotten.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9717", "revid": "10863197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9717", "title": "Excalibur", "text": "Legendary sword of King Arthur\nExcalibur is the mythical sword of King Arthur that may possess magical powers or be associated with the rightful sovereignty of Britain. Its first reliably datable appearance is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". Excalibur as the \"sword in the stone\" functioning as the proof of Arthur's lineage is an iconic motif featured throughout most works dealing with Arthur's youth since its introduction in Robert de Boron's \"Merlin\". The sword given to the young Arthur by the Lady of the Lake in the tradition that began soon afterwards with the \"Post-Vulgate Cycle\" is not the same weapon, but in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" both of them share the name of Excalibur. Several similar swords and other weapons also appear within Arthurian texts, as well as in other legends.\nForms and etymology.\nThe name \"Excalibur\" ultimately derives from the Welsh (Breton , Middle Cornish ), which is a compound of , 'hard', and , 'breach, cleft'. Caledfwlch appears in several early Welsh works, including the prose tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\" (c.\u200911th\u201312th century). The name was later used in Welsh adaptations of foreign material such as the s (chronicles), which were based on Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is often considered to be related to the phonetically similar , a sword borne by several figures from Irish mythology, although a borrowing of from the Irish has been considered unlikely by Rachel Bromwich and D. Simon Evans. They suggest instead that both names \"may have similarly arisen at a very early date as generic names for a sword\". In the late 15th to early 16th-century Middle Cornish play , Arthur's sword is called , which is etymologically an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh . It is unclear if the name was borrowed from the Welsh (if so, it must have been an early loan, for phonological reasons), or represents an early, pan-Brittonic traditional name for Arthur's sword.\nWelsh author Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his Latin chronicle (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\", c.\u20091136), Latinised the name of Arthur's sword as (possibly influenced by the Medieval Latin spelling of Classical Latin , from the Greek (), 'steel'). Most Celticists consider Geoffrey's to be derivative of a lost Old Welsh text in which (Old Welsh ) had not yet been lenited to (Middle Welsh or ). Geoffrey Gaimar, in his Old French chronicle (1134\u20131140), mentions Arthur and his sword: \"this Constantine was the nephew of Arthur, who had the sword Caliburc\" (\"\"). In Wace's (c.\u20091150\u20131155), composed in Old French, the sword is called (, , ), , , , , and (with additional variant spellings such as , , , , , found in various continental manuscripts). Various other spellings in the later medieval Arthurian literature have included \"Calibourch\", \"Calibourn\", \"Calibourne\", \"Caliburc\", \"Escaliber\", \"Escalibur\", \"Excalibor\", and finally the familiar \"Excalibur\".\nLegend.\nThe Sword in the Stone and the Sword in the Lake.\nRomance tradition elaborates on how Arthur pulled out Excalibur. In Robert de Boron's c. 1200 French poem \"Merlin\", the first known tale to mention the \"sword in the stone\" motif, Arthur obtained the British throne by pulling a sword from an anvil sitting atop a stone that appeared in a churchyard on Christmas Eve. In this account, as foretold by Merlin, the act could not be performed except by \"the true king\", meaning the divinely appointed king or true heir of Uther Pendragon. (As Thomas Malory related in his 15th-century Middle English Arthurian compilation, \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", \"whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born of all England.\") The scene is set by different authors at either explicitly London (historical Londinium) or generally in the land of Logres (which can be a city and also associated with London), and might have been inspired by a miracle attributed to the 11th-century bishop Wulfstan of Worcester. \nAfter many of the gathered nobles try and fail to complete Merlin's challenge, the teenage Arthur, who up to this point had believed himself to be the biological son of Ector and had gone there as a squire to his foster brother Kay, succeeds effortlessly. Arthur first achieves this feat by accident while unaware of the contest and unseen. He then returns the sword to its place in the anvil on a stone, and later repeats the act publicly as Merlin comes to announce his true parentage.\nThe identity of this sword as Excalibur is made explicit in the Prose \"Merlin\", a part of the thirteenth-century \"Lancelot-Grail\" cycle of French romances also known as the \"Vulgate Cycle\". Eventually, in the cycle's finale Vulgate \"Mort Artu\", when Arthur is at the brink of death, he enigmatically orders his surviving knight Griflet to cast Excalibur into a nearby lake. After two failed attempts to deceive Arthur, since Griflet felt that such a great sword should not be thrown away, he finally does comply with the wounded king's request. A woman's hand emerges from the lake to catch Excalibur, after which Morgan appears in a boat to take Arthur to Avalon. This motif then became attached to Bedivere (or Yvain in the chronicle \"Scalacronica\"), instead of Griflet, in the English Arthurian tradition.\nHowever, in the subsequent Post-Vulgate Cycle variants of the \"Merlin\" and the \"Merlin Continuation\", written soon afterwards, Arthur's sword drawn from the stone is unnamed. Furthermore, the young Arthur promptly breaks it in his duel against King Pellinore very early in his reign. On Merlin's advice, Arthur then goes with him to be given the actual Excalibur by a Lady of the Lake in exchange for a later boon for her (some time later, she arrives at Arthur's court to demand the head of Balin). In the Post-Vulgate \"Mort Artu\", it is this sword that is eventually hurled into the pool at Camlann (or actually Salisbury Plain where both cycles locate the battle, as do the English romances) by Griflet in the same circumstances as told in the story's Vulgate version. Malory included both of these stories in his now-iconic \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" while naming each of the swords as Excalibur: both the first one (from the stone), soon shattered in combat in a story taken from the Post-Vulgate \"Merlin Continuation\", and its replacement (from the lake), returned by Bedivere in the end.\nOther roles and attributes.\nIn the Welsh tales, Arthur's sword is known as \"Caledfwlch\". In \"Culhwch and Olwen\", it is one of Arthur's most valuable possessions and is used by Arthur's warrior Llenlleawg the Irishman to kill the Irish king Diwrnach while stealing his magical cauldron. Though not named as Caledfwlch, Arthur's sword is described vividly in \"The Dream of Rhonabwy\", one of the tales associated with the \"Mabinogion\" (as translated by Jeffrey Gantz): \"Then they heard Cadwr Earl of Cornwall being summoned, and saw him rise with Arthur's sword in his hand, with a design of two chimeras on the golden hilt; when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two chimeras was like two flames of fire, so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look.\"\nGeoffrey's \"Historia\" is the first non-Welsh text to speak of the sword. Geoffrey says the sword was forged in Avalon and Latinises the name Caledfwlch as \"Caliburnus\". When his influential pseudo-history made it to continental Europe, writers altered the name further until it finally took on the popular form \"Excalibur\". Its role was expanded upon in the Vulgate Cycle as well as in the Post-Vulgate Cycle which emerged in its wake. Both of these prose cycles incorporated the Prose \"Merlin\", but the Post-Vulgate authors left out the original \"Merlin\" continuation from the earlier cycle, choosing to add an original account of Arthur's early days that includes a new origin for Excalibur.\nIn Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes' late 12th-century Old French \"Perceval\", Arthur's nephew and best knight Gawain carries Excalibur, \"for at his belt hung Escalibor, the finest sword that there was, which sliced through iron as through wood\" (\"\"). This statement was probably picked up by the author of the \"Estoire Merlin\", or Vulgate \"Merlin\", where the author asserts that Escalibor \"is a Hebrew name which means in French 'cuts iron, steel, and wood'\" (\"\"; the word for 'steel', \"achier\", also means 'blade' or 'sword' and is from the medieval Latin , a derivative of ['sharp']). It is from this fanciful etymological musing that Thomas Malory got the notion that Excalibur meant 'cut steel', writing: \"'the name of it,' said the lady, 'is Excalibur, that is as moche to say, as cut stele'\". In addition, it said by Malory and his sources that when Arthur first drew Excalibur in combat (testing his sovereignty), its blade shone so bright that it blinded his enemies.\nIn the Post-Vulgate version (used in Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" for the second Excalibur), the sword's scabbard is also said to have powers of its own, as any wounds received while wearing it would not bleed at all, thus preventing the wearer from ever bleeding to death in battle. For this reason, Merlin chides Arthur for preferring Excalibur over its sheath, saying that the latter is the greater treasure. The scabbard is, however, soon stolen from Arthur by his half-sister Morgan le Fay in revenge for the death of her beloved Accolon, he having been slain by Arthur with Excalibur in a duel involving a false Excalibur (Morgan also secretly makes at least one duplicate of Excalibur during the time when the sword is entrusted to her by Arthur earlier in the different French, Iberian and English variants of that story). During Morgan's flight from the pursuit by Arthur, the sheath is then thrown by her into a deep lake and lost. This act later enables the death of Arthur, deprived of its magical protection, many years later in his final battle. In Malory's telling, the scabbard is never found again. In the Post-Vulgate, however, it is recovered and claimed by another fay, Marsique, who then briefly gives it to Gawain to help him fight Naborn the Enchanter (a Mabon figure).\nAs mentioned above, Excalibur is wielded also by Gawain in some French romances, including the Vulgate \"Lancelot\". The Prose \"Merlin\" also uniquely tells of Gawain killing the Roman leader Lucius with Excalibur. This is, however, in contrast to most versions, where Excalibur belongs solely to Arthur. A few texts, such as the English Alliterative \"Morte Arthure\" and one copy of the Welsh \"Ymddiddan Arthur a'r Eryr\", tell of Arthur using Excalibur to kill his son Mordred (in the first of these, he also uses it to kill Lucius). In the Iberian post-Arthurian romance \"Florambel de Lucea\", Morgan later gifts Excalibur (\"Esclariber\") to the eponymous hero. Another late Iberian romance, \"Tirant lo Blanch\", features Arthur who was brought back to life by Morgan and then wandered the world for a long time while mad and able to talk only when having Excalibur in his hands. Finally, Morgan finds her brother imprisoned in the contemporary (15th-century) Constantinople, where she restores him to his mind by making him gaze upon his reflection in Excalibur's blade. In \"Perceforest\", the sword is described as having originally belonged to Priam and then taken by Cassandra after the fall of Troy. \"The Sword in the Stone\" story in \"Perceforest\" tells how it had ended up embedded in the 'Great Stone' centuries before the time of Arthur.\nConnections and analogues.\nSimilar weapons.\nThe challenge of drawing a sword from a stone also appears in the later Arthurian story of Galahad, whose achievement of the task indicates that he is destined to find the Holy Grail, as also foretold in Merlin's prophecies. This powerful yet cursed weapon, known as the Adventurous Sword among other names, has also come from Avalon. In the Post-Vulgate (and Malory), it if first both drawn from its scabbard in a contest and promptly stolen by Balin, who then wields it until his death when he uses it to kill his own brother. In this version, it is later briefly taken up by Galahad, who pulls it from a stone floating on the river just outside Camelot, and eventually is used by Lancelot to give his former friend Gawain a mortal wound in their long final duel. In \"Perlesvaus\", Lancelot pulls a spear from stone pedestal. In the Post-Vulgate \"Merlin\" (and Malory), Morgan creates the copies of Excalibur itself as well as of its scabbard.\nIn Welsh mythology, the Dyrnwyn (\"White-Hilt\"), one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, is said to be a powerful sword belonging to Rhydderch Hael, one of the Three Generous Men of Britain mentioned in the Welsh Triads. When drawn by a worthy or well-born man, the entire blade would blaze with fire. Rhydderch was never reluctant to hand the weapon to anyone, hence his nickname Hael \"the Generous\", but the recipients, as soon as they had learned of its peculiar properties, always rejected the sword. There are other similar weapons described in other mythologies as well. Irish mythology features Caladbolg, the sword of Fergus mac R\u00f3ich, which was also known for its incredible power and was carried by some of Ireland's greatest heroes. The name, which can also mean \"hard cleft\" in Irish, appears in the plural, \"caladbuilc\", as a generic term for \"great swords\" in \"Togail Troi\" (\"The Destruction of Troy\"), a 10th-century Irish translation of the classical tale. A sword named Cla\u00edomh Solais, which is an Irish term meaning \"sword of light\", or \"shining sword\", appears in a number of orally transmitted Irish folk-tales. The Sword in the Stone has an analogue in some versions of the story of Sigurd, whose father, Sigmund, draws the sword Gram out of the tree Barnstokkr where it is embedded by the Norse god Odin. Apart from legendary swords, the only real ancient Sword in the Stone which still exists nowadays is kept since the medieval ages in the Chapel of Saint Galgano at Montesiepi in Tuscany, Italy; it is associated with the 12th-century Italian legend of that saint in the tale of \"Tuscany's Excalibur\".\nArthur's other weapons.\nA number of different swords and other weapons have been also associated with Arthur. In the Alliterative \"Morte Arthure\", Clarent is the royal sword of peace meant for knighting and ceremonies as opposed to battle. Guinevere steals it for Mordred, who then uses it to kill Arthur at Camlann. The Prose \"Lancelot\" of the Vulgate Cycle mentions a sword called Sequence (also \"Secace\" or \"Seure\") as borrowed from Arthur by Lancelot. In the Vulgate \"Merlin\", Arthur captures Marmiadoise (Marmydoyse), the marvellous sword of Hercules, from the latter's descendant King Rions. Marmiadoise's powers (such as causing wounds that would never heal) are so superior to those of Excalibur that Arthur gives Excalibur to Gawain.\nEarly-Arthurian Welsh tradition knew of a dagger named Carnwennan and a spear named Rhongomyniad that belonged to him. Carnwennan (\"little white-hilt\") first appears in \"Culhwch and Olwen\", where Arthur uses it to slice the witch Orddu in half. Rhongomyniad (\"spear\" + \"striker, slayer\") is also mentioned in \"Culhwch\", although only in passing; it appears as simply Ron (\"spear\") in Geoffrey's \"Historia\". Geoffrey also names Arthur's shield as Pridwen; in \"Culhwch\", however, Prydwen (\"fair face\") is the name of Arthur's ship while his shield is named Wynebgwrthucher (\"face of evening\").\nExcalibur as a relic.\nHistorically, a sword identified as Excalibur (Caliburn) was supposedly discovered during the exhumation of Arthur's purported grave at Glastonbury Abbey in 1191. On 6 March 1191, after the Treaty of Messina, either this or another claimed Excalibur was given as a gift of goodwill by the English king Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart) to his ally Tancred, King of Sicily. It was one of a series of symbolic Arthurian acts by the Anglo-Norman monarchs, such as their association of the crown of King Arthur with the crown they won from the slain Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Music writers have described it as \"the second most common blues form\" being \"common to folk, rock, and jazz forms of the blues\". It is often notated in or time with eight bars to the verse.\nOverview.\nEarly examples of eight-bar blues standards include:\nOne variant using this progression is to couple one eight-bar blues melody with a different eight-bar blues bridge to create a blues variant of the standard 32-bar song: \"I Want a Little Girl\" (T-Bone Walker) and \"Great Balls of Fire\" (Jerry Lee Lewis)(\nEight-bar blues progressions have more variations than the more rigidly defined twelve bar format. The move to the IV chord usually happens at bar 3 (as opposed to 5 in twelve bar); however, \"the I chord moving to the V chord right away, in the second measure, is a characteristic of the eight-bar blues.\"\nIn the following examples each box represents a 'bar' of music (the specific time signature is not relevant). The chord in the box is played for the full bar. If two chords are in the box they are each played for half a bar, etc. The chords are represented as scale degrees in Roman numeral analysis. Roman numerals are used so the musician may understand the progression of the chords regardless of the key it is played in.\n\"Eight-bar blues chord progression\":\n\"Worried Life Blues\" (probably the most common eight-bar blues progression):\n\"Heartbreak Hotel\" (variation with the I on the first half):\nJ. B. Lenoir's \"Slow Down\" and \"Key to the Highway\" (variation with the V at bar 2):\n\"Get a Haircut\" by George Thorogood (simple progression):\nJimmy Rogers' \"Walkin' By Myself\" (somewhat unorthodox example of the form):\nHowlin Wolf's version of \"Sitting on Top of the World\" is actually a 9 bar blues that adds an extra \"V\" chord at the end of the progression. The song uses movement between major and dominant 7th and major and minor fourth:\nThe first four bar progression used by Wolf is also used in Nina Simone's 1965 version of \"Trouble in Mind\", but with a more uptempo beat than \"Sitting on Top of the World\":\nThe progression may be created by dropping the first four bars from the twelve-bar blues, as in the solo section of Bonnie Raitt's \"Love Me Like a Man\" and Buddy Guy's \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\":\nThere are at least a few very successful songs using somewhat unusual chord progressions as well. For example, the song \"Ain't Nobody's Business\" as performed by Freddie King at least, uses a I\u2013III\u2013IV\u2013iv progression in each of the first four bars. The same four bar progression is used by the band Radiohead to make up the bulk of the song \"Creep\".\nThe same chord progression can also be called a sixteen-bar blues, if each symbol above is taken to be a half note in or time. Examples are \"Nine Pound Hammer\" and Ray Charles's original instrumental \"Sweet Sixteen Bars\".\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He entered Magdalene College, Cambridge as a sizar and became Senior wrangler in 1757. He was elected a Fellow of Magdalene and in 1760 Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, holding the chair until his death. He made the assertion known as Waring's problem without proof in his writings \"Meditationes Algebraicae\". Waring was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1763 and awarded the Copley Medal in 1784.\nEarly years.\nWaring was the eldest son of John and Elizabeth Waring, a prosperous farming couple. He received his early education in Shrewsbury School under a Mr Hotchkin and was admitted as a sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 24 March 1753, being also Millington exhibitioner. \nHis extraordinary talent for mathematics was recognised from his early years in Cambridge. In 1757 he graduated BA as senior wrangler and on 24 April 1758 was elected to a fellowship at Magdalene. He belonged to the Hyson Club, whose members included William Paley.\nCareer.\nAt the end of 1759 Waring published the first chapter of \"Miscellanea Analytica\". On 28 January the next year he was appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics, one of the highest positions in Cambridge. William Samuel Powell, then tutor in St John's College, Cambridge opposed Waring's election and instead supported the candidacy of William Ludlam. In the polemic with Powell, Waring was backed by John Wilson. In fact Waring was very young and did not hold the MA, necessary for qualifying for the Lucasian chair, but this was granted him in 1760 by royal mandate. In 1762 he published the full \"Miscellanea Analytica\", mainly devoted to the theory of numbers and algebraic equations. In 1763 he was elected to the Royal Society. He was awarded its Copley Medal in 1784 but withdrew from the society in 1795, after he had reached sixty, 'on account of [his] age'. Waring was also a member of the academies of sciences of G\u00f6ttingen and Bologna. In 1767 he took an MD degree, but his activity in medicine was quite limited. He carried out dissections with Richard Watson, professor of chemistry and later bishop of Llandaff. From about 1770 he was physician at Addenbrooke's Hospital at Cambridge, and he also practised at St Ives, Huntingdonshire, where he lived for some years after 1767. His career as a physician was not very successful since he was seriously short-sighted and a very shy man.\nPersonal life.\nWaring had a younger brother, Humphrey, who obtained a fellowship at Magdalene in 1775. In 1776 Waring married Mary Oswell, sister of a draper in Shrewsbury; they moved to Shrewsbury and then retired to Plealey, 8 miles out of the town, where Waring owned an estate of 215 acres in 1797\nWork.\nWaring wrote a number of papers in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\", dealing with the resolution of algebraic equations, number theory, series, approximation of roots, interpolation, the geometry of conic sections, and dynamics. The \"Meditationes Algebraicae\" (1770), where many of the results published in \"Miscellanea Analytica\" were reworked and expanded, was described by Joseph-Louis Lagrange as 'a work full of excellent researches'. In this work Waring published many theorems concerning the solution of algebraic equations which attracted the attention of continental mathematicians, but his best results are in number theory. Included in this work was the so-called Goldbach conjecture (every even integer is the sum of two primes), and also the following conjecture: every odd integer is a prime or the sum of three primes. Lagrange had proved that every positive integer is the sum of not more than four squares; Waring suggested that every positive integer is either a cube or the sum of not more than nine cubes. He also advanced the hypothesis that every positive integer is either a biquadrate (fourth power) or the sum of not more than nineteen biquadrates. These hypotheses form what is known as Waring's problem. He also published a theorem, due to his friend John Wilson, concerning prime numbers; it was later proven rigorously by Lagrange.\nIn \"Proprietates Algebraicarum Curvarum\" (1772) Waring reissued in a much revised form the first four chapters of the second part of \"Miscellanea Analytica\". He devoted himself to the classification of higher plane curves, improving results obtained by Isaac Newton, James Stirling, Leonhard Euler, and Gabriel Cramer. In 1794 he published a few copies of a philosophical work entitled \"An Essay on the Principles of Human Knowledge\", which were circulated among his friends.\nWaring's mathematical style is highly analytical. In fact he criticised those British mathematicians who adhered too strictly to geometry. It is indicative that he was one of the subscribers of John Landen's \"Residual Analysis\" (1764), one of the works in which the tradition of the Newtonian fluxional calculus was more severely criticised. In the preface of \"Meditationes Analyticae\" Waring showed a good knowledge of continental mathematicians such as Alexis Clairaut, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Euler. He lamented the fact that in Great Britain mathematics was cultivated with less interest than on the continent, and clearly desired to be considered as highly as the great names in continental mathematics\u2014there is no doubt that he was reading their work at a level never reached by any other eighteenth-century British mathematician. Most notably, at the end of chapter three of \"Meditationes Analyticae\" Waring presents some partial fluxional equations (partial differential equations in Leibnizian terminology); such equations are a mathematical instrument of great importance in the study of continuous bodies which was almost completely neglected in Britain before Waring's researches. One of the most interesting results in \"Meditationes Analyticae\" is a test for the convergence of series generally attributed to d'Alembert (the 'ratio test'). The theory of convergence of series (the object of which is to establish when the summation of an infinite number of terms can be said to have a finite 'sum') was not much advanced in the eighteenth century.\nWaring's work was known both in Britain and on the continent, but it is difficult to evaluate his impact on the development of mathematics. His work on algebraic equations contained in \"Miscellanea Analytica\" was translated into Italian by Vincenzo Riccati in 1770. Waring's style is not systematic and his exposition is often obscure. It seems that he never lectured and did not habitually correspond with other mathematicians. After J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande in 1796 observed, in \"Notice sur la vie de Condorcet\", that in 1764 there was not a single first-rate analyst in England, Waring's reply, published after his death as 'Original letter of Dr Waring' in the \"Monthly Magazine\", stated that he had given 'somewhere between three and four hundred new propositions of one kind or another'.\nDeath.\nDuring his last years he sank into a deep religious melancholy, and a violent cold caused his death, in Plealey, on 15 August 1798. He was buried in the churchyard at Fitz, Shropshire.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born in Mount Abu, India, was educated in Plymouth, Devon, and worked as an insurance officer for ten years before studying for the stage and eventually becoming a writer.\nLife.\nEden Phillpotts was a great-nephew of Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter. His father Henry Phillpotts was a son of the bishop's younger brother Thomas Phillpotts. James Surtees Phillpotts the reforming headmaster of Bedford School was his second cousin.\nEden Phillpotts was born on 4 November 1862 at Mount Abu in Rajasthan. His father Henry was an officer in the Indian Army, while his mother Adelaide was the daughter of an Indian Civil Service officer posted in Madras, George Jenkins Waters.\nHenry Phillpotts died in 1865, leaving Adelaide a widow at the age of 21. With her three small sons, of whom Eden was the eldest, she returned to England and settled in Plymouth.\nPhillpotts was educated at Mannamead School in Plymouth. At school he showed no signs of a literary bent. In 1879, aged 17, he left home and went to London to earn his living. He found a job as a clerk with the Sun Fire Office.\nPhillpotts' ambition was to be an actor and he attended evening classes at a drama school for two years. He came to the conclusion that he would never make a name as an actor but might have success as a writer. In his spare time out of office hours he proceeded to create a stream of small works which he was able to sell. In due course he left the insurance company to concentrate on his writing, while also working part-time as assistant editor for the weekly \"Black and White\" magazine.\nEden Phillpotts maintained a steady output of three or four books a year for the next half century. He produced poetry, short stories, novels, plays and mystery tales. Many of his novels were about rural Devon life and some of his plays were distinguished by their effective use of regional dialect.\nEden Phillpotts died at his home in Broadclyst near Exeter, Devon, on 29 December 1960.\nPersonal life.\nPhillpotts was for many years the President of the Dartmoor Preservation Association and cared passionately about the conservation of Dartmoor. He was an agnostic and a supporter of the Rationalist Press Association.\nPhillpotts was a friend of Agatha Christie, who was an admirer of his work and a regular visitor to his home. She dedicated her 1932 novel \"Peril at End House\" to Phillpotts, and in her autobiography, she expressed gratitude for his early advice on fiction writing and quoted some of it. Jorge Luis Borges was another Phillpotts admirer. Borges mentioned him numerous times, wrote at least two reviews of his novels, and included him in his \"Personal Library\", a collection of works selected to reflect his personal literary preferences.\nPhilpotts allegedly sexually abused his daughter Adelaide. In a 1976 interview for a book about her father, Adelaide described an incestuous \"relationship\" with him that she says lasted from the age of five or six until her early thirties, when he remarried. When she herself finally married at the age of 55 her father never forgave her, and never communicated with her again.\nWritings.\nPhillpotts wrote a great many books with a Dartmoor setting. One of his novels, \"Widecombe Fair\" (1913), inspired by an annual fair at the village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor, provided the scenario for his comic play \"The Farmer's Wife\" (1916). It went on to become a 1928 silent film of the same name, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It was followed by a 1941 remake, directed by Norman Lee and Leslie Arliss. It became a BBC TV drama in 1955, directed by Owen Reed. Jan Stewer played Churdles Ash. The BBC had broadcast the play in 1934.\nHe co-wrote several plays with his daughter Adelaide Phillpotts, \"The Farmer's Wife\" and \"Yellow Sands\" (1926); she later claimed their relationship was incestuous. Eden is best known as the author of many novels, plays and poems about Dartmoor. His Dartmoor cycle of 18 novels and two volumes of short stories still has many avid readers despite the fact that many titles are out of print.\nPhilpotts also wrote a series of novels, each set against the background of a different trade or industry. Titles include: \"Brunel's Tower\" (a pottery) and \"Storm in a Teacup\" (hand-papermaking). Among his other works is \"The Grey Room\", the plot of which is centred on a haunted room in an English manor house. He also wrote a number of other mystery novels, both under his own name and the pseudonym Harrington Hext. These include: \"The Thing at Their Heels\", \"The Red Redmaynes\", \"The Monster\", \"The Clue from the Stars\", and \"The Captain's Curio\". \"The Human Boy\" was a collection of schoolboy stories in the same genre as Rudyard Kipling's \"Stalky &amp; Co.\", though different in mood and style. Late in his long writing career he wrote a few books of interest to science fiction and fantasy readers, the most noteworthy being \"Saurus\", which involves an alien reptilian observing human life.\nEric Partridge praised the immediacy and impact of his dialect writing.\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNovels\nShort Fiction Books\nPoetry\nPlays\nNonfiction\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ties are further strengthened by the presence of an estimated 150,000-200,000 Ecuadorians living in the United States and by 24,000 U.S. citizens visiting Ecuador annually, and by approximately 15,000 U.S. citizens living in Ecuador.\nRelations between the two nations have been strained following Julian Assange's bid to seek political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London following repeated claims that the US government was pursuing his extradition due to his work with Wikileaks.\n Ecuador first offered political asylum to Julian Assange in November 2010, which he then invoked by entering their London embassy in June 2012. This was then revoked in 2019, following negotiations between the Moreno administration and the British Government. Relations have since improved following the ouster of Rafael Correa from office as President of Ecuador. \nHistory.\nBoth nations were early signatories of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (the \"Rio Treaty\") of 1947, the Western Hemisphere's regional mutual security treaty. However, under the Correa administration, Ecuador denounced the treaty in February 2014, a legal prerequisite by which Ecuador would leave the treaty in 2016. Ecuador shares U.S. concern over increasing narcotrafficking and international terrorism and has energetically condemned terrorist actions, whether directed against government officials or private citizens. The government has maintained Ecuador virtually free of coca production since the mid-1980s and is working to combat money laundering and the transhipment of drugs and chemicals essential to the processing of cocaine.\nAccording to CIA critic and former CIA agent who was stationed in Ecuador Philip Agee, the CIA carried out extensive operations and political manipulation in Ecuador in the early 1960s. For instance the CIA was involved in the group the Ecuadorian Anti-Communist Action.\nEcuador and the U.S. agreed in 1999 to a 10-year arrangement whereby U.S. military surveillance aircraft could use the airbase at Manta, Ecuador, as a \"Forward Operating Location\" to detect drug trafficking flights through the region. The arrangement expired in 2009; former president Rafael Correa vowed not to renew it, and since then Ecuador has not had any foreign military facilities in the country.\nIn fisheries issues, the United States claims jurisdiction for the management of coastal fisheries up to 200 mile (370\u00a0km) from its coast, but excludes highly migratory species; Ecuador, on the other hand, claims a 200-mile (370-km) territorial sea, and imposes license fees and fines on foreign fishing vessels in the area, making no exceptions for catches of migratory species. In the early 1970s, Ecuador seized about 100 foreign-flag vessels (many of them U.S.) and collected fees and fines of more than $6 million. After a drop-off in such seizures for some years, several U.S. tuna boats were again detained and seized in 1980 and 1981.\nThe U.S. Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act then triggered an automatic prohibition of U.S. imports of tuna products from Ecuador. The prohibition was lifted in 1983, and although fundamental differences between U.S. and Ecuadorian legislation still exist, there is no current conflict. During the period that has elapsed since seizures which triggered the tuna import ban, successive Ecuadorian governments have declared their willingness to explore possible solutions to this problem with mutual respect for longstanding positions and principles of both sides. The election of Rafael Correa in October 2006, has strained relations between the two countries and relations have since been fraught with tension. Rafael Correa was heavily critical of U.S. foreign policy whilst in office.\nIn April 2011, relations between Ecuador and the United States soured particularly after Ecuador expelled the U.S. ambassador after a leaked diplomatic cable was shown accusing president Correa of knowingly ignoring police corruption. In reciprocation, the Ecuadorian ambassador Luis Gallegos was expelled from the United States.\nIn 2013, when Ecuador unilaterally pulled out of a preferential trade pact with the United States over claiming the U.S. used it as blackmail in regards to the asylum request of Edward Snowden, relations between Ecuador and the United States reached an all-time low. The pact offered Ecuador US$23 million, which it offered to the U.S. for human rights training. Tariff free imports had been offered to Ecuador in exchange for drug elimination efforts.\nJulian Assange applied for Ecuadorian citizenship on 16 September 2017, which Ecuador granted on 12 December 2017. However, this development was not announced until 25 January 2018.\nIn April 2019, Assange was arrested by the Metropolitan Police. President of Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, stated that he had 'violated the terms of his asylum'. British Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt stated that the British and Ecuadorian governments had been co-operating since Moreno's inauguration and aimed to resolve the situation. Assange extradition to the United States was denied, due to a combination of his ill health and the nature of the US carceral system.\nThe relations with the United States improved significantly during the presidency of Lenin Moreno since 2017. In February 2020, his visit to Washington was the first meeting between an Ecuadorian and U.S. president in 17 years. In June 2019, Ecuador had agreed to allow US military planes to operate from an airport on the Galapagos Islands.\nEducation.\nAmerican schools in Ecuador:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The object balls include seven solid-colored balls numbered 1 through 7, seven striped balls numbered 9 through 15, and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;break&lt;/dfn&gt; shot, a player is assigned either the group of solid or striped balls once they have legally pocketed a ball from that group. The object of the game is to legally pocket the 8-ball in a \"called\" pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table.\nThe game is the most frequently played discipline of pool, and is often thought of as synonymous with \"pool\". The game has numerous variations, mostly regional. It is the second most played professional pool game, after nine-ball, and for the last several decades ahead of straight pool.\nHistory.\nThe game of eight-ball arose around 1900 in the United States as a development of pyramid pool, which allows any eight of the fifteen object balls to be pocketed to win. The game arose from two changes made, namely that the 8 ball must be pocketed last to win, and that each player may pocket only half of the other object balls. By 1925, the game was popular enough for the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company to introduce purpose-made ball sets with seven &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;red&lt;/dfn&gt;, seven &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;yellow&lt;/dfn&gt;, one &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;black ball&lt;/dfn&gt;, and the cue ball, which allowed spectators to more easily see which suit each ball belonged to. (Such colors became standard in the later British-originating variant.) The rules, as officially codified in the Billiard Congress of America's rule book, were periodically revised in the years following.\nStandardized rules of play.\nAmerican-style eight-ball is played around the world by professionals and in many amateur leagues. Nevertheless, the rules for eight-ball may be the most inconsistent of any billiard game, as there are several competing sets of \"official\" rules.\nThe World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), the governing body of pool which has continental and national affiliates around the world, promulgates standardized rules as \"Pool Billiards \u2013 The Rules of Play\". These are used for amateur and professional play.\nMeanwhile, many amateur leagues \u2013 such as the American Poolplayers Association (APA) and its affiliate the Canadian Poolplayers Association (CPA), the Valley National Eight-ball Association (VNEA) and the BCA Pool League (BCAPL) \u2013 use their own rulesets which have slight differences from WPA rules and from each other. Millions of individuals play casually, using informal \"house rules\" which vary not only from area to area but even from venue to venue.\nEquipment.\nThe regulation size of a table's playing surface is , with the between-cushion area being , though exact dimensions may vary slightly by manufacturer. Some leagues and tournaments using the World Standardized Rules may allow smaller sizes, down to . Early 20th-century models are occasionally also still used. Professional competition generally employs regulation tables, while the amateur championships of various leagues, including BCAPL, VNEA, and APA, use the seven-foot tables in order to fit more of them into the hosting venue.\nThere are seven &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;solid-colored balls&lt;/dfn&gt; numbered 1 through 7, seven &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;striped balls&lt;/dfn&gt; numbered 9 through 15, an &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;8 ball&lt;/dfn&gt;, and a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;cue ball&lt;/dfn&gt;. The balls are usually colored as follows:\nSpecial sets designed to be more easily discernible on television substitute pink for the dark purple of the 4 and 12 and light tan for the darker maroon of the 7 and 15 balls, and these alternative-color sets are now also available to consumers.\nSetup.\nTo start the game, the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;object balls&lt;/dfn&gt; are placed in a triangular rack. The base of the rack is parallel to the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;end rail&lt;/dfn&gt; (the short end of the pool table) and positioned so the apex ball of the rack is located on the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;foot spot&lt;/dfn&gt;. The balls in the rack are ideally placed so that they are all in contact with one another; this is accomplished by pressing the balls together toward the apex ball. The order of the balls should be random, with the exceptions of the 8-ball, which must be placed in the center of the rack (i.e., the middle of the third row), and the two back corner balls, one of which must be a stripe and the other a solid. The cue ball is placed anywhere the breaker desires behind the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;head string&lt;/dfn&gt;.\nBreak.\nOne person is chosen by some predetermined method (e.g., coin toss, &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;lag&lt;/dfn&gt;, or win or loss of previous game or match) to shoot first, using the cue ball to &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;break&lt;/dfn&gt; the object-ball rack apart. In most leagues, it is the breaker's opponent who racks the balls, but in some, players break their own racks. If the breaker fails to make a successful break\u2014usually defined as at least four balls hitting cushions or an object ball being pocketed\u2014then the opponent can opt either to play from the current position or to call for a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;re-rack&lt;/dfn&gt; and either re-break or have the original breaker repeat the break.\nIf the 8 ball is pocketed on the break, then the breaker can choose either to &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;re-spot&lt;/dfn&gt; the 8 ball and play from the current position or to re-rack and re-break; but if the cue ball is also pocketed on the break (colloquially referred to as a \"scratch\") then the opponent is the one who has the choice: either to re-spot the 8 ball and shoot with &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;ball-in-hand&lt;/dfn&gt; behind the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;head string&lt;/dfn&gt;, accepting the current position, or to re-break or have the breaker re-break.\nTurn-taking.\nA player (or team) continues to shoot until committing a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;foul&lt;/dfn&gt; or failing to legally pocket an object ball (whether &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;intentionally&lt;/dfn&gt; or not); thereupon it is the turn of the opposing players. Play alternates in this manner for the remainder of the game. Following a foul, the incoming player has &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;ball-in-hand&lt;/dfn&gt; anywhere on the table, unless the foul occurred on the break shot, as noted previously.\nSelection of the target group.\nThe table is \"open\" at the start of the game, meaning that either player may shoot at any ball. It remains open until one player legally pockets any called ball other than the 8 after the break. That player is assigned the \"group\", or \"suit\", of the pocketed ball\u00a0\u2013 1 to 7 (solids) or 9 to 15 (stripes)\u00a0\u2013 and the other suit is assigned to the opponent. Balls pocketed on the break, or as the result of a foul while the table is still open, are not used to assign the suits. Once the suits are assigned, they remain fixed throughout the game. If any balls from a player's suit are on the table, the player must hit one of them first on every shot; otherwise a foul is called and the turn ends. After all balls from the suit have been pocketed, the player's target becomes the 8 for the remainder of the game.\nPocketing the 8 ball.\nOnce all of a player's (or team's) group of object balls are pocketed, the player attempts to sink the 8 ball. In order to win the game, the player first designates which pocket the 8 ball will be pocketed into and then successfully pockets the 8 ball into that pocket. If the player knocks the 8 ball off the table, the player loses the game. If the player pockets the 8 ball and commits a foul or pockets it into another pocket than the one designated, the player loses the game. Otherwise (i.e., if the 8 ball is neither pocketed nor knocked off the table), the shooter's turn is simply over, even if a foul occurs. In short, a world-standardized rules game of eight-ball, like a game of nine-ball, is not over until the \"&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;money ball&lt;/dfn&gt;\" is no longer on the table. The rule has been increasingly adopted by amateur leagues.\nWinning.\nA player wins the game if that player legally pockets the 8 ball into a designated pocket after all of their object balls have been pocketed. Because of this, it is possible for a game to end with only one of the players having shot, which is known as \"running the table\" or a \"denial\"; conversely, it's also possible to win a game \"without\" taking a shot; such a scenario may occur if the opposing player illegally pockets the 8 ball on any shot other than the break (such as sinking the 8 ball in an uncalled pocket, knocking the 8 ball off the table, sinking the 8 ball when a player is not yet on the black ball, or sinking both the 8 ball and the cue ball off a single shot). The rules on what happens when the 8 ball is pocketed off the break vary by the rules in question &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nFouls.\nThe general rules of pool apply to eight-ball, such as the requirements that the cue ball not be pocketed and that a cushion be hit by any of the balls after the cue ball has struck an object ball. Fouls specific to eight-ball are:\nVariants.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe British version of eight-ball, known internationally as either blackball or simply eight-ball, has evolved into a separate game, retaining significant elements of earlier pub versions of the game, with additional influences from English billiards and snooker. It is popular in amateur and professional competition in the UK, Ireland, Australia and some other countries.\nThe game uses unnumbered, solid-colored object balls, typically red and yellow, with one black 8 ball. They are usually or in diameter, the latter being the same size as the balls used in snooker and English billiards. Tables are usually long, and feature pockets with rounded cushion openings, like snooker tables. Smaller tables are sometimes used in places where a larger table would be too large.\nThe rules of blackball differ from standard eight-ball in numerous ways, including the handling of fouls, which may give the opponent two shots, racking (the 8 ball, not the apex ball, goes on the spot), selection of which group of balls will be shot by which player, handling of &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;frozen&lt;/dfn&gt; balls and &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;snooker&lt;/dfn&gt;s, and many other details.\nInternationally, the World Pool-Billiard Association and the World Eightball Pool Federation both publish rules and promote events. The two rule sets differ in some details regarding the penalties for fouls.\nChinese eight-ball (Heyball).\nThe version of eight-ball played in China uses rules that are essentially the same as standard WPA rules; and the game is played with standard solids-and-stripes balls. However, the tables are constructed similarly to snooker tables, with rounded pocket openings, napped cloth and flat-faced rail cushions. This results in some differences in gameplay approach. The variant arose in the mid-1980s and 1990s as eight-ball gained popularity in China, where snooker was the most popular cue sport at the time. With standard American-style pool tables rare, Chinese players made do with playing eight-ball on small snooker tables. It has since become the most popular cue sport in China, and the major tournaments have some of the largest prize money in pool.\nEight-ball rotation.\nThe hybrid game eight-ball rotation is a combination of eight-ball and rotation, in which the players must pocket their balls (other than the 8, which remains last) in numerical order. Specifically, the solids player starts by pocketing the 1 ball and ascends to the 7 ball, and the stripes player starts by pocketing the 15 ball and descends to the 9 ball.\nBackwards eight-ball.\nBackwards eight-ball, also called reverse eight-ball, is a variant in which, instead of shooting the cue ball at an object ball to force the object ball into a pocket, the player strikes the object ball with their cue so it &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;carom&lt;/dfn&gt;s off the cue ball and into a pocket, in a fashion similar to Russian pyramid.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has the ability to combine measurements of the project management triangle: scope, time, and costs.\nIn a single integrated system, EVM is able to provide accurate forecasts of project performance problems, which is an important aspect of project management.\nEarly EVM research showed that the areas of planning and control are significantly impacted by its use; and similarly, using the methodology improves both scope definition as well as the analysis of overall project performance. More recent research studies have shown that the principles of EVM are positive predictors of project success. The popularity of EVM has grown in recent years beyond government contracting, a sector in which its importance continues to rise (e.g. recent new DFARS rules), in part because EVM can also surface in and help substantiate contract disputes.\nEVM features.\nEssential features of any EVM implementation include:\nEVM implementations for large or complex projects include many more features, such as indicators and forecasts of cost performance (over budget or under budget) and schedule performance (behind schedule or ahead of schedule). Large projects usually need to use quantitative forecasts associated with earned value management. Although deliverables in these large projects can use adaptive development methods, the forecasting metrics found in earned value management are mostly used in projects using the predictive approach. However, the most basic requirement of an EVM system is that it quantifies progress using PV and EV.\nApplication example.\nProject A has been approved for a duration of one year and with a budget. It was also planned that the project spends 50% of the approved budget and expects 50% of the work to be complete in the first six months. If now, six months after the start of the project, a project manager reports that he has spent 50% of the budget, one may presume that the project is perfectly on plan. However, in reality the provided information is not sufficient to come to such a conclusion. The project can spend 50% of the budget, whilst finishing only 25% of the work, which would mean the project is not doing well; or the project can spend 50% of the budget, whilst completing 75% of the work, which would mean that project is doing better than planned. EVM is meant to address such and similar issues.\nHistory.\nEVM emerged as a financial analysis specialty in United States government programs in the 1960s, with the government requiring contractors to implement an EVM system (EVMS). It has since become a significant branch of project management and cost engineering. Project management research investigating the contribution of EVM to project success suggests a moderately strong positive relationship. Implementations of EVM can be scaled to fit projects of all sizes and complexities.\nThe genesis of EVM occurred in industrial manufacturing at the turn of the 20th century, based largely on the principle of \"earned time\" popularized by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth.\nIn 1979, EVM was introduced to the architecture and engineering industry in a \"Public Works Magazine\" article by David Burstein, a project manager with a national engineering firm. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, EVM emerged more widely as a project management methodology to be understood and used by managers and executives, not just EVM specialists. Many industrialized nations also began to utilize EVM in their own procurement programs.\nAn overview of EVM was included in the Project Management Institute (PMI)'s first Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide in 1987 and was expanded in subsequent editions. In the most recent edition of the PMBOK guide, EVM is listed among the general tools and techniques for processes to control project costs.\nThe construction industry was an early commercial adopter of EVM. Closer integration of EVM with the practice of project management accelerated in the 1990s. In 1999, the Performance Management Association merged with the PMI to become its first college, the College of Performance Management (CPM). The United States Office of Management and Budget began to mandate the use of EVM across all government agencies, and, for the first time, for certain internally managed projects (not just for contractors). EVM also received greater attention by publicly traded companies in response to the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn construction projects, Earned Value Management (EVM) serves as a valuable tool. For effective implementation, costs within the construction domain need to meet specific criteria:\n- Costs must be verifiable, objective, current, and granular.\n- They should be based on local market rates for labor, materials, equipment, and productivity.\n- The costs must be itemized in a detailed Scope of Work within a standardized format, like an expanded MasterFormat.\n- All involved parties should agree on these costs.\nIn Australia, EVM has been codified as the standards AS 4817-2003 and AS 4817\u20132006.\nUS defense industry.\nThe EVM concept took root in the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s. The original concept was called the Program Evaluation and Review Technique, but it was considered overly burdensome and not very adaptable by contractors whom were mandated to use it, and many variations of it began to proliferate among various procurement programs. In 1967, the DoD established a criterion-based approach, using a set of 35 criteria, called the Cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria (C/SCSC). In the 1970s and early 1980s, a subculture of C/SCSC analysis grew, but the technique was often ignored or even actively resisted by project managers in both government and industry. C/SCSC was often considered a financial control tool that could be delegated to analytical specialists.\nIn 1989, EVM leadership was elevated to the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, thus making EVM an element of program management and procurement. In 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney canceled the Navy A-12 Avenger II Program because of performance problems detected by EVM. This demonstrated that EVM mattered to secretary-level leadership. In the 1990s, many U.S. Government regulations were eliminated or streamlined. However, EVM not only survived the acquisition reform movement, but became strongly associated with the acquisition reform movement itself. Most notably, from 1995 to 1998, ownership of EVM criteria (reduced to 32) was transferred to industry by adoption of ANSI EIA 748-A standard.\nThe use of EVM has expanded beyond the U.S. Department of Defense. It was adopted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States Department of Energy and other technology-related agencies.\nProject tracking.\nIt is helpful to see an example of project tracking that does not include earned value performance management. Consider a project that has been planned in detail, including a time-phased spend plan for all elements of work. Figure 1 shows the cumulative budget (cost) for this project as a function of time (the blue line, labeled PV). It also shows the cumulative actual cost of the project (red line, labeled AC) through week 8. To those unfamiliar with EVM, it might appear that this project was over budget through week 4 and then under budget from week 6 through week 8. However, what is missing from this chart is any understanding of how much work has been accomplished during the project. If the project was actually completed at week 8, then the project would actually be well under budget and well ahead of schedule. If, on the other hand, the project is only 10% complete at week 8, the project is significantly over budget and behind schedule. A method is needed to measure technical performance objectively and quantitatively, and that is what EVM accomplishes.\nProgress measurement sheet.\nProgress can be measured using a measurement sheet and employing various techniques including milestones, weighted steps, value of work done, physical percent complete, earned value, Level of Effort, earn as planned, and more. Progress can be tracked based on any measure \u2013 cost, hours, quantities, schedule, directly input percent complete, and more.\nProgress can be assessed using fundamental earned value calculations and variance analysis (Planned Cost, Actual Cost, and Earned Value); these calculations can determine where project performance currently is using the estimated project baseline's cost and schedule information.\nWith EVM.\nConsider the same project, except this time the project plan includes pre-defined methods of quantifying the accomplishment of work. At the end of each week, the project manager identifies every detailed element of work that has been completed, and sums the EV for each of these completed elements. Earned value may be accumulated monthly, weekly, or as progress is made. The Value of Work Done (VOWD) is mainly used in Oil &amp; Gas and is similar to the Actual Cost in EVM.\nEarned value (EV).\nformula_1\nEV is calculated by multiplying %complete of each task (completed or in progress) by its planned value\nFigure 2 shows the EV curve (in green) along with the PV curve from Figure 1. The chart indicates that technical performance (i.e. progress) started more rapidly than planned, but slowed significantly and fell behind schedule at week 7 and 8. This chart illustrates the schedule performance aspect of EVM. It is complementary to critical path or critical chain schedule management.\nFigure 3 shows the same EV curve (green) with the actual cost data from Figure 1 (in red). It can be seen that the project was actually under budget, relative to the amount of work accomplished, since the start of the project. This is a much better conclusion than might be derived from Figure 1.\nFigure 4 shows all three curves together \u2013 which is a typical EVM line chart. The best way to read these three-line charts is to identify the EV curve first, then compare it to PV (for schedule performance) and AC (for cost performance). It can be seen from this illustration that a true understanding of cost performance and schedule performance \"relies first on measuring technical performance objectively.\" This is the \"foundational principle\" of EVM.\nScaling EVM from simple to advanced implementations.\nThe \"foundational principle\" of EVM, mentioned above, does not depend on the size or complexity of the project. However, the \"implementations\" of EVM can vary significantly depending on the circumstances. In many cases, organizations establish an all-or-nothing threshold; projects above the threshold require a full-featured (complex) EVM system and projects below the threshold are exempted. Another approach that is gaining favor is to scale EVM implementation according to the project at hand and skill level of the project team.\nSimple implementations (emphasizing only technical performance).\nThere are many more small and simple projects than there are large and complex ones, yet historically only the largest and most complex have enjoyed the benefits of EVM. Still, lightweight implementations of EVM are achievable by any person who has basic spreadsheet skills. In fact, spreadsheet implementations are an excellent way to learn basic EVM skills.\nThe \"first step\" is to define the work. This is typically done in a hierarchical arrangement called a work breakdown structure (WBS), although the simplest projects may use a simple list of tasks. In either case, it is important that the WBS or list be comprehensive. It is also important that the elements be mutually exclusive, so that work is easily categorized into one and only one element of work. The most detailed elements of a WBS hierarchy (or the items in a list) are called work packages. Work packages are then often devolved further in the project schedule into tasks or activities.\nThe \"second step\" is to assign a value, called planned value (PV), to each work package. For large projects, PV is almost always an allocation of the total project budget, and may be in units of currency (e.g. dollar, euro or naira) or in labor hours, or both. However, in very simple projects, each activity may be assigned a weighted \"point value\" which might not be a budget number. Assigning weighted values and achieving consensus on all PV quantities yields an important benefit of EVM, because it exposes misunderstandings and miscommunications about the scope of the project, and resolving these differences should always occur as early as possible. Some terminal elements can not be known (planned) in great detail in advance, and that is expected, because they can be further refined at a later time.\nThe \"third step\" is to define \"earning rules\" for each work package. The simplest method is to apply just one earning rule, such as the 0/100 rule, to all activities. Using the 0/100 rule, no credit is earned for an element of work until it is finished. A related rule is called the 50/50 rule, which means 50% credit is earned when an element of work is started, and the remaining 50% is earned upon completion. Other fixed earning rules such as a 25/75 rule or 20/80 rule are gaining favor, because they assign more weight to finishing work than for starting it, but they also motivate the project team to identify when an element of work is started, which can improve awareness of work-in-progress. These simple earning rules work well for small or simple projects because generally, each activity tends to be fairly short in duration.\nThese initial three steps define the minimal amount of planning for simplified EVM. The \"final step\" is to execute the project according to the plan and measure progress. When activities are started or finished, EV is accumulated according to the earning rule. This is typically done at regular intervals (e.g. weekly or monthly), but there is no reason why EV cannot be accumulated in near real-time, when work elements are started/completed. In fact, waiting to update EV only once per month (simply because that is when cost data are available) only detracts from a primary benefit of using EVM, which is to create a technical performance scoreboard for the project team.\nIn a lightweight implementation such as described here, the project manager has not accumulated cost nor defined a detailed project schedule network (i.e. using a critical path or critical chain methodology). While such omissions are inappropriate for managing large projects, they are a common and reasonable occurrence in many very small or simple projects. Any project can benefit from using EV alone as a real-time score of progress. One useful result of this very simple approach (without schedule models and actual cost accumulation) is to compare EV curves of similar projects, as illustrated in Figure 5. In this example, the progress of three residential construction projects are compared by aligning the starting dates. If these three home construction projects were measured with the same PV valuations, the \"relative\" schedule performance of the projects can be easily compared.\nMaking earned value schedule metrics concordant with the CPM schedule.\nThe actual critical path is ultimately the determining factor of every project's duration. Because earned value schedule metrics take no account of critical path data, big budget activities that are not on the critical path have the potential to dwarf the impact of performing small budget critical path activities. This can lead to gaming the SV and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) metrics by ignoring critical path activities in favor of big-budget activities that may have more float. This can sometimes even lead to performing activities out-of-sequence just to improve the schedule tracking metrics, which can cause major problems with quality.\nA simple two-step process has been suggested to fix this:\nIn this way, the distorting aspect of float would be eliminated. There would be no benefit to performing a non-critical activity with many floats until it is due in proper sequence. Also, an activity would not generate a negative schedule variance until it had used up its float. Under this method, one way of gaming the schedule metrics would be eliminated. The only way of generating a positive schedule variance (or SPI over 1.0) would be by completing work on the current critical path ahead of schedule, which is in fact the only way for a project to get ahead of schedule.\nAdvanced implementations.\nIn addition to managing technical and schedule performance, large and complex projects require cost performance to be monitored and reviewed at regular intervals. To measure cost performance, planned value (BCWS) and earned value (BCWP) must be in the same currency units as actual costs.\nIn large implementations, the planned value curve is commonly called a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) and may be arranged in control accounts, summary-level planning packages, planning packages and work packages.\nIn large projects, establishing control accounts is the primary method of delegating responsibility and authority to various parts of the performing organization. Control accounts are cells of a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix, which is the intersection of the project WBS and the organizational breakdown structure (OBS). Control accounts are assigned to Control Account Managers (CAMs).\nLarge projects require more elaborate processes for controlling baseline revisions, more thorough integration with subcontractor EVM systems, and more elaborate management of procured materials.\nIn the United States, the primary standard for full-featured EVM systems is the ANSI/EIA-748A standard, published in May 1998 and reaffirmed in August 2002. The standard defines 32 criteria for full-featured EVM system compliance. As of the year 2007, a draft of ANSI/EIA-748B, a revision to the original is available from ANSI. Other countries have established similar standards.\nIn addition to using BCWS and BCWP, implementations often use the term actual cost of work performed (ACWP) instead of AC. Additional acronyms and formulas include:\nBudget at completion (BAC).\nAccording to the PMBOK (7th edition) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), Budget at Completion (BAC) is the \"sum of all budgets established for the work to be performed.\"\nIt is the total planned value (PV or BCWS) at the end of the project. If a project has a management reserve (MR), it is typically \"not\" included in the BAC, and respectively, in the performance measurement baseline.\nCost variance (CV).\nAccording to the PMBOK (7th edition) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), Cost variance (CV) is a \"The amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed as the difference between the earned value and the actual cost.\" Cost variance compares the estimated cost of a deliverable with the actual cost.\nformula_2\nCV greater than 0 is good (under budget).\nCost performance index (CPI).\nAccording to the PMBOK (7th edition) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), Cost performance index is a \"measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources expressed at the ratio of earned value to actual cost.\"\nformula_3\nCPI greater than 1 is favorable (under budget).\nCPI that is less than 1 means that the cost of completing the work is higher than planned (bad).\nWhen CPI is equal to 1, it means that the cost of completing the work is right on plan (good).\nCPI greater than 1 means that the cost of completing the work is less than planned (good or sometimes bad).\nHaving a CPI that is very high (in some cases, very high is only 1.2) may mean that the plan was too conservative, and thus a very high number may in fact not be good, as the CPI is being measured against a poor baseline. Management or the customer may be upset with the planners as an overly conservative baseline ties up available funds for other purposes, and the baseline is also used for manpower planning.\nEstimate at completion (EAC).\nAccording to the PMBOK (7th edition) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), Estimate at completion (EAC) is the \"expected total cost of completing all work expressed as the sum of the actual cost to date and the estimate to complete.\"\nEAC is the manager's projection of total cost of the project at completion.\nformula_4\nThis formula is based on the assumption, that the performance of the project (or rather a deviation of the actual performance from a baseline) to date gives a good indication of what a performance (or rather deviation of a performance from a baseline) will be in the future. In other words, this formula is using statistics of the project to date to predict future results. Therefore, it has to be used carefully, when the nature of the project in the future is likely to be different from the one to date (e.g. performance of the project compare to baseline at the design phase may not be a good indication of what it will be during a construction phase).\nEstimate to complete (ETC).\nAccording to the PMBOK (7th edition) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), Estimate to complete (ETC) is the \"expected cost to finish all the remaining project work.\"\nETC is the estimate to complete the remaining work of the project. ETC must be based on objective measures of the outstanding work remaining, typically based on the measures or estimates used to create the original planned value (PV) profile, including any adjustments to predict performance based on historical performance, actions being taken to improve performance, or acknowledgement of degraded performance.\nWhile algebraically, ETC = EAC-AC is correct, ETC should \"never\" be computed using either EAC or AC.\nIn the following equation:\nformula_5\nETC is the independent variable, EAC is the dependent variable, and AC is fixed based on expenditures to date. ETC should always be reported truthfully to reflect the project team estimate to complete the outstanding work. If ETC pushes EAC to exceed BAC, then project management skills are employed to either recommend performance improvements or scope change, but never force ETC to give the \"correct\" answer so that EAC=BAC. Managing project activities to keep the project within budget is a human factors activity, not a mathematical function.\nTo-complete performance index (TCPI).\nTo-complete performance index (TCPI) is an earned value management measure that estimates the cost performance needed to achieve a particular management objective.\nThe TCPI provides a projection of the anticipated performance required to achieve either the BAC or the EAC. TCPI indicates the future required cost efficiency needed to achieve a target BAC (Budget At Complete) or EAC (Estimate At Complete). Any significant difference between CPI, the cost performance to date, and the TCPI, the cost performance needed to meet the BAC or the EAC, should be accounted for by management in their forecast of the final cost.\nFor the TCPI based on BAC (describing the performance required to meet the original BAC budgeted total):\nformula_6\nor for the TCPI based on EAC (describing the performance required to meet a new, revised budget total EAC):\nformula_7\nThis implies, that if revised budget (EAC) is calculated using Earned Value methodology formula (BAC/CPI), then at the moment, when TCPI based on EAC is first time calculated, it will always be equal to CPI of a project at that moment. This happens because when EAC is calculated using formula BAC/CPI it is assumed, that cost performance of the remaining part of the project will be the same as the cost performance of the project to date.\nThe graph illustrates three scenarios outlined in PMI's \"Process Group: A Practice Guide\" (2022 edition, p.\u00a0311):\nIndependent estimate at completion (IEAC).\nThe IEAC is a metric to project total cost using the performance to date to project overall performance. This can be compared to the EAC, which is the manager's projection.\nformula_8\nLimitations.\nProponents of EVM note a number of issues with implementing it, and further limitations may be inherent to the concept itself.\nBecause EVM requires quantification of a project plan, it is often perceived to be inapplicable to discovery-driven or Agile software development projects. For example, it may be impossible to plan certain research projects far in advance, because research itself uncovers some opportunities (research paths) and actively eliminates others. However, another school of thought holds that all work can be planned, even if in weekly timeboxes or other short increments.\nTraditional EVM is not intended for non-discrete (continuous) effort. In traditional EVM standards, non-discrete effort is called \"level of effort\" (LOE). If a project plan contains a significant portion of LOE, and the LOE is intermixed with discrete effort, EVM results will be contaminated. This is another area of EVM research.\nTraditional definitions of EVM typically assume that project accounting and project network schedule management are prerequisites to achieving any benefit from EVM. Many small projects don't satisfy either of these prerequisites, but they too can benefit from EVM, as described for simple implementations, above. Other projects can be planned with a project network, but do not have access to true and timely actual cost data. In practice, the collection of true and timely actual cost data can be the most difficult aspect of EVM. Such projects can benefit from EVM, as described for intermediate implementations, above, and earned schedule.\nAs a means of overcoming objections to EVM's lack of connection to qualitative performance issues, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PEO(A) organization initiated a project in the late 1990s to integrate true technical achievement into EVM projections by utilizing risk profiles. These risk profiles anticipate opportunities that may be revealed and possibly be exploited as development and testing proceeds. The published research resulted in a Technical Performance Management (TPM) methodology and software application that is still used by many DoD agencies in informing EVM estimates with technical achievement.\nThe research was peer-reviewed and was the recipient of the Defense Acquisition University Acquisition Research Symposium 1997 Acker Award for excellence in the exchange of information in the field of acquisition research.\nThere is the difficulty inherent for any periodic monitoring of synchronizing data timing: actual deliveries, actual invoicing, and the date the EVM analysis is done are all independent, so that some items have arrived but their invoicing has not and by the time analysis is delivered the data will likely be weeks behind events. This may limit EVM to a less tactical or less definitive role where use is combined with other forms to explain why or add recent news and manage future expectations.\nThere is a measurement limitation for how precisely EVM can be used, stemming from classic conflict between accuracy and precision, as the mathematics can calculate deceptively far beyond the precision of the measurements of data and the approximation that is the plan estimation. The limitation on estimation is commonly understood (such as the ninety\u2013ninety rule in software) but is not visible in any margin of error. The limitations on measurement are largely a form of digitization error as EVM measurements ultimately can be no finer than by item, which may be the work breakdown structure terminal element size, to the scale of reporting period, typically end summary of a month, and by the means of delivery measure. (The delivery measure may be actual deliveries, may include estimates of partial work done at the end of month subject to estimation limits, and typically does not include QC check or risk offsets.)\nAs traditionally implemented, EVM deals with, and is based in, budget and cost. It has no relationship to the investment value or benefit for which the project has been funded and undertaken. Yet due to the use of the word \"value\" in the name, this fact is often misunderstood. However, earned value metrics can be used to compute the cost and schedule inputs to Devaux's Index of Project Performance (the DIPP), which integrates schedule and cost performance with the planned investment value of the project's scope across the project management triangle.\nDarling &amp; Whitty (2019) conducted an ethnographic study to see how EVM is implemented, applying Goffman's Dramaturgy (sociology), they found there is a sham act occurring through impressionable acts presenting statistical data as fact even when the data may be worthless. Findings include sham progress reporting can emerge in an environment where senior management's ignorance of project work creates unworkable binds for project staff. Moreover, the sham behaviour succeeds at its objective because senior management are vulnerable to false impressions. This situation raises ethical issues for those involved, and creates an overhead in dealing with the reality of project work. Further the Darling &amp; Whitty study is pertinent as it provides sociological insight to how a scientific management technique has been implemented.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It uses electron optics that are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope to control the electron beam, for instance focusing it to produce magnified images or electron diffraction patterns. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times smaller than that of visible light, electron microscopes have a much higher resolution of about 0.1\u00a0nm, which compares to about 200\u00a0nm for light microscopes. \"Electron microscope\" may refer to:\nAdditional details can be found in the above links. This article contains some general information mainly about transmission and scanning electron microscopes.\nHistory.\nMany developments laid the groundwork of the electron optics used in microscopes. One significant step was the work of Hertz in 1883 who made a cathode-ray tube with electrostatic and magnetic deflection, demonstrating manipulation of the direction of an electron beam. Others were focusing of the electrons by an axial magnetic field by Emil Wiechert in 1899, improved oxide-coated cathodes which produced more electrons by Arthur Wehnelt in 1905 and the development of the electromagnetic lens in 1926 by Hans Busch. According to Dennis Gabor, the physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd tried in 1928 to convince him to build an electron microscope, for which Szil\u00e1rd had filed a patent. To this day the issue of who invented the transmission electron microscope is controversial. In 1928, at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin), Adolf Matthias (Professor of High Voltage Technology and Electrical Installations) appointed Max Knoll to lead a team of researchers to advance research on electron beams and cathode-ray oscilloscopes. The team consisted of several PhD students including Ernst Ruska. In 1931, Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over an anode aperture. The device, a replicate of which is shown in the figure, used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, the first electron microscope. (Max Knoll died in 1969, so did not receive a share of the 1986 Nobel prize for the invention of electron microscopes.)\nApparently independent of this effort was work at Siemens-Schuckert by Reinhold R\u00fcdenberg. According to patent law (U.S. Patent No. 2058914 and 2070318, both filed in 1932), he is the inventor of the electron microscope, but it is not clear when he had a working instrument. He stated in a very brief article in 1932 that Siemens had been working on this for some years before the patents were filed in 1932, claiming that his effort was parallel to the university development. He died in 1961, so similar to Max Knoll, was not eligible for a share of the 1986 Nobel prize.\nIn the following year, 1933, Ruska and Knoll built the first electron microscope that exceeded the resolution of an optical (light) microscope. Four years later, in 1937, Siemens financed the work of Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries, and employed Helmut Ruska, Ernst's brother, to develop applications for the microscope, especially with biological specimens. Also in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne pioneered the scanning electron microscope. Siemens produced the first commercial electron microscope in 1938. The first North American electron microscopes were constructed in the 1930s, at the Washington State University by Anderson and Fitzsimmons and at the University of Toronto by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier, and Albert Prebus. Siemens produced a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1939. Although current transmission electron microscopes are capable of two million times magnification, as scientific instruments they remain similar but with improved optics.\nIn the 1940s, high-resolution electron microscopes were developed, enabling greater magnification and resolution. By 1965, Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago introduced the scanning transmission electron microscope using a field emission source, enabling scanning microscopes at high resolution. By the early 1980s improvements in mechanical stability as well as the use of higher accelerating voltages enabled imaging of materials at the atomic scale. In the 1980s, the field emission gun became common for electron microscopes, improving the image quality due to the additional coherence and lower chromatic aberrations. The 2000s were marked by advancements in aberration-corrected electron microscopy, allowing for significant improvements in resolution and clarity of images.\nTypes of electron microscopes.\nTransmission electron microscope (TEM).\nThe original form of the electron microscope, the transmission electron microscope (TEM), uses a high voltage electron beam to illuminate the specimen and create an image. An electron beam is produced by an electron gun, with the electrons typically having energies in the range 20 to 400 keV, focused by electromagnetic lenses, and transmitted through a thin specimen. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is then magnified by the lenses of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the \"image\") may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a detector. For example, the image may be viewed directly by an operator using a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a phosphor or scintillator material such as zinc sulfide. More commonly a high-resolution phosphor is coupled by means of a lens optical system or a fibre optic light-guide to the sensor of a digital camera. A different approach is to use a direct electron detector which has no scintillator, which addresses some of the limitations of scintillator-coupled cameras.\nFor many years the resolution of TEMs was limited by aberrations of the electron optics, primarily the spherical aberration. In most recent instruments hardware correctors can reduce spherical aberration and other aberrations, improving the resolution in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to below 0.5 angstrom (50 picometres), enabling magnifications of more than 50 million times. The ability of HRTEM to determine the positions of atoms within materials is useful for many areas of research and development.\nScanning electron microscope (SEM).\nAn SEM produces images by probing the specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across the specimen (raster scanning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy and is scattered in different directions by a variety of mechanisms. These interactions lead to, among other events, emission of low-energy secondary electrons and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission (cathodoluminescence) or X-ray emission. All of these signals carrying information about the specimen, such as the surface topography and composition. The image displayed when using an SEM shows the variation in the intensity of any of these signals as an image. In these each position in the image corresponding to a position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated.\nSEMs are different from TEMs in that they use electrons with much lower energy, generally below 20 keV, while TEMs generally use electrons with energies in the range of 80-300 keV. Thus, the electron sources and optics of the two microscopes have different designs, and they are normally separate instruments.\nScanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).\nA STEM combines features of both a TEM and a SEM by rastering a focused incident probe across a specimen, but now mainly using the electrons which are transmitted through the sample. Many types of imaging are common to both TEM and STEM, but some such as annular dark-field imaging and other analytical techniques are much easier to perform with higher spatial resolutions in a STEM instrument. One drawback is that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion.\nMain operating modes.\nThe most common methods of obtaining images in an electron microscope involve selecting different directions for the electrons that have been transmitted through a sample, and/or electrons of different energies. There are a very large number of methods of doing this, although not all are very common.\nSecondary electrons.\nIn a SEM the signals result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms within the sample. The most common mode is to use the secondary electrons (SE) to produce images. Secondary electrons have very low energies, on the order of 50 eV, which limits their mean free path in solid matter to a few nanometers below the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart\u2013Thornley detector, which is a type of collector-scintillator-photomultiplier system. The signal from secondary electrons tends to be highly localized at the point of impact of the primary electron beam, making it possible to collect images of the sample surface with a resolution of better than 1 nm, and with specialized instruments at the atomic scale.\nThe brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the electrons come out symmetrically about the axis of the beam. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume from which they cone increases and the \"escape\" distance from one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance that is similar to a reflected light image.\nBackscattered electrons.\nBackscattered electrons (BSE) are those emitted back out from the specimen due to beam-specimen interactions where the electrons undergo elastic and inelastic scattering. They are conventionally defined as having energies from 50 eV up to the energy of the primary beam. Backscattered electrons can be used for both imaging and to form an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) image, the latter can be used to determine the crystallography of the specimen.\nHeavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSE images can therefore be used to detect areas with different chemical compositions. To optimize the signal, dedicated backscattered electron detectors are positioned above the sample in a \"doughnut\" type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either scintillator or semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as if there was illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.\nDiffraction contrast imaging.\nDiffraction contrast uses the variation in either or both the direction of diffracted electrons or their amplitude as a function of position as the contrast mechanism. It is one of the simplest ways to image in a transmission electron microscope, and widely used.\nThe idea is to use an objective aperture below the sample and select only one or a range of different diffracted directions, then use these to form an image. When the aperture includes the incident beam direction the images are called \"bright field\", since in the absence of any sample the field of view would be uniformly bright. When the aperture excludes the incident beam the images are called \"dark field\", since similarly without a sample the image would be uniformly dark. One variant of this is called weak-beam dark-field microscopy, and can be used to obtain high resolution images of defects such as dislocations.\nHigh resolution imaging.\nIn high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (also sometimes called high-resolution electron microscopy) a number of different diffracted beams are allowed through the objective aperture. These interfere, leading to images which represent the atomic structure of the material. These can include the incident beam direction, or with scanning transmission electron microscopes they typically are for a range of diffracted beams excluding the incident beam. Depending upon how thick the samples are and the aberrations of the microscope, these images can either be directly interpreted in terms of the positions of columns of atoms, or require a more careful analysis using calculations of the multiple scattering of the electrons and the effect of the contrast transfer function of the microscope.\nThere are many other imaging variants that can also to lead to atomic level information. Electron holography uses the interference of electrons which have been through the sample and a reference beam. 4D STEM collects diffraction data at each point using a scanning instrument, then processes them to produce different types of images.\nX-ray microanalysis.\nX-ray microanalysis is a method of obtaining local chemical information within electron microscopes of all types, although it is most commonly used in scanning instruments. When high energy electrons interact with atoms they can knock out electrons, particularly those in the inner shells and core electrons. These are then filled by valence electron, and the energy difference between the valence and core states can be converted into an x-ray which is detected by a spectrometer. The energies of these x-rays is somewhat specific to the atomic species, so local chemistry can be probed.\nEELS.\nSimilar to X-ray microanalysis, the energies of electrons which have transmitted through a sample can be analyzed and yield information ranging from details of the local electronic structure to chemical information.\nElectron diffraction.\nTransmission electron microscopes can be used in electron diffraction mode where a map of the angles of the electrons leaving the sample is produced. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are primarily in the size of the crystals. In X-ray crystallography, crystals are commonly visible by the naked eye and are generally in the hundreds of micrometers in length. In comparison, crystals for electron diffraction must be less than a few hundred nanometers in thickness, and have no lower boundary of size. Additionally, electron diffraction is done on a TEM, which can also be used to obtain other types of information, rather than requiring a separate instrument.\nThere are many variants on electron diffraction, depending upon exactly what type of illumination conditions are used. If a parallel beam is used with an aperture to limit the region exposed to the electrons then sharp diffraction features are normally observed, a technique called selected area electron diffraction. This is often the main technique used. Another common approach uses conical illumination and is called convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED). This is good for determining the symmetry of materials. A third is precession electron diffraction, where a parallel beam is spun around a large angle, producing a type of average diffraction pattern. These often have less multiple scattering.\nAberration corrected instruments.\nAberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) is the general term for electron microscopes where electro optical components are introduced to reduce the aberrations that would otherwise limit the resolution of the images. Historically electron microscopes had quite severe aberrations, and until about the start of the 21st century the resolution was limited, able to image the atomic structure of materials if the atoms were far enough apart. Around the turn of the century the electron optical components were coupled with computer control of the lenses and their alignment, enabling correction of aberrations. The first demonstration of aberration correction in TEM mode was by Harald Rose and Maximilian Haider in 1998 using a hexapole corrector, and in STEM mode by Ondrej Krivanek and Niklas Dellby in 1999 using a quadrupole/octupole corrector.\nAs of 2025 correction of geometric aberrations is standard in many commercial electron microscopes, and they are extensively used in many different areas of science. Similar correctors have also been used at much lower energies for LEEM instruments.\nSample preparation.\nSamples for electron microscopes mostly cannot be observed directly. The samples need to be prepared to stabilize the sample and enhance contrast. Preparation techniques differ vastly in respect to the sample and its specific qualities to be observed as well as the specific microscope used. Details can be found in the relevant main articles listed above.\nDisadvantages.\nElectron microscopes are expensive to build and maintain. Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field canceling systems and anti vibration mounts.\nThe samples largely have to be viewed in vacuum, as the molecules that make up air would scatter the electrons. An exception is liquid-phase electron microscopy using either a closed liquid cell or an environmental chamber, for example, in the environmental scanning electron microscope, which allows hydrated samples to be viewed in a low-pressure (up to ) wet environment. Various techniques for in situ electron microscopy of gaseous samples have also been developed.\nSamples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens, have to be prepared in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in artifacts, but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of cryofixed, vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used.\nMany samples suffer from radiation damage which can change internal structures. This can be due to either or both radiolytic processes or ballistic, for instance with collision cascades. This can be a severe issue for biological samples,\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Currently there are approximately 11,000 living species of birds, with over 1,480 at risk of extinction and 223 critically endangered.\nIsland species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived, and Guam, which lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the decades following the introduction of the brown tree snake (\"Boiga irregularis\"). The disproportionate number of extinctions in rails reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists.\nThe extinction dates given below are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken), which are approximations of the actual date of extinction. For many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European colonization, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over 100 years, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists. In certain unusual cases, it is possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day; the San Benedicto rock wren represents an extreme example where its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour coinciding with the eruption of B\u00e1rcena.\nThe year 1500 serves as one common threshold of the \"modern\" era in which species are described scientifically, extinctions are monitored, and globalization has led to increased pressure on species. Bird taxa which became extinct before 1500 are listed in List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species; prominent examples include the elephant birds (\"Aepyornis\" and \"Mullerornis\") and the moa (\"Anomalopteryx\", \"Euryapteryx\", \"Pachyornis\", \"Emeus\", \"Dinornis\" and \"Megalapteryx\").\nExtinct bird species.\nPalaeognathae.\nRatites and tinamous\nApterygiformes.\nThe kiwis of New Zealand\nAnseriformes.\nDucks, geese and swans\nGalliformes.\nQuails and relatives\nSee also Bokaak \"bustard\" under Gruiformes below\nPodicipediformes.\nGrebes\nCharadriiformes.\nWaders, gulls and auks\nGruiformes.\nRails and allies - probably paraphyletic\nProcellariiformes.\nPetrels, storm petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses\nSphenisciformes.\nPenguins\nSuliformes.\nBoobies and related birds\nPelecaniformes.\nPelicans and related birds\nColumbiformes.\nPigeons, doves and dodos\nFor the \"R\u00e9union solitaire\", see R\u00e9union ibis above.\nCuculiformes.\nCuckoos\nCathartiformes.\nNew World vultures\nStrigiformes.\nTrue owls and barn owls\nStrigidae\u00a0\u2013 true owls\nTytonidae\u00a0\u2013 barn owls\nCaprimulgiformes.\nCaprimulgidae\u00a0\u2013 nightjars and nighthawks\nAegotheliformes.\nAegothelidae\nApodiformes.\nSwifts and hummingbirds\nCoraciiformes.\nKingfishers and related birds\nPiciformes.\nWoodpeckers and related birds\nFalconiformes.\nFalcons\nPsittaciformes.\nParrots\nPasseriformes.\nPerching birds\nAcanthisittidae\u00a0\u2013 New Zealand wrens\nTyrannidae\u00a0\u2013 tyrant flycatchers\nFurnariidae\u00a0\u2013 ovenbirds\nMohoidae\u00a0\u2013 Hawaiian honeyeaters; family established in 2008, previously in Meliphagidae\nMeliphagidae\u00a0\u2013 honeyeaters and Australian chats\nAcanthizidae\u00a0\u2013 Australasian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, and gerygones\nPachycephalidae\u00a0\u2013 whistlers, shrike-thrushes, pitohuis and allies\nMonarchidae\u00a0\u2013 monarch flycatchers and paradise flycatchers\nOriolidae\u00a0\u2013 Old World orioles and allies\nCorvidae\u00a0\u2013 crows, ravens, jays and magpies\nCallaeidae\u00a0\u2013 New Zealand wattlebirds\nHirundinidae\u00a0\u2013 swallows and martins\nAcrocephalidae\u00a0\u2013 acrocephalid warblers or reed warblers, brush warblers, swamp warblers, marsh-warblers, and tree-warblers\nMuscicapidae\u00a0\u2013 Old World flycatchers and chats\nLocustellidae\u00a0\u2013 megalurid warblers or grass warblers\nCisticolidae\u00a0\u2013 cisticolas and allies\nZosteropidae\u00a0\u2013 white-eyes; probably belong in Timaliidae\nPycnonotidae\u00a0\u2013 bulbuls\nSylviida \"incertae sedis\"\nSturnidae\u00a0\u2013 starlings\nTurdidae\u00a0\u2013 thrushes and allies\nMimidae\u00a0\u2013 mockingbirds and thrashers\nIcteridae\u00a0\u2013 New World blackbirds and allies\nParulidae\u00a0\u2013 New World warblers\nPloceidae\u00a0\u2013 weavers\nCardinalidae\u00a0\u2013 cardinals and allies\nFringillidae\u00a0\u2013 true finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers\nThraupidae\u00a0\u2013 tanagers\nPasserellidae\u00a0\u2013 New World sparrows\nExtinct/possibly extinct/status unknown bird subspecies.\nThe extinction of subspecies is a subject that is very dependent on guesswork.

{"id": "9732", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9732", "title": "Eli Whitney", "text": "American inventor (1765\u20131825)\nEli Whitney Jr. (December 8, 1765\u00a0\u2013 January 8, 1825) was an American inventor, widely known for inventing the cotton gin in 1793, one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution that shaped the economy of the Antebellum South. Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States and prolonged the institution. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost much of his profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention to securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. He continued making arms and inventing until his death in 1825.\nEarly life and education.\nWhitney was born in Westborough, Massachusetts, on December 8, 1765, the eldest child of Eli Whitney Sr., a prosperous farmer, and his wife Elizabeth Fay, also of Westborough.\nThe younger Eli was famous during his lifetime and after his death by the name \"Eli Whitney\", though he was technically Eli Whitney Jr. His son, born in 1820, also named Eli, was known during his lifetime and afterward by the name \"Eli Whitney Jr.\"\nWhitney's mother, Elizabeth Fay, died in 1777, when he was 11. At age 14 he operated a profitable nail manufacturing operation in his father's workshop during the Revolutionary War.\nBecause his stepmother opposed his wish to attend college, Whitney worked as a farm laborer and school teacher to save money. He prepared for Yale at Leicester Academy (later Becker College) and under the tutelage of Rev. Elizur Goodrich of Durham, Connecticut, he entered Yale in the fall of 1789 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1792. Whitney expected to study law but, finding himself short of funds, accepted an offer to go to South Carolina as a private tutor.\nInstead of reaching his destination, he was convinced to visit Georgia. In the closing years of the 18th century, Georgia was a magnet for New Englanders seeking their fortunes (its Revolutionary-era governor had been Lyman Hall, a migrant from Connecticut). When he initially sailed for South Carolina, among his shipmates were the widow (Catherine Littlefield Greene) and family of the Revolutionary hero Gen. Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island. Mrs. Greene invited Whitney to visit her Georgia plantation, Mulberry Grove. Her plantation manager and husband-to-be was Phineas Miller, another Connecticut migrant and Yale graduate (class of 1785), who would become Whitney's business partner.\nCareer.\nWhitney is most famous for two innovations which came to have significant impacts on the United States in the mid-19th century: the cotton gin (1793) and his advocacy of interchangeable parts. In the South, the cotton gin revolutionized the way cotton was harvested and reinvigorated slavery. Conversely, in the North the adoption of interchangeable parts revolutionized the manufacturing industry, contributing greatly to the U.S. victory in the Civil War.\nCotton gin.\nThe cotton gin is a mechanical device that removes the seeds from cotton, a process that had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word \"gin\" is short for \"engine.\" While staying at Mulberry Grove, Whitney constructed several ingenious household devices which led Mrs Greene to introduce him to some businessmen who were discussing the desirability of a machine to\nseparate the short staple upland cotton from its seeds, work that was then done by hand at the rate of a pound of lint a day. In a few weeks Whitney produced a model. The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and able to only pull through some of the feathers.\nA single cotton gin could generate up to of cleaned cotton daily. This contributed to the economic development of the Southern United States, a prime cotton growing area; some historians believe that this invention allowed for slavery in the United States, in particular in the South, to become more sustainable at a critical point in its development.\nWhitney applied for the patent for his cotton gin on October 28, 1793, and received the patent (later numbered as X72) on March 14, 1794, but it was not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. Rather, like the proprietors of gristmills and sawmills, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton \u2013 two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of patent law, made infringement inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale. Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits (one patent, later annulled, was granted in 1796 to Hogden Holmes for a gin which substituted circular saws for the spikes) and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797. One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney's first design. There are claims that the use of wires rather than pegs was proposed by Mrs. Greene, but these are disputed.\nAfter validation of the patent, the legislature of South Carolina voted $50,000 for the rights for that state, while North Carolina levied a license tax for five years, from which about $30,000 was realized. There is a claim that Tennessee paid about $10,000.\nWhile the cotton gin did not earn Whitney the fortune he had hoped for, it did give him fame. It has been argued by some historians that Whitney's cotton gin was an important if unintended cause of the American Civil War. After Whitney's invention, the Southern plantation economy was rejuvenated, eventually culminating in the Civil War.\nThe cotton gin transformed Southern agriculture and the national economy. Southern cotton found ready markets in Europe and in the burgeoning textile mills of New England. Cotton exports from the U.S. boomed after the cotton gin's appearance \u2013 from less than in 1793 to by 1810. Cotton was a staple that could be stored for long periods and shipped long distances, unlike most agricultural products. It became the U.S.'s chief export, representing over half the value of U.S. exports from 1820 to 1860.\nBefore the 1790s, slave labor was primarily employed in growing rice, tobacco, and indigo, none of which were especially profitable anymore. Neither was cotton, due to the difficulty of seed removal. But with the invention of the gin, growing cotton with slave labor became highly profitable \u2013 the chief source of wealth in the American South, and the basis of frontier settlement from Georgia to Texas. \"King Cotton\" became a dominant economic force, and slavery was sustained as a key institution of Southern society.\nInterchangeable parts.\nEli Whitney has often been incorrectly credited with inventing the idea of interchangeable parts, which he championed for years as a maker of muskets; however, the idea predated Whitney, and Whitney's role in it was one of promotion and popularizing, not invention. Successful implementation of the idea eluded Whitney until near the end of his life, occurring first in others' armories.\nAttempts at interchangeability of parts can be traced back as far as the Punic Wars through both archaeological remains of boats now in Museo Archeologico Baglio Anselmi and contemporary written accounts. In modern times the idea developed over decades among many people. An early leader was Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval, an 18th-century French artillerist who created a fair amount of standardization of artillery pieces, although not true interchangeability of parts. He inspired others, including Honor\u00e9 Blanc and Louis de Tousard, to work further on the idea, and on shoulder weapons as well as artillery. In the 19th century these efforts produced the \"armory system,\" or American system of manufacturing. Certain other New Englanders, including Captain John H. Hall and Simeon North, arrived at successful interchangeability before Whitney's armory did. The Whitney armory finally succeeded not long after his death in 1825.\nThe motives behind Whitney's acceptance of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney was on the verge of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in debt. His New Haven cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The French Revolutionary Wars had led the American government to embark on a process of remilitarization, and the War Department issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver between 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time. Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott Jr., sent him a \"foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques,\" possibly one of Honor\u00e9 Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.\nIn May 1798, Congress voted for legislation that would use 800,000 dollars in order to pay for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted. It offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for the person that was able to accurately produce arms for the government. Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed it promised, he accepted the offer. Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until 1809, using multiple excuses for the delay. Recently, historians have found that during 1801\u20131806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin.\nAlthough Whitney's demonstration of 1801 appeared to show the feasibility of creating interchangeable parts, Merritt Roe Smith concludes that it was \"staged\" and \"duped government authorities\" into believing that he had been successful. The charade gained him time and resources toward achieving that goal.\nWhen the government complained that Whitney's price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, he was able to calculate an actual price per musket by including fixed costs such as insurance and machinery, which the government had not accounted for. He thus made early contributions to both the concepts of cost accounting, and economic efficiency in manufacturing.\nMilling machine.\nMachine tool historian Joseph W. Roe credited Whitney with inventing the first milling machine circa 1818. Subsequent work by other historians (Woodbury; Smith; Muir; Battison [cited by Baida]) suggests that Whitney was among a group of contemporaries all developing milling machines at about the same time (1814 to 1818), and that the others were more important to the innovation than Whitney was. (The machine that excited Roe may not have been built until 1825, after Whitney's death.) Therefore, no one person can properly be described as the inventor of the milling machine.\nLater life and legacy.\nDespite his humble origins, Whitney was keenly aware of the value of social and political connections. In building his arms business, he took full advantage of the access that his status as a Yale alumnus gave him to other well-placed graduates, such as Oliver Wolcott Jr., Secretary of the Treasury (class of 1778), and James Hillhouse, a New Haven developer and political leader.\nHis 1817 marriage to Henrietta Edwards, granddaughter of the famed evangelist Jonathan Edwards, daughter of Pierpont Edwards, head of the Democratic Party in Connecticut, and first cousin of Yale's president, Timothy Dwight, the state's leading Federalist, further tied him to Connecticut's ruling elite. In a business dependent on government contracts, such connections were essential to success.\nWhitney died of prostate cancer on January 8, 1825, in New Haven, Connecticut, just a month after his 59th birthday. During the course of his illness, he reportedly invented and constructed several devices to mechanically ease his pain. \nHis son, Eli Whitney III (known as Eli Whitney Jr.), later took over the Whitney Armory and was instrumental in building New Haven, Connecticut's waterworks. \nThe Eli Whitney Students Program, Yale University's admissions program for non-traditional students, is named in honor of Whitney, who not only began his studies there when he was 23, but also went on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in just three years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9735", "revid": "12530063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9735", "title": "Electromagnetic field", "text": "Electric and magnetic fields produced by moving charged objects\nAn electromagnetic field (also EM field) is a physical field, varying in space and time, that represents the electric and magnetic influences generated by and acting upon electric charges. The field at any point in space and time can be regarded as a combination of an electric field and a magnetic field. \nBecause of the interrelationship between the fields, a disturbance in the electric field can create a disturbance in the magnetic field which in turn affects the electric field, leading to an oscillation that propagates through space, known as an \"electromagnetic wave\".\nMathematically, the electromagnetic field is a pair of vector fields consisting of one vector for the electric field and one for the magnetic field at each point in space. The vectors may change over time and space in accordance with Maxwell's equations. The vectors are subject to the rules of special relativity; different observers may determine different vectors.\nThe way in which charges and currents (i.e. streams of charges) interact with the electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law. Maxwell's equations detail how the electric field converges towards or diverges away from electric charges, how the magnetic field curls around electrical currents, and how changes in the electric and magnetic fields influence each other. The Lorentz force law states that a charge subject to an electric field feels a force along the direction of the field, and a charge moving through a magnetic field feels a force that is perpendicular both to the magnetic field and to its direction of motion. \nThe electromagnetic field is described by classical electrodynamics, an example of a classical field theory. This theory describes many macroscopic physical phenomena accurately. However, it was unable to explain the photoelectric effect and atomic absorption spectroscopy, experiments at the atomic scale. That required the use of quantum mechanics, specifically the quantization of the electromagnetic field and the development of quantum electrodynamics.\nHistory.\nThe empirical investigation of electromagnetism is at least as old as the ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician and scientist Thales of Miletus, who around 600\u00a0BCE described his experiments rubbing fur of animals on various materials such as amber creating static electricity. By the 18th century, it was understood that objects can carry positive or negative electric charge, that two objects carrying charge of the same sign repel each other, that two objects carrying charges of opposite sign attract one another, and that the strength of this force falls off as the square of the distance between them. Michael Faraday visualized this in terms of the charges interacting via the electric field. An electric field is produced when the charge is stationary with respect to an observer measuring the properties of the charge, and a magnetic field as well as an electric field are produced when the charge moves, creating an electric current with respect to this observer. Over time, it was realized that the electric and magnetic fields are better thought of as two parts of a greater whole\u2014the electromagnetic field. In 1820, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted showed that an electric current can deflect a nearby compass needle, establishing that electricity and magnetism are closely related phenomena. Faraday then made the seminal observation that time-varying magnetic fields could induce electric currents in 1831. \nIn 1861, James Clerk Maxwell synthesized all the work to date on electrical and magnetic phenomena into a single mathematical theory, from which he then deduced that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell's continuous field theory was very successful until evidence supporting the atomic model of matter emerged. Beginning in 1877, Hendrik Lorentz developed an atomic model of electromagnetism and in 1897 J. J. Thomson completed experiments that defined the electron. The Lorentz theory works for free charges in electromagnetic fields, but fails to predict the energy spectrum for bound charges in atoms and molecules. For that problem, quantum mechanics is needed, ultimately leading to the theory of quantum electrodynamics.\nPractical applications of the new understanding of electromagnetic fields emerged in the late 1800s. The electrical generator and motor were invented using only the empirical findings like Faraday's and Ampere's laws combined with practical experience.\nMathematical description.\nThere are different mathematical ways of representing the electromagnetic field. The first one views the electric and magnetic fields as three-dimensional vector fields. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as E(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"t\") (electric field) and B(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"t\") (magnetic field).\nIf only the electric field (E) is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an electrostatic field. Similarly, if only the magnetic field (B) is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a magnetostatic field. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using Maxwell's equations.\nWith the advent of special relativity, physical laws became amenable to the formalism of tensors. Maxwell's equations can be written in tensor form, generally viewed by physicists as a more elegant means of expressing physical laws.\nThe behavior of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or electrodynamics (electromagnetic fields), is governed by Maxwell's equations. In the vector field formalism, these are:\nwhere formula_5 is the charge density, which is a function of time and position, formula_6 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_7 is the vacuum permeability, and J is the current density vector, also a function of time and position. Inside a linear material, Maxwell's equations change by switching the permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question. Inside other materials which possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often represented by complex numbers, or tensors.\nThe Lorentz force law governs the interaction of the electromagnetic field with charged matter.\nWhen a field travels across to different media, the behavior of the field changes according to the properties of the media.\nProperties of the field.\nElectrostatics and magnetostatics.\nThe Maxwell equations simplify when the charge density at each point in space does not change over time and all electric currents likewise remain constant. All of the time derivatives vanish from the equations, leaving two expressions that involve the electric field,\nformula_8\nand\nformula_9\nalong with two formulae that involve the magnetic field:\nformula_10\nand\nformula_11\nThese expressions are the basic equations of electrostatics, which focuses on situations where electrical charges do not move, and magnetostatics, the corresponding area of magnetic phenomena.\nTransformations of electromagnetic fields.\nWhether a physical effect is attributable to an electric field or to a magnetic field is dependent upon the observer, in a way that special relativity makes mathematically precise. For example, suppose that a laboratory contains a long straight wire that carries an electrical current. In the frame of reference where the laboratory is at rest, the wire is motionless and electrically neutral: the current, composed of negatively charged electrons, moves against a background of positively charged ions, and the densities of positive and negative charges cancel each other out. A test charge near the wire would feel no electrical force from the wire. However, if the test charge is in motion parallel to the current, the situation changes. In the rest frame of the test charge, the positive and negative charges in the wire are moving at different speeds, and so the positive and negative charge distributions are Lorentz-contracted by different amounts. Consequently, the wire has a nonzero net charge density, and the test charge must experience a nonzero electric field and thus a nonzero force. In the rest frame of the laboratory, there is no electric field to explain the test charge being pulled towards or pushed away from the wire. So, an observer in the laboratory rest frame concludes that a magnetic field must be present.\nIn general, a situation that one observer describes using only an electric field will be described by an observer in a different inertial frame using a combination of electric and magnetic fields. Analogously, a phenomenon that one observer describes using only a magnetic field will be, in a relatively moving reference frame, described by a combination of fields. The rules for relating the fields required in different reference frames are the Lorentz transformations of the fields.\nThus, electrostatics and magnetostatics are now seen as studies of the static EM field when a particular frame has been selected to suppress the other type of field, and since an EM field with both electric and magnetic will appear in any other frame, these \"simpler\" effects are merely a consequence of different frames of measurement. The fact that the two field variations can be reproduced just by changing the motion of the observer is further evidence that there is only a single actual field involved which is simply being observed differently.\nReciprocal behavior of electric and magnetic fields.\nThe two Maxwell equations, Faraday's Law and the Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell Law, illustrate a very practical feature of the electromagnetic field. Faraday's Law may be stated roughly as \"a changing magnetic field inside a loop creates an electric voltage around the loop\". This is the principle behind the electric generator.\nAmpere's Law roughly states that \"an electrical current around a loop creates a magnetic field through the loop\". Thus, this law can be applied to generate a magnetic field and run an electric motor.\nBehavior of the fields in the absence of charges or currents.\nMaxwell's equations can be combined to derive wave equations. The solutions of these equations take the form of an electromagnetic wave. In a volume of space not containing charges or currents (free space) \u2013 that is, where formula_5 and J are zero, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy these electromagnetic wave equations:\n formula_13\n formula_14\nJames Clerk Maxwell was the first to obtain this relationship by his completion of Maxwell's equations with the addition of a displacement current term to Ampere's circuital law. This unified the physical understanding of electricity, magnetism, and light: visible light is but one portion of the full range of electromagnetic waves, the electromagnetic spectrum.\nTime-varying EM fields in Maxwell's equations.\nAn electromagnetic field very far from currents and charges (sources) is called electromagnetic radiation (EMR) since it radiates from the charges and currents in the source. Such radiation can occur across a wide range of frequencies called the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio waves, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays. The many commercial applications of these radiations are discussed in the named and linked articles.\nA notable application of visible light is that this type of energy from the Sun powers all life on Earth that either makes or uses oxygen.\nA changing electromagnetic field which is physically close to currents and charges (see near and far field for a definition of \"close\") will have a dipole characteristic that is dominated by either a changing electric dipole, or a changing magnetic dipole. This type of dipole field near sources is called an electromagnetic \"near-field\".\nChanging electric dipole fields, as such, are used commercially as near-fields mainly as a source of dielectric heating. Otherwise, they appear parasitically around conductors which absorb EMR, and around antennas which have the purpose of generating EMR at greater distances.\nChanging magnetic dipole fields (i.e., magnetic near-fields) are used commercially for many types of magnetic induction devices. These include motors and electrical transformers at low frequencies, and devices such as RFID tags, metal detectors, and MRI scanner coils at higher frequencies.\nHealth and safety.\nThe potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health vary widely depending on the frequency, intensity of the fields, and the length of the exposure. Low frequency, low intensity, and short duration exposure to electromagnetic radiation is generally considered safe. On the other hand, radiation from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet light and gamma rays, are known to cause significant harm in some circumstances.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from \"Empire State\", the nickname of New York state. The building has a roof height of and stands a total of tall including its antenna. The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building until the North Tower of the World Trade Center was topped out in 1970; following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was once more New York City's tallest building until it was surpassed in 2012 by One World Trade Center. As of 2025[ [update]], the building is the eighth-tallest building in New York City, the tenth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, and the 59th-tallest completed skyscraper in the world.\nThe site of the Empire State Building, on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s.\nThe building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around four\u00a0million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an international cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250\u00a0television series and films since the film \"King Kong\" was released in 1933. The building's size has been used as a standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSite.\nThe Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue, between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north, in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, United States. Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue. Visitors to the observatories use an entrance at 20 West 34th Street; prior to August 2018, visitors entered through the Fifth Avenue lobby. Although physically located in South Midtown, a mixed residential and commercial area, the building is so large that it was assigned its own ZIP Code, 10118; as of 2012[ [update]], it is one of 43 buildings in New York City that have their own ZIP codes.\nThe areas surrounding the Empire State Building are home to other major points of interest, including Macy's at Herald Square on Sixth Avenue and 34th Street, and Koreatown on 32nd Street between Madison and Sixth avenues. To the east of the Empire State Building is Murray Hill, a neighborhood with a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment activity. The block directly to the northeast contains the B. Altman and Company Building, which houses the City University of New York's Graduate Center. The nearest New York City Subway stations are 34th Street\u2013Herald Square, one block west, and 33rd Street at Park Avenue, two blocks east; there is also a PATH station at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue.\nArchitecture.\nThe Empire State Building was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon in the Art Deco style. The Empire State Building is tall to its 102nd floor, or including its pinnacle. It was the first building in the world to be more than 100 stories tall, though only the lowest 86 stories are usable. The first through 85th floors contain of commercial and office space, while the 86th floor contains an observatory. The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes. Atop the 102nd story is the pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.\nForm.\nThe Empire State Building has a symmetrical massing because of its large lot and relatively short base. Its articulation consists of three horizontal sections\u2014a base, shaft, and capital\u2014similar to the components of a column. The five-story base occupies the entire lot, while the 81-story shaft above it is set back sharply from the base. The setback above the 5th story is deep on all sides. There are smaller setbacks on the upper stories, allowing sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors while also positioning these floors away from the noisy streets below. The setbacks are located at the 21st, 25th, 30th, 72nd, 81st, and 85th stories. The setbacks correspond to the tops of elevator shafts, allowing interior spaces to be at most deep &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nThe setbacks were mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well. Normally, a building of the Empire State's dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on the Fifth Avenue side, and up to 17 stories on the 33rd Street and 34th Street sides, before it would have to utilize setbacks. However, with the largest setback being located above the base, the tower stories could contain a uniform shape. According to architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern, the building's form contrasted with the nearly contemporary, similarly designed 500 Fifth Avenue eight blocks north, which had an asymmetrical massing on a smaller lot.\nFacade.\nThe Empire State Building's Art Deco design is typical of pre\u2013World War II architecture in New York City. The facade is clad in Indiana limestone panels made by the Indiana Limestone Company and sourced from a quarry in south-central Indiana; the panels give the building its signature blonde color. According to official fact sheets, the facade uses of limestone and granite, ten million bricks, and of aluminum and stainless steel. The building also contains 6,514 windows. The decorative features on the facade are largely geometric, in contrast with earlier buildings, whose decorations often were intended to represent a specific narrative.\nThe main entrance, composed of three sets of metal doors, is at the center of the facade's Fifth Avenue elevation, flanked by molded piers that are topped with eagles. Above the main entrance is a transom, a triple-height transom window with geometric patterns, and the golden letters \"Empire State\" above the fifth-floor windows. There are two entrances each on 33rd and 34th streets, with modernistic, stainless steel canopies projecting from the entrances on 33rd and 34th streets there. Above the secondary entrances are triple windows, less elaborate in design than those on Fifth Avenue.\nThe storefronts on the first floor contain aluminum-framed doors and windows within a black granite cladding. The second through fourth stories consist of windows alternating with wide stone piers and narrower stone mullions. The fifth story contains windows alternating with wide and narrow mullions, and is topped by a horizontal stone sill.\nThe facade of the tower stories is split into several vertical bays on each side, with windows projecting slightly from the limestone cladding. The bays are arranged into sets of one, two, or three windows on each floor. The bays are separated by alternating narrow and wide piers, the inclusion of which may have been influenced by the design of the contemporary Daily News Building. The windows in each bay are separated by vertical nickel-chrome steel mullions and connected by horizontal aluminum spandrels between each floor. The windows are placed within stainless-steel frames, which saved money by eliminating the need to apply a stone finish around the windows. In addition, the use of aluminum spandrels obviated the need for cross-bonding, which would have been required if stone had been used instead.\nLights.\nThe building was originally equipped with white searchlights at the top. They were first used in November 1932 when they lit up to signal Roosevelt's victory over Hoover in the presidential election of that year. These were later swapped for four \"Freedom Lights\" in 1956. In February 1964, flood lights were added on the 72nd floor to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the World Fair later that year. The lights were shut off from November 1973 to July 1974 because of the energy crisis at the time. In 1976, the businessman Douglas Leigh suggested that Wien and Helmsley install 204 metal-halide lights, which were four times as bright as the 1,000 incandescent lights they were to replace. New red, white, and blue metal-halide lights were installed in time for the country's bicentennial that July. After the bicentennial, Helmsley retained the new lights due to the reduced maintenance cost, about $116 a year.\nSince October 12, 1977, the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays. Organizations are allowed to make requests through the building's website. The building is also lit in the colors of New York-based sports teams on nights when they host games: for example, orange, blue, and white for the New York Knicks; red, white, and blue for the New York Rangers. The spire can also be lit to commemorate events including disasters, anniversaries, or deaths, as well as for celebrations such as Pride and Halloween. In 1998, the building was lit in blue after the death of singer Frank Sinatra, who was nicknamed \"Ol' Blue Eyes\".\nThe structure was lit in red, white, and blue for several months after the September 11 attacks in 2001. On January 13, 2012, the building was lit in red, orange, and yellow to honor the 60th anniversary of the NBC program \"The Today Show\". After retired basketball player Kobe Bryant's January 2020 death, the building was lit in purple and gold, signifying the colors of his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers. The evening after iconic actor James Earl Jones died, September 9, 2024, the building was lit up to look like Jones's iconic Darth Vader villain from \"Star Wars.\"\nIn addition to lightings, the Empire State Building is able to do immersive visual projections on the building's exterior. It partnered with Netflix in May 2022 to celebrate the return of Stranger Things fourth season by projecting the Upside Down onto the Empire State Building.\nIn 2012, the building's four hundred metal halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16\u00a0million. The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard during the 2012 United States presidential election, using red and blue lights to represent Republican and Democratic electoral votes respectively. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. Artists such as Eminem and OneRepublic have been featured in later shows, including the building's annual Holiday Music-to-Lights Show. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they do not use the lights to play advertisements.\nInterior.\nAccording to official fact sheets, the Empire State Building weighs and has an internal volume of . The interior required of elevator cable and of electrical wires. It has a total floor area of , and each of the floors in the base cover . This gives the building capacity for 20,000 tenants and 15,000 visitors.\nThe riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravitational stresses and wind loads. The amount of material used in the building's construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of versus the Willis Tower's and the John Hancock Center's . A December 1930 feature in \"Popular Mechanics\" estimated that a building with the Empire State's dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of .\nUtilities are grouped in a central shaft. On the 6th through 86th stories, the central shaft is surrounded by a main corridor on all four sides. Per the final specifications of the building, the corridor is surrounded in turn by office space deep, maximizing office space at a time before air conditioning became commonplace. Each of the floors has 210 structural columns that pass through it, which provide structural stability but limits the amount of open space on these floors. The relative dearth of stone in the Empire State Building allows for more space overall, with a 1:200 stone-to-building ratio compared to a 1:50 ratio in similar buildings.\nLobby.\nThe original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and is the only place in the building where the design contains narrative motifs. It contains an entrance with one set of double doors between a pair of revolving doors. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three \"crafts or industries\" used in the building's construction\u2014Electricity, Masonry, and Heating. The three-story-high space runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets. The lobby contains two tiers of marble: a wainscoting of darker marble, topped by lighter marble. There is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from east to west. To the north and south are storefronts, which are flanked by tubes of dark rounded marble and topped by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble. Until the 1960s, there was a Longchamps restaurant next to the lobby, with six oval murals designed by Winold Reiss; these murals were placed in storage when the Longchamps closed.\nThe western ends of the north and south walls include escalators to a mezzanine level. At the west end of the lobby, behind the security desk, is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (without the antenna). The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect, contains an embossed outline of the building, with rays radiating from the spire and the sun behind it. In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a \"medallion\" in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is depicted in the bottom right and a plaque to the building's major developers is on the bottom left. A scale model of the building was also placed south of the security desk.\nThe plaque at the western end of the lobby is on the eastern interior wall of a one-story-tall rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby. The rectangular-shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle, as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side. At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors. The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators (originally stairs), which go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from the northern and southern corridors, respectively. The side entrances from 33rd and 34th Street lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel-and-glass-enclosed bridges at the mezzanine floor.\nUntil the 1960s, an Art Deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the Machine Age, was installed in the lobby ceilings. Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an anemometer and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur. The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Ren\u00e9e Nemorov, in time for the 1964 World's Fair, depicting the building as the Eighth Wonder of the World alongside the traditional seven. The building's owners installed a series of paintings by the New York artist Kysa Johnson in the concourse level. Johnson later filed a federal lawsuit, in January 2014, under the Visual Artists Rights Act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist. As part of the building's 2010 renovation, Denise Amses commissioned a work consisting of 15,000 stars and 5,000 circles, superimposed on a etched-glass installation, in the lobby.\nElevators.\nThe Empire State Building has 73 elevators in all, including service elevators. Its original 64 elevators, built by the Otis Elevator Company, in a central core and are of varying heights, with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the 80th floor. As originally built, there were four \"express\" elevators that connected the lobby, 80th floor, and several landings in between; the other 60 \"local\" elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. Of the 64 total elevators, 58 were for passenger use (comprising the four express elevators and 54 local elevators), and eight were for freight deliveries. The elevators were designed to move at . At the time of the skyscraper's construction, their practical speed was limited to per city law, but this limit was removed shortly after the building opened.\nAdditional elevators connect the 80th floor to the six floors above it, as the six extra floors were built after the original 80 stories were approved. The elevators were mechanically operated until 2011, when they were replaced with automatic elevators during the $550\u00a0million renovation of the building. An additional elevator connects the 86th and 102nd floor observatories, which allows visitors access to the 102nd floor observatory after having their tickets scanned. It also allows employees to access the mechanical floors located between the 87th and 101st floors.\nObservation decks.\nThe 80th, 86th, and 102nd floors contain observatories. The latter two observatories saw a combined average of four\u00a0million visitors per year in 2010. Since opening, the observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the Chrysler Building, the first One World Trade Center, or the Woolworth Building, despite being more expensive. There are variable charges to enter the observatories based on demand and time of day. Though most tickets allow visitors to go to the 86th floor, an additional fee is charged for access to the 102nd floor. Other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view the sunrise from the observatory, a \"premium\" guided tour with VIP access, and the \"AM/PM\" package which allows for two visits in the same day.\nThe 86th floor observatory contains both an enclosed viewing gallery and an open-air outdoor viewing area, allowing for it to remain open 365 days a year regardless of the weather. The 102nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller in size. The 102nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late 1990s to 2005 due to limited viewing capacity and long lines. The observation decks were redesigned in mid-1979. The 102nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in 2019, allowing the windows to be extended from floor to ceiling and widening the space in the observatory overall. An observatory on the 80th floor, opened in 2019, includes various exhibits as well as a mural of the skyline drawn by British artist Stephen Wiltshire. An interactive multimedia museum, with multiple hands-on exhibitions about the building's history, was added during this project. The design of the Observatory Experience was inspired by the plans and designs of the original Empire State Building.\nAccording to a 2010 report by Concierge.com, the five lines to enter the observation decks are \"as legendary as the building itself\". Concierge.com stated that there were five lines: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck. In 2016, New York City's official tourism website made note of only three lines: the security check line, the ticket purchase line, and the second elevator line. Following renovations completed in 2019, designed to streamline queuing and reduce wait times, guests enter from a single entrance on 34th Street, where they make their way through exhibits on their way up to the observatories. Guests were offered a variety of ticket packages, including a package that enables them to skip the lines throughout the duration of their stay. The Empire State Building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks, making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years.\nNew York Skyride.\nIn early 1994, a motion simulator attraction was built on the 2nd floor, as a complement to the observation deck. The original cinematic presentation lasted approximately 25\u00a0minutes, while the simulation was about eight minutes. The ride had two incarnations. The original version, which ran from 1994 until around 2002, featured James Doohan, \"\"'s Scotty, as the airplane's pilot who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the ride was closed. An updated version debuted in mid-2002, featuring actor Kevin Bacon as the pilot, with the new flight also going haywire. This new version served a more informative goal, as opposed to the old version's main purpose of entertainment, and contained details about the 9/11 attacks. The simulator received mixed reviews, with assessments of the ride ranging from \"great\" to \"satisfactory\" to \"corny\".\nSpire.\nAbove the 102nd floor.\nThe final stage of the building was the installation of a hollow mast, a steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities, above the 86th floor. The spire of the Empire State Building was originally intended to serve as a mooring mast for zeppelins and other airships, although the plan was abandoned when it was determined that high winds would make that impossible. At the top would be a conical roof and the 102nd-floor docking station. Inside, the elevators would ascend from the 86th-floor ticket offices to a 101st-floor waiting room. From there, stairs would lead to the 102nd floor, where passengers would enter the airships. The airships would have been moored to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor.\nAs constructed, the mast contains four rectangular tiers topped by a cylindrical shaft with a conical pinnacle. On the 102nd (formerly 101st) floor, there is a door with stairs ascending to a 103rd (formerly 102nd) floor. This top level, originally planned to be the airship docking station, now contains electrical equipment and features an exterior balcony. The floor is inaccessible to the public but celebrities and dignitaries may be given permission to take pictures there. A set of stairs and a ladder ascend to the spire and are used by maintenance workers. The mast's 480 windows were all replaced in 2015. The mast serves as the base of the building's broadcasting antenna.\nInflatable objects have sometimes been mounted to the spire for promotional purposes. For example, a King Kong balloon was attached to the spire in 1983 to mark the 50th anniversary of the character's introduction, and an inflatable dragon was placed on the spire in 2024 to promote the TV series \"House of Dragon\".\nBroadcast stations.\nBroadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when NBC and RCA began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the mast, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there. In 1934, RCA was joined by Edwin Howard Armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna. This setup, which entailed the installation of the world's first FM transmitter, continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong. Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong's transmitter was located.\nAfter some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA's New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 (now WNBC channel 4). NBC's FM station, W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940. NBC retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the exclusive deal be terminated. The FCC directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York\u2013area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Other television broadcasters would later join RCA at the building on the 81st through 83rd floors, often along with sister FM stations. Construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on July 27, 1950, with TV, and FM, transmissions starting in 1951. The broadcast tower was completed in 1953. From 1951, six broadcasters agreed to pay a combined $600,000 per year for the use of the antenna. In 1965, a separate set of FM antennae was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna.\nThe placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984. Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.\nThe September 11 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city's stations without a transmitter for ten days until the Armstrong Tower in Alpine, New Jersey, was re-activated temporarily. By October 2001, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that Congress commissioned about the transition from analog television to digital television, it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered \"problematic\" due to interference from nearby buildings. In comparison, the congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference. In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby Cond\u00e9 Nast Building to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building. Eleven television stations and twenty-two FM stations had signed 15-year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in Bayonne, New Jersey, or Governors Island, would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a \"backup\" since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality. Following the construction of One World Trade Center in the late 2000s and early 2010s, some TV stations began moving their transmitting facilities there.\nAs of 2021[ [update]], the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:\nHistory.\nThe site was previously owned by John Jacob Astor of the prominent Astor family, which had owned the site since the mid-1820s. In 1893, John Jacob Astor Sr.'s grandson William Waldorf Astor opened the Waldorf Hotel on the site. Four years later, his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The two portions of the Waldorf\u2013Astoria hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time. After the death of its founding proprietor, George Boldt, in early 1918, the hotel lease was purchased by Thomas Coleman du Pont. By the 1920s, the old Waldorf\u2013Astoria was becoming dated and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north. Additionally, many stores had opened on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street. The Astor family decided to build a replacement hotel on Park Avenue and sold the hotel to Bethlehem Engineering Corporation in 1928 for $14\u201316\u00a0million. The hotel closed shortly thereafter on May 3, 1929.\nPlanning.\nEarly plans.\nBethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf\u2013Astoria site. The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1\u00a0million down payment required to start construction on the building, with the promise that the difference would be paid later. Brown borrowed $900,000 from a bank but defaulted on the loan.\nAfter Brown was unable to secure additional funding, the land was resold to Empire State Inc., a group of wealthy investors that included Louis G. Kaufman, Ellis P. Earle, John J. Raskob, Coleman du Pont, and Pierre S. du Pont. The name came from the state nickname for New York. Alfred E. Smith, a former Governor of New York and U.S. presidential candidate whose 1928 campaign had been managed by Raskob, was appointed head of the company. The group also purchased nearby land so they would have the needed for the base, with the combined plot measuring wide by long. The Empire State Inc. consortium was announced to the public in August 1929. Concurrently, Smith announced the construction of an 80-story building on the site, to be taller than any other buildings in existence.\nEmpire State Inc. contracted William F. Lamb, of architectural firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, to create the building design. Lamb produced the initial building design using the firm's earlier designs for the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the basis. He had also been inspired by Raymond Hood's design for the Daily News Building, which was being constructed at the same time. Concurrently, Lamb's partner Richmond Shreve created \"bug diagrams\" of the project requirements. The 1916 Zoning Act forced Lamb to design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper floors. Consequently, the building was conceived from the top down, giving it a pencil-like shape. The plans were devised within a budget of $50 million and a stipulation that the building be ready for occupancy within 18 months of the start of construction. Design drawings and construction were concurrent. Steel drawings were completed in mid-January 1930, when foundations were underway.\nDesign changes.\nThe original plan of the building was 50 stories, but was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories. Height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings to ensure that the top fifty floors of the planned 80-story, building would have unobstructed views of the city. \"The New York Times\" lauded the site's proximity to mass transit, with the Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit's 34th Street station and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad's 33rd Street terminal one block away, as well as Penn Station two blocks away and Grand Central Terminal nine blocks away at its closest. It also praised the of proposed floor space near \"one of the busiest sections in the world\". The Empire State Building was to be a typical office building, but Raskob intended to build it \"better and in a bigger way\", according to architectural writer Donald J. Reynolds.\nWhile plans for the Empire State Building were being finalized, an intense competition in New York for the title of \"world's tallest building\" was underway. 40 Wall Street (then the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building in Manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the Empire State Building. The \"Race into the Sky\", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities. The race was defined by at least five other proposals, although only the Empire State Building would survive the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The 40 Wall Street tower was revised, in April 1929, from to making it the world's tallest. The Chrysler Building added its steel tip to its roof in October 1929, thus bringing it to a height of and greatly exceeding the height of 40 Wall Street. The Chrysler Building's developer, Walter Chrysler, realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having instructed his architect, William Van Alen, to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to a narrow steel spire. Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world's tallest, reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension. On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27\u201331 West 33rd Street, adding to the width of the proposed office building's site. Two days later, Smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper. The plans included an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.\nThe 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be taller than the Chrysler Building, and Raskob was afraid that Chrysler might try to \"pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.\" The plans were revised one last time in December 1929, to include a 16-story, metal \"crown\" and an additional mooring mast intended for dirigibles. The roof height was now , making it the tallest building in the world by far, even without the antenna. The addition of the dirigible station meant that another floor, the 86th, would have to be built below the crown; however, unlike the Chrysler's spire, the Empire State's mast would serve a practical purpose. A revised plan was announced to the public in late December 1929, just before the start of construction. The final plan was sketched within two hours, the night before the plan was supposed to be presented to the site's owners in January 1930. \"The New York Times\" reported that the spire was facing some \"technical problems\", but they were \"no greater than might be expected under such a novel plan.\" By this time the blueprints for the building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were approved. Lamb described the other specifications he was given for the final, approved plan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The program was short enough\u2014a fixed budget, no space more than 28 feet from window to corridor, as many stories of such space as possible, an exterior of limestone, and completion date of [May 1], 1931, which meant a year and six months from the beginning of sketches.\nConstruction.\nThe contractors were Starrett Brothers and Eken, which were composed of Paul and William A. Starrett and Andrew J. Eken. The project was financed primarily by Raskob and Pierre du Pont, while James Farley's General Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials. John W. Bowser was the construction superintendent of the project, and the structural engineer of the building was Homer G. Balcom. The tight completion schedule necessitated the commencement of construction even though the design had yet to be finalized.\nHotel demolition.\nDemolition of the old Waldorf\u2013Astoria began on October 1, 1929. Stripping the building down was an arduous process, as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been. Furthermore, the old hotel's granite, wood chips, and \"'precious' metals such as lead, brass, and zinc\" were not in high demand, resulting in issues with disposal. Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. Much of the other materials that made up the old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.\nBy the time the hotel's demolition started, Raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the building. The plan was to start construction later that year but, on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange experienced the major and sudden Wall Street Crash, marking the beginning of the decade-long Great Depression. Despite the economic downturn, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point. Neither Raskob, who had ceased speculation in the stock market the previous year, nor Smith, who had no stock investments, suffered financially in the crash. However, most of the investors were affected and as a result, in December 1929, Empire State Inc. obtained a $27.5\u00a0million loan from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company so construction could begin. The stock market crash resulted in no demand for new office space; Raskob and Smith nonetheless started construction, as canceling the project would have resulted in greater losses for the investors.\nSteel structure.\nA structural steel contract was awarded on January 12, 1930, with excavation of the site beginning ten days later on January 22, before the old hotel had been completely demolished. Two twelve-hour shifts, consisting of 300 men each, worked continuously to dig the deep foundation. Small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork. Excavation was nearly complete by early March, and construction on the building itself started on March 17, with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been finished. Around this time, Lamb held a press conference on the building plans. He described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows, the large-block Indiana Limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks, and the building's vertical lines. Four colossal columns, intended for installation in the center of the building site, were delivered; they would support a combined when the building was finished.\nThe structural steel was pre-ordered and pre-fabricated in anticipation of a revision to the city's building code that would have allowed the Empire State Building's structural steel to carry , up from , thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building. Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before construction was due to commence. The first steel framework was installed on April 1, 1930. From there, construction proceeded at a rapid pace; during one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors. This was made possible through precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels. On one occasion, when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark Hauteville marble, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.\nThe scale of the project was massive, with trucks carrying \"16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, of sand and 300 bags of lime\" arriving at the construction site every day. There were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch. Temporary water taps were installed so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground level. Carts running on a small railway system transported materials from the basement storage to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks. The of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever single order of steel at the time, comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined. According to historian John Tauranac, building materials were sourced from numerous, and distant, sources with \"limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, [and] hardware from New England.\" The facade, too, used a variety of material\u2014most prominently Indiana limestone but also architectural terracotta, brick, and black granite from Sweden.\nBy June 20, the skyscraper's supporting steel structure had risen to the 26th floor, and by July 27, half of the steel structure had been completed. Starrett Bros. and Eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction, achieving a pace of four and a half stories per week; prior to this, the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been three and a half stories per week. While construction progressed, the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up (as opposed to the general design, which had been from the roof down). Some of the levels were still undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized. On September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building's cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands. The stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day's \"New York Times\", a U.S. currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930, a history of the site and building, and photographs of the people involved in construction. The steel structure was topped out at on September 19, twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after the start of construction. Workers raised a flag atop the 86th floor to signify this milestone.\nCompletion and scale.\nWork on the building's interior and crowning mast commenced after the topping out. The mooring mast topped out on November 21, two months after the steelwork had been completed. Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th floor. The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November. Because of the building's height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the Otis Elevator Company to make 66 cars that could speed at , which represented the largest-ever elevator order at the time.\nIn addition to the time constraint builders had, there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly, and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic. This was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd and 34th Streets, and then storing the materials in the building's first floor and basements. Concrete mixers, brick hoppers, and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the public. At one point, over 200 trucks made material deliveries at the building site every day. A series of relay and erection derricks, placed on platforms erected near the building, lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed the beams at the appropriate locations. The Empire State Building was structurally completed on April 11, 1931, twelve days ahead of schedule and 410\u00a0days after construction commenced. Al Smith shot the final rivet, which was made of solid gold.\nThe project involved more than 3,500 workers at its peak, including 3,439 on a single day, August 14, 1930. Many of the workers were Irish and Italian immigrants, with a sizable minority of Mohawk ironworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. According to official accounts, five workers died during the construction, although the \"New York Daily News\" gave reports of 14 deaths and a headline in the socialist magazine \"The New Masses\" spread unfounded rumors of up to 42 deaths. The Empire State Building cost $40,948,900 to build (equivalent to $ in 2024), including demolition of the Waldorf\u2013Astoria. This was lower than the $60\u00a0million budgeted for construction.\nLewis Hine captured many photographs of the construction, documenting not only the work itself but also providing insight into the daily life of workers in that era. Hine's images were used extensively by the media to publish daily press releases. According to the writer Jim Rasenberger, Hine \"climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture, as no one ever had before (or has since), the dizzy work of building skyscrapers\". In Rasenberger's words, Hine turned what might have been an assignment of \"corporate flak\" into \"exhilarating art\". These images were later organized into their own collection. Onlookers were enraptured by the sheer height at which the steelworkers operated. \"New York\" magazine wrote of the steelworkers: \"Like little spiders they toiled, spinning a fabric of steel against the sky\".\nOpening and early years.\nThe Empire State Building officially opened on May 1, 1931, forty-five days ahead of its projected opening date, and eighteen months from the start of construction. The opening was marked with an event featuring United States President Herbert Hoover, who turned on the building's lights with the ceremonial button push from Washington, D.C. Over 350 guests attended the opening ceremony, and following luncheon, at the 86th floor including Jimmy Walker, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Al Smith. An account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog, with other landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty being \"lost in the mist\" enveloping New York City. The Empire State Building officially opened the next day. Advertisements for the building's observatories were placed in local newspapers, while nearby hotels also capitalized on the events by releasing advertisements that lauded their proximity to the newly opened building.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", builders and real estate speculators predicted that the Empire State Building would be the world's tallest building \"for many years\", thus ending the great New York City skyscraper rivalry. At the time, most engineers agreed that it would be difficult to build a building taller than , even with the hardy Manhattan bedrock as a foundation. Technically, it was believed possible to build a tower of up to , but it was deemed uneconomical to do so, especially during the Great Depression. As the tallest building in the world, at that time, and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building became an icon of the city and, ultimately, of the nation.\nIn 1932, the Fifth Avenue Association gave the building its 1931 \"gold medal\" for architectural excellence, signifying that the Empire State had been the best-designed building on Fifth Avenue to open in 1931. A year later, on March 2, 1933, the movie \"King Kong\" was released. The movie, which depicted a large stop motion ape named Kong climbing the Empire State Building, made the still-new building into a cinematic icon.\nTenants and tourism.\nAt the beginning of 1931, Fifth Avenue was experiencing high demand for storefront space, with only 12 of 224 stores being unoccupied. The Empire State Building, along with 500 Fifth Avenue and 608 Fifth Avenue, were expected to add a combined 11 stores. The office space was less successful, as the Empire State Building's opening had coincided with the Great Depression in the United States. In the first year, only 23\u00a0percent of the available space was rented, as compared to the early 1920s, where the average building would be 52\u00a0percent occupied upon opening and 90\u00a0percent occupied within five years. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the \"Empty State Building\" or \"Smith's Folly\".\nThe earliest tenants in the Empire State Building were large companies, banks, and garment industries. Jack Brod, one of the building's longest resident tenants, co-established the Empire Diamond Corporation with his father in the building in mid-1931 and rented space in the building until he died in 2008. Brod recalled that there were only about 20 tenants at the time of opening, including him, and that Al Smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh-floor offices. Generally, during the early 1930s, it was rare for more than a single office space to be rented in the building, despite Smith's and Raskob's aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they knew. The building's lights were continuously left on, even in the unrented spaces, to give the impression of occupancy. This was exacerbated by competition from Rockefeller Center as well as from buildings on 42nd Street, which, when combined with the Empire State Building, resulted in surplus of office space in a slow market during the 1930s.\nAggressive marketing efforts served to reinforce the Empire State Building's status as the world's tallest. The observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad tickets. The building became a popular tourist attraction, with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in 1931. In its first year of operation, the observation deck made approximately $2\u00a0million in revenue, as much as its owners made in rent that year. By 1936, the observation deck was crowded on a daily basis, with food and drink available for purchase at the top, and by 1944 the building had received its five-millionth visitor. In 1931, NBC took up tenancy, leasing space on the 85th floor for radio broadcasts. From the outset the building was in debt, losing $1\u00a0million per year by 1935. Real estate developer Seymour Durst recalled that the building was so underused in 1936 that there was no elevator service above the 45th floor, as the building above the 41st floor was empty except for the NBC offices and the Raskob/Du Pont offices on the 81st floor.\nOther events.\nPer the original plans, the Empire State Building's spire was intended to be an airship docking station. Raskob and Smith had proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the 86th floor, while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor. An elevator would ferry passengers from the 86th to the 101st floor after they had checked in on the 86th floor, after which passengers would have climbed steep ladders to board the airship. The idea was impractical and dangerous due to powerful updrafts caused by the building itself, the wind currents across Manhattan, and the spires of nearby skyscrapers. Even if the airship could successfully navigate all these obstacles, its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability, and then tie the craft's nose to the spire with no mooring lines securing the tail end of the craft. On September 15, 1931, a small commercial United States Navy airship circled 25 times in winds. The airship then attempted to dock at the mast, but its ballast spilled and the craft was rocked by unpredictable eddies. The near-disaster scuttled plans to turn the building's spire into an airship terminal, although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward.\nOn July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 79th and 80th floors. One engine completely penetrated the building and landed in a neighboring block, while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. Fourteen people were killed in the incident, but the building escaped severe damage and was reopened two days later.\nProfitability.\nBy the 1940s, the Empire State Building was 98 percent occupied. The structure broke even for the first time in the 1950s. At the time, mass transit options in the building's vicinity were limited compared to the present day. Despite this challenge, the Empire State Building began to attract renters due to its reputation. A radio antenna was erected on top of the towers starting in 1950, allowing the area's television stations to be broadcast from the building.\nDespite the turnaround in the building's fortunes, Raskob listed it for sale in 1951, with a minimum asking price of $50\u00a0million. The property was purchased by business partners Roger L. Stevens, Henry Crown, Alfred R. Glancy and Ben Tobin. The sale was brokered by the Charles F. Noyes Company, a prominent real estate firm in upper Manhattan, for $51\u00a0million, the highest price paid for a single structure at the time. By this time, the Empire State had been fully leased for several years with a waiting list of parties looking to lease space in the building, according to the \"Cortland Standard\". That same year, six news companies formed a partnership to pay a combined annual fee of $600,000 to use the building's antenna, which was completed in 1953. Crown bought out his partners' ownership stakes in 1954, becoming the sole owner. The following year, the American Society of Civil Engineers named the building one of the \"Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders\".\nIn 1961, Lawrence A. Wien signed a contract to purchase the Empire State Building for $65\u00a0million, with Harry B. Helmsley acting as partners in the building's operating lease. This became the new highest price for a single structure. Over 3,000 people paid $10,000 for one share each in a company called Empire State Building Associates. The company in turn subleased the building to another company headed by Helmsley and Wien, raising $33\u00a0million of the funds needed to pay the purchase price. In a separate transaction, the land underneath the building was sold to Prudential Insurance for $29\u00a0million. Helmsley, Wien, and Peter Malkin quickly started a program of minor improvement projects, including the first-ever full-building facade refurbishment and window-washing in 1962, the installation of new flood lights on the 72nd floor in 1964, and replacement of the manually operated elevators with automatic units in 1966. The little-used western end of the second floor was used as a storage space until 1964, at which point it received escalators to the first floor as part of its conversion into a highly sought retail area.\nLoss of \"tallest building\" title.\nIn 1961, the same year that Helmsley, Wien, and Malkin had purchased the Empire State Building, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey formally backed plans for a new World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The plan originally included 66-story twin towers with column-free open spaces. The Empire State's owners and real estate speculators were worried that the twin towers' of office space would create a glut of rentable space in Manhattan as well as take away the Empire State Building's profits from lessees. A revision in the World Trade Center's plan brought the twin towers to each or 110 stories, taller than the Empire State. Opponents of the new project included prominent real-estate developer Robert Tishman, as well as Wien's Committee for a Reasonable World Trade Center. In response to Wien's opposition, Port Authority executive director Austin J. Tobin said that Wien was only opposing the project because it would overshadow his Empire State Building as the world's tallest building.\nThe World Trade Center's twin towers started construction in 1966. The following year, the Ostankino Tower succeeded the Empire State Building as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. In 1970, the Empire State surrendered its position as the world's tallest building, when the World Trade Center's still-under-construction North Tower surpassed it, on October 19; the North Tower was topped out on December 23, 1970.\nIn December 1975, the observation deck was opened on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers, significantly higher than the 86th floor observatory on the Empire State Building. The latter was also losing revenue during this period, particularly as a number of broadcast stations had moved to the World Trade Center in 1971; the Port Authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the Empire State until 1984. The Empire State Building was still seen as prestigious, having seen its forty-millionth visitor in March 1971.\n1980s and 1990s.\nBy 1980, there were nearly two million annual visitors, although a building official had previously estimated between 1.5\u00a0million and 1.75\u00a0million annual visitors. The building received its own ZIP code in May 1980 in a roll out of 63 new postal codes in Manhattan. At the time, its tenants collectively received 35,000 pieces of mail daily. The Empire State Building celebrated its 50th anniversary on May 1, 1981, with a much-publicized, but poorly received, laser light show, as well as an \"Empire State Building Week\" that ran through to May 8. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) voted to designate the building and its lobby as city landmarks on May 19, 1981,\nCapital improvements were made to the Empire State Building during the early to mid-1990s at a cost of $55\u00a0million. Because all of the building's windows were being replaced at the same time, the LPC mandated a paint-color test for the windows; the test revealed that the Empire State Building's original windows were actually red. The improvements also entailed replacing alarm systems, elevators, windows, and air conditioning; making the observation deck compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA); and refurbishing the limestone facade. The observation deck renovation was added after disability rights groups and the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the building in 1992, in what was the first lawsuit filed by an organization under the new law. A settlement was reached in 1994, in which Empire State Building Associates agreed to add ADA-compliant elements, such as new elevators, ramps, and automatic doors, during the renovation.\nPrudential sold the land under the building in 1991 for $42\u00a0million to a buyer representing hotelier Hideki Yokoi, who was imprisoned at the time in connection with the deadly Hotel New Japan Fire at the Hotel New Japan in Tokyo. In 1994, Donald Trump entered into a joint-venture agreement with Yokoi, with a shared goal of breaking the Empire State Building's lease on the land in an effort to gain total ownership of the building so that, if successful, the two could reap the potential profits of merging the ownership of the building with the land beneath it. Having secured a half-ownership of the land, Trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it, even though Helmsley and Malkin had already started their refurbishment project. He sued Empire State Building Associates in February 1995, claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a \"high-rise slum\" and a \"second-rate, rodent-infested\" office tower. Trump had intended to have Empire State Building Associates evicted for violating the terms of their lease, but was denied. This led to Helmsley's companies countersuing Trump in May. This sparked a series of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several years, partly arising from Trump's desire to obtain the building's master lease by taking it from Empire State Building Associates. Upon Harry Helmsley's death in 1997, the Malkins sued Helmsley's widow, Leona Helmsley, for control of the building.\n21st century.\n2000s.\nFollowing the destruction of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, but was only the second-tallest building in the Americas after the Sears (later Willis) Tower in Chicago. As a result of the attacks, transmissions from nearly all of the city's commercial television and FM radio stations were again broadcast from the Empire State Building. The attacks also led to an increase in security due to persistent terror threats against prominent sites in New York City.\nIn 2002, Trump and Yokoi sold their land claim to the Empire State Building Associates, now headed by Malkin, in a $57.5\u00a0million transaction. This action merged the building's title and lease for the first time in half a century. Despite the lingering threat posed by the 9/11 attacks, the Empire State Building remained popular with 3.5\u00a0million visitors to the observatories in 2004, compared to about 2.8\u00a0million in 2003.\nEven though she maintained her ownership stake in the building until the post-consolidation IPO in October 2013, Leona Helmsley handed over day-to-day operations of the building in 2006 to Peter Malkin's company. In 2008, the building was temporarily \"stolen\" by the \"New York Daily News\" to show how easy it was to transfer the deed on a property, since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information, as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money. The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of \"King Kong\", and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber. The newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners, who at that time were Empire State Land Associates.\n2010s to present.\nStarting in 2009, the building's public areas received a $550\u00a0million renovation, with improvements to the air conditioning and waterproofing, renovations to the observation deck and main lobby, and relocation of the gift shop to the 80th floor. About $120\u00a0million was spent on improving the energy efficiency of the building, with the goal of reducing energy emissions by 38% within five years. For example, all of the windows were refurbished onsite into film-coated \"superwindows\" which block heat but pass light. Air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced, saving $17\u00a0million of the project's capital cost immediately and partially funding some of the other retrofits. The Empire State Building won the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold for Existing Buildings rating in September 2011, as well as the World Federation of Great Towers' Excellence in Environment Award for 2010. For the LEED Gold certification, the building's energy reduction was considered, as was a large purchase of carbon offsets. Other factors included low-flow bathroom fixtures, green cleaning supplies, and use of recycled paper products.\nOn April 30, 2012, One World Trade Center topped out, surpassing the Empire State Building as the city's tallest skyscraper. By 2014, the building was owned by the Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT), with Anthony Malkin as chairman, CEO, and president. The ESRT was a public company, having begun trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange the previous year. In August 2016, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) was issued new fully diluted shares equivalent to 9.9% of the trust; this investment gave them partial ownership of the entirety of the ESRT's portfolio, and as a result, partial ownership of the Empire State Building. The trust's president John Kessler called it an \"endorsement of the company's irreplaceable assets\". The investment has been described by the real-estate magazine \"The Real Deal\" as \"an unusual move for a sovereign wealth fund\", as these funds typically buy direct stakes in buildings rather than real estate companies. Other foreign entities that have a stake in the ESRT include investors from Norway, Japan, and Australia.\nA renovation of the Empire State Building was commenced in the 2010s to further improve energy efficiency, public areas, and amenities. In August 2018, to improve the flow of visitor traffic, the main visitor's entrance was shifted to 20 West 34th Street as part of a major renovation of the observatory lobby. The new lobby includes several technological features, including large LED panels, digital ticket kiosks in nine languages, and a two-story architectural model of the building surrounded by two metal staircases. The first phase of the renovation, completed in 2019, features an updated exterior lighting system and digital hosts. The new lobby also features free Wi-Fi provided for those waiting. A exhibit with nine galleries opened in July 2019. The 102nd floor observatory, the third phase of the redesign, reopened to the public on October 12, 2019. That portion of the project included outfitting the space with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a brand-new glass elevator. The final portion of the renovations to be completed was a new observatory on the 80th floor, which opened on December 2, 2019. In total, the renovation cost $160 million or $165\u00a0million and took four years to finish.\nA comprehensive restoration of the building's mooring and antenna masts also began in June 2019. Antennas on the mooring mast were removed or relocated to the upper mast, while the aluminum panels were cleaned and coated with silver paint. To minimize disruption to the observation decks, the restoration work took place at night. The project was completed by late 2020.\nHeight records.\nThe world record held by the Empire State Building for the longest was for the tallest skyscraper (to structural height). The building held this distinction for 42\u00a0years, being surpassed by the North Tower of the World Trade Center in October 1970. The Empire State Building was also the tallest human-made structure in the world before it was surpassed by the Griffin Television Tower Oklahoma (KWTV Mast) in 1954, and the tallest freestanding structure in the world until the completion of the Ostankino Tower in 1967. An early-1970s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors, which would have brought the building's height to 1,494\u00a0feet (455\u00a0m) and made it once again the world's tallest at the time, was considered but ultimately rejected.\nWith the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, and the second-tallest building in the Americas, surpassed only by the Willis Tower in Chicago. The Empire State Building remained the tallest building in New York until the new One World Trade Center reached a greater height in April 2012. As of 2022[ [update]], it is the seventh-tallest building in New York City and the tenth-tallest in the United States. The Empire State Building is the 49th-tallest in the world as of \u00a02021[ [update]]. It is also the eleventh-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas behind the tallest U.S. buildings and the CN Tower.\nNotable tenants.\nAs of 2013[ [update]], the building housed around 1,000 businesses. Current tenants include:\nFormer tenants include:\nIncidents.\n1945 plane crash.\nAt 9:40\u00a0am on July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber, piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr., crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th and 80th floors (then the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council). One engine completely penetrated the building, landing on the roof of a nearby building where it started a fire that destroyed a penthouse. The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft, causing a fire that was extinguished in 40\u00a0minutes. Fourteen people were killed in the incident. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver fell 75 stories and survived, which still holds the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded.\nDespite the damage and loss of life, many floors were open two days later. The crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law, allowing people to sue the government for the incident. Also as a result of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Administration enacted strict regulations regarding flying over New York City, setting a minimum flying altitude of above sea level regardless of the weather conditions.\nA year later, on July 24, 1946, another airplane narrowly missed striking the building. The unidentified twin-engine plane scraped past the observation deck, frightening the tourists there.\n2000 elevator plunge.\nOn January 24, 2000, an elevator in the building suddenly descended 40 stories after a cable that controlled the cabin's maximum speed was severed. The elevator fell from the 44th floor to the fourth floor, where a narrowed elevator shaft provided a second safety system. Despite the 40-floor fall, both of the passengers in the cabin at the time were only slightly injured. After the fall, building inspectors reviewed all of the building's elevators.\nSuicide attempts.\nBecause of the building's iconic status, it and other Midtown landmarks are common locations for suicide attempts. More than 30 people have attempted suicide over the years by jumping from the upper parts of the building, with most attempts being successful.\nThe first suicide from the building occurred on April 7, 1931, before it was even completed, when a carpenter who had been laid off went to the 58th floor and jumped. The first suicide after the building's opening occurred from the 86th floor observatory in February 1935, when Irma P. Eberhardt fell onto a marquee sign. On December 16, 1943, William Lloyd Rambo jumped to his death from the 86th floor, landing amidst Christmas shoppers on the street below. In the early morning of September 27, 1946, shell-shocked Marine Douglas W. Brashear Jr. jumped from the 76th-floor window of the Grant Advertising Agency; police found his shoes from his body.\nOn May 1, 1947, Evelyn McHale leaped to her death from the 86th-floor observation deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: \"He is much better off without me... I wouldn't make a good wife for anybody\". The photo ran in the May 12, 1947, edition of \"Life\" magazine and is often referred to as \"The Most Beautiful Suicide\". It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his prints entitled \"Suicide (Fallen Body)\". A mesh fence was put up around the 86th floor terrace in December 1947 after five people tried to jump during three weeks in October and November of that year. By then, sixteen people had died from suicide jumps.\nOnly one person has jumped from the upper observatory. Frederick Eckert of Astoria ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd-floor gallery on November 3, 1932, and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for dirigible passengers. He landed and died on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade.\nTwo people have survived falls by not falling more than a floor. On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor, only to be blown back onto a ledge on the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a broken hip. On April 25, 2013, a man fell from the 86th floor observation deck, but he landed alive with minor injuries on an 85th-floor ledge where security guards brought him inside and paramedics transferred him to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.\nShootings.\nTwo fatal shootings have occurred in the direct vicinity of the Empire State Building. Abu Kamal, a 69-year-old Palestinian teacher, shot seven people on the 86th floor observation deck during the afternoon of February 23, 1997. He killed one person and wounded six others before committing suicide. Kamal reportedly committed the shooting in response to events happening in Palestine and Israel.\nOn the morning of August 24, 2012, 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson shot and killed a former co-worker on the building's Fifth Avenue sidewalk. He had been laid off from his job in 2011. Two police officers confronted the gunman, and he aimed his firearm at them. They responded by firing 16 shots, killing him but also wounding nine bystanders. Most of the injured were hit by bullet fragments, although three took direct hits from bullets.\nImpact.\nAs the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation. In 2013, \"Time\" magazine noted that the Empire State Building \"seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with\". The historian John Tauranac called it \"'the' twentieth-century New York building\", despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings.\nThe New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to designate the building and its lobby as city landmarks on May 19, 1981, citing the historic nature of the first and second floors, as well as \"the fixtures and interior components\" of the upper floors. The New York City Planning Commission endorsed the landmark status. The building became a National Historic Landmark in 1986 in close alignment with the New York City Landmarks report. The Empire State Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places the following year due to its architectural significance.\nContemporary reception.\nEarly architectural critics also focused on the Empire State Building's exterior ornamentation. Architectural critic Talbot Hamlin wrote in 1931, \"That it is the world's tallest building is purely incidental.\" George Shepard Chappell, writing in \"The New Yorker\" under the pseudonym \"T-Square\", wrote the same year that the Empire State Building had a \"palpably enormous\" appeal to the general public, and that \"its difference and distinction [lay] in the extreme sensitiveness of its entire design\". Edmund Wilson of \"The New Republic\" wrote that the building's neutral color palette made it \"New York's handsomest skyscraper\".\nArchitectural critics also wrote negatively of the mast, especially in light of its failure to become a real air terminal. Chappell called the mast \"a silly gesture\", and Lewis Mumford called it \"a public comfort station for migratory birds\". Nevertheless, architecture critic Douglas Haskell said the Empire State Building's appeal came from the fact that it was \"caught at the exact moment of transition\u2014caught between metal and stone, between the idea of 'monumental mass' and that of airy volume, between handicraft and machine design, and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication.\"\nAs icon.\nEarly in the building's history, travel companies such as Short Line Motor Coach Service and New York Central Railroad used the building as an icon to symbolize the city. In a 1932 survey of 50 American architects, fourteen ranked the Empire State Building as the United States' best building; the Empire State Building received more votes than any building except the Lincoln Memorial. After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect Paul Goldberger noted that the Empire State Building \"is famous for being tall, but it is good enough to be famous for being good.\"\nAs an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans. In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was \"America's favorite building\". The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants. The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was \"a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men (both clients and construction workers) who were themselves new Americans.\" The architectural critic Jonathan Glancey refers to the building as an \"icon of American design\". Additionally, in 2007, the Empire State Building was first on the AIA's List of America's Favorite Architecture.\nThe Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a \"wonder of the world\" due to the massive effort expended during construction. \"The Washington Star\" listed it as part of one of the \"seven wonders of the modern world\" in 1931, while \"Holiday\" magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State's height would be taller than the combined heights of the Eiffel Tower and the Great Pyramid of Giza. The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building \"A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States\" in 1958 and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World in 1994. Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the \"seven wonders of engineering\". It has often been called the Eighth Wonder of the World as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening. The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, showing the seven original wonders alongside the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building also became the standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures globally, both natural and human-made.\nThe building has also inspired replicas. The New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the \"Empire Tower\", a 47-story replica of the Empire State Building. A portion of the hotel's interior was also designed to resemble the Empire State Building's interior.\nIn media.\nAs an icon of New York City, the Empire State Building has been featured in various films, books, TV shows, and video games. According to the building's official website, more than 250 movies contain depictions of the Empire State Building. In his book about the building, John Tauranac writes that its first documented appearance in popular culture was \"Swiss Family Manhattan\", a 1932 children's story by Christopher Morley. A year later, the film \"King Kong\" depicted Kong, a giant stop motion ape that climbs the Empire State Building during the film's climax, bringing the building into the popular imagination. Later movies such as \"An Affair to Remember\" (1957), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993), and \"Independence Day\" (1996) also prominently featured the building. The building has also been featured in other works, such as \"Daleks in Manhattan\", a 2007 episode of the TV series \"Doctor Who\"; and \"Empire\", an eight-hour black-and-white silent film by Andy Warhol, which was later added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.\nThroughout its history, the Empire State Building has welcomed celebrities, royalty, and dignitaries to visit the observation deck. From celebrities like Taylor Swift and Zendaya to royalty such as Prince William, the Empire State Building hosts notable figures every year.\nEmpire State Building Run-Up.\nThe Empire State Building Run-Up, a foot race from ground level to the 86th-floor observation deck, has been held annually since 1978. It is organized by NYCRUNS. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often tower running enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of and takes in 1,576 steps. The record time is 9\u00a0minutes and 33\u00a0seconds, achieved by Australian professional cyclist Paul Crake in 2003, at a climbing rate of per hour.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9737", "revid": "34669967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9737", "title": "Eugenics", "text": "Effort to improve purported human genetic quality\nEugenics is a set of largely discredited beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population. Historically, eugenicists have attempted to alter the frequency of various human phenotypes by inhibiting the fertility of those considered inferior, or promoting that of those considered superior.\nThe contemporary history of eugenics began in the late 19th century, when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the United Kingdom, and then spread to many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and most European countries (e.g., Sweden and Germany). \nHistorically, the idea of \"eugenics\" has been used to argue for a broad array of practices ranging from prenatal care for mothers deemed genetically desirable to the forced sterilization and murder of those deemed unfit. To population geneticists, the term has included the avoidance of inbreeding without altering allele frequencies; for example, British-Indian scientist J. B. S. Haldane wrote in 1940 that \"the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent.\" Debate as to what qualifies as eugenics continues today.\nA progressive social movement promoting eugenics had originated in the 19th century, with diverse support, but by the mid 20th century the term was closely associated with scientific racism and authoritarian coercion. With modern medical genetics, genetic testing and counseling have become common, and new or liberal eugenics rejects coercive programs in favor of individual parental choice.\nCommon distinctions.\n Eugenic programs included both \"positive\" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly \"fit\" to reproduce, and \"negative\" measures, such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction.\nPositive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged, for example, the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, \"in vitro\" fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally undesirable. This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning. Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; in Nazi Germany, for example, abortion was illegal for women deemed by the state to be superior.\nHistorical eugenics.\nAncient and medieval origins.\n \nAccording to Plutarch, in Sparta every proper citizen's child was inspected by the council of elders, the Gerousia, which determined whether or not the child was fit to live. If the child was deemed unfit, the child was thrown into a chasm. Plutarch is the sole historical source for the Spartan practice of systemic infanticide motivated by eugenics. While infanticide was practiced by Greeks, no contemporary sources support Plutarch's claims of mass infanticide motivated by eugenics. In 2007 the suggestion that infants were dumped near Mount Taygete was called into question due to a lack of physical evidence. Anthropologist Theodoros Pitsios' research found only bodies from adolescents up to the age of approximately 35.\nPlato's political philosophy included the belief that human reproduction should be cautiously monitored and controlled by the state through selective breeding.\nAccording to Tacitus (c.\u200956 \u2013 c.\u2009120), a Roman of the Imperial Period, the Germanic tribes of his day killed any member of their community they deemed cowardly, unwarlike or \"stained with abominable vices\", usually by drowning them in swamps. Modern historians see Tacitus' ethnographic writing as unreliable in such details.\nAcademic origins.\nThe term \"eugenics\" and its modern field of study were first formulated by Francis Galton in 1883, directly drawing on the recent work delineating natural selection by his half-cousin Charles Darwin. He published his observations and conclusions chiefly in his influential book \"Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development\". Galton himself defined it as \"the study of all agencies under human control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations\". The first to systematically apply Darwinism theory to human relations, Galton believed that various desirable human qualities were also hereditary ones, although Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory.\nEugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities and received funding from various sources. Organizations were formed to win public support for and to sway opinion towards responsible eugenic values in parenthood, including the British Eugenics Education Society of 1907 and the American Eugenics Society of 1921. Both sought support from leading clergymen and modified their message to meet religious ideals. In 1909, the Anglican clergymen William Inge and James Peile both wrote for the Eugenics Education Society. Inge was an invited speaker at the 1921 International Eugenics Conference, which was also endorsed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York Patrick Joseph Hayes.\nThree International Eugenics Conferences presented a global venue for eugenicists, with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York City. Eugenic policies in the United States were first implemented by state-level legislators in the early 1900s. Eugenic policies also took root in France, Germany, and Great Britain. Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, the eugenic policy of sterilizing certain mental patients was implemented in other countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Sweden.\nFrederick Osborn's 1937 journal article \"Development of a Eugenic Philosophy\" framed eugenics as a social philosophy\u2014a philosophy with implications for social order. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of sexual reproduction among people with desired traits (\"positive eugenics\") or reduced rates of sexual reproduction or sterilization of people with less-desired or undesired traits (\"negative eugenics\").\nIn addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations. Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, the Cold Spring Harbor Carnegie Institution for Experimental Evolution, and the Eugenics Record Office. Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws. In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness. Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure \"Nordic race\" or \"Aryan\" genetic pool and the eventual elimination of \"unfit\" races.\nMany leading British politicians subscribed to the theories of eugenics. Winston Churchill supported the British Eugenics Society and was an honorary vice president for the organization. Churchill believed that eugenics could solve \"race deterioration\" and reduce crime and poverty.\nAs a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings, birth control, promoting differential birth rates, marriage restrictions, segregation (both racial segregation and sequestering the mentally ill), compulsory sterilization, forced abortions or forced pregnancies, ultimately culminating in genocide. By 2014, gene selection (rather than \"people selection\") was made possible through advances in genome editing, leading to what is sometimes called \"new eugenics\", also known as \"neo-eugenics\", \"consumer eugenics\", or \"liberal eugenics\"; which focuses on individual freedom and allegedly pulls away from racism, sexism or a focus on intelligence.\nEarly opposition.\nEarly critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist Lester Frank Ward, the English writer G. K. Chesterton, and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author Halliday Sutherland. Ward's 1913 article \"Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics\", Chesterton's 1917 book , and Franz Boas' 1916 article \"\" (published in \"The Scientific Monthly\") were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement.\nSeveral biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including Lancelot Hogben. Other biologists who were themselves eugenicists, such as J. B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher, however, also expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of \"defectives\" (i.e. a purely negative eugenics) would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.\nAmong institutions, the Catholic Church opposes sterilization for eugenic purposes. Attempts by the Eugenics Education Society to persuade the British government to legalize voluntary sterilization were opposed by Catholics and by the Labour Party. The American Eugenics Society initially gained some Catholic supporters, but Catholic support declined following the 1930 papal encyclical \"Casti connubii\". In this, Pope Pius XI explicitly condemned sterilization laws: \"Public magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects; therefore, where no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, they can never directly harm, or tamper with the integrity of the body, either for the reasons of eugenics or for any other reason.\"\nThe eugenicists' political successes in Germany and Scandinavia were not at all matched in such countries as Poland and Czechoslovakia, even though measures had been proposed there, largely because of the Catholic church's moderating influence.\nNazism and the decline of eugenics.\nThe reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when Ernst R\u00fcdin used eugenics as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of \"defectives\" that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power. Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families. This included racial groups (such as the Roma and Jews in Nazi Germany), the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, promiscuous women, and homosexuals as \"degenerate\" or \"unfit\". This led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, and mass murder. The Nazi policy of identifying German citizens deemed unfit and then systematically murdering them with poison gas, referred to as the \"Aktion T4\" campaign, paved the way for the Holocaust.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"All practices aimed at eugenics, any use of the human body or any of its parts for financial gain, and human cloning shall be prohibited.\"\nHungarian Constitution\nBy the end of World War II, many eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with Nazi Germany. H. G. Wells, who had called for \"the sterilization of failures\" in 1904, stated in his 1940 book \"The Rights of Man: Or What Are We Fighting For?\" that among the human rights, which he believed should be available to all people, was \"a prohibition on mutilation, sterilization, torture, and any bodily punishment\". After World War II, the practice of \"imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group\" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also proclaims \"the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons\".\nIn Singapore.\nLee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore, actively promoted eugenics as late as 1983. In 1984, Singapore began providing financial incentives to highly educated women to encourage them to have more children. For this purpose was introduced the \"Graduate Mother Scheme\" that incentivized graduate women to get married as much as the rest of their populace. The incentives were extremely unpopular and regarded as eugenic, and were seen as discriminatory towards Singapore's non-Chinese ethnic population. In 1985, the incentives were partly abandoned as ineffective, while the government matchmaking agency, the Social Development Network, remains active.\nModern eugenics.\nLiberal eugenics, also called new eugenics, aims to make genetic interventions morally acceptable by rejecting coercive state programs and relying on parental choice. Bioethicist Nicholas Agar, who coined the term, argues that the state should intervene only to forbid interventions that excessively limit a child\u2019s ability to shape their own future. Unlike \"authoritarian\" or \"old\" eugenics, liberal eugenics draws on modern scientific knowledge of genomics to enable informed choices aimed at improving well-being. Julien Savulescu further argues that some eugenic practices, like prenatal screening for Down syndrome, are already widely practiced, without being labeled \"eugenics\", as they are seen as enhancing freedom rather than restricting it.\nUC Berkeley sociologist Troy Duster argued that modern genetics is a \"back door to eugenics\". This view was shared by then-White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, Tania Simoncelli, who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at Hampshire College that advances in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) are moving society to a \"new era of eugenics\", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, \"where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products\". The United Nations' International Bioethics Committee also noted that while human genetic engineering should not be confused with the 20th century eugenics movements, it nonetheless challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want or cannot afford the technology.\nIn 2025, geneticist Peter Visscher published a paper in \"Nature,\" arguing genome editing of human embryos and germ cells may become feasible in the 21st century, and raising ethical considerations in the context of previous eugenics movements. A response argued that human embryo genetic editing is \"unsafe and unproven\". \"Nature\" also published an editorial, stating: \"The fear that polygenic gene editing could be used for eugenics looms large among them, and is, in part, why no country currently allows genome editing in a human embryo, even for single variants\".\nContested scientific status.\nOne general concern is that the reduced genetic diversity that may be a feature of long-term, species-wide eugenics plans could eventually result in inbreeding depression, increased spread of infectious disease, and decreased resilience to changes in the environment.\nArguments for scientific validity.\nIn his original lecture \"Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics\", Karl Pearson claimed that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. Anthropologist Ale\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka said in 1918 that \"[t]he growing science of eugenics will essentially become applied anthropology.\" The economist John Maynard Keynes was a lifelong proponent of eugenics and described it as a branch of sociology.\nIn a 2006 newspaper article, Richard Dawkins said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.\nObjections to scientific validity.\nAmanda Caleb, Professor of Medical Humanities at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, says \"Eugenic laws and policies are now understood as part of a specious devotion to a pseudoscience that actively dehumanizes to support political agendas and not true science or medicine.\"\nThe first major challenge to conventional eugenics based on genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He demonstrated the event of genetic mutation occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a fruit fly (\"Drosophila melanogaster\") with white eyes from a family with red eyes, demonstrating that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance. Morgan criticized the view that traits such as intelligence or criminality were hereditary, because these traits were subjective.\nPleiotropy occurs when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits, an example being phenylketonuria, which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect. Andrzej P\u0119kalski, from the University of Wroclaw, argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. P\u0119kalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with myopia from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two were associated.\nWhile the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point there is no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some conditions such as sickle-cell disease and cystic fibrosis respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to cholera when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual, so eliminating these genes is undesirable in places where such diseases are common.\nEdwin Black, journalist, historian, and author of \"War Against the Weak\", argues that eugenics is often deemed a pseudoscience because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry. This aspect of eugenics is often considered to be tainted with scientific racism and pseudoscience.\nContested ethical status.\nContemporary ethical opposition.\nIn a book directly addressed at socialist eugenicist J.B.S. Haldane and his once-influential \"Daedalus\", Bertrand Russell had one serious objection of his own: eugenic policies might simply end up being used to reproduce existing power relations \"rather than to make men happy.\"\nEnvironmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued against germinal choice technology and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging, maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to \"improve\" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, he argues, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using Ming China, Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish as examples.\nContemporary ethical advocacy.\nBioethicist Stephen Wilkinson has said that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral.\nHistorian Nathaniel C. Comfort has claimed that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making process from the state to patients and their families. \nIn their book published in 2000, \"From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice\", bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.\nIn popular culture.\nThe novel \"Brave New World\" by the English author Aldous Huxley (1931), is a dystopian social science fiction novel which is set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy.\nVarious works by the author Robert A. Heinlein mention the Howard Foundation, a group which attempts to improve human longevity through selective breeding.\nAmong Frank Herbert's other works, the \"Dune\" series, starting with the eponymous 1965 novel, describes selective breeding by a powerful sisterhood, the \"Bene Gesserit\", to produce a supernormal male being, the \"Kwisatz Haderach\".\nThe Star Trek franchise features a race of genetically engineered humans which is known as \"Augments\", the most notable of them being Khan Noonien Singh. These \"supermen\" were the cause of the Eugenics Wars, a dark period in Earth's fictional history, before they were deposed and exiled. Spin-offs like ' and ' present the Eugenics Wars as the main reason why genetic enhancement is illegal in the United Federation of Planets.\nNaoki Urasawa's manga Monster and its anime adaptation of the same name mention the \"The Eugenics Experiment\" conducted in the premises of 511 Kinderheim, a clandestine East German orphanage where the main antagonist Johan Liebert grew up into a psychopathic serial killer.\n&lt;section begin=Gattaca1997/&gt;The film \"Gattaca\" (1997) provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decide what people are capable of and their place in the world. The title alludes to the letters G, A, T and C, the four nucleobases of DNA, and depicts the possible consequences of genetic discrimination in the present societal framework. Relegated to the role of a cleaner owing to his genetically projected death at age 32 due to a heart condition (being told: \"The only way you'll see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it\"), the protagonist observes enhanced astronauts as they are demonstrating their superhuman athleticism. Although it was not a box office success, it was critically acclaimed and influenced the debate over human genetic engineering in the public consciousness. As to its accuracy, its production company, Sony Pictures, consulted with a gene therapy researcher and prominent critic of eugenics known to have stated that \"[w]e should not step over the line that delineates treatment from enhancement\", W. French Anderson, to ensure that the portrayal of science was realistic. Disputing their success in this mission, Philim Yam of \"Scientific American\" called the film \"science bashing\" and \"Nature's\" Kevin Davies called it a \"surprisingly pedestrian affair\", while molecular biologist Lee Silver described its extreme determinism as \"a straw man\".\nIn his 2018 book \"Blueprint\", the behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin writes that while \"Gattaca\" warned of the dangers of genetic information being used by a totalitarian state, genetic testing could also favor better meritocracy in democratic societies which already administer a variety of standardized tests to select people for education and employment. He suggests that polygenic scores might supplement testing in a manner that is essentially free of biases.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was conceived in the late\u201320th century as the digital version of, or counterpart to, mail (hence \"e- + mail\"). Email is a ubiquitous and very widely used communication medium; in current use, an email address (commonly \"local-part\" + @ + domain name) is often treated as a basic and necessary part of many processes in business, commerce, government, education, entertainment, and other spheres of daily life in most countries.\nEmail operates across computer networks, primarily the Internet, and also local area networks. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it.\nOriginally a text-only ASCII communications medium, Internet email was extended by MIME to carry text in expanded character sets and multimedia content such as images. International email, with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8, is standardized but not widely adopted.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"electronic mail\" has been in use with its modern meaning since 1975, and variations of the shorter \"E-mail\" have been in use since 1979:\nThe service is often simply referred to as \"mail\", and a single piece of electronic mail is called a \"message\". The conventions for fields within emails\u2014the \"To\", \"From\", \"CC\", \"BCC\" etc.\u2014began with RFC-680 in 1975.\nAn Internet email consists of an \"envelope\" and \"content\"; the content consists of a \"header\" and a \"body\".\nHistory.\nComputer-based messaging between users of the same system became possible after the advent of time-sharing in the early 1960s, with a notable implementation by MIT's CTSS project in 1965. Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. In 1971 the first ARPANET network mail was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the '@' symbol designating the user's system address. Over a series of RFCs, conventions were refined for sending mail messages over the File Transfer Protocol.\nProprietary electronic mail systems soon began to emerge. IBM, CompuServe and Xerox used in-house mail systems in the 1970s; CompuServe sold a commercial intraoffice mail product in 1978 to IBM and to Xerox from 1981. DEC's ALL-IN-1 and Hewlett-Packard's HPMAIL (later HP DeskManager) were released in 1982; development work on the former began in the late 1970s and the latter became the world's largest selling email system.\nThe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was implemented on the ARPANET in 1983. LAN email systems emerged in the mid-1980s. For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X.400 email system, part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995, a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard (see Protocol Wars).\nOperation.\nThe following is a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent (MUA) addressed to the email address of the recipient.\nIn addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:\nMany MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called \"open mail relays\". This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable. However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare, and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.\nEmail pre-dates instant messaging, and transmission favors reliability over speed, in order to be able to cope with unreliable network links and busy servers (more common in the early days of the Internet). Reasons for slower delivery include:\nMail can be queued and retried for up to five days before senders are notified of a permanent delivery failure. Messages are timestamped as they pass through each server, allowing for diagnosis of slow delivery, though analysis is complicated by time zones and computer clocks that are inaccurately set.\nEmail messages classified as spam by a spam filter may be sorted into a separate folder which the recipient must check manually, or may be dropped entirely.\nMessage format.\nThe basic Internet message format used for email is defined by , with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\" or \"MIME\". The extensions in International email apply only to email. RFC 5322 replaced RFC 2822 in 2008. Earlier, in 2001, RFC 2822 had in turn replaced RFC 822, which had been the standard for Internet email for decades. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET.\nInternet email messages consist of two sections, \"header\" and \"body\". These are known as \"content\". The header is structured into fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a signature block at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.\nMessage header.\nRFC 5322 specifies the syntax of the email header. Each email message has a header (the \"header section\" of the message, according to the specification), comprising a number of fields (\"header fields\"). Each field has a name (\"field name\" or \"header field name\"), followed by the separator character \":\", and a value (\"field body\" or \"header field body\").\nEach field name begins in the first character of a new line in the header section, and begins with a non-whitespace printable character. It ends with the separator character \":\". The separator is followed by the field value (the \"field body\"). The value can continue onto subsequent lines if those lines have space or tab as their first character. Field names and, without SMTPUTF8, field bodies are restricted to 7-bit ASCII characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words.\nHeader fields.\nEmail header fields can be multi-line, with each line recommended to be no more than 78 characters, although the limit is 998 characters. Header fields defined by RFC 5322 contain only US-ASCII characters; for encoding characters in other sets, a syntax specified in RFC 2047 may be used. In some examples, the IETF EAI working group defines some standards track extensions, replacing previous experimental extensions so UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters may be used within the header. In particular, this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters. Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products, and promoted by some government agents.\nThe message header must include at least the following fields:\nRFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA; it provides for https:// and https:// field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:\nThe \"To:\" field may be unrelated to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, SMTP, which may be extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field may not be the sender. Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages relayed. Data pertaining to the server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.\nSMTP defines the \"trace information\" of a message saved in the header using the following two fields:\nOther fields added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called \"trace fields\".\nMessage body.\nContent encoding.\nInternet email was designed for 7-bit ASCII. Most email software is 8-bit clean, but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: quoted printable for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data. The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many mail transport agents may not support them. In some countries, e-mail software violates by sending raw non-ASCII text and several encoding schemes co-exist; as a result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is a coincidence if the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international character sets, Unicode is growing in popularity.\nPlain text and HTML.\nMost modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user. HTML email messages often include an automatic-generated plain text copy for compatibility.\nAdvantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in block quotes, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as underlines and italics, and change font styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about web bugs, abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software.\nSome e-mail clients interpret the body as HTML even in the absence of a codice_1 header field; this may cause various problems.\nSome web-based mailing lists recommend all posts be made in plain text, with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons, and because they have a significant number of readers using text-based email clients such as Mutt.\nVarious informal conventions evolved for marking up plain text in email and usenet posts, which later led to the development of formal languages like setext \"(c. 1992)\" and many others, the most popular of them being markdown.\nSome Microsoft email clients may allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format (RTF), but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client.\nServers and client applications.\nMessages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it, and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender, indicating the problem.\nUsers can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP, or, as is more likely in a large corporate environment, with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise, Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers. Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called mail user agents (MUAs).\nWhen opening an email, it is marked as \"read\", which typically visibly distinguishes it from \"unread\" messages on clients' user interfaces. Email clients may allow hiding read emails from the inbox so the user can focus on the unread.\nMail can be stored on the client, on the server side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP, moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol.\nMany current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, that performs the same tasks. Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser, from any computer, rather than relying on a local email client.\nFilename extensions.\nUpon reception of email messages, email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system. Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the \"mbox\" format. The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions:\nUsed by many email clients including Novell GroupWise, Microsoft Outlook Express, Lotus notes, Windows Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.\nUsed by Apple Mail.\nUsed by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware.\nUsed by Opera Mail, KMail, and Apple Mail based on the mbox format.\nSome applications (like Apple Mail) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.\nURI scheme mailto.\nThe URI scheme, as registered with the IANA, defines the codice_6 scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the \"To:\" field. Many clients also support query string parameters for the other email fields, such as its subject line or carbon copy recipients.\nTypes.\nWeb-based email.\nMany email providers have a web-based email client. This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the web client, so it cannot be read without a current Internet connection.\nPOP3 email servers.\nThe Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the server. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's). POP3 allows downloading messages on a local computer and reading them even when offline.\nIMAP email servers.\nThe Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while traveling and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually, the mail is left in folders in the mail server.\nMAPI email servers.\nMessaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server\u2014and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server, Kerio Connect, Scalix, Zimbra, HP OpenMail, IBM Lotus Notes, Zarafa, and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.\nUses.\nBusiness and organizational use.\nEmail has been widely accepted by businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an 'e-revolution' in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet). A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.\nIt has some key benefits to business and other organizations, including:\n Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an in-person meeting, telephone call, or conference call can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.\n With real time communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows asynchrony: each participant may control their schedule independently. Batch processing of incoming emails can improve workflow compared to interrupting calls.\n Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or long distance telephone calls, telex or telegrams.\n Much faster than most of the alternatives.\n Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.\n As well pre-processing of customer's orders or addressing the person in charge can be realized by automated procedures.\nEmail marketing.\nEmail marketing via \"opt-in\" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information. Depending on the recipient's culture, email sent without permission\u2014such as an \"opt-in\"\u2014is likely to be viewed as unwelcome \"email spam\".\nPersonal use.\nPersonal computer.\nMany users access their personal emails from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment.\nMobile.\nEmail has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers. Mobile \"apps\" for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their homes. While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other devices to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. As of 2011[ [update]], there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.\nIndividuals often check emails on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages. It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone. It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on a smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries. For example, in comparison to 75% of those consumers in the US who used it, only 17% in India did.\nDeclining use among young people.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. For persons 12 to 17, the number was down 18 percent. Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media. Technology writer Matt Richtel said in \"The New York Times\" that email was like the VCR, vinyl records and film cameras\u2014no longer cool and something older people do.\nA 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email.\nIssues.\nAttachment size limitation.\nEmail messages may have one or more attachments, which are additional files that are appended to the email. Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents, PDF documents, and scanned images of paper documents. In principle, there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments. However, in practice, email clients, servers, and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files, or complete email \u2013 typically to 25MB or less. Furthermore, due to technical reasons, attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ from what the user sees, which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email. Where larger files need to be shared, various file hosting services are available and commonly used.\nInformation overload.\nThe ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and \"white collar\" employees has led to concerns that recipients face an \"information overload\" in dealing with increasing volumes of email. With the growth in mobile devices, by default employees may also receive work-related emails outside of their working day. This can lead to increased stress and decreased satisfaction with work. Some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect, as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity.\nSpam.\nEmail \"spam\" is unsolicited bulk email. The low cost of sending such email meant that, by 2003, up to 30% of total email traffic was spam, and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool. The US CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact, and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users, but the volume sent is still very high\u2014and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products, but malicious content or links. In September 2017, for example, the proportion of spam to legitimate email rose to 59.56%. The percentage of spam email in 2021 is estimated to be 85%.\nMalware.\nEmails are a major vector for the distribution of malware. This is often achieved by attaching malicious programs to the message and persuading potential victims to open the file. Types of malware distributed via email include computer worms and ransomware.\nEmail spoofing.\nEmail spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email that appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\nEmail bombing.\nEmail bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\nPrivacy concerns.\nToday it can be important to distinguish between the Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\nEmail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\nThere are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, Virtual Private Networks or the Tor network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG, PGP, SMEmail, or S/MIME can be used for end-to-end message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\nAdditionally, many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this. Finally, the attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer-to-peer filesharing. Attached files may contain trojans or viruses.\nLegal contracts.\nIt is possible for an exchange of emails to form a binding contract, so users must be careful about what they send through email correspondence. A signature block on an email may be interpreted as satisfying a signature requirement for a contract.\nFlaming.\nFlaming occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word \"incendiary\" to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.\nEmail bankruptcy.\nAlso known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.\nInternationalization.\nOriginally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based. MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets, but other headers and email addresses using UTF-8, while standardized have yet to be widely adopted.\nTracking of sent mail.\nThe original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications (delivery receipts) and Message Disposition Notifications (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production.\nMany ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\nIn the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns, and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML. Many mail clients now default to not showing \"web content\". Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9739", "revid": "1100608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9739", "title": "Emoticon", "text": "Pictorial representation of a facial expression\nAn emoticon (, , rarely , ), portmanteau of emotion and icon, is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters\u2014usually punctuation marks, numbers and letters\u2014to express a person's feelings, mood or reaction, without needing to describe it in detail.\nASCII emoticons can be traced back hundreds of years with various one-off uses. The protocol as a way to use them to communicate emotion in conversations is credited to computer scientist Scott Fahlman, who proposed what came to be known as \"smileys\"\u2014codice_1 and codice_2\u2014in a message on the bulletin board system (BBS) of Carnegie Mellon University in 1982. In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called \"kaomoji\", using Japanese's larger character sets. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986. They are also known as \"verticons\" (from \"vertical emoticon\") due to their readability without rotations. This is often seen as the 1st generation of emoticons.\nThe second generation began when computing became more common in the west, and people began replacing the previous ASCII art with actual emoticon icons or designs. One term used to define these types of emoticons compared to ASCII was portrait emoticons, as portrait emoticons are meant to resemble a face from the front like a portrait painting. The use of these emoticons became prevalent when SMS mobile text messaging and the Internet became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used in texting, Internet forums and emails. Over time, the designs became more elaborate and emoticons such as \ud83d\ude42 by Unicode became commonly referred to as Emoticons. They have played a significant role in communication as technology for communication purposes advanced and increased in use. Emoticons today convey non-verbal cues of language, such as facial expressions but also hand gestures, with The Smiley Company stating in interviews that emoticons now allow for greater emotional understanding in writing when emoticons are used. Emoticons were the precursors to modern emojis not just for facial expressions, but also replacing categories like weather, sports and animals.\nHistory.\nASCII art and faces (pre-1981).\nIn 1648, poet Robert Herrick wrote, \"Tumble me down, and I will sit Upon my ruins, (smiling yet:).\" Herrick's work predated any other recorded use of brackets as a smiling face by around 200 years. However, experts doubted the inclusion of the colon in the poem was deliberate and if it was meant to represent a smiling face. English professor Alan Jacobs argued that \"punctuation, in general, was unsettled in the seventeenth century ... Herrick was unlikely to have consistent punctuational practices himself, and even if he did he couldn't expect either his printers or his readers to share them.\" 17th century typography practice often placed colons and semicolons within parentheses, including 14 instances of \":)\" in Richard Baxter's 1653 \"Plain Scripture Proof of Infants Church-membership and Baptism\".\nPrecursors to modern emoticons have existed since the 19th century. The \"National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide\" in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in Morse code to express \"love and kisses\" (later reduced to the more formal \"best regards\"). \"Dodge's Manual\" in 1908 documented the reintroduction of \"love and kisses\" as the number 88. New Zealand academics Joan Gajadhar and John Green comment that both Morse code abbreviations are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as LOL.\nThe transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln's speeches in 1862 recorded the audience's reaction as: \"(applause and laughter ;)\". There has been some debate whether the glyph in Lincoln's speech was a typo, a legitimate punctuation construct or the first emoticon. Linguist Philip Seargeant argues that it was a simple typesetting error.\nBefore March 1881, the examples of \"typographical art\" appeared in at least three newspaper articles, including \"Kurjer warszawski\" (published in Warsaw) from March 5, 1881, using punctuation to represent the emotions of joy, melancholy, indifference and astonishment.\nIn a 1912 essay titled \"For Brevity and Clarity\", American author Ambrose Bierce suggested facetiously that a bracket could be used to represent a smiling face, proposing \"an improvement in punctuation\" with which writers could convey \"cachinnation\", loud or immoderate laughter: \"it is written thus\u00a0\u203f and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence\". In a 1936 \"Harvard Lampoon\" article, writer Alan Gregg proposed combining brackets with various other punctuation marks to represent various moods. Brackets were used for the sides of the mouth or cheeks, with other punctuation used between the brackets to display various emotions: (-) for a smile, (showing more \"teeth\") for laughter, (#) for a frown and (*) for a wink. An instance of text characters representing a sideways smiling and frowning face could be found in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" on March 10, 1953, promoting the film \"Lili\" starring Leslie Caron.\nThe September 1962 issue of \"MAD\" magazine included an article titled \"Typewri-toons\". The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to \"Royal Portable\", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger 'bust' than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h \"raising its hand\". A further example attributed to a \"Baltimore Sunday Sun\" columnist appeared in a 1967 article in \"Reader's Digest\", using a dash and right bracket to represent a tongue in one's cheek: \u2014). Prefiguring the modern \"smiley\" emoticon, writer Vladimir Nabokov told an interviewer from \"The New York Times\" in 1969, \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile\u2014some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.\"\nIn the 1970s, the PLATO IV computer system was launched. It was one of the first computers used throughout educational and professional institutions, but rarely used in a residential setting. On the computer system, a student at the University of Illinois developed pictograms that resembled different smiling faces. Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope stated this likely took place in 1972, and they claimed these to be the first emoticons.\nASCII emoticons - First generation (1982\u2013mid-1990s).\nIn 1982, Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Scott Fahlman is generally credited with the protocol of communicating and portraying emotion in written text. The use of ASCII symbols, a standard set of codes representing typographical marks, was essential to allow the symbols to be displayed on any computer. In Carnegie Mellon's bulletin board system, Fahlman proposed colon\u2013hyphen\u2013right bracket as a label for \"attempted humor\" to try to solve the difficulty of conveying humor or sarcasm in plain text. Fahlman sent the following message after an incident where a humorous warning about a mercury spill in an elevator was misunderstood as serious:\nWithin a few months, the smiley had spread to the ARPANET and Usenet. Other suggestions on the forum included an asterisk and an ampersand , the latter meant to represent a person doubled over in laughter, as well as a percent sign and a pound sign . Scott Fahlman suggested that not only could his emoticon communicate emotion, but also replace language. Since the 1990s, emoticons (colon, hyphen and bracket) have become integral to digital communications, and have inspired a variety of other emoticons, including the \"winking\" face using a semicolon , , a representation of the Face with Tears of Joy emoji and the acronym \"LOL\".\nIn 1996, The Smiley Company was established by Nicolas Loufrani and his father Franklin as a way of commercializing the smiley trademark. As part of this, The Smiley Dictionary website was launched and had a focus on ASCII emoticons, where available emoticons were catalogued. In total more than 500 were recorded. Notably this catalog removed the dash ( - ) for a nose and just had eyes and a mouth. The reasoning behind this was to make the ASCII emoticons more like the smiley, which resulted in :) instead of :-). The shortening or redesign of ASCII emoticons has not been covered in enough depth to know where the shorter versions originated, but The Smiley Dictionary could have as a minimum influenced the way ASCII emoticons are used today. Many other people did similar to Loufrani from 1995 onwards, including David Sanderson creating the book \"Smileys\" in 1997. James Marshall also hosted an online collection of ASCII emoticons that he completed in 2008. In 1998, the book Le Dico Smiley was also published.\nA researcher at Stanford University surveyed the emoticons used in four million Twitter messages and found that the smiling emoticon without a hyphen \"nose\" was much more common than the original version with the hyphen . Linguist Vyvyan Evans argues that this represents a shift in usage by younger users as a form of \"covert prestige\": rejecting a standard usage in order to demonstrate in-group membership.\nPortrait emoticons - Second generation (1990s\u2013present).\nNicolas Loufrani began to use the basic text designs and turned them into graphical representations, which are now known as portrait emoticons. His designs were registered at the United States Copyright Office in 1997 and appeared online as GIF files in 1998. For ASCII emoticons that did not exist to convert into graphical form, Loufrani also backward engineered new ASCII emoticons from the graphical versions he created. These were the first graphical representations of ASCII emoticons. Not only did these portrait emoticons portray existing and new ASCII emoticons, but also new features were added, such as hand gestures in the form of white gloves. These have since become standalone emojis along with other emojis that have replaced words in text communication. In 2001, he published his emoticon set online on the Smiley Dictionary. This dictionary included 640 different smiley icons and was published as a book called \"Dico Smileys\" in 2002. In 2017, British magazine \"The Drum\" referred to Loufrani as the \"godfather of the emoji\" for his work in the field.\nThe first American company to take notice of emojis was Google beginning in 2007. In August 2007, a team made up of Mark Davis and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer began petitioning the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) in an attempt to standardise the emoji. The UTC, having previously deemed emoji to be out of scope for Unicode, made the decision to broaden its scope to enable compatibility with the Japanese cellular carrier formats which were becoming more widespread. Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative effort from Apple Inc. shortly after, and their official UTC proposal came in January 2009 with 625 new emoji characters. Notably the move included a large set of emoticons, designed in an emoji-style but representing different emotions.\nIn recent times, emoticons, emojis and smileys have often become intertwined and confused. Emojis represent the largest set of graphical communication, but they often include portrait emoticons. In fact, the majority of the most commonly used Emoji are emoticons (because they represent an emotion). In 2024, the BBC reported that 2 of the top 3 emojis were portrait emoticons.\nOn September 23, 2021, it was announced that Scott Fahlman was holding an auction for the original emoticons he created in 1982. The auction was held in Dallas, United States, and sold the two designs as non-fungible tokens (NFT). The online auction ended later that month, with the originals selling for US$237,500. A year later in 2022, The Smiley Company auctioned off an NFT of 42 original graphical emoticon on World Emoji Day. The proceeds of the sale went to the company's non-profit arm, Smiley Movement.\nIn some programming languages, certain operators are known informally by their emoticon-like appearance. This includes the Spaceship operator codice_3 (a comparison), the Diamond operator codice_4 (for type hinting) and the Elvis operator codice_5 (a shortened ternary operator).\nStyles.\nWestern.\nUsually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by the nose and the mouth. It is commonly placed at the end of a sentence, replacing the full stop. The two-character version codice_6, which omits the nose, is very popular. The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but some can be rotated (making them tiny ambigrams). There are also some variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express another feeling. For example, codice_7 equals sad and codice_8 equals very sad. Weeping can be written as codice_9. A blush can be expressed as codice_10. Others include wink codice_11, a grin codice_12, codice_13 for tongue out, and smug codice_14; they can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it. codice_15, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also codice_16 for a heart and codice_17 for a broken heart. codice_18 is also sometimes used to depict shock. codice_19 is used to depict melancholy, disappointment or disapproval. codice_20 may be used to depict a neutral face.\nA broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; codice_21 and the addition of further \"D\" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement, e.g., codice_22. The \"3\" in codice_23 and codice_24 represents an animal's mouth. An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as codice_25. It has become more acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age, with younger people less likely to use a nose.\nSome variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. For example, the smiley codice_25 may occur in Scandinavia. Diacritical marks are sometimes used. The letters codice_27 and codice_28 can be seen as emoticons, as the upright versions of codice_18 (meaning that one is surprised) and codice_12 (meaning that one is very happy), respectively. In countries where the Cyrillic alphabet is used, the right parenthesis codice_31 is used as a smiley. Multiple parentheses codice_32 are used to express greater happiness, amusement or laughter. The colon is omitted due to being in a lesser-known position on the \u0419\u0426\u0423\u041a\u0415\u041d keyboard layout. The 'shrug' emoticon, codice_33, uses the glyph \u30c4 from the Japanese katakana writing system.\nKaomoji (Japan ASCII movement).\nKaomoji are often seen as the Japanese development of emoticons that is separate to the Scott Fahlman movement, which started in 1982. In 1986, a designer began to use brackets and other ASCII text characters to form faces. Over time, they became more often differentiated from each other, although both use ASCII characters. However, more westernised Kaomojis have dropped the brackets, such as codice_34, codice_35 and codice_36, popularised in internet subcultures such as the anime and furry communities.\n2channel.\nUsers of the Japanese discussion board 2channel, in particular, have developed a variety emoticons using characters from various scripts, such as Kannada, as in codice_37 (for a look of disapproval, disbelief or confusion). Similarly, the letter \u0cb0\u0cc3 was used in emoticons to represent a monocle and \u0ca5 to represent a tearing eye. They were picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after. Some have become characters in their own right like Mon\u0101.\nKorean.\nIn South Korea, emoticons use Korean Hangul letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean jamo (letters) instead of other characters.\nThe consonant jamos codice_38, codice_39 or codice_40 can be used as the mouth or nose component and codice_41, codice_42 or codice_43 for the eyes. Using quotation marks codice_44 and apostrophes codice_45 are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as \u315c and \u3160 can depict a crying face. Example: codice_46, (same function as T in Western style). Sometimes \u3161 (not an em-dash \"\u2014\", but a vowel jamo), a comma (codice_47) or an underscore (codice_48) is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in codice_49, codice_50 and codice_51. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons can mean sweating, examples of it are codice_52, codice_53 and codice_54.\nChinese ideographic.\nThe character \u56e7 (U+56E7), which means 'bright', may be combined with the posture emoticon Orz, such as \u56e7rz. The character existed in Oracle bone script but was rarely used until its use as an emoticon, documented as early as January 20, 2005.\nOther variants of \u56e7 include \u5d2e (king \u56e7), \u8394 (queen \u56e7), \u5546 (\u56e7 with a hat), \u56e7\u8208 (turtle) and \u5363 (\"Bomberman\"). The character \u69d1 (U+69D1), a variant of \u6885 'plum', is used to represent a double of \u5446 'dull' or further magnitude of dullness. In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of \u69d1) might be duplicated to express emphasis.\nPosture emoticons.\nOrz.\nOrz (other forms include: Or2, on_, OTZ, OTL, STO, JTO, _no, _\u5182\u25cb and \u56e7\u200brz) is an emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person (the Japanese version of which is called \"dogeza\"), with the \"o\" being the head, the \"r\" being the arms and part of the body, and the \"z\" being part of the body and the legs. This stick figure can represent respect or \"kowtowing\", but commonly appears along a range of responses, including \"frustration, despair, sarcasm, or grudging respect\".\nIt was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, a Japanese personal website. At the \"Techside FAQ Forum\" (), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing \"_|\uffe3|\u25cb\" to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the concept of nice guys.\no7.\no7, or O7, is an emoticon that depicts a person saluting, with the \"o\" being the head and the \"7\" being its arm.\nMultimedia variations.\nA portmanteau of \"emotion\" and \"sound\", an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or email message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext. Some services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and music players in an Adobe Flash-based widget. In 2004, the Trillian chat application introduced a feature called \"emotiblips\", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients \"as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon\".\nIn 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the \"emoticlip\" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show \"The Hills\". The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley &amp; Montgomery advertising firm, which wrote that they hoped it would be widely adopted as \"greeting cards that just happen to be selling something\".\nIntellectual property rights.\nIn 2000, Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the \"frowny\" emoticon codice_2 when used on \"greeting cards, posters and art prints\". In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the company received protests when its mock release was posted on technology news website Slashdot.\nA number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have been issued as US patents. US 6987991, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop-down menu. The stated advantage was that it eases entering emoticons.\nThe emoticon codice_1 was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM). In Finland, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked, thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons codice_1, codice_25, codice_59, codice_6 and codice_7. In 2005, a Russian court rejected a legal claim against Siemens by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the codice_62 emoticon. In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the codice_62 emoticon. A license would not \"cost that much\u2014tens of thousands of dollars\" for companies but would be free of charge for individuals.\nUnicode.\nA different, but related, use of the term \"emoticon\" is found in the Unicode Standard, referring to a subset of emoji that display facial expressions. The standard explains this usage with reference to existing systems, which provided functionality for substituting certain textual emoticons with images or emoji of the expressions in question.\nSome smiley faces were present in Unicode since 1.1, including a white frowning face, a white smiling face and a black smiling face (\"black\" refers to a glyph which is filled, \"white\" refers to a glyph which is unfilled).\nThe Emoticons block was introduced in Unicode Standard version 6.0 (published in October 2010) and extended by 7.0. It covers Unicode range from U+1F600 to U+1F64F fully.\nAfter that block had been filled, Unicode 8.0 (2015), 9.0 (2016) and 10.0 (2017) added additional emoticons in the range from U+1F910 to U+1F9FF. Currently, U+1F90C\u00a0\u2013 U+1F90F, U+1F93F, U+1F94D\u00a0\u2013 U+1F94F, U+1F96C\u00a0\u2013 U+1F97F, U+1F998\u00a0\u2013 U+1F9CF (excluding U+1F9C0 which contains the \ud83e\uddc0 emoji) and U+1F9E7\u00a0\u2013 U+1F9FF do not contain any emoticons since Unicode 10.0.\nFor historic and compatibility reasons, some other heads and figures, which mostly represent different aspects like genders, activities, and professions instead of emotions, are also found in Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (especially U+1F466\u00a0\u2013 U+1F487) and Transport and Map Symbols. Body parts, mostly hands, are also encoded in the Dingbat and Miscellaneous Symbols blocks.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The same principle has been applied in other fields where a particular individual has collaborated with a large and broad number of peers.\nOverview.\nPaul Erd\u0151s (1913\u20131996) was an influential Hungarian mathematician who, in the latter part of his life, spent a great deal of time writing papers with a large number of colleagues\u2014more than 500\u2014working on solutions to outstanding mathematical problems. He published more papers during his lifetime (at least 1,525) than any other mathematician in history. (Leonhard Euler published more total pages of mathematics but fewer separate papers: about 800.) Erd\u0151s spent most of his career with no permanent home or job. He traveled with everything he owned in two suitcases, and would visit mathematicians with whom he wanted to collaborate, often unexpectedly, and expect to stay with them.\nThe idea of the Erd\u0151s number was originally created by the mathematician's friends as a tribute to his enormous output. Later it gained prominence as a tool to study how mathematicians cooperate to find answers to unsolved problems. Several projects are devoted to studying connectivity among researchers, using the Erd\u0151s number as a proxy. For example, Erd\u0151s collaboration graphs can tell us how authors cluster, how the number of co-authors per paper evolves over time, or how new theories propagate.\nSeveral studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erd\u0151s numbers. The median Erd\u0151s number of Fields Medalists is 3. Only 7,097 (about 5% of mathematicians with a collaboration path) have an Erd\u0151s number of 2 or lower. As time passes, the lowest Erd\u0151s number that can still be achieved will necessarily increase, as mathematicians with low Erd\u0151s numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. Still, historical figures can have low Erd\u0151s numbers. For example, renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan has an Erd\u0151s number of only 3 (through G. H. Hardy, Erd\u0151s number 2), even though Paul Erd\u0151s was only 7 years old when Ramanujan died.\nDefinition and application in mathematics.\nTo be assigned an Erd\u0151s number, someone must be a coauthor of a research paper with another person who has a finite Erd\u0151s number. Paul Erd\u0151s himself is assigned an Erd\u0151s number of zero. A certain author's Erd\u0151s number is one greater than the lowest Erd\u0151s number of any of their collaborators; for example, an author who has coauthored a publication with Erd\u0151s would have an Erd\u0151s number of 1. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the collaboration distance between two mathematical authors listed in the \"Mathematical Reviews\" catalogue.\nErd\u0151s wrote around 1,500 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly co-written. He had 509 direct collaborators; these are the people with Erd\u0151s number 1. The people who have collaborated with them (but not with Erd\u0151s himself) have an Erd\u0151s number of 2 (12,600 people as of 7 August 2020), those who have collaborated with people who have an Erd\u0151s number of 2 (but not with Erd\u0151s or anyone with an Erd\u0151s number of 1) have an Erd\u0151s number of 3, and so forth. A person with no such coauthorship chain connecting to Erd\u0151s has an Erd\u0151s number of infinity (or an undefined one). Since the death of Paul Erd\u0151s, the lowest Erd\u0151s number that a new researcher can obtain is 2.\nThere is room for ambiguity over what constitutes a link between two authors. The American Mathematical Society collaboration distance calculator uses data from \"Mathematical Reviews\", which includes most mathematics journals but covers other subjects only in a limited way, and which also includes some non-research publications. The Erd\u0151s Number Project web site says:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; It also says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... Our criterion for inclusion of an edge between vertices u and v is some research collaboration between them resulting in a published work. Any number of additional co-authors is permitted...\nbut excludes non-research publications such as elementary textbooks, joint editorships, obituaries, and the like. The \"Erd\u0151s number of the second kind\" restricts assignment of Erd\u0151s numbers to papers with only two collaborators.\nThe Erd\u0151s number was most likely first defined in print by Casper Goffman, an analyst whose own Erd\u0151s number is 2. Goffman published his observations about Erd\u0151s' prolific collaboration in a 1969 article entitled \"And what is your Erd\u0151s number?\" See also some comments in an obituary by Michael Golomb.\nThe median Erd\u0151s number among Fields medalists is as low as 3. Fields medalists with Erd\u0151s number 2 include Atle Selberg, Kunihiko Kodaira, Klaus Roth, Alan Baker, Enrico Bombieri, David Mumford, Charles Fefferman, William Thurston, Shing-Tung Yau, Jean Bourgain, Richard Borcherds, Manjul Bhargava, Jean-Pierre Serre and Terence Tao. There are no Fields medalists with Erd\u0151s number 1; however, Endre Szemer\u00e9di is an Abel Prize Laureate with Erd\u0151s number 1.\nMost frequent Erd\u0151s collaborators.\nWhile Erd\u0151s collaborated with hundreds of co-authors, there were some individuals with whom he co-authored dozens of papers. This is a list of the ten persons who most frequently co-authored with Erd\u0151s and their number of papers co-authored with Erd\u0151s, i.e., their number of collaborations.\nRelated fields.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], all Fields medalists have a finite Erd\u0151s number, with values that range between 2 and 6, and a median of 3. In contrast, the median Erd\u0151s number across all mathematicians (with a finite Erd\u0151s number) is 5, with an extreme value of 13. The table below summarizes the Erd\u0151s number statistics for Nobel prize laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, and Economics. The first column counts the number of laureates. The second column counts the number of winners with a finite Erd\u0151s number. The third column is the percentage of winners with a finite Erd\u0151s number. The remaining columns report the minimum, maximum, average, and median Erd\u0151s numbers among those laureates.\nPhysics.\nAmong the Nobel Prize laureates in Physics, Albert Einstein and Sheldon Glashow have an Erd\u0151s number of 2. Nobel Laureates with an Erd\u0151s number of 3 include Enrico Fermi, Otto Stern, Wolfgang Pauli, Max Born, Willis E. Lamb, Eugene Wigner, Richard P. Feynman, Hans A. Bethe, Murray Gell-Mann, Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg, Norman F. Ramsey, Frank Wilczek, David Wineland, and Giorgio Parisi. Fields Medal-winning physicist Ed Witten has an Erd\u0151s number of 3.\nBiology.\nSeveral prolific scientists working in Genetics, Biomedical Engineering, Mathematical, and Computational Biology have an Erd\u0151s number of 2. Among them are Zvia Agur, Joel E. Cohen, Eugene Koonin, Bruce Kristal, Eric Lander, Lior Pachter and Temple F. Smith. Through collaboratons with these authors there are many biologists with an Erd\u0151s number of 3 and it has been argued that almost every author on a paper in the biological sciences can be linked to Erd\u00f6s.\nFinance and economics.\nThere are at least two winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics with an Erd\u0151s number of 2: Harry M. Markowitz (1990) and Leonid Kantorovich (1975). Other financial mathematicians with Erd\u0151s number of 2 include David Donoho, Marc Yor, Henry McKean, Daniel Stroock, and Joseph Keller.\nNobel Prize laureates in Economics with an Erd\u0151s number of 3 include Kenneth J. Arrow (1972), Milton Friedman (1976), Herbert A. Simon (1978), Gerard Debreu (1983), John Forbes Nash, Jr. (1994), James Mirrlees (1996), Daniel McFadden (2000), Daniel Kahneman (2002), Robert J. Aumann (2005), Leonid Hurwicz (2007), Roger Myerson (2007), Alvin E. Roth (2012), and Lloyd S. Shapley (2012) and Jean Tirole (2014).\nSome investment firms have been founded by mathematicians with low Erd\u0151s numbers, among them James B. Ax of Axcom Technologies, and James H. Simons of Renaissance Technologies, both with an Erd\u0151s number of 3.\nPhilosophy.\nSince the more formal versions of philosophy share reasoning with the basics of mathematics, these fields overlap considerably, and Erd\u0151s numbers are available for many philosophers. Philosophers John P. Burgess and Brian Skyrms have an Erd\u0151s number of 2. Jon Barwise and Joel David Hamkins, both with Erd\u0151s number 2, have also contributed extensively to philosophy, but are primarily described as mathematicians.\nLaw.\nJudge Richard Posner, having coauthored with Alvin E. Roth, has an Erd\u0151s number of at most 4. Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a politician, philosopher, and legal theorist who teaches at Harvard Law School, has an Erd\u0151s number of at most 4, having coauthored with Lee Smolin.\nPolitics.\nAngela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021, has an Erd\u0151s number of at most 5.\nEngineering.\nSome fields of engineering, in particular communication theory and cryptography, make direct use of the discrete mathematics championed by Erd\u0151s. It is therefore not surprising that practitioners in these fields have low Erd\u0151s numbers. For example, Robert McEliece, a professor of electrical engineering at Caltech, had an Erd\u0151s number of 1, having collaborated with Erd\u0151s himself. Cryptographers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, inventors of the RSA cryptosystem, all have Erd\u0151s number 2.\nLinguistics.\nThe Romanian mathematician and computational linguist Solomon Marcus had an Erd\u0151s number of 1 for a paper in \"Acta Mathematica Hungarica\" that he co-authored with Erd\u0151s in 1957.\nImpact.\nErd\u0151s numbers have been a part of the folklore of mathematicians throughout the world for many years. Among all working mathematicians at the turn of the millennium who have a finite Erd\u0151s number, the numbers range up to 15, the median is 5, and the mean is 4.65; almost everyone with a finite Erd\u0151s number has a number less than 8.\nDue to the very high frequency of interdisciplinary collaboration in science today, very large numbers of non-mathematicians in many other fields of science also have finite Erd\u0151s numbers. For example, political scientist Steven Brams has an Erd\u0151s number of 2. In biomedical research, it is common for statisticians to be among the authors of publications, and many statisticians can be linked to Erd\u0151s via Persi Diaconis or Paul Deheuvels, who have Erd\u0151s numbers of 1, or John Tukey, who has an Erd\u0151s number of 2. Similarly, the prominent geneticist Eric Lander and the mathematician Daniel Kleitman have collaborated on papers, and since Kleitman has an Erd\u0151s number of 1, a large fraction of the genetics and genomics community can be linked via Lander and his numerous collaborators. Similarly, collaboration with Gustavus Simmons opened the door for \nErd\u0151s numbers within the cryptographic research community, and many linguists have finite Erd\u0151s numbers, many due to chains of collaboration with such notable scholars as Noam Chomsky (Erd\u0151s number 4), William Labov (3), Mark Liberman (3), Geoffrey Pullum (3), or Ivan Sag (4). There are also connections with arts fields.\nAccording to Alex Lopez-Ortiz, all the Fields and Nevanlinna Prize winners during the three cycles in 1986 to 1994 have Erd\u0151s numbers of at most 9.\nEarlier mathematicians published fewer papers than modern ones, and more rarely published jointly written papers. The earliest person known to have a finite Erd\u0151s number is either Antoine Lavoisier (born 1743, Erd\u0151s number 13), Richard Dedekind (born 1831, Erd\u0151s number 7), or Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (born 1849, Erd\u0151s number 3), depending on the standard of publication eligibility.\nMartin Tompa proposed a directed graph version of the Erd\u0151s number problem, by orienting edges of the collaboration graph from the alphabetically earlier author to the alphabetically later author and defining the \"monotone Erd\u0151s number\" of an author to be the length of a longest path from Erd\u0151s to the author in this directed graph. He finds a path of this type of length 12.\nAlso, Michael Barr suggests \"rational Erd\u0151s numbers\", generalizing the idea that a person who has written \"p\" joint papers with Erd\u0151s should be assigned Erd\u0151s number 1/\"p\". From the collaboration multigraph of the second kind (although he also has a way to deal with the case of the first kind)\u2014with one edge between two mathematicians for \"each\" joint paper they have produced\u2014form an electrical network with a one-ohm resistor on each edge. The total resistance between two nodes tells how \"close\" these two nodes are.\nIt has been argued that \"for an individual researcher, a measure such as Erd\u0151s number captures the structural properties of [the] network whereas the \"h\"-index captures the citation impact of the publications,\" and that \"One can be easily convinced that ranking in coauthorship networks should take into account both measures to generate a realistic and acceptable ranking.\"\nIn 2004 William Tozier, a mathematician with an Erd\u0151s number of 4 auctioned off a co-authorship on eBay, hence providing the buyer with an Erd\u0151s number of 5. The winning bid of $1031 was posted by a Spanish mathematician, who refused to pay and only placed the bid to stop what he considered a mockery.\nVariations.\nA number of variations on the concept have been proposed to apply to other fields, notably the Bacon number (as in the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon), connecting actors to the actor Kevin Bacon by a chain of joint appearances in films. It was created in 1994, 25 years after Goffman's article on the Erd\u0151s number.\nA small number of people are connected to both Erd\u0151s and Bacon and thus have an Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon number, which combines the two numbers by taking their sum. One example is the actress-mathematician Danica McKellar, best known for playing Winnie Cooper on the TV series \"The Wonder Years\". \nHer Erd\u0151s number is 4, and her Bacon number is 2.\nFurther extension is possible. For example, the \"Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon\u2013Sabbath number\" is the sum of the Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon number and the collaborative distance to the band Black Sabbath in terms of singing in public. Physicist Stephen Hawking had an Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon\u2013Sabbath number of 8, and actress Natalie Portman has one of 11 (her Erd\u0151s number is 5).\nIn chess, the Morphy number describes a player's connection to Paul Morphy, widely considered the greatest chess player of his time and an unofficial World Chess Champion.\nIn go, the Shusaku number describes a player's connection to Hon'inb\u014d Sh\u016bsaku, the strongest player of his time.\nIn video games, the Ryu number describes a video game character's connection to the Street Fighter character Ryu.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9750", "revid": "6209078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9750", "title": "School voucher", "text": "Government funding of non-public schools\nA school voucher, also called an education voucher, is a certificate of government funding for students at a chosen school. Funding is usually for a particular year, term, or semester. Depending on jurisdiction, a voucher may be used for home schooling expenses or exclusively for private schools, charter schools, or publicly-funded schools.\nMilton Friedman argued for the modern economic concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that free market competition among private schools would improve schools, cost less and yield superior educational outcomes than publicly-funded schools. Proponents of school vouchers, including Friedrich Hayek, also argue that voucher systems provide consumer sovereignty, thus increasing school performance and accountability. Friedman's argument has nonetheless been criticised for promoting cream-skimming among students, the random nature of lottery-style voucher allocation systems, the inherent inequality in some students having to attend less preferred schools, and the diversion of public funding away from public education.\nResearch on the empirical effects of school vouchers has produced mixed results. On one hand, some studies find that, after adjusting for demographic factors, private and public schools performed similarly, and that voucher programs can contribute to segregation. Other studies show that increased competition indeed leads to better educational outcomes across the board and actually reduces racial and socio-economic division.\nDefinition.\nSchool vouchers are often distributed to enable students to attend private schools, charter schools, and publicly-funded schools. Educational subsidies can also take the form of comprise government-created bank accounts, whose funds are specifically used for educational purposes, and education tax credits.\nGovernment intervention in education typically takes two forms. The first approach is broad, comprising the institution of charter schools, magnet schools, or for-profit schools, and increasing competition. The second approach is individually focused and comprises providing subsidies or loans for individuals.\nEconomics.\nMilton Friedman argued for the modern economic concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that free market competition among private schools would improve schools, cost less and yield superior educational outcomes than publicly-funded schools. Further, proponents of Friedman's theory, including Friedrich Hayek, argue that voucher systems provide consumer sovereignty, thus increasing school performance and accountability. The free-market theory of school vouchers has been analogised to the competition between universities and the provision of government aid or scholarships for university students, which has arguably had a positive impact on research and teaching in higher education. Major proponents of Friedman's theory include Friedman's own non-governmental organisation EdChoice and the Sutherland Institute.\nFriedman's reasoning in favor of vouchers gained additional attention in 1980 with the broadcast of his ten-part television series \"Free to Choose\" and the publication of its companion book of the same name. Friedman's argument has been criticised for its implicit assumption that the prices of private schools are competitive owing to differences in teaching and administration, rather than its cream-skimming approach to selecting only students who come from wealthy or otherwise advantaged backgrounds.\nIn contrast, the United States's National Education Association has criticised the random nature of lottery-style voucher allocation systems, the inherent inequality in some students having to attend less preferred and less competitive schools, and the diversion of public funding away from public education, which may in turn weaken public schooling standards.\nA random survey of 210 economists of the American Economic Association, found that over two-thirds support giving parents educational vouchers that can be used at government-operated or privately operated schools, particularly for low-income students or students in poorly performing schools.\nBackground.\nGovernments have multiple incentives for intervention in and improvement of public education, including human capital accumulation, the promotion of societal values and norms, and positive externalities such as the reduction of crime and economic development. Families face a bundle of consumption choices that determine how much they will spend on education and private consumption, with the corresponding indifference curve representing how much education an individual will want to consume versus how much private consumption an individual will want to consume. Vouchers are thus typically instituted for two broad economic reasons: to enable consumer choice; and to increase market competition among schools.\nEmpirical effects.\nResearch has produced mixed results. A 2017 review of the economics literature on school vouchers concluded that \"the evidence to date is not sufficient to warrant recommending that vouchers be adopted on a widespread basis; however, multiple positive findings support continued exploration\". Some studies, including a 2006 United States Department of Education report, conclude that, after adjusting for demographic factors, private and public schools performed similarly. At the same time, a 2021 meta-analysis found \"moderate evidence of positive achievement impacts of private school vouchers, with substantial effect heterogeneity across programs and outcome years\" as well as evidence suggesting that \"voucher interventions may be cost-effective even for null achievement impacts.\"\nOther studies suggest that voucher programs can contribute to segregation and lack accountability for taxpayer funds. Nonetheless, other research has also shown that under certain circumstances, income and racial segregation can be reduced indirectly by increasing school choice. Additionally, it is possible that private school vouchers may offset the overall budget by way of public school cost savings from lower enrollments. Resulting job losses in the public sector may also, potentially, be offset by the increased demand for jobs in the private sector.\nA 2018 study by Abdulkadiro\u011flu et al. found that disadvantaged students who won a lottery to get vouchers to attend private schools had worse education outcomes than disadvantaged students who did not win vouchers.\nColombia.\nStudies of Colombia's PACES voucher program indicate the program increased private school attendance and academic outcomes. After three years, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to attend private schools, completed 0.1 more years of schooling on average, and were 10 percentage points more likely to complete eighth grade. Test scores for voucher recipients were 0.2 standard deviations higher than non-recipients, with stronger effects in mathematics for boys compared to girls. The program had no significant effect on dropout rates but was associated with reduced teenage employment and lower likelihood of early marriage or cohabitation among lottery winners.\nSweden.\nA 2004 study found that competition from independent schools improved public school performance. However, Sweden's PISA rankings declined in the 2000s, though some attribute this to factors unrelated to the voucher system. A 2015 study reported that a higher share of independent school students correlated with improved educational outcomes, largely due to increased competition. According to Susanne Wiborg, Sweden's voucher system introduced in 1992 has \"augmented social and ethnic segregation, particularly in relation to schools in deprived areas\".\nUnited States.\nA 2003 study by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research concludes that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements, including in academic test scores, than similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Caroline Hoxby studied the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools, finding that public schools forced to compete made greater test-score gains than schools not faced with such competition, and that the so-called effect of cream skimming did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined.\nA CATO Institute study of public and private school per pupil spending in Phoenix, Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, New York City, and Houston found that public schools spend 93% more than the estimated median private schools.\nA 2013 study of Milwaukee's Parental Choice Program, which funds vouchers for both religious and nonreligious private institutions, posited that the use of vouchers increased the probability that a student would graduate from high school, go to college, and stay in college. A 2015 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that participation in Louisiana's voucher program \"substantially reduces academic achievement\", which may reflect the poor quality of private schools in the program. A 2014 analysis of the competitive effects of school vouchers in Florida suggests that more competition improves performance in regular public schools.\nHistorically, data suggests that voucher programs have been used to further segregate Americans. Further, some data has shown that the effects of voucher programs such as the New York City School Choice Scholarship Program, are marginal when it comes to increasing student achievement.\nHistory.\nWhen France lost the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871) many blamed the loss on its inferior military education system. Following this defeat, the French Assembly proposed a voucher that they hoped would improve schools by allowing students to seek out the best. This proposal never moved forward due to the reluctance of the French to subsidize religious education. Despite its failure, this proposal closely resembles voucher systems proposed or used in many modern countries.\nThe oldest extant school voucher programs in the United States are the Town Tuitioning programs in Vermont and Maine, respectively beginning in 1869 and 1873. Because some towns in these states operate neither local high schools nor elementary schools, vouchers provide for students in these towns to attend either public schools in other towns or secular private schools.\nA system of educational vouchers was introduced in the Netherlands in 1917. , more than 70% of pupils attend privately run but publicly funded schools, mostly split along denominational lines.\nIn some Southern states during the 1960s, school vouchers were used as a way to perpetuate segregation. In a few instances, public schools were closed outright and vouchers were issued to parents. Many of the vouchers were only good at new, private and segregated schools, known as segregation academies.\nImplementations.\nColombia.\nThe Colombian government launched the PACES voucher program in 1991 to support low-income secondary school students in neighborhoods within the two lowest socioeconomic strata. From 1991 to 1997, the program distributed 125,000 vouchers, valued at approximately US$190 in 1998, though students typically incurred additional costs averaging US$340 for private school fees. Students were selected by lottery, with vouchers renewable annually based on satisfactory academic progress.\nChile.\nIn 1981, Chile introduced a universal school voucher system for elementary and secondary students, leading to the establishment of over 1,000 private schools and a 20\u201340% increase in private school enrollment by 1998, exceeding 50% in some urban areas. Urban private school enrollment grew 11% faster than in rural areas from 1981 to 1988. Unlike public schools, which accepted all students, private voucher schools could be selective, and voucher values were not income-based. Low international test scores prompted major educational reforms in 2008, including changes to the voucher system.\nThe 2008 Preferential School Subsidy Law adjusted vouchers to account for family income, providing 50% higher vouchers to students from the lowest 40% income bracket, deemed \"priority students.\" Schools with more priority students received additional per-student bonuses. The program initially covered preschool through fourth grade, expanding annually. Most public schools and two-thirds of private subsidized elementary schools participated in 2008. Participating schools could not charge fees to priority students, select students based on academic ability, or expel them for academic reasons, and they were required to join an accountability system monitoring financial and academic performance.\nEurope.\nIn most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g., Belgium or France), parents are free to choose which school their child attends.\nFrance.\nIn France, parents can choose between public and private schools, with about 20% of students attending private institutions. Most private schools operate under contract with the government, which covers teachers' salaries and requires adherence to the national curriculum. These schools charge low fees for other costs. Non-contracted private schools have more curricular flexibility but charge higher fees, as they fund teacher salaries independently. Homeschooling is permitted but tightly regulated, with restrictions tightened in 2022 to limit it to specific cases, such as for students with disabilities or those in nomadic communities.\nIreland.\nIn Ireland, most schools are state-aided Catholic parish schools, funded through government grants and per-student fees, regardless of whether schools charge additional fees. A minority of fee-paying schools receive state aid, prompting criticism for perceived unfair advantages. Parents and students may choose their schools, and schools failing to attract students risk losing funding and teaching posts. Multi-denominational schools, organized by parents as non-profit entities, have grown in popularity. Free third-level education, introduced in 1995, increased overall university attendance, particularly among lower-income students, though debates persist about reintroducing fees. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children.\nSweden.\nSweden introduced a school vouchers system (\"skolpeng\") in 1992, allowing parents to choose between public and privately-run independent schools (\"frist\u00e5ende skolor\"). Both school types receive public funding from the local municipality solely based on student enrollment. By 2008, over 10% of students attended independent schools, with enrollment rising rapidly. \nHong Kong.\nIn 2007, Hong Kong implemented a voucher system for children aged three to six attending non-profit kindergartens, providing HK$13,000 per student annually. Of this, HK$10,000 subsidizes school fees, and HK$3,000 supports teacher training. Vouchers are restricted to non-profit kindergartens with annual fees below HK$24,000. The program was later extended to children who were enrolled in for-profit kindergartens before September 2007, with subsidies up to HK$30,000 offered to for-profit kindergartens converting to non-profit status.\nMilton Friedman criticised the system, arguing that the point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive marketplace, and thus should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens.\nPhilippines.\nIn 2015, the Philippines introduced a senior high school voucher program that provides qualifications for students in grades 11-12.\nUnited States.\nIn the 1980s, the Reagan administration promoted school vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in its initial education reform proposals leading up to the No Child Left Behind Act. As of December 2016, 14 states and the District of Columbia had school voucher programs. Including scholarship tax credits and education savings accounts, 27 states plus the District of Columbia had private school choice programs, most of them targeting disadvantaged students. By 2014, around 250,000 students were enrolled in voucher or tax-credit scholarship programs, compared with 55\u00a0million in public schools.\n, the Indiana Choice Scholarships program is the largest school voucher program in the United States.\nSupporters of voucher programs include New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford, billionaire and American philanthropist John T. Walton, Former mayor of Baltimore Kurt L. Schmoke, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and John McCain. \nLegal issues.\nSchool vouchers have also been challenged on legal grounds. In \"Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\" (2002), the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision, held that Ohio's voucher plan did not violate the Establishment Clause merely by giving money to parents who choose to send their child to a religious school. By contrast, the Florida Supreme Court struck down that state's Opportunity Scholarship Program in 2006, ruling that it violated constitutional provisions requiring a uniform system of public schools. In 2013, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that Louisiana's use of money earmarked, via the Louisiana Constitution, for public schools to fund Louisiana's voucher program was unconstitutional.\nAdministrative issues.\nPeople who can benefit from vouchers may not know it. In April 2012, a bill passed in Louisiana that made vouchers available to low-income families whose children attended poorly ranked schools. Of the estimated 380,000 eligible students during the school year when the bill was passed, only 5,000 students knew about, applied for, and accepted the vouchers.\nVoucher programs often may not be implemented with the necessary safeguards that prevent institutions from discriminating against marginalized communities. In the United States, as of 2016, there are currently no state laws that require voucher programs to not discriminate against marginalized communities.\nSome school voucher systems may also lack accountability to taxpayers. At the same time, tax credit systems relating to donations to voucher-distributing non-governmental organisations may be used as a means to reduce taxes without substantially benefitting low-income students.\nTrump's 2018 budget.\nPresident Donald Trump proposed a 2018 budget that included $250\u00a0million for voucher initiatives, state-funded programs that pay for students to go to private school.\nTeaching creationism instead of evolution.\nSome private religious schools in voucher programs teach creationism instead of the theory of evolution. Over 300 schools in the U.S. have been documented as teaching creationism and receiving taxpayer money. A strict definition of state-funded religious education was narrowly deemed constitutional in \"Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\" (2002). At least 35 states have passed various Blaine Amendments restricting or prohibiting public funding of religious education. However, \"Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue\" (2020) ruled that it is unconstitutional to disqualify all religious schools from receiving public funds that other private schools are eligible to get.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

White", "text": "American author (1899\u20131985)\nElwyn Brooks White (July 11, 1899\u00a0\u2013 October 1, 1985) was an American writer. He was the author of highly popular books for children: \"Stuart Little\" (1945), \"Charlotte's Web\" (1952), and \"The Trumpet of the Swan\" (1970).\nIn a 2012 survey of \"School Library Journal\" readers, \"Charlotte's Web\" was ranked first in their poll of the top one hundred children's novels. White also was a contributing editor and writer \"The New Yorker\" magazine and co-author of \"The Elements of Style\", an English language style guide. Kurt Vonnegut called White \"one of the most admirable prose stylists our country has so far produced.\"\nEarly life, family and education.\nWhite was born in Mount Vernon, New York, on July 11, 1899, the sixth and youngest child of Samuel Tilly White, the president of a piano firm, and Jessie Hart White, the daughter of Scottish-American painter William Hart. Elwyn's older brother Stanley Hart White, known as Stan, a professor of landscape architecture and the inventor of the vertical garden, taught E. B. White to read and explore the natural world.\nWhite attended Cornell University, where he was briefly a private in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), created by the US Department of War in 1918 to hasten the training of US soldiers for World War I in Europe. Students continued to take college courses while training for the army. Unlike the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), SATC students were required to live and take all meals on campus and adhered to a strict military schedule of study and training. They also required a pass to go off campus on weekends. Following the end of World War I, the SATC program was disbanded in December 1918, and White did not serve with the active armed forces.\nIn 1921, White graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Cornell, he obtained the nickname \"Andy\", where tradition confers that moniker on any male student whose surname is White after Cornell co-founder Andrew Dickson White. He worked as editor of \"The Cornell Daily Sun\" with classmate Allison Danzig, who later became a sportswriter for \"The New York Times\". As a Cornell University student, White was a member of Aleph Samach, Quill and Dagger, and Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from Cornell, White went to work for the United Press, later United Press International, and the American Legion News Service in 1921 and 1922. From September 1922 to June 1923, he was a cub reporter for \"The Seattle Times\". On one occasion, when White was stuck writing a story, a \"Times\" editor said, \"Just say the words.\"\nWhite was fired from the \"Times\" and later wrote for the rival \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" before a stint in Alaska on a fireboat. He then worked for almost two years with the Frank Seaman advertising agency as a production assistant and copywriter before returning to New York City in 1924.\nIn 1925, after \"The New Yorker\" was founded, White began submitting manuscripts to the magazine. Katharine Angell, the literary editor, recommended to editor-in-chief and founder Harold Ross that White be hired as a staff writer. However, it took months to convince White to attend a meeting at the office and additional weeks to convince him to work on the premises. He eventually agreed to work in the office on Thursdays.\nWhite published his first article for \"The New Yorker\" in 1925, then joined the staff in 1927 and continued to write for the magazine for nearly six decades. Best recognized for his essays and unsigned \"Notes and Comment\" pieces, he gradually became the magazine's most important contributor. From the beginning to the end of his career at \"The New Yorker,\" he frequently provided what the magazine calls \"Newsbreaks\", which were short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources, under various categories, such as \"Block That Metaphor.\" In his essays, he advocated in favor of limited government, civil rights, and especially world federalism. He also was a columnist for \"Harper's Magazine\" from 1938 to 1943.\nIn 1929, White coauthored with James Thurber on \"Is Sex Necessary?\" In 1949, White published \"Here Is New York\", a short book based on an article he had been commissioned to write for \"Holiday\". Editor Ted Patrick approached White about writing the essay, telling him it would be fun. \"Writing is never 'fun'\", White replied. That article reflects the writer's appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both \"the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy.\" It concludes with a dark note touching on the forces that could destroy the city that he loved. This prescient \"love letter\" to the city was re-published in 1999 on his centennial with an introduction by his stepson, Roger Angell.\nIn 1959, White edited and updated \"The Elements of Style\". This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of American English was first written and published in 1918 by William Strunk Jr., one of White's professors at Cornell. White's reworking of the book was extremely well received, and later editions followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. Maira Kalman illustrated an edition in 2005. That same year, Nico Muhly, a New York City composer, premiered a short opera based on the book. The volume is a standard tool for students and writers and remains required reading in many composition classes. The complete history of \"The Elements of Style \"is detailed in Mark Garvey's \"Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style\".\nIn 1978, White was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize, citing \"his letters, essays and the full body of his work\". He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 and honorary memberships in a variety of literary societies throughout the United States. The 1973 Oscar-nominated Canadian animated short \"The Family That Dwelt Apart\" was narrated by White and was based on his short story of the same name.\nChildren's books.\nIn the late 1930s, White turned his hand to children's fiction on behalf of a niece, Janice Hart White. His first children's book, \"Stuart Little\", was published in 1945, and \"Charlotte's Web\" followed in 1952. \"Stuart Little\" initially received a lukewarm welcome from the literary community. However, both books went on to receive high acclaim, and \"Charlotte's Web\" won a Newbery Honor from the American Library Association, though it lost out on winning the Newbery Medal to \"Secret of the Andes\" by Ann Nolan Clark.\nWhite received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the U.S. professional children's librarians in 1970. It recognized his \"substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature.\" That year, he was also the U.S. nominee and eventual runner-up for the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award, as he was again in 1976. Also, in 1970, White's third children's novel was published, \"The Trumpet of the Swan\". In 1973 it won the Sequoyah Award from Oklahoma and the William Allen White Award from Kansas, both selected by students voting for their favorite book of the year. In 2012, the \"School Library Journal\" sponsored a survey of readers, which identified \"Charlotte's Web\" as the best children's novel (\"fictional title for readers 8\u201312\" years old). The librarian who conducted it said, \"It is impossible to conduct a poll of this sort and expect [White's novel] to be anywhere but #1.\"\nPersonal life.\nWhite was shy around women, claiming he had \"too small a heart, too large a pen\". But in 1929, after an affair that led to Katharine Angell's divorce, she and White were married. They had a son, Joel White, a naval architect and boat builder, who later owned Brooklin Boat Yard in Brooklin, Maine. Katharine's son from her first marriage, Roger Angell, spent decades as a fiction editor for \"The New Yorker\" and was well known as the magazine's baseball writer.\nIn her foreword to \"Charlotte's Web\", Kate DiCamillo quotes White as saying, \"All that I hope to say in books, all that I ever hope to say, is that I love the world.\" White also loved animals, farms and farming implements, seasons, and weather formats.\nJames Thurber described White as a quiet man who disliked publicity and who, during his time at \"The New Yorker\", would slip out of his office via the fire escape to a nearby branch of Schrafft's to avoid visitors he didn't know: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Most of us, out of a politeness made up of faint curiosity and profound resignation, go out to meet the smiling stranger with a gesture of surrender and a fixed grin, but White has always taken to the fire escape. He has avoided the Man in the Reception Room as he has avoided the interviewer, the photographer, the microphone, the rostrum, the literary tea, and the Stork Club. His life is his own. He is the only writer of prominence I know of who could walk through the Algonquin lobby or between the tables at Jack and Charlie's and be recognized only by his friends.\u2014\u200a\nLater in life, White developed Alzheimer's disease. He died on October 1, 1985, at his farm home in North Brooklin, Maine. He is buried in the Brooklin Cemetery beside Katharine, who died in 1977.\nLegacy.\nThe E. B. White Read Aloud Award is given by The Association of Booksellers for Children (ABC) to honor books that its membership feel embodies the universal read-aloud standards that E. B. White's works created.\nThe Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections at Cornell University Library holds the E. B. White Collection, an archive of manuscripts, letters, photographs, cassette tapes regarding E. B. White, including over 25,000 letters sent to him. For example, when Late Night show host Conan O'Brien reminisced about the return letter he received from E. B. White after writing him a letter at the age of 16, Cornell's Olin Library found that letter for him. During the 2025 Palisades Fire, O'Brien recalled that when he was told to evacuate, his wife asked what to grab, and he replied, \"Just grab the E. B. White letter off the wall.\"\nWhite was played by Patrick Kennedy in Blue Moon, Richard Linklater's 2025 biopic of musical writer Lorenz Hart.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9752", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9752", "title": "Evangelist (Latter Day Saints)", "text": "In the Latter Day Saint movement, an evangelist is an ordained office of the ministry. In some denominations of the movement, an evangelist is referred to as a patriarch. However, the latter term was deprecated by the Community of Christ after the church began ordaining women to the priesthood. Other denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), have an evangelist position independent of the original \"patriarch\" office instituted movement founder Joseph Smith.\nEarly Latter Day Saint movement.\nThe first use of the term \"evangelist\" in Latter Day Saint theology were mainly consistent with how the term is used by Protestants and Catholics.\nIn 1833, Joseph Smith introduced the new office of patriarch, to which he ordained his father. The elder Smith was given the \"keys of the patriarchal Priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth\", the same power said to be held by the Biblical patriarchs, which included the power to give blessings upon one's posterity. The elder Smith, however, was also called to give patriarchal blessings to the fatherless within the church, and the church as a whole, a calling he passed onto his eldest surviving son Hyrum Smith prior to his death. Hyrum himself was killed in 1844 along with Joseph, resulting in a succession crisis that broke the Latter Day Saint movement into multiple denominations.\nIt is not known who first identified the term \"evangelist\" with the office of patriarch. However, in an 1835 church publication, W. W. Phelps stated,\n\"[W]ho is not desirous of receiving a father's or an evangelist's blessing? Who can read the ancient patriarchal blessings, recorded in the bible, for the benefit of the church, without a heart filled with joy ... ?\"\nIn 1839, Joseph Smith equated an evangelist with the office of patriarch, stating that \"an Evangelist is a Patriarch\".\nThe necessity of an evangelist in the church organization has been reinforced repeatedly, based on the passage in Ephesians 4:11, which states, \"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers\". In 1834, while writing what he called the \"principles of salvation\", prominent early Latter Day Saint Oliver Cowdery stated that:\n\"We do not believe that he ever had a church on earth without revealing himself to that church: consequently, there were apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, in the same.\"\nJoseph Smith echoed Cowdery's statement in 1842, in a letter to a Chicago newspaper editor outlining the church's basic beliefs. Smith said that his religion \"believe[s] in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists\".\nCommunity of Christ.\nIn the Community of Christ, which was formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), an evangelist is an office in the Melchizedec Order of the priesthood.\nAn evangelist-patriarch's primary responsibility was to provide special blessings to members of the church; these blessings were considered one of the eight sacraments in the RLDS Church. The local evangelist-patriarchs of the church were governed by an individual with church-wide authority known as the Presiding Patriarch.\nIn 1984, when the first women began to be ordained to the office of evangelist-patriarch, the RLDS Church changed the title of the evangelist-patriarchs to simply \"evangelist\". Similarly, it changed the title of the Presiding Patriarch to the \"Presiding Evangelist\". To be an evangelist, a person must also be a high priest of the Melchizedec Order of the priesthood.\nThe primary duty of an evangelist in the Community of Christ remains the giving of sacramental \"evangelist's blessings\"; it is for this reason that evangelists are often referred to as \"ministers of blessing\". Ideally, an evangelist is free from administrative responsibilities in the church in order to allow them to be fully responsive to the Holy Spirit. The blessings\u2014which are given by the laying on of hands\u2014provide counsel and advice and confer spiritual blessings upon the recipient(s). Not only individuals, but also couples, families, households, groups and congregations may receive an evangelist's blessing. Any person, including nonmembers, eight years of age or older can receive a blessing, although the blessing is rarely offered for someone who has not reached adolescence. A recipient may receive multiple evangelist's blessings in their life. Evangelist's blessings may or may not be recorded. If it is recorded in written form, a copy is stored in the church archives at Independence, Missouri.\nAll evangelists belong to the Order of Evangelists, which is led by the Presiding Evangelist (currently Jane M. Gardner, since 2016).\nThe Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite).\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), the prescribed duties of an evangelist are to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, language, and people. An evangelist is part of the Quorum of Seventy Evangelists.\nQuorum of Seventy Evangelists.\nThe Quorum of Seventy Evangelists is responsible for management of the International Missionary Programs of the church and assists Regions of the church with their individual Domestic Missionary Programs. The Quorum of Seventy oversees the activities of its Missionary Operating Committees to ensure the fulfilling of Christ's commandment to take the gospel to the entire world.\nIn 2007, the officers of the Quorum of Seventy Evangelists were:\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), an evangelist is considered to be an office of the Melchizedek priesthood. However, the term \"evangelist\" is rarely used for this position; instead, the church has retained the term \"patriarch\", the term most commonly used by Joseph Smith.\nThe most prominent reference to the term \"evangelist\" in the LDS Church's literature is found in its \"Articles of Faith\", derived from the Wentworth letter\u2014a statement by Smith in 1842 to a Chicago newspaper editor\u2014that the church believes in \"the same organization that existed in the primitive church\", including \"evangelists\". Smith taught that \"an Evangelist is an Patriarch\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Roman poets, particularly Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid, adopted the same form in Latin many years later. As with the English heroic couplet, each pair of lines usually makes sense on its own, while forming part of a larger work.\nEach couplet consists of a dactylic hexameter verse followed by a dactylic pentameter verse. The following is a graphic representation of its scansion:\n \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu | \u2013 x\n \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu | \u2013 || \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu | \u2013\n \u2013 is one long syllable, u one short syllable, uu is one long or two short syllables, and x is one long or one short syllable (anceps).\nThe form was felt by the ancients to contrast the rising action of the first verse with a falling quality in the second. The sentiment is summarized in a line from Ovid's \"Amores\" I.1.27 \u2014 \"Sex mihi surgat opus numeris, in quinque residat\" \u2014 \"Let my work rise in six steps, fall back in five.\" The effect is illustrated by Friedrich Schiller's couplet\n\ntranslated into English by Samuel Taylor Coleridge as:\nIn the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column,\nIn the pentameter aye falling in melody back.\nand by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, as:\nUp goes the Hexameter with might as a fountain rising.\nLightly the fountain falls, lightly the Pentameter.\nGreek origins.\nThe elegiac couplet is presumed to be the oldest Greek form of epodic poetry (a form where a later verse is sung in response or comment to a previous one). Scholars, who even in the past did not know who created it, theorize the form was originally used in Ionian dirges, with the name \"elegy\" derived from the Greek \"\u03b5, \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b5, \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\"\u2014\"Woe, cry woe, cry!\" Hence, the form was used initially for funeral songs, typically accompanied by an aulos, a double-reed wind instrument. Archilochus expanded use of the form to treat other themes, such as war, travel, and homespun philosophy. Between Archilochus and other imitators, the verse form became a common poetic vehicle for conveying any strong emotion.\nAt the end of the 7th century BCE, Mimnermus of Colophon struck on the innovation of using the verse for erotic poetry. He composed several elegies celebrating his love for the flute girl Nanno, and though fragmentary today, his poetry was clearly influential in the later Roman development of the form. Propertius, to cite one example, notes \u2014\"The verse of Mimnermus is stronger in love than Homer\".\nThe form continued to be popular throughout the Greek period and treated a number of different themes. Tyrtaeus composed elegies on a war theme, apparently for a Spartan audience. Theognis of Megara vented himself in couplets as an embittered aristocrat in a time of social change. Popular leaders were writers of elegies\u2014Solon the lawgiver of Athens composed on political and ethical subjects\u2014and even Plato and Aristotle dabbled with the meter.\nA famous example of an elegiac couplet is the epitaph composed by Simonides of Ceos which Herodotus says was inscribed on a stone to commemorate those who died at the battle of Thermopylae in 490 BC:\n (Book VII, 228)\n\n\"O stranger, tell the Spartans that in this place\nwe lie, obeying their commands.\"\nCicero translates it as follows (\"Tusc. Disp.\" 1.42.101), also using an elegiac couplet: \n\n\"Say, stranger, in Sparta that you saw us lying here\nwhile we obey the sacred laws of our fatherland.\"\nBy the Hellenistic period, the Library of Alexandria made elegy its favorite and most highly developed form. They preferred the briefer style associated with elegy in contrast to the lengthier epic forms, and made it the singular medium for short epigrams. The founder of this school was Philitas of Cos. He was eclipsed only by the school's most admired exponent, Callimachus; their learned character and intricate art would have a heavy influence on the Romans.\nRoman elegy.\nLike many Greek forms, elegy was adapted by the Romans for their own literature. The fragments of Ennius contain a few couplets, but it is the elegists of the mid-to-late first century BCE who are most commonly associated with the distinctive Roman form of the elegiac couplet. Catullus, the first of these, is an invaluable link between the Alexandrine school and the subsequent elegies of Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid. He shows a familiarity with the usual Alexandrine style of terse epigram and a wealth of mythological learning, as in his 66th poem, , a direct translation of Callimachus' \"Lock of Berenice\". His 85th poem is famous:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nTo read it correctly it is necessary to take account of the three elisions:\n \u2013 u u| \u2013 \u2013| \u2013 u u|\u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u u| \u2013 x\n Od'et a|mo. Qua|r'id faci|am, for|tasse re|quiris?\n \u2013 uu | \u2013 uu| \u2013 || \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u|\u2013\n Nescio, | sed fie|ri || senti'et | excruci|or.\nCornelius Gallus, an important statesman of this period, was also regarded by the ancients as a great elegist, but, except for a few lines, his work has been lost.\nElegy in the Augustan Age.\nThe form reached its zenith with the collections of Tibullus and Propertius and several collections of Ovid (the \"Amores\", \"Ars Amatoria\", \"Heroides\", \"Tristia\", and \"Epistulae ex Ponto\"). The vogue of elegy during this time is seen in the so-called 3rd and 4th books of Tibullus. Many poems in these books were clearly not written by Tibullus but by others, perhaps part of a circle under Tibullus' patron Messalla. Notable in this collection are the poems of Sulpicia, thought to be the only surviving work by a Classical Latin female poet. The six elegiac poems of Lygdamus in the collection are thought by some to be an anonymous early work by Ovid, though other scholars attribute them to an imitator of Ovid who may have lived in a much later period.\nThrough these poets\u2014and in comparison with the earlier Catullus\u2014it is possible to trace specific characteristics and evolutionary patterns in the Roman form of the verse:\n*There is a trend toward the clear separation of the pentameter halves. Catullus, for example, allows an elision across the caesura in 18 cases, a rare occurrence in the later poets (Ovid, for example, never does this).\n*The pentameter begins to show a semi-regular \"leonine\" rhyme between the two halves of the verse, e.g. Tib. I.1\u20132, where the \"culti\" ending the first half of the pentameter rhymes with the \"soli\" closing the verse:\n\n\"Let another man pile up riches for himself with yellow gold\nand hold many acres of cultivated land\"\nWhile Catullus shows this rhyme in about 1 in 5 couplets, the later elegists use it more frequently. Propertius II.34, for example, has the rhyme in nearly half its pentameters. Rhyming between adjacent lines and even in the two halves of the hexameter is also observed, more than would be expected by chance alone.\n*Unlike Catullus, later poets show a definite trend toward ending the pentameter with a two-syllable word. In Catullus the proportion of disyllabic endings is 39%, not dissimilar to Greek practice; in Propertius book 1, this rises to 61%; but in the last two books endings other than a disyllabic word are very rare. In Tibullus book 1 the figure is 93%. Ovid has no exceptions to the disyllabic ending in his \"Amores\", and only a few exceptions in his later work.\nPost-Augustan writers.\nAlthough no classical poet wrote collections of love elegies after Ovid, the verse retained its popularity as a vehicle for popular occasional poetry. Elegiac verses appear, for example, in Petronius' \"Satyricon\", and Martial's Epigrams uses it for many witty stand-alone couplets and for longer pieces. The trend continues through the remainder of the empire; short elegies appear in Apuleius's story of Cupid and Psyche and in the minor writings of Ausonius.\nMedieval elegy.\nAfter the fall of the empire, one writer who produced elegiac verse was Maximianus. Various Christian writers also adopted the form; Venantius Fortunatus wrote some of his hymns in the meter, while later Alcuin and the Venerable Bede dabbled in the verse. The form also remained popular among the educated classes for gravestone epitaphs; many such epitaphs can be found in European cathedrals.\n\"De tribus puellis\" is an example of a Latin \"fabliau\", a genre of comedy which employed elegiac couplets in imitation of Ovid. The medieval theorist John of Garland wrote that \"all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.\" Medieval Latin had a developed comedic genre known as elegiac comedy. Sometimes narrative, sometimes dramatic, it deviated from ancient practice because, as Ian Thompson writes, \"no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.\"\nRenaissance and modern period.\nWith the Renaissance, more skilled writers interested in the revival of Roman culture attempted to recapture the spirit of the Augustan writers. The Dutch Latinist Johannes Secundus, for example, included Catullus-inspired love elegies in his \"Liber Basiorum\", while the English poet John Milton wrote several lengthy elegies throughout his career. This trend continued down through the Recent Latin writers, whose close study of their Augustan counterparts reflects their general attempts to apply the cultural and literary forms of the ancient world to contemporary themes."}

The Spanish era is calculated from 38 BC, Before Christ, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. indiction) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the Battle of Actium, which occurred in 31 BC.\nLike epoch, \"era\" in English originally meant \"the starting point of an age\"; the meaning \"system of chronological notation\" is c. 1646; that of \"historical period\" is 1741.\nUse in chronology.\nIn chronology, an \"era\" is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of time. A \"calendar era\" indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific reference date (epoch), which often marks the origin of a political state or cosmology, dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in \"Victorian era\".\nGeological era.\nIn large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where \"geologic era\" refers to well-defined time spans.\nThe next-larger division of geologic time is the eon. The Phanerozoic Eon, for example, is subdivided into eras. There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for \"before present\").\nThe older Proterozoic and Archean eons are also divided into eras.\nCosmological era.\nFor periods in the history of the universe, the term \"epoch\" is typically preferred, but \"era\" is used e.g. of the \"Stelliferous Era\".\nCalendar eras.\nCalendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. \"Anno mundi\" (year of the world) refers to a group of calendar eras based on a calculation of the age of the world, assuming it was created as described in the Book of Genesis. In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many Eastern Orthodox religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012. In the Western church, \"Anno Domini\" (\"AD\" also written \"CE\"), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant.\nThe Islamic calendar, which also has variants, counts years from the Hijra or emigration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, which occurred in 622 AD. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH (\"After Hijra\").\nFor a time ranging from 1872 to the Second World War, the Japanese used the imperial year system (\"k\u014dki\"), counting from the year when the legendary Emperor Jimmu founded Japan, which occurred in 660 BC.\nMany Buddhist calendars count from the death of the Buddha, which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545\u2013543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as \"BE\" for \"Buddhist Era\"; 2000 AD was 2543 BE in the Thai solar calendar.\nOther calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the Seleucid era and the Ancient Roman \"ab urbe condita\" (\"AUC\"), counting from the foundation of the city.\nRegnal eras.\nThe word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again. The use of regnal years is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures. Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of Romulus and Remus). In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.\nIn East Asia, each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:\nA similar practice survived in the United Kingdom until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but Acts of Parliament were dated according to the years of the reign of the current monarch, so that \"61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37\" refers to the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 passed in the session of Parliament in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of Queen Victoria.\nHistoriography.\n\"Era\" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the Roman era, Elizabethan era, Victorian era, etc.\nUse of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include Soviet era, and \"musical eras\" in the history of modern popular music, such as the \"big band era\", \"disco era\", etc.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The end of the world or end times is predicted by several world religions (both Abrahamic and Dharmic), which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. Belief that the end of the world is imminent is known as apocalypticism, and over time has been held both by members of mainstream religions and by doomsday cults. In the context of mysticism, the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the divine. Many religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in folklore, while other religions may have concepts of renewal or transformation after significant events.\nThe Abrahamic religions maintain a linear cosmology, with end-time scenarios containing themes of transformation and redemption. In Judaism, the term \"end of days\" makes reference to the Messianic Age and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish diaspora, the coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the righteous, and the world to come. Christianity depicts the end time as a period of tribulation that precedes the second coming of Christ, who will face the rise of the Antichrist along with his power structure and false prophets, and usher in the Kingdom of God. The explicit description of a new earth is primarily found in Christian teachings (this description can be found in Chapter 21 of the Book of Revelation). In later traditions of Islam, separate hadiths detail the Day of Judgment as preceded by the appearance of the Mas\u012b\u1e25 ad-Dajj\u0101l, and followed by the descending of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 (Jesus), which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the Qiy\u0101mah (Judgment Day).\nDharmic religions tend to have more cyclical worldviews, with end-time eschatologies characterized by decay, redemption, and rebirth (though some believe transitions between cycles are relatively uneventful). In Hinduism, the end time occurs when Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, descends atop a white horse and brings an end to the current \"Kali Yuga\", completing a cycle that starts again with the regeneration of the world. In Buddhism, the Buddha predicted his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. It says a \"bodhisattva\" named Maitreya will appear and rediscover the teachings of the \"Buddha Dharma\", and that the ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.\nSince the development of the concept of deep time in the 18th century and the calculation of the estimated age of planet Earth, scientific discourse about end times has considered the ultimate fate of the universe. Theories have included the Big Rip, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, and Big Freeze (heat death). Social and scientific commentators also worry about global catastrophic risks and scenarios that could result in human extinction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe word \"eschatology\" arises from the Ancient Greek term (\"\u00e9schatos\"), meaning \"last\", and \"-logy\", meaning \"the study of\", and first appeared in English around 1844. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines eschatology as \"the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind\".\nLinear cosmology.\nJudaism.\nThe main tenets of modern Jewish eschatology, in no particular order, include:\nJudaism usually refers to the end times as the \"end of days\" (\"a\u1e25arit ha-yamim\", \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh. The end times are addressed in the Book of Daniel and in numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the Talmud, particularly Tractate Avodah Zarah.\nThe idea of a Messianic Age, an era of global peace and knowledge of the Creator, has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days. A well-known passage from the Book of Isaiah describes this future condition of the world: \"They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare\" (Isaiah 2:4, see also Micah 4:3). Maimonides (1135\u20131204) further describes the Messianic Era in the Mishneh Torah: \"And at that time there will be no hunger or war, no jealousy or rivalry. For the good will be plentiful, and all delicacies available as dust. The entire occupation of the world will be only to know God;... the people Israel will be of great wisdom; they will perceive the esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator's wisdom as is the capacity of man. As it is written (Isaiah 11:9): 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.'\"\nKabbalah.\nIn Kabbalah, the Zohar maintains that the seven days of the week, based on the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of creation. The seventh day of the week, the Shabbat day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal rest, or the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium begins with the year 6000 AM, and is the latest time the Messiah can come. A number of early and late Jewish scholars have written in support of this, including the Ramban, Isaac Abarbanel, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bachya, the Vilna Gaon, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Ramchal, Aryeh Kaplan and Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis.\nZoroastrianism.\nFrashokereti is the Zoroastrian doctrine of a final renovation of the universe when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will then be in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). The doctrinal premises are:\nZoroastrian eschatology is considered one of the oldest in recorded history. The birth of its founder, Zoroaster, is unknown, with scholarly dates ranging from 500 BCE to 1,500 BCE. Pliny the Elder even suggests there were two Zoroasters. However, with beliefs paralleling and possibly predating the framework of the major Abrahamic faiths, a fully developed concept of the end of the world was not established in Zoroastrianism until 500 BCE. The Bahman Yasht describes:\nAt the end of thy tenth hundredth winter, the sun is more unseen and more spotted; the year, month, and day are shorter; and the earth is more barren; and the crop will not yield the seed. And men become more deceitful and more given to vile practices. They will have no gratitude. Honorable wealth will proceed to those of perverted faith. And a dark cloud makes the whole sky night, and it will rain more noxious creatures than water.\nA battle between the righteous and wicked will be followed by the Frashokereti. On earth, the Saoshyant will arrive as the final savior of mankind, and bring about the resurrection of the dead. The \"yazata\"s Airyaman and Atar will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, which will flow as lava across the earth and all mankind, both the living and resurrected, will be required to wade through it. \"Ashavan\" will pass through the molten river as if it were warm milk, but the sinful will burn. It will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate Angra Mainyu and the last vestiges of wickedness.\nThe righteous will partake of the \"parahaoma\", which will confer immortality upon them. Humanity will become like the Amesha Spentas, living without food, hunger, thirst, weapons or injury. Bodies will become so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language, and belong to a single nation with no borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with Ahura Mazda for a perpetual and divine exaltation.\nGnosticism.\nThe Gnostic codex On the Origin of the World (possibly dating from near the end of the third century AD) states that during what is called the consummation of the age, the Sun and Moon will become dark as the stars change their ordinary course. Kings will make war with each other, and thunder will cause the world to be shaken. The corrupt Archons will mourn. The sea will be troubled by fighting of the kings who became drunk from the flaming sword. Finally, great thunder will come from Sophia, the woman in the firmament above the forces of Chaos. She will cast the corrupt gods into the abyss where they will fight each other until only their chief Yaldabaoth remains and destroys himself. Next the heavens of the Archons will collapse on each other before the Earth sinks into the abyss. Light will cover the darkness and eliminate it then form into something greater than anything that ever existed before. The source of the darkness will dissolve, and the deficiency will be taken from its root. Those who were not perfected in the unconceived one will receive glories in their realms and kingdoms of the immortals, but those who were will enter a kingless realm. All will be judged according to their deeds and gnosis.\nChristianity.\nChristian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and of the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the Old and New Testaments.\nChristian eschatological research looks to study and discuss matters such as the nature of the divine and the divine nature of Jesus Christ, death and the afterlife, Heaven and Hell, the Second Coming of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, the rapture, the Tribulation, millennialism, the end of the world, the Last Judgment, and the New Heaven and New Earth in the world to come.\nEschatological passages occur in many places in the Bible, in both the Old and the New Testaments. In the Old Testament, apocalyptic eschatology can be found notably in Isaiah 24\u201327, Isaiah 56\u201366, Joel, Zechariah 9\u201314 as well as in the closing chapters of Daniel, and in Ezekiel. In the New Testament, applicable passages include Matthew 24, Mark 13, the parable of \"The Sheep and the Goats\" and the Book of Revelation\u2014Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.\nThe Second Coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology within the broader context of the fullness of the Kingdom of God. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.\nThe Book of Revelation stands at the core of much of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or hermeneutics:\nDate.\nFirst-century Christians believed Jesus would return during their lifetime. When the converts of Paul in Thessalonica were persecuted by the Roman Empire, they believed the end of days to be imminent. Most of the scholars participating in the third quest hold that Jesus was an eschatological prophet who believed the \"Kingdom of God\" was coming within his own lifetime or within the lifetime of his contemporaries. This view, generally known as \"consistent eschatology,\" was influential during the early to the mid\u2014twentieth century and continues to be influential today in proposed portraits of the Historical Jesus. Dale Allison argues that while Jesus expected an imminent end, its date was not unchangeable and was contingent on the repentance of Israel to proceed. However, C. H. Dodd and others have insisted on a \"realized eschatology\" that says Jesus' own ministry fulfilled prophetic hopes. Many conservative scholars have adopted the paradoxical position the Kingdom of God passages describes a kingdom that is both \"present\" and \"still to come\" claiming Pauline eschatology as support. R. T. France and N. T. Wright among others have taken Jesus' apocalyptic statements of an imminent end, historically, as referring to the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD. A number of interpretations of the term \"Kingdom of God\" have thus appeared in its eschatological context, e.g., apocalyptic, realized or Inaugurated eschatologies, yet no consensus has emerged among scholars.\nWhile some who believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible insist the prediction of dates or times is futile, others believe Jesus foretold signs of the end of days. The precise time, however, will come like a \"thief in the night\" (). They may also refer to in which Jesus is quoted as saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.\"\nGreat Tribulation.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus refers to this period preceding the end times as the \"Great Tribulation\" (), \"Affliction\" (), and \"days of vengeance\" ().\nThe Book of Matthew describes the devastation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe resulting chaos will affect pregnancies, newborns, and a scourge will spread throughout the flesh, save for the elect. The vivid imagery of this section is repeated closely in .\nThe Gospel of Luke describes a complete unraveling of the social fabric, with widespread calamity and war:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then he said to them, \"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. This will be your opportunity to bear witness. Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death. You will be hated by all for my name's sake. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your lives.\n\"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.\n\"And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.\"\nAnd he told them a parable: \"Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\"\nIn the Book of Revelation, the \"great tribulation\" (Rev. 7:14b) refers to a time of affliction upon God's people.\nCatholicism.\nThe Profession of Faith addresses Catholic beliefs concerning the last days. Catholicism adheres to the amillennial school of thought, promoted by Augustine of Hippo in his work \"The City of God\".\nProtestantism.\nContemporary use of the term \"End Times\" has evolved from literal belief in Christian millennialism. In this tradition, Biblical apocalypse is believed to be imminent, with various current events as omens of impending Armageddon. These beliefs have been put forward by the Adventist movement (Millerites) and dispensational premillennialists. In 1918 a group of eight, well-known preachers produced the London Manifesto, warning of an imminent second coming of Christ shortly after the 1917 liberation of Jerusalem by the British.\nMillennialists and Amillennialists.\nProtestants are divided between Millennialists and Amillennialists. Millennialists concentrate on the issue of whether the true believers will see the Great Tribulation or be removed from it by what is referred to as a Pre-Tribulation rapture.\nAmillennialists believe the end times encompass the time from Christ's ascension to the last day, and maintain that the mention of the \"thousand years\" in the Book of Revelation is meant to be taken metaphorically (i.e., not literally), a view which continues to cause divisions within Protestant Christianity.\nThere is a range of eschatological belief in Protestant Christianity. Christian premillennialists who believe the end times are occurring now, are usually specific about timelines that climax in the end of the world. For some, Israel, the European Union, or the United Nations are seen as major players whose roles were foretold in scripture. Within dispensational premillennialist writing, there is the belief that Christians will be summoned to Heaven by Christ at the rapture, occurring before a Great Tribulation prophesied in Matthew 24\u201325; Mark 13 and Luke 21. The Tribulation is described in the Book of Revelation.\n\"End times\" may also refer to the passing of an age or long period in the relationship between man and God. Adherents to this view cite the Second Epistle to Timothy and draw analogies to the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.\nPost-Exilic Hebrew books of prophecy such as Daniel and Ezekiel are given new interpretations in this Christian tradition, while apocalyptic forecasts appear in the Judeo-Christian Sibylline Oracles which include the Book of Revelation ascribed to John, the apocryphal Apocalypse of Peter, and the Second Book of Esdras.\nAdventists and Millerites.\nReligious movements which expect that the second coming of Christ will be a cataclysmic event are generally called adventism. These have arisen throughout the Christian era, but were particularly common after the Protestant Reformation. Emanuel Swedenborg considered the second coming to be symbolic, and to have occurred in 1757. Along with others, he developed a religious system around the second coming of Christ, disclosed by new prophecy or special revelation not described in the Bible. The Millerites are diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of interpretation for predicting the second coming.\nThe difference between the 19th-century Millerite and adventist movements and contemporary prophecy is that William Miller and his followers, based on biblical interpretation, predicted the time of the Second Coming to have occurred in 1844. Contemporary writing of end time has suggested the timetable will be triggered by future wars and moral catastrophe, and that this time of tribulation is close at hand.\nSeventh-day Adventists believe biblical prophecy to foretell an end time scenario in which the United States works in conjunction with the Catholic Church to mandate worship on a day other than the true Sabbath, Saturday, as prescribed in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8\u201311). This will bring about a situation where one must choose for or against the Bible as the will of God.\nPreterists.\nAnother view of the \"end times\" is preterism. It distinguishes \"the time of the end\" from \"the end of time\". Preterists believe the term \"last days\" (or \"Time of the End\") refers to, neither the last days of the Earth, nor the last days of humankind, but the end of the Old Covenant between God and Israel; which, according to preterism, took place when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 CE.\nPreterists believe that prophecies\u2014such as the Second Coming, the desecration of the Jewish Temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, the rise of the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, the advent of The Day of the Lord, and a Final Judgment\u2014had been fulfilled when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and completely destroyed its Temple.\nProponents of \"full preterism\" do not believe in a coming resurrection of the dead. They place this event (as well as the Second Coming) in the year 70. Advocates of partial preterism do believe in a coming resurrection. Full preterists contend that partial preterists are merely \"futurists\", since they believe the Second Coming, the Resurrection, the Rapture, and the Judgment are yet to come.\nMany preterists believe first-century Christians experienced the Rapture to rejoin the Christ.\nAccording with Preterism's interpretation of end times, many \"time passages\" in the New Testament foretell a Second Coming of Christ, with last days to take place within the lifetimes of his disciples: Matt. 10:23, Matt. 16:28, Matt. 24:34, Matt. 26:64, Rom. 13:11\u201312, 1 Cor. 7:29\u201331, 1 Cor. 10:11, Phil. 4:5, James 5:8\u20139, 1 Pet. 4:7, 1 Jn. 2:18.\nDispensationalists.\nDispensationalism is an evangelical futurist Biblical interpretation that foresees a series of dispensations, or periods, in which God relates to human beings under different Biblical covenants. The belief system is primarily rooted in the writings of John Nelson Darby and is premillennial in content. The reestablishment of Israel in 1948 provided a major impetus to the dispensationalist belief system. The wars of Israel after 1948 with its Arab neighbors provided further support, according to John F. Walvoord. After the Six-Day War in 1967, and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, it seemed plausible to many Fundamentalist Christians in the 1970s that Middle East turmoil may well be leading up to the fulfillment of various Bible prophecies and to the Battle of Armageddon.\nMembers of the dispensationalist movement such as Hal Lindsey, J. Dwight Pentecost, John Walvoord, all of whom have Dallas Theological Seminary backgrounds, and some other writers, claimed further that the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, would become a United States of Europe, which would in turn become a Revived Roman Empire ruled by the Antichrist. The Revived Roman Empire also figured into the New Testament writers' vision of the future. The fact that in the early 1970s, there were (erroneously thought to be) seven nations in the European Economic Community was held to be significant; this aligned the Community with a seven-headed beast mentioned in Revelation. This specific prophecy has required revision, but the idea of a Revived Roman Empire remains.\nDispensationalism, in contrast to the Millerite Adventist movement, had its beginning in the 19th century, when John Nelson Darby, founder of the Plymouth Brethren religious denomination, incorporated into his system of Biblical interpretation a system of organizing Biblical time into a number of discrete dispensations, each of which marks a separate covenant with God. Darby's beliefs were widely publicized in Cyrus I. Scofield's \"Scofield Reference Bible\", an annotated Bible that became popular in the United States.\nSince the majority of the Biblical prophets were writing at a time when the Temple in Jerusalem was still functioning, they wrote as if it would still be standing during the prophesied events. According to preterism, this was a fulfillment of the prophecies. However, according to Futurists, their destruction in AD 70 put the prophetic timetable on hold. Many such believers therefore anticipated the return of Jews to Israel and the reconstruction of the Temple before the Second Coming could occur.\nPosttribulation premillennialism.\nA view of the Second Coming of Christ as held by posttribulational premillennialists holds that the Church of Christ will have to undergo great persecution by being present during the great tribulation.\nSpecific prophetic movements.\nIn 1843, William Miller made the first of several predictions that the world would end in only a few months. As his predictions did not come true (referred to as the Great Disappointment), followers of Miller went on to found separate groups, the most successful of which is the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\nMembers of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith believe Miller's interpretation of signs and dates of the coming of Jesus were, for the most part, correct. They believe the fulfillment of biblical prophecies of the coming of Christ came through a forerunner of their own religion, the B\u00e1b. According to the B\u00e1b's words, 4 April 1844 was \"the first day that the Spirit descended\" into his heart. His subsequent declaration to Mull\u00e1 Husayn-i Bushru'i that he was the \"Promised One\"\u2014an event now commemorated by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds as a major holy day\u2014took place on 23 May 1844. It was in October of that year that the B\u00e1b embarked on a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he openly declared his claims to the Sharif of Mecca. The first news coverage of these events in the West was in 1845 by \"The Times\", followed by others in 1850 in the United States. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to come to America was in 1892. Several Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed books and pamphlets make mention of the Millerites, the prophecies used by Miller and the Great Disappointment, most notably William Sears's \"Thief in the Night\".\nRestorationism (Christian primitivism).\nEnd times theology is also significant to restorationist Christian religions, which consider themselves distinct from both Catholicism and Protestantism.\nJehovah's Witnesses.\nThe eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses is central to their religious beliefs. They believe Jesus Christ has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe was prophesied in the Bible) and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred, resulting in God's selection of the Bible Students associated with Charles Taze Russell as his people in 1919. They also believe that the destruction of those who reject the Bible's message and thus willfully refuse to obey God will shortly take place at Armageddon, ensuring that the beginning of the new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.\nThe religion's doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic claims regarding the years 1799, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918 and 1925 made in the Watch Tower Society's publications between 1879 and 1924. Claims about the significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the beginning of the \"last days\", the destruction of worldly governments and the earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned. In 1922 the society's principal magazine, \"The Watchtower\", described its chronology as \"no stronger than its weakest link\", but also claimed the chronological relationships to be \"of divine origin and divinely corroborated... in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct\" and \"indisputable facts\", and repudiation of Russell's teachings was described as \"equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord\".\nThe Watch Tower Society has acknowledged its early leaders promoted \"incomplete, even inaccurate concepts\". The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible. It says that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who did not understand the meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower Society literature often cites Proverbs 4:18, \"The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established\" (NWT) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during \"the time of the end\", and that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower Society publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God's Kingdom and that they do not call their core beliefs into question.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe there will be a Second Coming of Jesus to the earth at some time in the future. The LDS Church and its leaders do not make any predictions of the date of the Second Coming.\nAccording to church doctrine, the true gospel will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming. They also believe there will be increasing war, wickedness, earthquakes, hurricanes, and man-made disasters prior to the Second Coming. Disasters of all kind will happen before Christ comes. Upon the return of Jesus Christ, all people will be resurrected, the righteous in a first resurrection and the unrighteous in a second, later resurrection. Christ shall reign for a period of 1000 years, after which the Final Judgment will occur.\nRealized eschatology.\nRealized eschatology is a Christian eschatological theory that holds that the eschatological passages in the New Testament do not refer to the future, but instead refer to the ministry of Jesus and his lasting legacy.\nIslam.\nMuslims believe there are three periods before the Day of Judgment with some debate as to whether the periods could overlap.\nSunni.\nSunnis believe the dead will then stand in a grand assembly, awaiting a scroll detailing their righteous deeds, sinful acts and ultimate judgment. Muhammad will be the first to be resurrected. Punishments will include \"adhab\", or severe pain and embarrassment, and \"khizy\" or shame. There will also be a punishment of the grave between death and the resurrection. Several Sunni scholars explain some of the signs metaphorically.\nThe signs of the coming end time are divided into major and minor signs:\nFollowing the second period, the third is said to be marked by the ten major signs known as \"alamatu's-sa'ah al- kubra\" (The major signs of the end). They are as follows:\nShia.\nMany of the signs shown above are shared by both Sunni and Shia beliefs, with some exceptions, e.g. Imam Al-Mahdi defeating Al-Masih ad-Dajjal.\nConcepts and terminology in Shia eschatology include Mi'ad, the Occultation, Al-Yamani, and Sufyani. In Twelver Shia narrations about the last days, the literature largely revolves around Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is considered by many beliefs to be the true twelfth appointed successor to Muhammad. Muhammad al-Mahdi will help mankind against the deception by the \"Dajjal\" who will try to get people in to a new world religion which is called \"the great deception\".\nAhmadiyya.\nAhmadiyya is considered distinct from mainstream Islam. In its writing, the present age has been witness to the evil of man and wrath of God, with war and natural disaster. Ghulam Ahmad is seen as the promised Messiah and the Mahdi, fulfilling Islamic and Biblical prophecies, as well as scriptures of other religions such as Hinduism. His teaching will establish spiritual reform and establish an age of peace. This will continue for a thousand years, and will unify mankind under one faith.\nAhmadis believe that despite harsh and strong opposition and discrimination they will eventually be triumphant and their message vindicated both by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Ahmadis also incorporate the eschatological views from other religions into their doctrine and believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmed falls into this sequence.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, creation has neither a beginning nor an end; Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard the eschatologies of other religions as symbolic. In Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed belief, human time is marked by a series of progressive revelations in which successive messengers or prophets come from God. The coming of each of these messengers is seen as the day of judgment to the adherents of the previous religion, who may choose to accept the new messenger and enter the \"heaven\" of belief, or denounce the new messenger and enter the \"hell\" of denial. In this view, the terms \"heaven\" and \"hell\" become symbolic terms for a person's spiritual progress and their nearness to or distance from God. In Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed belief, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (1817\u20131892), the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, was the Second Coming of Christ and also the fulfilment of previous eschatological expectations of Islam and other major religions.\nThe inception of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith coincides with Great Disappointment of the Millerite prophecy in 1844.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 taught that Armageddon would begin in 1914, but without a clear indication of its end date. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds believe that the mass martyrdom anticipated during the \"End Times\" had already passed within the historical context of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds expect their faith to be eventually embraced by the masses of the world, ushering in a golden age.\nRastafari.\nRastafari have a unique interpretation of end times, based on the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. They believe Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I to be God incarnate, the \"King of kings\" and \"Lord of lords\" mentioned in Revelation 5:5. They saw the crowning of Selassie as the second coming, and the Second Italo-Ethiopian War as fulfillment of Revelation. There is also the expectation that Selassie will return for a day of judgment and bring home the \"lost children of Israel\", which in Rastafari refers to those taken from Africa through the slave trade. There will then be an era of peace and harmony at Mount Zion in Africa.\nCyclic cosmology.\nHinduism.\nThe Vaishnavite tradition links contemporary Hindu eschatology to the figure of Kalki, the tenth and last avatar of Vishnu. Many Hindus believe that before the age draws to a close, Kalki will reincarnate as Shiva and simultaneously dissolve and regenerate the universe. Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.\nIn Hindu eschatology, time is cyclic and consists of kalpas. Each lasts 4.1\u20138.2 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for Brahma, who will be alive for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. Within a \"kalpa\" there are periods of creation, preservation and decline. After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a singularity and then again will expand from that single point, as the ages continue in a religious fractal pattern.\nWithin the current kalpa, there are four epochs that encompass the cycle. They progress from a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total corruption. The last of the four ages is Kali Yuga (which most Hindus believe is the current time), characterized by quarrel, hypocrisy, impiety, violence and decay. The four pillars of dharma will be reduced to one, with truth being all that remains. As written in the Gita:\n&lt;poem&gt;\"Yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nirbhavati Bh\u0101rata\"\n\"Abhyutth\u0101nam adharmasya tad\u0101tm\u0101nam s\u1e5bj\u0101myaham\"\nO descendant of Bharata, whenever there is a decline of religion and an increase in irreligion, at that time I manifest My eternally perfect form in this mundane world.&lt;/poem&gt;\nAt this time of chaos, the final avatar, Kalki, endowed with eight superhuman faculties will appear on a white horse. Kalki will amass an army to \"establish righteousness upon the earth\" and leave \"the minds of the people as pure as crystal.\"\nAt the completion of Kali Yuga, the next Yuga Cycle will begin with a new Satya Yuga, in which all will once again be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma. This, in turn, will be followed by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will then repeat until the larger cycle of existence under Brahma returns to the singularity, and a new universe is born.\nThe cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagueries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief.\nBuddhism.\nThere is no classic account of beginning or end\nin Buddhism; Masao Abe attributes this to the absence of God.\nHistory is embedded in the continuing process of samsara or the \"beginningless and endless cycles of birth-death-rebirth\". Buddhists believe there is an end to things but it is not final because they are bound to be born again. However, the writers of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures establish a specific end-time account in Buddhist tradition: this describes the return of Maitreya Buddha, who would bring about an end to the world. This constitutes one of the two major branches of Buddhist eschatology, with the other being the Sermon of the Seven Suns. End time in Buddhism could also involve a cultural eschatology covering \"final things\", which include the idea that Sakyamuni Buddha's dharma will also come to an end.\nMaitreya.\nThe Buddha described his teachings disappearing five thousand years from when he preached them, corresponding approximately to the year 4300 since he was born in 623 BCE. At this time, knowledge of dharma will be lost as well. The last of his relics will be gathered in Bodh Gaya and cremated. There will be a new era in which the next Buddha Maitreya will appear, but it will be preceded by the degeneration of human society. This will be a period of greed, lust, poverty, ill will, violence, murder, impiety, physical weakness, sexual depravity and societal collapse, and even the Buddha himself will be forgotten.\nThis will be followed by the coming of Maitreya when the teachings of dharma are forgotten. Maitreya was the first Bodhisattva around whom a cult developed, in approximately the third century CE.\nThe earliest known mention of Maitreya occurs in the Cakkavatti, or Sihanada Sutta in Digha Nikaya 26 of the Pali Canon. In it, Gautama Buddha predicted his teachings of dharma would be forgotten after 5,000 years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At that period, brethren, there will arise in the world an Exalted One named Maitreya, Fully Awakened, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha, even as I am now. He, by himself, will thoroughly know and see, as it were face to face, this universe, with Its worlds of the spirits, Its Brahmas and Its Maras, and Its world of recluses and Brahmins, of princes and peoples, even as I now, by myself, thoroughly know and see them.\u2014\u200a\nThe text then foretells the birth of Maitreya Buddha in the city of Ketumat\u012b in present-day Benares, whose king will be the Cakkavatt\u012b Sankha. Sankha will live in the former palace of King Mah\u0101panad\u0101, and will become a renunciate who follows Maitreya.\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya will attain \"bodhi\" in seven days, the minimum period, by virtue of his many lifetimes of preparation. Once Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati Pure Land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the Indian city of Varanasi or Benares in present-day Uttar Pradesh. In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha presides over a land of purity. For example, Amitabha presides over Sukhavati, more popularly known as the \"Western Paradise\".\nA notable teaching he will rediscover is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds\u2014killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views. The ten virtuous deeds will replace them with the abandonment of each of these practices. Edward Conze in his \"Buddhist Scriptures\" (1959) gives an account of Maitreya:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Lord replied, 'Maitreya, the best of men, will then leave the heavens and go for his last rebirth. As soon as he is born he will walk seven steps forward, and where he puts down his feet a jewel or a lotus will spring up. He will raise his eyes to the ten directions and will speak these words: \"This is my last birth. There will be no rebirth after this one. Never will I come back here, but, all pure, I shall win Nirvana.\"'\u2014\u200a\nMaitreya currently resides in Tushita, but will come to Jambudvipa when needed most as successor to the historic \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha. Maitreya will achieve complete enlightenment during his lifetime, and following this reawakening he will bring back the timeless teaching of dharma to this plane and rediscover enlightenment. The Arya Maitreya Mandala, founded in 1933 by Lama Anagarika Govinda, is based on the idea of Maitreya.\nMaitreya eschatology forms the central canon of the White Lotus Society, a religious and political movement which emerged in Yuan China. It later branched into the Chinese underground criminal organization known as the Triads, which exist today as an international underground criminal network. \nNote that no description of Maitreya occurs in any other sutta in the canon, casting doubt as to the authenticity of the scripture. In addition, sermons of the Buddha normally are in response to a question, or in a specific context, but this sutta has a beginning and an ending, and its content is quite different from the others. This has led some to conclude that the whole sutta is apocryphal, or tampered with.\nSermon of the Seven Suns.\nIn his \"Sermon of the Seven Suns\" in the Pali Canon, the Buddha describes the ultimate fate of the Earth in an apocalypse characterized by the consequent appearance of seven suns in the sky, each causing progressive ruin until the planet is destroyed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe canon goes on to describe the progressive destruction of each sun. The third sun will dry the Ganges River and other rivers, whilst the fourth will cause the lakes to evaporate; the fifth will dry the oceans. Later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe sermon completes with the Earth immersed into an extensive holocaust. The Pali Canon does not indicate when this will happen relative to Maitreya.\nNorse mythology.\nNorse mythology depicts the end of days as \"Ragnar\u00f6k\", an Old Norse term translatable as \"twilight of the gods\". It will be heralded by a devastation known as Fimbulvetr which will seize Midgard in cold and darkness. The sun and moon will disappear from the sky, and poison will fill the air. The dead will rise from the ground and there will be widespread despair.\nThen there will be a battle between\u2014on the one hand\u2014the Gods with the \u00c6sir, Vanir and Einherjar, led by Odin, and\u2014on the other hand\u2014forces of Chaos, including the fire giants and j\u00f6tunn, led by Loki. In the fighting Odin will be swallowed whole by his old nemesis Fenrir. The god Freyr fights Surtr but loses. V\u00ed\u00f0arr, son of Odin, will then avenge his father by ripping Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The serpent J\u00f6rmungandr will open its gaping maw and be met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin, will defeat the serpent, only to take nine steps afterwards before collapsing in his own death.\nAfter this people will flee their homes as the sun blackens and the earth sinks into the sea. The stars will vanish, steam will rise, and flames will touch the heavens. This conflict will result in the deaths of most of the major Gods and forces of Chaos. Finally, Surtr will fling fire across the nine worlds. The ocean will then completely submerge Midgard.\nAfter the cataclysm, the world will resurface new and fertile, and the surviving Gods will meet. Baldr, another son of Odin, will be reborn in the new world, according to V\u00f6lusp\u00e1. The two human survivors, L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir, will then repopulate this new earth.\nEgyptian mythology.\nEgyptian texts typically treat the dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. However, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles of renewal, is destined to end. This end is described in a passage in the \"Coffin Texts\" and a more explicit one in the \"Book of the Dead\", in which Atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. All things other than the creator will cease to exist, except Osiris, who will survive along with him. Details about this eschathological prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with Osiris. Yet with the creator god and the god of renewal together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there is the potential for a new creation to arise in the same manner as the old.\nNo end times.\nTaoism.\nThe Taoist faith is not concerned with what came before or after life, knowing only their own being in the Tao. The philosophy is that people come and go, just like mountains, trees and stars, but Tao will go on for time immemorial.\nAnalogies in science and philosophy.\nResearchers in futures studies and transhumanists investigate how the accelerating rate of scientific progress may lead to a \"technological singularity\" in the future that would profoundly and unpredictably change the course of human history, and result in \"Homo sapiens\" no longer being the dominant life form on Earth.\nOccasionally the term \"physical eschatology\" is applied to the long-term predictions of astrophysics about the future of Earth and ultimate fate of the universe. In approximately 6 billion years, the Sun will turn into a red giant. Life on Earth will become impossible due to a rise in temperature long before the planet is possibly actually swallowed up by the Sun or left charred. Later, the Sun will become a white dwarf.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Ancient Aztec eschatology\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
