{"id": "6591", "revid": "4490355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6591", "title": "Crete", "text": "Largest Greek island\nCrete ( ; , , ) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 90th largest island in the world, and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus, and Corsica. Crete is located approximately south of the Peloponnese, and about southwest of Anatolia. Crete has an area of and a coastline of 1,046\u00a0km (650\u00a0mi). It bounds the southern border of the Aegean Sea, with the Sea of Crete (or North Cretan Sea) to the north and the Libyan Sea (or South Cretan Sea) to the south. Crete covers 260\u00a0km from west to east but is narrow from north to south, spanning three degrees of longitude but only half a degree of latitude.\nCrete and its surrounding islands and islets form the Region of Crete (), which is the southernmost of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece, and the fifth most populous of Greece's regions. Its capital and largest city is Heraklion, located on the island's north shore. As of 2021[ [update]], the region had a population of 624,408. The Dodecanese are located to the northeast of Crete, while the Cyclades are situated to the north, separated by the Sea of Crete. \nCrete was the center of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was subsequently ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Byzantine Empire again, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913. In Greek mythology, Crete is best known as the birthplace of the Greek god Zeus.\nCrete is predominantly mountainous, characterized by a range that crosses the island from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, Mount Ida, and the range of the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above in altitude and the Samaria Gorge, a World Biosphere Reserve. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own poetry and music). The Nikos Kazantzakis airport at Heraklion and the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania serve international travelers. The Minoan palace at Knossos is also located in Heraklion.\nName.\nThe earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating from the 18th century BC, where the island is referred to as \"Kaptara\". This is repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and the Bible (\"Caphtor\"). It was known in ancient Egyptian as or , strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.\nThe current name \"Crete\" is first attested in the 15th century BC in Mycenaean Greek texts, written in Linear B, through the words \"ke-re-te\" , *\"Kr\u0113tes\"; later Greek: , plural of ) and \"ke-re-si-jo\" , *\"Kr\u0113sijos\"; later Greek: , 'Cretian'). In Ancient Greek, the name Crete () first appears in Homer's \"Odyssey\". Its etymology is unknown. One proposal derives it from a hypothetical Luwian word (compare 'island', 'cutting, sliver'). Another proposal suggests that it derives from the ancient Greek word \"\"\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03ae\" (krataie\u0305)\", meaning strong or powerful, the reasoning being that Crete was the strongest thalassocracy during ancient times.\nIn Latin, the name of the island became . The original Arabic name of Crete was ( &lt; , but after the Emirate of Crete's establishment of its new capital at (modern Heraklion; , ), both the city and the island became known as () or (), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian , from which were derived French and English \"Candy\" or \"Candia\". Under Ottoman rule, in Ottoman Turkish, Crete was called (). In the Hebrew Bible, Crete is referred to as () \"kretim\".\nPhysical geography and climate.\nCrete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located south of almost the rest of the country, in the southern part of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea.\nIsland morphology.\nThe island has an elongated shape: it spans from east to west, is at its widest point, and narrows to as little as (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of , with a coastline of ; to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (); to the south, the Libyan Sea (); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Carpathian Sea. It lies approximately south of the Greek mainland.\nThere are a number of peninsulas and gulfs on the north side of Crete, from west to east these include: Gramvousa peninsula, gulf of Kissamos, Rodopos peninsula, gulf of Chania, Akrotiri peninsula, Souda Bay, Apokoronas cape, gulf of Almiros, gulf of Heraklion, Aforesmenos cape, gulf of Mirabello, gulf of Sitia and the Sideros peninsula. On the south side of Crete is the gulf of Messaras and Cape Lithinon.\nMountains and valleys.\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:\nThese mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus); and a number of gorges.\nThe mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic and moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. \nFor residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.\nGorges, rivers and lakes.\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the Samari\u00e1 Gorge, Imbros Gorge, Kourtaliotiko Gorge, Ha Gorge, Platania Gorge, the Gorge of the Dead (at Kato Zakros, Sitia) and Richtis Gorge and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in Sitia.\nThe rivers of Crete include the Geropotamos River, the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, the Keritis, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake Kournas and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit. Lake Voulismeni at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi. Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of Aposelemis Dam, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.\nSurrounding islands.\n \nA large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands includes:\nOff the south coast, the island of Gavdos is located south of Hora Sfakion and is the southernmost point of Europe.\nClimate.\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the semi-arid climate, mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily a hot-summer Mediterranean (\"Csa\") climate while some areas in the south and east have a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"BSh\"). The higher elevations fall into the cold-summer Mediterranean climate category (\"Csc\"), while some of the mountain peaks (&gt;2,000 meters) may feature a continental climate (\"Dfb\" or \"Dfc\"). The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and April, but rare in most low-lying areas.\nThe south coast, including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains enjoy significantly more sunny days and, on average, higher temperatures throughout the year. There, date palms bear fruit, and swallows remain year-round. The fertile region around Ierapetra, on the southeastern corner of the island, has year-round agricultural production, with summer vegetable and fruit produced in greenhouses throughout the year. Western Crete (Chania province) receives more rain and the soil there suffers more erosion compared to the Eastern part of Crete.\nAverage annual temperatures reach up to 22.0\u00a0\u00b0C in Tris Ekklisies and Psari Forada which are located in South Crete. Crete holds the record for the highest temperatures ever recorded in Europe during October, November, January and February among W.M.O. stations. \n According to the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, South Crete receives the most sunshine in Greece with more than 3,257 hours of sunshine per year.\nHuman geography.\nCrete is the most populous island in Greece, with a population of over 600,000. Approximately 42% of residents live in the island's main cities and towns, while 45% reside in rural areas.\nAdministration.\nCrete with its nearby islands form the Crete Region (, , ), one of the 13 regions of Greece which were established in the 1987 administrative reform. Under the 2010 Kallikratis plan, the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at Heraklion and is divided into four regional units (pre-Kallikratis prefectures). From west to east these are: Chania, Rethymno, Heraklion, and Lasithi. These are further subdivided into 24 municipalities.\nSince 1 January 2011, the regional governor is Stavros Arnaoutakis of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement. First elected in 2010, he was re-elected in 2014, 2019 and 2023.\nCities.\nHeraklion is the largest city and capital of Crete, holding more than a fourth of the island's population. Chania was the capital until 1971. The principal cities are:\nDemographics.\nAccording to official census data by the Hellenic Statistical Authority, the region's population has increased by 1,343 people between 2011 and 2021, experiencing a rise of 0.22%. The island is home to 308,608 men and 315,800 women, accounting for 49.4% and 50.6% of the population respectively.\n&lt;graph&gt;{\n \"version\": 2,\n \"width\": 350,\n \"height\": 150,\n \"data\": [\n \"name\": \"table\",\n \"values\": [\n \"x\": 1981,\n \"y\": 502\n {\n \"x\": 1991,\n \"y\": 540\n {\n \"x\": 2001,\n \"y\": 601\n {\n \"x\": 2011,\n \"y\": 623\n {\n \"x\": 2021,\n \"y\": 624\n ]\n ],\n \"scales\": [\n \"name\": \"x\",\n \"type\": \"linear\",\n \"range\": \"width\",\n \"zero\": false,\n \"domain\": {\n \"data\": \"table\",\n \"field\": \"x\"\n },\n \"name\": \"y\",\n \"type\": \"linear\",\n \"range\": \"height\",\n \"nice\": true,\n \"domain\": {\n \"data\": \"table\",\n \"field\": \"y\"\n \"axes\": [\n \"type\": \"x\",\n \"scale\": \"x\"\n {\n \"type\": \"y\",\n \"scale\": \"y\"\n ],\n \"marks\": [\n \"type\": \"line\",\n \"from\": {\n \"data\": \"table\"\n \"properties\": {\n \"enter\": {\n \"x\": {\n \"scale\": \"x\",\n \"field\": \"x\"\n \"y\": {\n \"scale\": \"y\",\n \"field\": \"y\"\n \"y2\": {\n \"scale\": \"y\",\n \"value\": 0\n \"interpolate\": {\n \"value\": \"monotone\"\n \"stroke\": {\n \"value\": \"steelblue\"\n \"strokeWidth\": {\n \"value\": 3\n}&lt;/graph&gt;The island is divided into four regional units, Heraklion, Rethymno, Chania, and Lasithi.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself without a tourism industry. The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\nAs in many regions of Greece, viticulture and olive groves are significant; oranges, citrons, avocadoes and bananas are also cultivated. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of specialty cheeses such as mizithra, anthotyros, and kefalotyri. 20% of Greek wine is produced in Crete, mostly in the region of Peza.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.\nTransport infrastructure.\nAirports.\nThe island has three significant airports, Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion, the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania and the smaller Sitia airport. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. Nikos Kazantzakis was Greece\u2019s second-busiest airport through the year of 2024. Work has begun plan to replace Heraklion airport with a new airport at Kasteli, where there is presently an air force base, and the new Kasteli Airport is due to open by 2027.\nFerries.\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from Piraeus, by ferry companies such as Minoan Lines and ANEK Lines with links to the Cyclades and Dodecanese islands. Seajets also operates routes to Cyclades.\nThe main ports from west to east are at Kissamos (ferry link to Peloponnese), Souda (Chania), Rethymno, Heraklion (links to Cyclades), Agios Nikolaos and Sitia (link to Dodecanese).\nRoad network.\nMost of Crete is served by the road network. A modern highway is currently being upgraded along the north coast connecting the four major cities (A90 motorway), the sections bypassing the main cities (Heraklion to Malia, Rethymno, Chania to Kolymvari) are at motorway standard, while the sections in between, and west to Kissamos and east to Sitia, should be completed by 2028. A link will also connect to the new Kasteli international airport .\nIn addition, a European Union study has been devised to promote a modern highway to connect the northern and southern parts of the island via a tunnel. The study proposal includes a section of road between the villages of Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete's largest city Heraklion, which houses the island's biggest airport and ferry links with mainland Greece.\nRailway.\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.\nDevelopment.\nThe construction sector in Crete responded well during the pandemic and has come out strong in the post-recession recovery period. Total construction spending recovered and is expected to peak a record high (approximately 8% higher than 2019 average levels) signalling consistent expansion in construction projects and real estate investments in Crete. The evolution of the private sector in Crete is tightly linked with the demand for tourism-related investments. Moreover, the recovery of the tourism sector is expected to lead to further growth in housing prices and rental demand.\nNewspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, South Korea, Dubai Ports World and China for the construction of a large international container port and free trade zone in southern Crete near Tympaki; the plan is to expropriate of land. The port would handle two\u00a0million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact. As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to approve it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.\nThere are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus: EuroAfrica Interconnector and EuroAsia Interconnector. They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece, ending energy isolation of Crete. At present Greece covers electricity cost differences for Crete of around \u20ac300\u00a0million per year.\nHistory.\nIn the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Emirate of Crete, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. After a brief period of independence (1897\u20131913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\nPrehistory.\nStone tools suggest that archaic humans may have visited Crete as early as 130,000 years ago, but there is no evidence of permanent settlement of the island until the Neolithic, around 7,000 BCE. Settlements dating to the aceramic Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC, used cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs as well as domesticated cereals and legumes; ancient Knossos was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later Minoan) sites. Other neolithic settlements include those at Kephala, Magasa, Trapeza and Gortyn.\nMinoan civilization.\nDuring the Bronze Age, Crete was the centre of the Minoan civilization, notable for its art, its writing systems such as Linear A, and for its massive building complexes including the palace at Knossos. Its economy benefited from a network of trade around much of the Mediterranean, and Minoan cultural influence extended to Cyprus, Canaan, and Egypt.\nMycenaean civilization.\nIn 1420\u00a0BC, the Minoan civilization was subsumed by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by Michael Ventris, is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425\u20131375\u00a0BC.\nArchaic and Classical period.\nAfter the Bronze Age collapse, Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the Archaic period. There was limited contact with mainland Greece, and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete, so there are few literary references about the island or its people.\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The Gortyn code (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified civil law established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights. In the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, Gortyn, Kydonia (Chania), Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two opposing coalitions of cities. As a result, the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC), when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs. In the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (Ierapetra) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\nRoman rule.\nCrete was involved in the Mithridatic Wars, initially repelling an attack by Roman general Marcus Antonius Creticus in 71\u00a0BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, equipped with three legions. Crete was conquered by Rome in 69\u00a0BC, earning for Metellus the title \"Creticus\". Gortyn was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with Cyrenaica that was called Creta et Cyrenaica. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire. In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the Panhellenion, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.\nByzantine Empire \u2013 first period.\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica c.\u2009297. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by Vandals in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by Slavs in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In c.\u2009732, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the Pope to that of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nArab rule.\nIn the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman island, Crete was captured by Andalusian Muwallads led by Abu Hafs, who established the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960\u201361, Nikephoros Phokas' campaign restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control. Muslim inhabitants were either killed or carried off into slavery, while the island's last emir Abd al-Aziz ibn Shu'ayb (Kouroupas) and his son al-Numan (Anemas) were taken captive and brought to Constantinople, where Phokas celebrated a triumph. The island was converted into a Byzantine theme, and the remaining Muslims were converted to Christianity by missionaries like Nikon \"the Metanoeite\".\nByzantine Empire \u2013 second period.\nIn 961, Nikephoros Phokas returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon \"the Metanoeite\". The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.\nIn 1204, the Fourth Crusade seized and sacked the imperial capital of Constantinople. Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader Boniface of Montferrat in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the Republic of Venice, whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the Republic of Genoa immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.\nVenetian rule.\nFrom 1212, during Venice's rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a Renaissance swept through the island as is evident from the artistic works dating to that period. Known as The Cretan School or Post-Byzantine Art, it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. This included the painter El Greco and the writers Nicholas Kalliakis (1645\u20131707), Georgios Kalafatis (professor) (c.\u20091652\u20131720), Andreas Musalus (c.\u20091665\u20131721) and Vitsentzos Kornaros.\nIn total, about 10,000 Venetians are estimated to have moved to Crete during the first century of Venetian rule\u2014by comparison, Venice itself had a population of c.\u200960,000 at this period. The colonization wave of 1252 also resulted in the establishment of Canea (modern Chania), on the site of the long abandoned ancient city of Kydonia.\nUnder the rule of the Catholic Venetians, the city of Candia (modern Heraklion) was reputed to be the best fortified city of the Eastern Mediterranean. The three main forts were located at Gramvousa, Spinalonga, and Fortezza at Rethymnon. Other fortifications include the Kazarma fortress at Sitia and Frangokastello in Sfakia.\nIn 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island. In 1574\u201377, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and Inquisitor. According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population. Marco Foscarini was the Doge of Venice during this time.\nOttoman rule.\nThe Ottomans conquered Crete (Girit Ey\u00e2leti) in 1669, after the siege of Candia with the last Venetian strongholds off Crete falling in the last Ottoman\u2013Venetian War in 1715. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the Republic of Venice after the Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars, some even prospering such as the family of Simone Stratigo (c. 1733 \u2013 c. 1824) who migrated to Dalmatia from Crete in 1669.\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where the elite were gathered. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\" following its destruction after the Siege of Candia.\nIslamic presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the Arab occupation, was cemented by the Ottoman conquest. Most Cretan Muslims were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan Greek, but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks. Contemporary estimates vary, but in 1830, as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim. \nDuring the Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774), a revolt against Ottoman rule in Crete was started by Daskalogiannis, a shipowner from Sfakia who was promised support by the Russian navy which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. On 17 June 1771 Daskalogiannis was, in the full daylight of publicity, tortured, skinned alive and then beaten to death, an ordeal that he endured in complete silence. Today, Chania International Airport is named after him.\nDuring the Greek War of Independence, Sultan Mahmud II granted rule over Crete to Egypt's \"de facto\" ruler Muhammad Ali Pasha in exchange for his military support. Crete was subsequently left out of the new Greek state established under the London Protocol of 1830. Its administration by Muhammad Ali was confirmed in the Convention of K\u00fctahya of 1833, but direct Ottoman rule was re-established by the Convention of London of 3 July 1840.\nThe Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869 or Great Cretan Revolution () was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the \"Holocaust of Arkadi\". The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the Arkadi Monastery, which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. \nIn addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, under orders from the\u00a0hegumen\u00a0(abbot) of the monastery, the Cretans blew up barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than surrender. The subsequent explosion resulted the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there. Thirty-six insurgents had found refuge in the refectory, near the ammunitions. Discovered by the Ottomans, who forced the door, they were massacred.\nCretan State and union with Greece.\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the Great Powers decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the near future.\nIn September 1898 the Candia massacre in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians and 14 British servicemen dead at the hands of Muslim irregulars. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, Prince George of Greece, appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898. The flag of the Cretan State was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.\nIn 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos over the question of the \"enosis\" (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the Theriso revolt, one of the leaders being Eleftherios Venizelos. Prince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece. With the outbreak of the First Balkan War, the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.\nSecond World War.\nDuring World War II, the island was the scene of the Battle of Crete in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and Adolf Hitler forbade further large-scale paratroop operations for the rest of the war.\nDuring the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the Massacre of Kondomari and the Viannos massacres. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.\nFollowing the collapse of fronts elsewhere in Europe, German forces evacuated most of Crete in October 1944 leaving an area including Chania under occupation. The following year the day after VE Day the remaining Germans under Generalmajor Hans-Georg Benthack surrendered at Knossos to British Major-General Colin Callander, refusing to surrender to the Greek army, for fear of retaliations.\nCivil War.\nIn the aftermath of the Dekemvriana in Athens, Cretan leftists were targeted by the right-wing paramilitary organization National Organization of Rethymno (EOR), which engaged in attacks in the villages of Koxare and Melampes, as well as Rethymno in January 1945. Those attacks did not escalate into a full-scale insurgency as they did in the Greek mainland and the Cretan ELAS did not surrender its weapons after the Treaty of Varkiza. An uneasy truce was maintained until 1947, with a series of arrests of notable communists in Chania and Heraklion. Encouraged by orders from the central organization in Athens, KKE launched an insurgency in Crete; marking the beginning of the Greek Civil War on the island. In eastern Crete the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) struggled to establish its presence in Dikti and Psilorites. On 1 July 1947, the surviving 55 fighters of DSE were ambushed south of Psilorites, the few surviving members of the unit managed to join the rest of DSE in Lefka Ori.\nThe Lefka Ori region in the west offered more favourable conditions for DSE's insurgency. In the summer of 1947 DSE raided and looted the Maleme Airport and motor depot at Chrysopigi. Its numbers swelled to approximately 300 fighters. The rise of DSE numbers compounded with crop failure on the island created serious logistical issues for the insurgents. The communists resorted to cattle rustling and crop confiscations which solved the problem only temporarily. In the autumn of 1947, the Greek government offered generous amnesty terms to Cretan DSE fighters and mountain bandits, many of whom opted to abandon armed struggle or defect to the nationalists. On 4 July 1948, government troops launched a large scale offensive on Samari\u00e1 Gorge. Many DSE soldiers were killed in the fighting while the survivors broke into small armed bands. In October 1948, the secretary of the Cretan KKE Giorgos Tsitilos was killed in an ambush. By the following month only 34 DSE fighters remained active in Lefka Ori. The insurgency in Crete gradually withered away, with the last two hold outs surrendering in 1974, 25 years after the conclusion of the war in mainland Greece.\nTourism.\nCrete is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. In 2023, Crete welcomed 6.3 million visitors, who stayed on average 5.4 days on the island, reflecting significant overtourism pressure on coastal infrastructure. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion make up about 20% of all charter flights in Greece. The number of hotel beds on the island increased by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991. \nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure includes a wide range of accommodation; including large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and Chania and a smaller airport in Sitia (international charter and domestic flights started in May 2012) or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, Rethimno, Agios Nikolaos and Sitia.\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of Chania, the Venetian castle at Rethymno, the gorge of Samaria, the islands of Chrysi, Elafonisi, Gramvousa, Spinalonga and the Palm Beach of Vai, which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\nTransportation.\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in Heraklion. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.\nHoliday homes and immigration.\nCrete's mild climate attracts northern Europeans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. EU citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality. In the cities of Heraklion and Chania, the average price per square metre of apartments ranges from \u20ac1,670 to \u20ac1,700. A growing number of real estate companies cater mainly to British immigrants, followed by Dutch, German, Scandinavian and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The British immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of Chania and Rethymno and to a lesser extent in Heraklion and Lasithi.\nArchaeological sites and museums.\nThe area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of Knossos, Malia (not to be confused with the town of the same name), Zakros, Petras and Phaistos, the classical site of Gortys, and the diverse archaeology of the island of Koufonisi, which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to Koufonisi has been restricted for the last few years).\nThere are museums throughout Crete, most notably the Heraklion Archaeological Museum which displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era. Other notable museums include the Maritime Museum of Crete, the Archaeological Museum of Chania, and the WW2 museum in Platinias.\nHarmful effects.\nHelen Briassoulis, in a qualitative analysis, proposed in the \"Journal of Sustainable Tourism\" that Crete is affected by tourism applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in three stages: from the period from 1960 to 1970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.\nFauna and flora.\nFauna.\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of Hercules (who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all \"harmful\" and \"venomous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the Apostle Paul, who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. The Natural History Museum of Crete, operates under the direction of the University of Crete and two aquariums \u2013 Aquaworld in Hersonissos and Cretaquarium in Gournes, display sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\nPrehistoric fauna.\nDwarf elephants, dwarf hippopotamus, dwarf mammoths, dwarf deer, and giant flightless owls were native to Pleistocene Crete. Their ancestors could have reached the island in the time of the Messinian salinity crisis.\nMammals.\nMammals of Crete include the vulnerable kri-kri, \"Capra aegagrus cretica\" that can be seen in the national park of the Samaria Gorge and on Thodorou, Dia and Agioi Pantes (islets off the north coast), the Cretan wildcat and the Cretan spiny mouse. Other terrestrial mammals include subspecies of the Cretan marten, the Cretan weasel, the Cretan badger, the Cretan wildcat, the long-eared hedgehog, and the edible dormouse.\nThe Cretan shrew, a type of white-toothed shrew is considered endemic to the island of Crete because this species of shrew is unknown elsewhere. It is a relic species of the \"Crocidura\" shrews of which fossils have been found that can be dated to the Pleistocene era. Today it can only be found in the highlands of Crete. It is considered to be the only surviving remnant of the endemic species of the Pleistocene Mediterranean islands.\nBat species include: Blasius's horseshoe bat, the lesser horseshoe bat, the greater horseshoe bat, the lesser mouse-eared bat, Geoffroy's bat, the whiskered bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle, the common pipistrelle, Savi's pipistrelle, the serotine bat, the long-eared bat, Schreibers' bat and the European free-tailed bat.\nBirds.\nVarieties of birds include eagles (can be seen in Lasithi), swallows (throughout Crete in the summer and year-round in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and common cranes (including Gavdos and Gavdopoula). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered lammergeier vulture. Bird species include: the golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, the bearded vulture or lammergeier, the griffon vulture, Eleonora's falcon, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon, European kestrel, tawny owl, little owl, hooded crow, alpine chough, red-billed chough, and the Eurasian hoopoe. The population of griffon vultures in Crete is the largest insular one of the species in the world and consists of the majority of the griffon vulture population in Greece.\nReptiles and amphibians.\nTortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains. Reptiles include the Aegean wall lizard, Balkan green lizard, common chameleon, ocellated skink, snake-eyed skink, Moorish gecko, Turkish gecko, Kotschy's gecko, spur-thighed tortoise, and the Caspian turtle. There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the leopard snake (locally known as \"ochendra\"), the Balkan whip snake (locally called \"dendrogallia\"), the dice snake (called \"nerofido\" in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal cat snake which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.\nSea turtles include the green turtle and the loggerhead turtle which are both threatened species. The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara. Amphibians include the European green toad, American bullfrog (introduced), European tree frog, and the Cretan marsh frog (endemic).\nArthropods.\nCicadas, known locally as \"tzitzikia\", make a distinctive repetitive \"tzi tzi\" http:// that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the swallowtail butterfly. There are several species of scorpion such as \"Euscorpius carpathicus\" whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.\nCrustaceans and molluscs.\nRiver crabs include the semi-terrestrial \"Potamon potamios\" crab. Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.\nSealife.\nApart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals. The endangered Mediterranean monk seal lives in almost all the coasts of the country. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts whales, sperm whales, dolphins and porpoises. The Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Squid, octopus, sea turtles and hammerhead sharks live or traverse along the coast.\nSome of the fish of the waters around Crete include: scorpion fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, Mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the flying gurnard.\nThe Cretaquarium and the Aquaworld Aquarium, are two of the three aquariums in Greece. They are located in Gournes and Hersonissos respectively.\nFlora.\nThe Minoans contributed to the deforestation of Crete. Further deforestation occurred in the 1600s \"so that no more local supplies of firewood were available\".\nCommon wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladiolus, hyacinth, iris, poppy, cyclamen and tulip, among others. There are more than 200 species of wild orchid on the island and this includes 14 varieties of \"Ophrys cretica\". Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Rare herbs include the endemic Cretan dittany and ironwort, \"Sideritis syriaca\", known as malotira (\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1). Varieties of cactus include the edible prickly pear. Common trees on the island include the chestnut, cypress, oak, olive tree, pine, plane, and tamarisk. Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.\nEnvironmentally protected areas.\nEnvironmentally protected areas include the island of Elafonisi on the coast of southwestern Crete, the palm forest of Vai in eastern Crete and the Dionysades (both in the municipality of Sitia, Lasithi). Vai has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of Chrysi, south of Ierapetra, has the largest naturally-grown \"Juniperus macrocarpa\" forest in Europe. Samaria Gorge is a World Biosphere Reserve and Richtis Gorge is protected for its landscape diversity. Also, Sitia UNESCO Global Geopark, added in 2015 in UNESCO Geoparks, is located on the easternmost edge of Crete.\nMythology.\nCrete has a strong association with ancient Greek gods but is also connected with the Minoan civilization. According to Greek mythology, the Diktaean Cave at Mount Dikti was the birthplace of the god Zeus. The Paximadia islands were the birthplace of the goddess Artemis and the god Apollo . Their mother, the goddess Leto, was worshipped at Phaistos. The goddess Athena bathed in Lake Voulismeni. Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the lizard-shaped island of Dia, which can be seen from Knossos. The islets of Lefkai were the result of a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of Souda and Leon). Heracles, in one of his labors, took the Cretan bull to the Peloponnese. Europa and Zeus made love at Gortys and conceived the kings of Crete: Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, and Minos.\nThe labyrinth of the Palace of Knossos was the setting for the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. Icarus and Daedalus were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death, King Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades, while Rhadamanthys became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\nCulture.\nCrete has its own distinctive Mantinades poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based music (typically performed with the Cretan lyra and the laouto) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the Pentozali. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 1990s onwards there has been a proliferation of cultural associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete where many focus on rizitiko singing). These associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet and engage in traditional practices. The topic of tradition and the role of cultural associations in reviving it is often debated throughout Crete.\nCretan authors have made important contributions to Greek literature throughout the modern period; major names include Vikentios Kornaros, creator of the 17th-century epic romance \"Erotokritos\" (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, Nikos Kazantzakis. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the Cretan School of icon painting, which influenced El Greco and through him subsequent European painting.\nCretans are proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (\"stivania\"), \"vr\u00e1ka\" breeches tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (\"mantili\" / \"kefalomantilo\"). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of pride, manhood and valiance.\nCretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan vendettas which persist on the island to date. Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, stemming from the era of resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun. Guns are subject to strict regulation from the Greek government, and in recent years an effort to control firearms in Crete has been undertaken by the Greek police, but with limited success.\nSports.\nCrete has many football clubs playing in the local leagues. During the 2011\u201312 season, OFI, which plays at Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium (Iraklion), and Ergotelis F.C., which plays at the Pankritio Stadium (Iraklion) were both members of the Greek Superleague. During the 2012\u201313 season, OFI, which plays at Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium (Iraklion), and Platanias F.C., which plays at the Perivolia Municipal Stadium, near Chania, are both members of the Greek Superleague.\nNotable people.\nNotable people from Crete include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name () refers to the archipelago forming a circle around the sacred island of Delos. The largest island of the Cyclades is Naxos; the most populated, however, is Syros.\nHistory.\nThe significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat sculptures carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age Minoan civilization arose in Crete to the south. (These figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.)\nA distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Chalandriani, Phylakopi, Skarkos, Saliagos and Kephala (on Kea) with signs of copperworking, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.\nArchaeology.\nThe first archaeological excavations of the 1880s, undertaken by antiquaries such as Theodore Bent at Antiparos in early 1884, were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898\u20131899 and coined the term \"Cycladic civilization\". Interest lagged, and then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood.\nAnother intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had emigrated from Anatolia c.\u20095000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.\u00a03300 \u2013 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is known as the Helladic period.\nIn recent decades the Cyclades have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.\nGeography.\nThe Cyclades includes about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santor\u00edni. There are also many minor islands (the Lesser Cyclades) including Donousa, Eschati, Gyaros, Irakleia, Koufonisia, Makronisos, Rineia, and Schoinousa. The name \"Cyclades\" refers to the islands forming a circle (\"circular islands\") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.\nErmoupoli on Syros is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.\nThe islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos, the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco. Lower temperatures are registered in higher elevations and these areas do not usually see wintry weather.\nThe Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete.\nAdministration.\nThe Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMunicipalities and communities.\nThe prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities.

{"id": "6596", "revid": "49416358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6596", "title": "Computer vision", "text": "Computerized information extraction from images\nComputer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the form of decisions. \"Understanding\" in this context signifies the transformation of visual images (the input to the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\nThe scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. Image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, 3D point clouds from LiDaR sensors, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.\nSubdisciplines of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, activity recognition, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.\nDefinition.\nComputer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. \"Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.\" As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems. Machine vision refers to a systems engineering discipline, especially in the context of factory automation. In more recent times, the terms computer vision and machine vision have converged to a greater degree.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1960s, computer vision began at universities that were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. In 1966, it was believed that this could be achieved through an undergraduate summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it \"describe what it saw\".\nWhat distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract three-dimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.\nThe next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scale-space, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields.\nBy the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than others. Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.\nRecent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks. \nThe advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.\nRelated fields.\nSolid-state physics.\nSolid-state physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible, infrared or ultraviolet light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example, motion in fluids.\nNeurobiology.\nNeurobiology has greatly influenced the development of computer vision algorithms. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and brain structures devoted to the processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse yet convoluted description of how natural vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision-related tasks. These results have led to a sub-field within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (\"e.g.\" neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in neurobiology. The Neocognitron, a neural network developed in the 1970s by Kunihiko Fukushima, is an early example of computer vision taking direct inspiration from neurobiology, specifically the primary visual cortex.\nSome strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision\u2014indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human intelligence and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate, and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, develops and describes the algorithms implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. An interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.\nSignal processing.\nYet another field related to computer vision is signal processing. Many methods for processing one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to the processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images, there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in the processing of one-variable signals. Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.\nRobotic navigation.\nRobot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot\nOther fields.\nBesides the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer vision is also used in fashion eCommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industry.\nDistinctions.\nThe fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences, and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input and output are both images, whereas in computer vision, the input is an image or video, and the output could be an enhanced image, an analysis of the image's content, or even a system's behavior based on that analysis.\nComputer graphics produces image data from 3D models, and computer vision often produces 3D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, \"e.g.\", as explored in augmented reality.\nThe following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:\nPhotogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision.\nApplications.\nApplications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer-vision applications, computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:\nFor 2024, the leading areas of computer vision were industry (market size US$5.22 billion), medicine (market size US$2.6 billion), military (market size US$996.2 million).\nMedicine.\nOne of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is the detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes, and a variety of dental pathologies; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information: \"e.g.\", about the structure of the brain or the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also include enhancement of images interpreted by humans\u2014ultrasonic images or X-ray images, for example\u2014to reduce the influence of noise.\nMachine vision.\nA second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is a measurement of the position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in the agricultural processes to remove undesirable foodstuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.\nMilitary.\nThe obvious examples are the detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as \"battlefield awareness\", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene that can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.\nAutonomous vehicles.\nOne of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars, or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer-vision-based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment (SLAM), for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task-specific events, \"e.g.\", a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, cameras and LiDAR sensors in vehicles, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, \"e.g.\", NASA's \"Curiosity\" and CNSA's \"Yutu-2\" rover.\nTactile feedback.\nMaterials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting microundulations and calibrating robotic hands. Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins are being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data on imperfections on a very large surface. Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.\nOther application areas include:\nTypical tasks.\nEach of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.\nComputer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, \"e.g.\", in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\nRecognition.\nThe classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of recognition problem are described in the literature.\nCurrently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and 1000 object classes used in the competition. Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on the stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras). By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.\nSeveral specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:\nMotion analysis.\nSeveral tasks relate to motion estimation, where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene or even of the camera that produces the images. Examples of such tasks are:\nScene reconstruction.\nGiven one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a 3D model of the scene. In the simplest case, the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model. The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models.\nImage restoration.\nImage restoration comes into the picture when the original image is degraded or damaged due to some external factors like lens wrong positioning, transmission interference, low lighting or motion blurs, etc., which is referred to as noise. When the images are degraded or damaged, the information to be extracted from them also gets damaged. Therefore, we need to recover or restore the image as it was intended to be. The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters, such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look to distinguish them from noise. By first analyzing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.\nAn example in this field is inpainting.\nSystem methods.\nThe organization of a computer vision system is highly application-dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.\nMore complex features may be related to texture, shape, or motion.\nImage-understanding systems.\nImage-understanding systems (IUS) include three levels of abstraction as follows: low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions; intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.\nThe representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.\nWhile inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.\nHardware.\nThere are many kinds of computer vision systems; however, all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (camera, ccd, etc.), a processor, and control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism. In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system. Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment. Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories, such as camera supports, cables, and connectors.\nMost computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).\nA few computer vision systems use image-acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both, such as structured-light 3D scanners, thermographic cameras, hyperspectral imagers, radar imaging, lidar scanners, magnetic resonance images, side-scan sonar, synthetic aperture sonar, etc. Such hardware captures \"images\" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.\nWhile traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second. For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms. When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realized.\nEgocentric vision systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective.\nAs of 2016, vision processing units are emerging as a new class of processors to complement CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) in this role.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many curries are found in the cuisines of countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia. \nIn medieval India, proto-curries were flavoured with mild spices such as asafoetida, cardamom, coriander, cumin, and ginger, with the modest heat of black pepper. A definite step in the creation of modern curry was the arrival in India of spicy hot chili peppers, along with other ingredients such as tomatoes and potatoes, part of the Columbian exchange of plants between the Old World and the New World. The Mughal empire brought new subtly-spiced dishes, especially to the north of India. During the British Raj, Anglo-Indian cuisine developed, leading to Hannah Glasse's 18th century recipe for \"currey the India way\" in England. Curry was then spread in the 19th century by indentured Indian sugar workers to the Caribbean, and by British traders to Japan. Further exchanges around the world made curry a fully international dish.\nMany types of curry exist in different countries. In Southeast Asia, curry often contains a spice paste and coconut milk. In India, the spices are fried in oil or ghee to create a paste; this may be combined with a water-based broth, or sometimes with milk or coconut milk. In China and Korea, curries are based on a commercial curry powder. Curry restaurants outside their native countries often adapt their cuisine to suit local tastes; for instance, Thai restaurants in the West sell red, yellow, and green curries with chili peppers of those colours, often combined with additional spices of the same colours. In Britain, curry is a popular dish with some types adopted from India, others modified or wholly invented, as with chicken tikka masala, created by British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 20th century.\nEtymology.\nThe English word curry is derived from a Dravidian root, possibly by way of Dutch carrijl, Portuguese caris or caril, or some combination of these. The Dravidian source may be Tamil \"ka\u1e5fi\", (\"a spiced mixture with fish, meat or vegetable, eaten with boiled rice\"), or a mingled borrowing from multiple Dravidian languages. Other Dravidian languages, namely Malayalam (\u0d15\u0d31\u0d3f \"kari\", \"hot condiments; meats, vegetables\"), Middle Kannada, Kodava, and Telugu have similar words.\n\"Ka\u1e5fi\" is described in a 17th-century Portuguese cookbook, based on trade with Tamil merchants along the Coromandel Coast of southeast India, becoming known as a \"spice blend... called \"kari podi\" or curry powder\". The first appearance in its anglicised form (spelt \"currey\") was in Hannah Glasse's 1747 book \"The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy\".\nThe term \"curry\" is not derived from the name of the curry tree, although some curries do include curry leaves among many other spices. The cookery writer Pat Chapman noted the similarity of the words \"Karahi\" or \"Kadai\", an Indian cooking dish shaped like a wok, without giving evidence. \"Curry\" is not related to the word \"cury\" in \"The Forme of Cury\", a 1390s English cookbook; that term comes from the Middle French word \"cuire\", meaning 'to cook'.\nCultural exchanges.\nAncient spice trade in Asia.\nBy 1500 BCE, seafaring merchants from Austronesian communities were already trading spices across the ocean. They sailed between South Asia and East Asia, especially the ports along southeastern India and Sri Lanka, creating some of the world's earliest maritime trade networks. Archaeological discoveries at Mohenjo-daro show that people were using mortar and pestle to grind spices as early as 2600 BCE. They pounded cumin, fennel, garlic, ginger, mustard, black peppercorns, saffron, sesame seed, tamarind pods, and turmeric to create spicy flavourings for their food, which included meat, fish, grains, pulses, and fruits. Black pepper is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE. The three basic ingredients of the spicy stew were ginger, garlic, and turmeric. Using starch grain analysis, archaeologists identified the residue of these spices in both skeletons and pottery shards from excavations in India, finding that turmeric and ginger were present, in what have been called \"proto-curries\". Sauces in India before Columbus could contain black pepper or long pepper to provide a little heat, but not chili, so they were not spicy hot by modern standards.\nMedieval Indian proto-curries.\nBefore Christopher Columbus, Indian dishes were sometimes spicy but they were never hot like many modern curries, as chili peppers were absent, along with tomatoes, potatoes, bell peppers and squashes. The proto-curries of medieval pre-Columbian India were diverse but not much like modern international curries. \"Sambar\", for example, was a dish of pigeon peas (\"toor dal\") or lentils, flavoured with onions and mild spices. Among the key spices used in the period was asafoetida (\"h\u012bng\"), a foul-smelling gum from plants of the genus \"Ferula\". Despite its smell, it adds a fine-tasting meaty flavour when it is fried in oil. \nChavundaraya II's 11th century \"Lokopakara\" makes use of asafoetida, cumin, curry tree leaves, and mustard to flavour a dal. \nSpices named in the 12th century \"M\u0101nasoll\u0101sa\" from the Western Chalukya Empire of South India include coriander, cumin, asafoetida, salt, and black pepper.\nThe 15th century \"Ni'matn\u0101mah Na\u1e63ir al-D\u012bn Sh\u0101h\u012b\" from the Malwa Sultanate of Northern India describes flavouring vegetables with asafoetida and sesame seeds fried in ghee (clarified butter), with lime juice and salt.\nEarly modern trade.\nThe establishment of the Mughal Empire, in the early 16th century, brought some new and subtly spiced dishes, especially in the north. The Indo-Persian Mughal cuisine of the emperor Akbar, as described in the \"Ain-i-Akbari\", could cook aubergines (eggplants) with asafoetida, cardamom, cloves, coriander, ginger, lime juice, onions, and pepper.\nAnother influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in Goa in 1510, resulting in the introduction of chili peppers, tomatoes and potatoes to India from the Americas, as a byproduct of the Columbian Exchange. The food culture scholar Lizzie Collingham suggests that the Portuguese in Goa (in West India) heard and adopted words adopted into a local language from the Dravidian words from South India, becoming \"caril\" or \"carree\" as transcribed by British travellers of the time. This eventually led to the modern meaning of \"curry\" as a dish, often spiced, in a sauce or gravy. In 1598, an English translation of a Dutch book about travel in the East Indies mentioned a \"somewhat sour\" broth called \"Carriel\", eaten with rice. The later Dutch word was used in the Dutch East Indies from the 19th century; many Indians had by then migrated to Southeast Asia.\nBritish influence.\nCurry was introduced to English cuisine from Anglo-Indian cooking in the 17th century, as spicy sauces were added to plain boiled and cooked meats. That cuisine was created in the British Raj when British wives or memsahibs instructed Indian cooks on the food they wanted, transforming many dishes in the process. Further, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when there were few British women in India, British men often lived with Indian mistresses, acquiring the local customs, language, and food. Curry was first served in coffee houses in Britain from 1809.\nIndian cooks in the 19th century prepared curries for their British masters simplified and adjusted to Anglo-Indian taste. For instance, a \"quarama\" from Lucknow contained (among other ingredients) ghee, yoghurt, cream, crushed almonds, cloves, cardamom, and saffron; whereas an 1869 Anglo-Indian \"quorema\" or \"korma\", \"different in substance as well as name\", had no cream, almonds, or saffron, but it added the then-standard British curry spices, namely coriander, ginger, and black peppercorns. Curry, initially understood as \"an unfamiliar set of Indian stews and ragouts\", had become \"a dish in its own right, created for the British in India\". Collingham describes the resulting Anglo-Indian cuisine as \"eclectic\", \"pan-Indian\", \"lacking sophistication\", embodying a \"passion for garnishes\", and forming a \"coherent repertoire\"; but it was eaten only by the British. Collingham writes that \"The idea of a curry is, in fact, a concept that the Europeans imposed on India's food culture. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names... But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry.\"\nElsewhere in the 19th century, curry was carried to the Caribbean by Indian indentured workers in the British sugar industry.\nGlobalisation.\nSince the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international fusion cuisine. Alan Davidson writes that curry's worldwide extension is a result of the Indian diaspora and globalisation, starting within the British Empire, and followed by economic migrants who brought Indian cuisine to many countries. In 1886, \u5496\u55b1 (\"G\u0101l\u00ed\") (Chinese pronunciation of \"curry\") appeared among the Chinese in Singapore. Malay Chinese people then most likely brought curry to China.\nIn India, spices are always freshly prepared for use in curries. Derived from such mixtures (but not containing curry leaves), curry powder is a ready-prepared spice blend first sold by Indian merchants to European colonial traders. This was commercially available from the late 18th century, with brands such as Crosse &amp; Blackwell and Sharwood's persisting to the present. Curry powder became a standard item in Anglo-Indian cuisine. British traders introduced the powder to Meiji-era Japan, in the mid-19th century, where it was used to make Japanese curry, known as , .\nTypes.\nThere are many varieties of curry. The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural traditions and personal preferences. Such dishes have names such as dopiaza and rogan josh that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk and spice pastes, and is commonly eaten over rice. Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. A masala mixture is a combination of dried or dry-roasted spices commonly homemade for some curries.\nDry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume pur\u00e9e, saut\u00e9ed crushed onion, or tomato pur\u00e9e.\nCurry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain. Other commercial mixes include curry pastes and Japanese-style curry roux (in block or powder form).\nBy region.\nUnited Kingdom.\nCurry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town. It was estimated that in 2016 there were 12,000 curry houses, employing 100,000 people and with annual combined sales of approximately \u00a34.2\u00a0billion. The food offered is cooked to British taste, but with increasing demand for authentic Indian styles. In 2001, chicken tikka masala was described by the British foreign secretary Robin Cook as \"a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.\" Its origin is not certain, but many sources attribute it to British Asians; some cite Glasgow as the city of origin. Others suggest that it derives from butter chicken, popular in the north of India.\nCurries in Britain are derived partly from India and partly from invention in local Indian restaurants. They vary from mildly-spiced to extremely hot, with names that are to an extent standardised across the country, but are often unknown in India. Zoe Perrett, writing for \"The Times of India\", comments that anyone expecting traditional Indian cuisine from \"Brindian\" cuisine, a \"Bangla spin on Indian regional dishes, twisted still further to tempt British tastebuds\", will be disappointed. Variants like \"Kashmir\" and \"Malaya\" curry add fruits like banana, lychees, and pineapple. In short, the food might be, Perrett writes, \"not Indian at all.\" Inexpensive curry kits, containing a packet of whole spices, a packet of spice paste, and a pouch of sauce, are sold in British supermarkets, enabling a curry of \"exceptional\" quality to be cooked quickly at home.\nSouth Asia.\nSpicy Indian dishes were until the late 20th century not called \"curry\" by Indians: the term was initially limited to Anglo-Indian cuisine. Instead, numerous Indian dishes like dopiaza and rogan josh had their own names; the historian of food Colleen Sen notes that the Indian cook Madhur Jaffrey found the umbrella term 'curry' \"degrading to India's great cuisine\", but eventually accepted the category in her later writings. Both the names of the dishes and their methods of preparation are often regional.\nIndian curry sauces are made with spices including black pepper, cardamom, chili peppers, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, fennel seed, mustard seed, and turmeric. As many as 15 spices may be used for a meat curry. The spices are sometimes fried whole, sometimes roasted, sometimes ground and mixed into a paste. The sauces are eaten with steamed rice or idli rice cakes in south India, and breads such as chapatis, roti, and naan in the north. \nThe popular rogan josh, for example, from Kashmiri cuisine, is a wet dish of lamb with a red gravy coloured by Kashmiri chillies and an extract of the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (\"mawal\"). Rice and curry is the staple dish of Sri Lanka.\nEast Asia.\nJapanese curry is usually eaten as \u2013 curry, rice, and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of a thick stew than a curry. British people brought curry from the Indian colony back to Britain and introduced it to Japan during the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation (), and curry in Japan was categorised as a Western dish. Its spread across the country is attributed to its use in the Japanese Army and Navy which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own recipes. The standard Japanese curry contains onions, carrots, potatoes, and sometimes celery, and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated apples or honey are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead.\nCurry spread to other regions of Asia. Curry powder is added to some dishes in the southern part of China. The curry powder sold in Chinese grocery stores is similar to Madras curry powder, but with the addition of star anise and cinnamon. The former Portuguese colony of Macau has its own culinary traditions and curry dishes, including \"Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa\" (\"Portuguese-style chicken\") and curry crab. Portuguese sauce is a sauce flavoured with curry and thickened with coconut milk.\nCurry was popularized in Korean cuisine when Ottogi entered the Korean food industry with an imported curry powder in 1969. Korean curry powder contains spices including cardamom, chili, cinnamon, and turmeric.\nCurry \"tteokbokki\" is made of \"tteok\" (rice cakes), \"eomuk\" (fish cakes), eggs, vegetables, and \"gochujang\", fermented red chili paste. As in India, chilis were brought to Korea by European traders. Spicy chili sauce then replaced the soy sauce formerly used in \"tteokbokki\".\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn Burmese cuisine, curries are broadly called \"hin\". Burmese curries contains meat simmered in a curry paste containing onion, garlic, shrimp paste, tomato, and turmeric. Burmese curries are often mild, without chili, and somewhat oily.\nThai curries are called , and usually consist of meat, fish or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste. A few stir-fried Thai dishes use , an Indian style curry powder. In the West, Thai curries are often colour-coded green, yellow, and red, with green usually the mildest, red the hottest. Green curry is flavoured with green chili, coriander, kaffir lime, and basil; yellow, with yellow chili and turmeric; and red, with red chili.\nMalaysian Indian cuisine adapted curries (such as , with coconut milk) via the region's Indian population, but it has become a staple among the Malay and Chinese populations there. Malaysian curries have many varieties, but are often flavoured with cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, chili peppers, and garlic.\nIndian Indonesian cuisine consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Indonesia. Curry in Indonesian is \"kari\" and in Javanese, \"kare\". In Indonesian cuisine especially in Bandung, there is a dish called \"lontong kari\", a combined of lontong and beef yellow curry soup. In Javanese cuisine, \"kare rajungan\", blue swimmer crab curry has become a delicacy of Tuban Regency, East Java.\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, influenced by both Thai and Indian cooking, curry is known as \"c\u00e0 ri\". Curry was brought to Vietnam by French colonisers, from their Indian outpost at Pondicherry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the south of the country in particular, the Vietnamese adopted Madras curry powder and coconut milk as the basis of dishes such as chicken lemongrass curry, \"c\u00e0 ri g\u00e0\".\nIn the Philippines, a dish that may have been directly inspired by Indian curries is the oxtail stew , possibly influenced by Sepoy expatriates during the brief British occupation of Manila (1762\u20131764), or indirectly via Southeast Asian spicy dishes. are native dishes using coconut milk, which as in the case of Filipino chicken curry can be called 'curries' when curry powder is added.\nSouth Africa.\nCurry spread to South Africa with the migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to the region in the colonial era. African curries, Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal curry, the Durban curry, bunny chow, and roti rolls. South African curries appear to have been created in both KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, while others developed across the country over the late 20th and early 21st centuries to include ekasi, coloured, and Afrikaner varieties. Durban has the largest population of Indians outside of India in the world. Bunny chow or a \"set\", a South African standard, consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers by dipping pieces of the bread into it. 'Bunny chow' means 'Indian food', from Banian, an Indian. The method of serving the curry was created because apartheid forbade black people from eating in Indian restaurants; the loaves could speedily be taken away and eaten in the street.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n "}

Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (camel milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from camel hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The wild Bactrian camel is a distinct species that is not ancestral to the domestic Bactrian camel, and is now critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals.\nThe word \"camel\" is also used informally in a wider sense, where the more correct term is \"camelid\", to include all seven species of the family Camelidae: the true camels (the above three species), along with the \"New World\" camelids: the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicu\u00f1a, which belong to the separate tribe Lamini. Camelids originated in North America during the Eocene, with the ancestor of modern camels, \"Paracamelus\", migrating across the Bering land bridge into Asia during the late Miocene, around 6 million years ago.\nTaxonomy.\nExtant species.\nThree species are extant:\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Common name\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"|Scientific name and subspecies\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Range\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:29%;\"\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:16%; min-width:112px;\"\n!scope=\"row\"|Bactrian camel\n!scope=\"row\"| Dromedary / Arabian camel\n!scope=\"row\"|Wild Bactrian camel\nBiology.\nThe average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years.

Bactrian camels weigh and dromedaries . The widening toes on a camel's hoof provide supplemental grip for varying soil sediments.\nThe male dromedary camel has an organ called a \"dulla\" in his throat, a large, inflatable sac that he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging out of the side of the camel's mouth. Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.\nEcological and behavioral adaptations.\nIt is a common myth that a camel stores water in its hump, but the humps in fact are reservoirs of fatty tissue, which can be used as a reserve source of calories, not water. When this tissue is metabolized, it yields a greater mass of water than that of the fat processed. This fat metabolization, while releasing energy, causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration (as oxygen is required for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water.\nCamels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water. The dromedary camel can drink as seldom as once every 10 days even under very hot conditions, and can lose up to 30% of its body mass due to dehydration. They can drink as much as at a time but this is stored in the animal's bloodstream, not, as popularly believed, in its humps.\nUnlike other mammals, camels' red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape. This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water.\nCamels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other mammals. Their temperature ranges from at dawn and steadily increases to by sunset, before they cool off at night again. In general, to compare between camels and the other livestock, camels lose only 1.3 liters of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose 20 to 40 liters per day. Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals; to assist this, camels have a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain. Camels rarely sweat, even when ambient temperatures reach . Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat. Camels can withstand losing 25% of their body weight in water, whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12\u201314% dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance.\nWhen the camel exhales, water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water. Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies' hydrated state without the need for drinking.\nCamels have three-chambered stomachs and perform rumination as part of their digestive process, even though they are not part of the ruminant sub-order.\nThe camel's thick coat insulates it from the intense heat radiated from desert sand; a shorn camel must sweat 50% more to avoid overheating. During the summer the coat becomes lighter in color, reflecting light as well as helping avoid sunburn. The camel's long legs help by keeping its body farther from the ground, which can heat up to . Dromedaries have a pad of thick tissue over the sternum called the \"pedestal\". When the animal lies down in a sternal recumbent position, the pedestal raises the body from the hot surface and allows cooling air to pass under the body.\nCamels' mouths have a thick leathery lining, allowing them to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with nostrils that can close, form a barrier against sand. If sand gets lodged in their eyes, they can dislodge it using their translucent third eyelid (also known as the nictitating membrane). The camels' gait and widened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.\nThe kidneys and intestines of a camel are very efficient at reabsorbing water. Camels' kidneys have a 1:4 cortex to medulla ratio. Thus, the medullary part of a camel's kidney occupies twice as much area as a cow's kidney. Secondly, renal corpuscles have a smaller diameter, which reduces surface area for filtration. These two major anatomical characteristics enable camels to conserve water and limit the volume of urine in extreme desert conditions. Camel urine comes out as a thick syrup, and camel faeces are so dry that they do not require drying when used to fuel fires.\nThe camel immune system differs from those of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped antibody molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in addition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait that makes them smaller and more durable. These \"heavy-chain-only\" antibodies, discovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50\u00a0million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs.\nThe parasite \"Trypanosoma evansi\" causes the disease surra in camels.2\nGenetics.\nThe karyotypes of different camelid species have been studied earlier by many groups, but no agreement on chromosome nomenclature of camelids has been reached. A 2007 study flow sorted camel chromosomes, building on the fact that camels have 37 pairs of chromosomes (2n=74), and found that the karyotype consisted of one metacentric, three submetacentric, and 32 acrocentric autosomes. The Y is a small metacentric chromosome, while the X is a large metacentric chromosome.\nThe hybrid camel, a hybrid between Bactrian and dromedary camels, has one hump, though it has an indentation deep that divides the front from the back. The hybrid is at the shoulder and tall at the hump. It weighs an average of and can carry around , which is more than either the dromedary or Bactrian can.\nAccording to molecular data, the wild Bactrian camel (\"C. ferus\") separated from the domestic Bactrian camel (\"C. bactrianus\") about 1 million years ago. New World and Old World camelids diverged about 11 million years ago. In spite of this, these species can hybridize and produce viable offspring. The cama is a camel-llama hybrid bred by scientists to see how closely related the parent species are. Scientists collected semen from a camel via an artificial vagina and inseminated a llama after stimulating ovulation with gonadotrophin injections. The cama is halfway in size between a camel and a llama and lacks a hump. It has ears intermediate between those of camels and llamas, longer legs than the llama, and partially cloven hooves. Like the mule, camas are sterile, despite both parents having the same number of chromosomes.\nEvolution.\nThe earliest known camel, called \"Protylopus\", lived in North America 40 to 50 million years ago (during the Eocene). It was about the size of a rabbit and lived in the open woodlands of what is now South Dakota. By 35 million years ago, the \"Poebrotherium\" was the size of a goat and had many more traits similar to camels and llamas. The hoofed \"Stenomylus\", which walked on the tips of its toes, also existed around this time, and the long-necked \"Aepycamelus\" evolved in the Miocene. The split between the tribes Camelini, which contains modern camels and Lamini, modern llamas, alpacas, vicu\u00f1as, and guanacos, is estimated to have occurred over 16 million years ago.\nThe ancestor of modern camels, \"Paracamelus\", migrated into Eurasia from North America via Beringia during the late Miocene, between 7.5 and 6.5 million years ago. During the Pleistocene, around 3 to 1 million years ago, the North American Camelidae spread to South America as part of the Great American Interchange via the newly formed Isthmus of Panama, where they gave rise to guanacos and related animals. Populations of \"Paracamelus\" continued to exist in the North American Arctic into the Early Pleistocene. This creature is estimated to have stood around tall. The Bactrian camel diverged from the dromedary about 1 million years ago, according to the fossil record.\nThe last camel native to North America was \"Camelops hesternus\", which vanished along with horses, short-faced bears, mammoths and mastodons, ground sloths, sabertooth cats, and many other megafauna as part of the Quaternary extinction event, coinciding with the migration of humans from Asia at the end of the Pleistocene, around 13\u201311,000 years ago.\nAn extinct giant camel species, \"Camelus knoblochi\" roamed Asia during the Late Pleistocene, before becoming extinct around 20,000 years ago.\nDomestication.\nLike horses, camels originated in North America and eventually spread across Beringia to Asia. They survived in the Old World, and eventually humans domesticated them and spread them globally. Along with many other megafauna in North America, the original wild camels were wiped out during the spread of the first indigenous peoples of the Americas from Asia into North America, 10 to 12,000 years ago; although fossils have never been associated with definitive evidence of hunting.\nMost camels surviving today are domesticated. Although feral populations exist in Australia, India and Kazakhstan, wild camels survive only in the wild Bactrian camel population of the Gobi Desert.\nHistory.\nWhen humans first domesticated camels is disputed. Dromedaries may have first been domesticated by humans in Somalia or South Arabia sometime during the 3rd millennium BC, the Bactrian in central Asia around 2,500\u00a0BC, as at Shar-i Sokhta (also known as the Burnt City), Iran. A study from 2016, which genotyped and used world-wide sequencing of modern and ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), suggested that they were initially domesticated in the southeast Arabian Peninsula, with the Bactrian type later being domesticated around Central Asia.\nMartin Heide's 2010 work on the domestication of the camel tentatively concludes that humans had domesticated the Bactrian camel by at least the middle of the third millennium somewhere east of the Zagros Mountains, with the practice then moving into Mesopotamia. Heide suggests that mentions of camels \"in the patriarchal narratives may refer, at least in some places, to the Bactrian camel\", while noting that the camel is not mentioned in relationship to Canaan. Heide and Joris Peters reasserted that conclusion in their 2021 study on the subject.\nIn 2009\u20132013, excavations in the Timna Valley by Lidar Sapir-Hen and Erez Ben-Yosef discovered what may be the earliest domestic camel bones yet found in Israel or even outside the Arabian Peninsula, dating to around 930\u00a0BC. This garnered considerable media coverage, as it is strong evidence that the stories of Abraham, Jacob, Esau, and Joseph were written after this time.\nThe existence of camels in Mesopotamia and Arabia but not in Syria is not a new idea. The historian Richard Bulliet thought that although camels were occasionally mentioned in the Bible, this didn't mean that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time. The archaeologist William F. Albright, writing even earlier, saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.\nThe official report by Sapir-Hen and Ben-Joseph says:\nThe introduction of the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) as a pack animal to the southern Levant ... substantially facilitated trade across the vast deserts of Arabia, promoting both economic and social change (e.g., Kohler 1984; Borowski 1998: 112\u2013116; Jasmin 2005). This ... has generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein 1971: 558\u2013584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; K\u00f6hler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and Uerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson 2012). Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack animal sometime in the early Iron Age (not before the 12th century [BC])\nand concludes:\nCurrent data from copper smelting sites of the Arabah Valley enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of radiocarbon dates. The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century [BC] and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region\u2014attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I\u2014raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.\nTextiles.\nDesert tribes and Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents, yurts, clothing, bedding and accessories. Camels have outer guard hairs and soft inner down, and the fibers may also be sorted by color and age of the animal. The guard hairs can be felted for use as waterproof coats for the herdsmen, while the softer hair is used for premium goods. The fiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or crochet. Pure camel hair is recorded as being used for western garments from the 17th century onwards, and from the 19th century a mixture of wool and camel hair was used.\nMilitary uses.\nBy at least 1200\u00a0BC the first camel saddles had appeared, and Bactrian camels could be ridden. The first saddle was positioned to the back of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500 and 100\u00a0BC, Bactrian camels came into military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC the military Arabian saddle evolved, which again improved the saddle design slightly.\nMilitary forces have used camel cavalries in wars throughout Africa, the Middle East, and their use continues into the modern-day within the Border Security Force (BSF) of India. The first documented use of camel cavalries occurred in the Battle of Qarqar in 853\u00a0BC. Armies have also used camels as freight animals instead of horses and mules.\nThe East Roman Empire used auxiliary forces known as \"dromedarii\", whom the Romans recruited in desert provinces. The camels were used mostly in combat because of their ability to scare off horses at close range (horses are afraid of the camels' scent), a quality famously employed by the Achaemenid Persians when fighting Lydia in the Battle of Thymbra (547\u00a0BC).\n19th and 20th centuries.\nThe United States Army established the U.S. Camel Corps, stationed in California, in the 19th century. One may still see stables at the Benicia Arsenal in Benicia, California, where they nowadays serve as the Benicia Historical Museum. Though the experimental use of camels was seen as a success (John B. Floyd, Secretary of War in 1858, recommended that funds be allocated towards obtaining a thousand more camels), the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 saw the end of the Camel Corps: Texas became part of the Confederacy, and most of the camels were left to wander away into the desert.\nFrance created a \"m\u00e9hariste\" camel corps in 1912 as part of the Arm\u00e9e d'Afrique in the Sahara in order to exercise greater control over the camel-riding Tuareg and Arab insurgents, as previous efforts to defeat them on foot had failed. The Free French Camel Corps fought during World War II, and camel-mounted units remained in service until the end of French rule over Algeria in 1962.\nIn 1916, the British created the Imperial Camel Corps. It was originally used to fight the Senussi, but was later used in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I. The Imperial Camel Corps comprised infantrymen mounted on camels for movement across desert, though they dismounted at battle sites and fought on foot. After July 1918, the Corps began to become run down, receiving no new reinforcements, and was formally disbanded in 1919.\nIn World War I, the British Army also created the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which consisted of a group of Egyptian camel drivers and their camels. The Corps supported British war operations in Sinai, Palestine, and Syria by transporting supplies to the troops.\nThe Somaliland Camel Corps was created by colonial authorities in British Somaliland in 1912; it was disbanded in 1944.\nBactrian camels were used by Romanian forces during World War II in the Caucasian region. At the same period the Soviet units operating around Astrakhan in 1942 adopted local camels as draft animals due to shortage of trucks and horses, and kept them even after moving out of the area. Despite severe losses, some of these camels ended up as far west as to Berlin itself.\nThe Bikaner Camel Corps of British India fought alongside the British Indian Army in World Wars I and II.\nThe \"Tropas N\u00f3madas\" (Nomad Troops) were an auxiliary regiment of Sahrawi tribesmen serving in the colonial army in Spanish Sahara (today Western Sahara). Operational from the 1930s until the end of the Spanish presence in the territory in 1975, the \"Tropas N\u00f3madas\" were equipped with small arms and led by Spanish officers. The unit guarded outposts and sometimes conducted patrols on camelback.\n21st century.\nThe annual King Abdulaziz Camel Festival is held in Saudi Arabia. In addition to camel racing and camel milk tasting, the festival holds a camel \"beauty pageant\" with prize money of $57m (\u00a340m). In 2018, 12 camels were disqualified from the beauty contest after their owners were found to have injected them with botox. In a similar incident in 2021, over 40 camels were disqualified.\nFood uses.\nCamel meat and milk are foods that are found in many cuisines, typically in Middle Eastern, North African and some Australian cuisines. Camels provide food in the form of meat and milk.\nDairy.\nCamel milk is a staple food of desert nomad tribes and is sometimes considered a meal itself; a nomad can live on only camel milk for almost a month.\nCamel milk can readily be made into yogurt, but can only be made into butter if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not be made into camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, who was able to produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet in the 1990s. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant.\nCamel milk can also be made into ice cream.\nMeat.\nApproximately 3.3 million camels and camelids are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. A camel carcass can provide a substantial amount of meat. The male dromedary carcass can weigh , while the carcass of a male Bactrian can weigh up to . The carcass of a female dromedary weighs less than the male, ranging between . The brisket, ribs and loin are among the preferred parts, and the hump is considered a delicacy. The hump contains \"white and sickly fat\", which can be used to make the \"khli\" (preserved meat) of mutton, beef, or camel. On the other hand, camel milk and meat are rich in protein, vitamins, glycogen, and other nutrients making them essential in the diet of many people. From chemical composition to meat quality, the dromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production. It does well even in arid areas due to its unusual physiological behaviors and characteristics, which include tolerance to extreme temperatures, radiation from the sun, water paucity, rugged landscape and low vegetation. Camel meat is reported to taste like coarse beef, but older camels can prove to be very tough, although camel meat becomes tenderer the more it is cooked.\nCamel is one of the animals that can be ritually slaughtered and divided into three portions (one for the home, one for extended family/social networks, and one for those who cannot afford to slaughter an animal themselves) for the qurban of Eid al-Adha.\nThe Abu Dhabi Officers' Club serves a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the texture and taste. In Karachi, Pakistan, some restaurants prepare nihari from camel meat. Specialist camel butchers provide expert cuts, with the hump considered the most popular.\nCamel meat has been eaten for centuries. It has been recorded by ancient Greek writers as an available dish at banquets in ancient Persia, usually roasted whole. The Roman emperor Heliogabalus enjoyed camel's heel. Camel meat is mainly eaten in certain regions, including Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, and other arid regions where alternative forms of protein may be limited or where camel meat has had a long cultural history. Camel blood is also consumable, as is the case among pastoralists in northern Kenya, where camel blood is drunk with milk and acts as a key source of iron, vitamin D, salts and minerals.\nA 2005 report issued jointly by the Saudi Ministry of Health and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details four cases of human bubonic plague resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver.\nCamel meat is also occasionally found in Australian cuisine: for example, a camel lasagna is available in Alice Springs. Australia has exported camel meat, primarily to the Middle East but also to Europe and the US, for many years. The meat is very popular among East African Australians, such as Somalis, and other Australians have also been buying it. The feral nature of the animals means they produce a different type of meat to farmed camels in other parts of the world, and it is sought after because it is disease-free, and a unique genetic group. Demand is outstripping supply, and governments are being urged not to cull the camels, but redirect the cost of the cull into developing the market. Australia has seven camel dairies, which produce milk, cheese and skincare products in addition to meat.\nReligion.\nIslam.\nMuslims consider camel meat \"halal\" (, 'allowed'). However, according to some Islamic schools of thought, a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it. Consequently, these schools hold that Muslims must perform \"wudhu\" (ablution) before the next time they pray after eating camel meat. Also, some Islamic schools of thought consider it \"haram\" (, 'forbidden') for a Muslim to perform \"Salat\" in places where camels lie, as it is said to be a dwelling place of the \"Shaytan\" (, 'Devil'). According to Abu Yusuf (d.798), the urine of camels may be used for medical treatment if necessary, but according to Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfah, the drinking of camel urine is discouraged.\nIslamic texts contain several stories featuring camels. In the story of the people of Thamud, the prophet Salih miraculously brings forth a \"naqat\" (, 'milch-camel') out of a rock. After Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina (the Hijrah), he allowed his she-camel to roam there; the location where the camel stopped to rest determined the location where he would build his house in Medina.\nJudaism.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, camel meat and milk are not kosher. Camels possess only one of the two kosher criteria; although they chew their cud, they do not have cloven hooves: \"But these you shall not eat among those that bring up the cud and those that have a cloven hoof: the camel, because it brings up its cud, but does not have a [completely] cloven hoof; it is unclean for you.\"\nThe Palestinian Muslim Makhamara clan in Yatta, who claim descent from Jews, reportedly avoid eating camel meat, a practice cited as evidence of their Jewish origins.\nCultural depictions.\nWhat may be the oldest carvings of camels were discovered in 2018 in Saudi Arabia. They were analysed by researchers from several scientific disciplines and, in 2021, were estimated to be 7,000 to 8,000 years old. The dating of rock art is made difficult by the lack of organic material in the carvings that may be tested, so the researchers attempting to date them tested animal bones found associated with the carvings, assessed erosion patterns, and analysed tool marks in order to determine a correct date for the creation of the sculptures. This Neolithic dating would make the carvings significantly older than Stonehenge (5,000 years old) and the Egyptian pyramids at Giza (4,500 years old) and it predates estimates for the domestication of camels.\nDistribution and numbers.\nThere are approximately 14 million camels alive as of 2010[ [update]], with 90% being dromedaries. Dromedaries alive today are domesticated animals (mostly living in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Maghreb, Middle East and South Asia). The Horn region alone has the largest concentration of camels in the world, where the dromedaries constitute an important part of local nomadic life. They provide nomadic people in Somalia and Ethiopia with milk, food, and transportation.\nOver one million dromedary camels are estimated to be feral in Australia, descended from those introduced as a method of transport in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This population is growing about 8% per year; it was estimated at 700,000 in 2008. Representatives of the Australian government have culled more than 100,000 of the animals in part because the camels use too much of the limited resources needed by sheep farmers.\nA small population of introduced camels, dromedaries and Bactrians, wandered through Southwestern United States after having been imported in the 19th century as part of the U.S. Camel Corps experiment. When the project ended, they were used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released. Twenty-five U.S. camels were bought and exported to Canada during the Cariboo Gold Rush.\nThe Bactrian camel is, as of 2010[ [update]], reduced to an estimated 1.4\u00a0million animals, most of which are domesticated. The Wild Bactrian camel is the only truly wild (as opposed to feral) camel in the world. It is a distinct species that is not ancestral to the domestic Bactrian camel. The wild camels are critically endangered and number approximately 950, inhabiting the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in China and Mongolia.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nFurther reading"}
{"id": "6599", "revid": "114797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6599", "title": "Chaldea", "text": "Small Semitic nation of ancient Mesopotamia\nChaldea () refers to a region probably located in the marshy land of southern Mesopotamia. It is mentioned, with varying meaning, in Neo-Assyrian cuneiform, the Hebrew Bible, and in classical Greek texts. The Hebrew Bible uses the term (\"Ka\u015bdim\") and this is translated as \"Chaldaeans\" in the Greek Old Testament.\nDuring a period of weakness in the East Semitic-speaking kingdom of Babylonia, new tribes of West Semitic-speaking migrants arrived in the region from the Levant between the 11th and 9th centuries BC. The earliest waves consisted of Suteans and Arameans, followed a century or so later by the Kaldu, a group who became known later as the Chaldeans or the Chaldees. These migrations did not affect the powerful kingdom and empire of Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia, which repelled these incursions.\nThese nomadic Chaldeans settled in the far southeastern portion of Babylonia, chiefly on the left bank of the Euphrates. Though for a short time the name commonly referred to the whole of southern Mesopotamia in Hebraic literature, this was a geographical and historical misnomer as Chaldea proper was in fact only the plain in the far southeast formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending about along the course of these rivers and averaging about in width.\n There were several kings of Chaldean origins who ruled Babylonia. From 626 BC to 539 BC, a ruling dynasty in later times referred to as the \"Chaldean dynasty\", named after their possible Chaldean origin,4 ruled the kingdom at its height under the Neo-Babylonian Empire, although the final ruler of this empire, Nabonidus (556\u2013539 BC) (and his son and regent Belshazzar) was a usurper of Assyrian ancestry.\nDespite the similarity in name, Chaldea is not to be confused with the modern Chaldean Catholic Church or its adherents, who are predominantly ethnic Assyrians. Members of the Assyrian community have noted that Mandaeans hold a stronger connection to the region, while the theory of Chaldean origin arose around the time of a rise of Chaldean nationalism within the Assyrian community.\nName.\nThe name \"Chaldaea\" is a latinization of the Greek ' (), a hellenization of Akkadian ' or ', suggesting an underlying /ka\u026cdu/. The term \"Chaldea\" appears in Hebrew in the Bible as ' (), while \"Chaldeans\" are Hebrew ' () and Aramaic ' ().\nGenesis 22:22 lists \"Kesed\" (\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05e9\u05b6\u05c2\u05d3, reconstructed /ka\u026cd/), perhaps a singular form of \"Kasdim\", as son of Abraham's brother Nahor (and brother of Kemuel the father of Aram), residing in Aram Naharaim. Jubilees 11:7 claims that \"Ur son of Kesed built the city of Ur-Kasdim, and he named it after himself and his father\". \nJewish historian Flavius Josephus (37\u2013c.\u2009100) links Arpachshad and Chaldaea in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\": \"Arphaxad named the Arphaxadites, who are now called Chaldeans.\" Umberto Cassuto suggests that the name \"Arpachshad\" (\u05d0\u05e8\u05e4\u05db\u05e9\u05d3) may be compounded from Arapcha-Kesed.\nLand.\nIn the early period, between the early 9th century and late 7th century BC, \"mat Kaldi\" was the name of a small sporadically independent migrant-founded territory under the domination of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC) in southeastern Babylonia, extending to the western shores of the Persian Gulf.\nThe expression \" mat Bit Y\u00e2kin\" is also used, apparently synonymously. \"Bit Y\u00e2kin\" was the name of the largest and most powerful of the five tribes of the Chaldeans, or equivalently, their territory.\nThe original extension of \"Bit Y\u00e2kin\" is not known precisely, but it extended from the lower Tigris into the Arabian Peninsula. Sargon II mentions it as extending as far as Dilmun or \"sea-land\" (littoral Eastern Arabia). \"Chaldea\" or \"mat Kaldi\" generally referred to the low, marshy, alluvial land around the estuaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, which at the time discharged their waters through separate mouths into the sea.\nThe tribal capital \"Dur Y\u00e2kin\" was the original seat of Marduk-Baladan.\nThe king of Chaldea was also called the king of Bit Yakin, just as the kings of Babylonia and Assyria were regularly styled simply king of Babylon or Assur, the capital city in each case. In the same way, what is now known as the Persian Gulf was sometimes called \"the Sea of Bit Yakin\", and sometimes \"the Sea of the Land of Chaldea\".\n\"Chaldea\" came to be used in a wider sense, of Southern Mesopotamia in general, following the brief ascendancy of the Chaldeans during 608\u2013557 BC. This is especially the case in the Hebrew Bible, which was substantially composed during this period (roughly corresponding to the period of Babylonian captivity). The Book of Jeremiah makes frequent reference to the Chaldeans (King James Version \"Chaldees\" following LXX ; in Biblical Hebrew as \"Kasd\u00eem\" ). \nBook of Habakkuk 1:6 calls them \"that bitter and hasty nation\" (). Book of Isaiah 23:13 DRB states, \u201cBehold the land of the Chaldeans, there was not such a people, the Assyrians founded it: they have led away the strong ones thereof into captivity, they have destroyed the houses thereof, they have brought it to ruin.\u201d\nAncient Chaldeans.\nUnlike the East Semitic Akkadian-speaking Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians, whose ancestors had been established in Mesopotamia since at least the 30th century BC, the Chaldeans were not a native Mesopotamian people, but were late 10th- or early 9th-century BC West Semitic Levantine migrants to the southeastern corner of the region, who had played no part in the previous three millennia of Sumero-Akkadian and Assyro-Babylonian Mesopotamian civilization and history.\nThe ancient Chaldeans seem to have migrated into Mesopotamia sometime between c. 940 and 860 BC, a century or so after other new Semitic arrivals, the Arameans and the Suteans, appeared in Babylonia, c. 1100 BC. According to Ran Zadok, they first appear in written record in cylinder inscriptions of the King of Mari A\u0161\u0161ur-ketta-l\u0113\u0161ir II (late 12th-early 11th century BC), which record them reaching Mesopotamia as early as the 11th century BC. They later appear in the annals of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III during the 850s BC. This was a period of weakness in Babylonia, and its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of semi-nomadic foreign peoples from invading and settling in the land.\nThough belonging to the same West Semitic speaking ethnic group and migrating from the same Levantine regions as the earlier arriving Aramaeans, they are to be differentiated; the Assyrian king Sennacherib, for example, carefully distinguishes them in his inscriptions.\nThe Chaldeans were for a time able to keep their identity despite the dominant native Assyro-Babylonian (Sumero-Akkadian-derived) culture although, as was the case for the earlier Amorites, Kassites and Suteans before them, by the time Babylon fell in 539 BC, perhaps before, the Chaldeans ceased to exist as a specific ethnic group.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, \"Ur of the Chaldees\" (Ur Ka\u015bdim) is cited as the starting point of the patriarch Abraham's journey to Canaan.\nLanguage.\nAncient Chaldeans probably spoke a West Semitic language similar to Old Aramaic. \nDuring the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Imperial Aramaic became the lingua franca of the empire under the rule of the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in the mid-8th century BC. As a result, in late periods both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian became marginalized, and Aramaic took its place across Mesopotamia, including among the Chaldeans, and later, also the southern Levant. One form of this once widespread Aramaic language was used in some books of the Hebrew Bible (the Book of Daniel and the Book of Ezra). The use of the name \"Chaldean\" (Chaldaic, Chaldee) to describe it, first introduced by Jerome of Stridon (d. 420), became common in early Aramaic studies, but that misnomer was later corrected, when modern scholars concluded that the Aramaic dialect used in the Hebrew Bible was not closely related to the ancient Chaldean language.\nHistory.\nThe region that the Chaldeans eventually made their homeland was in relatively poor southeastern Mesopotamia, at the head of the Persian Gulf. They appear to have migrated into southern Babylonia from the Levant at some unknown point between the end of the reign of Ninurta-kudurri-usur II (a contemporary of Tiglath-Pileser II) circa 940 BC, and the start of the reign of Marduk-zakir-shumi I in 855 BC, although there is no historical proof of their existence prior to the late 850s BC.\nFor perhaps a century or so after settling in the area, these semi-nomadic migrant Chaldean tribes had no impact on the pages of history, seemingly remaining subjugated by the native Akkadian speaking kings of Babylon or by perhaps regionally influential Aramean tribes. The main players in southern Mesopotamia during this period were Babylonia and Assyria, together with Elam to the east and the Aramaeans, who had already settled in the region a century or so prior to the arrival of the Chaldeans.\nThe very first written historical attestation of the existence of Chaldeans occurs in 852 BC, in the annals of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III, who mentions invading the southeastern extremes of Babylonia and subjugating one Mushallim-Marduk, the chief of the Amukani tribe and overall leader of the Kaldu tribes, together with capturing the town of Baqani, extracting tribute from Adini, chief of the Bet-Dakkuri, another Chaldean tribe.\nShalmaneser III had invaded Babylonia at the request of its own king, Marduk-zakir-shumi I, who, being threatened by his own rebellious relations, together with powerful Aramean tribes pleaded with the more powerful Assyrian king for help. The subjugation of the Chaldean tribes by the Assyrian king appears to have been an aside, as they were not at that time a powerful force or a threat to the native Babylonian king.\nImportant Kaldu tribes and their regions in southeastern Babylonia were Bit-Y\u00e2kin (the original area the Chaldeans settled in on the Persian Gulf), Bet-Dakuri, Bet-Adini, Bet-Amukkani, and Bet-Shilani.\nChaldean leaders had by this time already adopted Assyro-Babylonian names, religion, language, and customs, indicating that they had become Akkadianized to a great degree.\nThe Chaldeans remained quietly ruled by the native Babylonians (who were in turn subjugated by their Assyrian relations) for the next seventy-two years, only coming to historical prominence for the first time in Babylonia in 780 BC, when a previously unknown Chaldean named Marduk-apla-usur usurped the throne from the native Babylonian king Marduk-bel-zeri (790\u2013780 BC). The latter was a vassal of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser IV (783\u2013773 BC), who was otherwise occupied quelling a civil war in Assyria at the time.\nThis was to set a precedent for all future Chaldean aspirations on Babylon during the Neo-Assyrian Empire; always too weak to confront a strong Assyria alone and directly, the Chaldeans awaited periods when Assyrian kings were distracted elsewhere in their vast empire, or engaged in internal conflicts, then, in alliance with other powers stronger than themselves (usually Elam), they made a bid for control over Babylonia.\nShalmaneser IV attacked and defeated Marduk-apla-user, retaking northern Babylonia and forcing on him a border treaty in Assyria's favour. The Assyrians allowed him to remain on the throne, although subject to Assyria. Eriba-Marduk, another Chaldean, succeeded him in 769 BC and his son, Nabu-shuma-ishkun in 761 BC, with both being dominated by the new Assyrian king Ashur-Dan III (772\u2013755 BC). Babylonia appears to have been in a state of chaos during this time, with the north occupied by Assyria, its throne occupied by foreign Chaldeans, and continual civil unrest throughout the land.\nThe Chaldean rule proved short-lived. A native Babylonian king named Nabonassar (748\u2013734 BC) defeated and overthrew the Chaldean usurpers in 748 BC, restored indigenous rule, and successfully stabilised Babylonia. The Chaldeans once more faded into obscurity for the next three decades. During this time both the Babylonians and the Chaldean and Aramean migrant groups who had settled in the land once more fell completely under the yoke of the powerful Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III (745\u2013727 BC), a ruler who introduced Imperial Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire. The Assyrian king at first made Nabonassar and his successor native Babylonian kings Nabu-nadin-zeri, Nabu-suma-ukin II and Nabu-mukin-zeri his subjects, but decided to rule Babylonia directly from 729 BC. He was followed by Shalmaneser V (727\u2013722 BC), who also ruled Babylon in person.\nWhen Sargon II (722\u2013705 BC) ascended the throne of the Assyrian Empire in 722 BC after the death of Shalmaneser V, he was forced to launch a major campaign in his subject states of Persia, Mannea and Media in Ancient Iran to defend his territories there. He defeated and drove out the Scythians and Cimmerians who had attacked Assyria's Persian and Median vassal colonies in the region. At the same time, Egypt began encouraging and supporting the rebellion against Assyria in Israel and Canaan, forcing the Assyrians to send troops to deal with the Egyptians.\nThese events allowed the Chaldeans to once more attempt to assert themselves. While the Assyrian king was otherwise occupied defending his Iranian colonies from the Scythians and Cimmerians and driving the Egyptians from Canaan, Marduk-apla-iddina II (the Biblical Merodach-Baladan) of Bit-Y\u00e2kin, allied himself with the powerful Elamite kingdom and the native Babylonians, briefly seizing control of Babylon between 721 and 710 BC. With the Scythians and Cimmerians vanquished, the Medes and Persians pledging loyalty, and the Egyptians defeated and ejected from southern Canaan, Sargon II was free at last to deal with the Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Elamites. He attacked and deposed Marduk-apla-adding II in 710 BC, also defeating his Elamite allies in the process. After defeat by the Assyrians, Merodach-Baladan fled to his protectors in Elam\nIn 703, Merodach-Baladan very briefly regained the throne from a native Akkadian-Babylonian ruler Marduk-zakir-shumi II, who was a puppet of the new Assyrian king, Sennacherib (705\u2013681 BC). He was once more soundly defeated at Kish, and once again fled to Elam where he died in exile after one final failed attempt to raise a revolt against Assyria in 700 BC, this time not in Babylon, but in the Chaldean tribal land of Bit-Y\u00e2kin. A native Babylonian king named Bel-ibni (703\u2013701 BC) was placed on the throne as a puppet of Assyria.\nThe next challenge to Assyrian domination came from the Elamites in 694 BC, with Nergal-ushezib deposing and murdering Ashur-nadin-shumi (700\u2013694 BC), the Assyrian prince who was king of Babylon and son of Sennacherib. The Chaldeans and Babylonians again allied with their more powerful Elamite neighbors in this endeavour. This prompted the enraged Assyrian king Sennacherib to invade and subjugate Elam and Chaldea and to sack Babylon, laying waste to and largely destroying the city. Babylon was regarded as a sacred city by all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians, and this act eventually resulted in Sennacherib's being murdered by his own sons while he was praying to the god Nisroch in Nineveh.\nEsarhaddon (681\u2013669 BC) succeeded Sennacherib as ruler of the Assyrian Empire. He completely rebuilt Babylon and brought peace to the region. He conquered Egypt, Nubia and Libya and entrenched his mastery over the Persians, Medes, Parthians, Scythians, Cimmerians, Arameans, Israelites, Phoenicians, Canaanites, Urartians, Pontic Greeks, Cilicians, Phrygians, Lydians, Manneans and Arabs. For the next 60 or so years, Babylon and Chaldea remained peacefully under direct Assyrian control. The Chaldeans remained subjugated and quiet during this period, and the next major revolt in Babylon against the Assyrian empire was fermented not by a Chaldean, Babylonian or Elamite, but by Shamash-shum-ukin, who was an Assyrian king of Babylon, and elder brother of Ashurbanipal (668\u2013627 BC), the new ruler of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\nShamash-shum-ukin (668\u2013648 BC) had become infused with Babylonian nationalism after sixteen years peacefully subject to his brother, and despite being Assyrian himself, declared that the city of Babylon and not Nineveh or Assur should be the seat of the empire.\nIn 652 BC, he raised a powerful coalition of peoples resentful of their subjugation to Assyria against his own brother Ashurbanipal. The alliance included the Babylonians, Persians, Chaldeans, Medes, Elamites, Sultans, Arameans, Israelites, Arabs and Canaanites, together with some disaffected elements among the Assyrians themselves. After a bitter struggle lasting five years, the Assyrian king triumphed over his rebellious brother in 648 BC, Elam was utterly destroyed, and the Babylonians, Persians, Medes, Chaldeans, Arabs, and others were savagely punished. An Assyrian governor named Kandalanu was then placed on the throne of Babylon to rule on behalf of Ashurbanipal. The next 22 years were peaceful, and neither the Babylonians nor Chaldeans posed a threat to the dominance of Ashurbanipal.\nHowever, after the death of the mighty Ashurbanipal (and Kandalanu) in 627 BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire descended into a series of bitter internal dynastic civil wars that were to be the cause of its downfall.\nAshur-etil-ilani (626\u2013623 BC) ascended to the throne of the empire in 626 BC but was immediately engulfed in a torrent of fierce rebellions instigated by rival claimants. He was deposed in 623 BC by an Assyrian general (\"turtanu\") named Sin-shumu-lishir (623\u2013622 BC), who was also declared king of Babylon. Sin-shar-ishkun (622\u2013612 BC), the brother of Ashur-etil-ilani, took back the throne of empire from Sin-shumu-lishir in 622 BC, but was then himself faced with unremitting rebellion against his rule by his own people. Continual conflict among the Assyrians led to a myriad of subject peoples, from Cyprus to Persia and The Caucasus to Egypt, quietly reasserting their independence and ceasing to pay tribute to Assyria.\nNabopolassar, a previously obscure and unknown Chaldean chieftain, followed the opportunistic tactics laid down by previous Chaldean leaders to take advantage of the chaos and anarchy gripping Assyria and Babylonia and seized the city of Babylon in 620 BC with the help of its native Babylonian inhabitants.\nSin-shar-ishkun amassed a powerful army and marched into Babylon to regain control of the region. Nabopolassar was saved from likely destruction because yet another massive Assyrian rebellion broke out in Assyria proper, including the capital Nineveh, which forced the Assyrian king to turn back in order to quell the revolt. Nabopolassar took advantage of this situation, seizing the ancient city of Nippur in 619 BC, a mainstay of pro-Assyrianism in Babylonia, and thus Babylonia as a whole.\nHowever, his position was still far from secure, and bitter fighting continued in the Babylonian heartlands from 620 to 615 BC, with Assyrian forces encamped in Babylonia in an attempt to eject Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar attempted a counterattack, marched his army into Assyria proper in 616 BC, and tried to besiege Assur and Arrapha (modern Kirkuk), but was defeated by Sin-shar-ishkun and chased back into Babylonia after being driven from Idiqlat (modern Tikrit) at the southernmost end of Assyria. A stalemate seemed to have ensued, with Nabopolassar unable to make any inroads into Assyria despite its greatly weakened state, and Sin-shar-ishkun unable to eject Nabopolassar from Babylonia due to constant rebellions and civil war among his own people.\nNabopolassar's position, and the fate of the Assyrian empire, was sealed when he entered into an alliance with another of Assyria's former vassals, the Medes, the now dominant people of what was to become Persia. The Median Cyaxares had also recently taken advantage of the anarchy in the Assyrian Empire, while officially still a vassal of Assyria, he took the opportunity to meld the Iranian peoples; the Medes, Persians, Sagartians and Parthians, into a large and powerful Median-dominated force. The Medes, Persians, Parthians, Chaldeans and Babylonians formed an alliance that also included the Scythians and Cimmerians to the north.\nWhile Sin-shar-ishkun was fighting both the rebels in Assyria and the Chaldeans and Babylonians in southern Mesopotamia, Cyaxares (hitherto a vassal of Assyria), in alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians launched a surprise attack on civil-war-beleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical Calah/Nimrud) and taking Arrapkha (modern Kirkuk). Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia, was not involved in this major breakthrough against Assyria. From this point however, the alliance of Medes, Persians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Sagartians, Scythians and Cimmerians fought in unison against Assyria.\nDespite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued. Throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to make inroads into Assyria itself, although in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied to score a number of counterattacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians. This led to a coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and sacking Nineveh in late 612 BC, killing Sin-shar-ishkun in the process.\nA new Assyrian king, Ashur-uballit II (612\u2013605 BC), took the crown amidst the house-to-house fighting in Nineveh, and refused a request to bow in vassalage to the rulers of the alliance. He managed to fight his way out of Nineveh and reach the northern Assyrian city of Harran, where he founded a new capital. Assyria resisted for another seven years until 605 BC, when the remnants of the Assyrian army and the army of the Egyptians, whose 26th Dynasty had formed a brief allied coalition with the Assyrians, were defeated at Karchemish. Nabopolassar and his Median, Scythian and Cimmerian allies were now in possession of much of the huge Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Egyptians had belatedly come to the aid of Assyria, which they would have hoped to support as a secure buffer between Egypt and the new powers of Babylon, Medes and Persians, having already been raided by the Scythians.\nThe Chaldean king of Babylon now ruled all of southern Mesopotamia (Assyria in the north was ruled by the Medes), and the former Assyrian possessions of Aram (Syria), Phoenicia, Israel, Cyprus, Edom, Philistia, and parts of Arabia, while the Medes took control of the former Assyrian colonies in Ancient Iran, Asia Minor and the Caucasus.\nNabopolassar was not able to enjoy his success for long, dying in 604 BC, only one year after the victory at Karchemish. He was succeeded by his son, who took the name Nebuchadnezzar II, after the unrelated 12th century BC native Akkadian-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I, indicating the extent to which the migrant Chaldeans had become infused with native Mesopotamian culture.\nNebuchadnezzar II and his allies may well have been forced to deal with remnants of Assyrian resistance based in and around Dur-Katlimmu, as Assyrian imperial records continue to be dated in this region between 604 and 599 BC. In addition, the Egyptians remained in the region an attempt to revive the Asian colonies of the ancient Egyptian Empire.\nNebuchadnezzar II was to prove himself to be the greatest of the Chaldean rulers, rivaling another non-native ruler, the 18th century BC Amorite king Hammurabi, as the greatest king of Babylon. He was a patron of the cities and a spectacular builder, rebuilding all of Babylonia's major cities on a lavish scale. His building activity at Babylon, expanding on the earlier major and impressive rebuilding of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon, helped to turn it into the immense and beautiful city of legend. Babylon covered more than , surrounded by moats and ringed by a double circuit of walls. The Euphrates flowed through the center of the city, spanned by a beautiful stone bridge. At the center of the city rose the giant ziggurat called Etemenanki, \"House of the Frontier Between Heaven and Earth,\" which lay next to the Temple of Marduk. He is also believed by many historians to have built The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (although others believe these gardens were built much earlier by an Assyrian king in Nineveh) for his wife, a Median princess from the green mountains, so that she would feel at home.\nA capable leader, Nebuchadnezzar II conducted successful military campaigns; cities like Tyre, Sidon and Damascus were subjugated. He also conducted numerous campaigns in Asia Minor against the Scythians, Cimmerians, and Lydians. Like their Assyrian relations, the Babylonians had to campaign yearly in order to control their colonies.\nIn 601 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II was involved in a major but inconclusive battle against the Egyptians. In 599 BC, he invaded Arabia and routed the Arabs at Qedar. In 597 BC, he invaded Judah, captured Jerusalem after the siege of Jerusalem (597 BC) and deposed its king Jehoiachin, carrying the Israelites into captivity in Babylon. Egyptian and Babylonian armies fought each other for control of the Near East throughout much of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and this encouraged king Zedekiah of Judah to revolt. After an eighteen-month siege, Jerusalem was captured in 587 BC, thousands of Jews were deported to Babylon, and Solomon's Temple was razed to the ground.\nNebuchadnezzar successfully fought the Pharaohs Psammetichus II and Apries throughout his reign, and during the reign of Pharaoh Amasis in 568 BC it is rumoured that he may have briefly invaded Egypt itself.\nBy 572, Nebuchadnezzar was in full control of Babylonia, Chaldea, Aramea (Syria), Phonecia, Israel, Judah, Philistia, Samarra, Jordan, northern Arabia, and parts of Asia Minor. Nebuchadnezzar died of illness in 562 BC after a one-year co-reign with his son, Amel-Marduk, who was deposed in 560 BC after a reign of only two years.\nEnd of the Chaldean dynasty.\nNeriglissar succeeded Amel-Marduk. It is unclear as to whether he was in fact an ethnic Chaldean or a native Babylonian nobleman, as he was not related by blood to Nabopolassar's descendants, having married into the ruling family. He conducted successful military campaigns against the Hellenic inhabitants of Cilicia, which had threatened Babylonian interests. Neriglissar reigned for only four years and was succeeded by the youthful Labashi-Marduk in 556 BC. Again, it is unclear whether he was a Chaldean or a native Babylonian.\nLabashi-Marduk reigned only for a matter of months, being deposed by Nabonidus in late 556 BC. Nabonidus was certainly not a Chaldean, but an Assyrian from Harran, the last capital of Assyria, and proved to be the final native Mesopotamian king of Babylon. He and his son, the regent Belshazzar, were deposed by the Persians under Cyrus the Great in 539 BC.\nWhen the Babylonian Empire was absorbed into the Persian Achaemenid Empire, the name \"Chaldean\" lost its meaning in reference to a particular ethnicity or land, but lingered for a while as a term solely and explicitly used to describe a societal class of astrologers and astronomers in southern Mesopotamia. The original Chaldean tribe had long ago became Akkadianized, adopting Akkadian culture, religion, language and customs, blending into the majority native population, and eventually wholly disappearing as a distinct race of people, as had been the case with other preceding migrant peoples, such as the Amorites, Kassites, Suteans and Arameans of Babylonia.\nThe Persians considered this \"Chaldean societal class\" to be masters of reading and writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. They spoke of astrologists and astronomers as \"Chaldeans\", and it is used with this specific meaning in the Book of Daniel (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 et seq.) and by classical writers, such as Strabo.\nThe disappearance of the Chaldeans as an ethnicity and Chaldea as a land is evidenced by the fact that the Persian rulers of the Achaemenid Empire (539\u2013330 BC) did not retain a province called \"Chaldea\", nor did they refer to \"Chaldeans\" as a race of people in their written annals. This is in contrast to Assyria, and for a time Babylonia also, where the Persians retained the names Assyria and Babylonia as designations for distinct geo-political entities within the Achaemenid Empire. In the case of the Assyrians in particular, Achaemenid records show Assyrians holding important positions within the empire, particularly with regards to military and civil administration.\nLegacy.\nThe term Chaldean was still in use at the time of Cicero (106\u201343 BC) long after the Chaldeans had disappeared. In one of his speeches he mentioned \"Chaldean astrologers\", and he spoke of them more than once in his \"De Divinatione\". Other classical Latin writers who speak of them as distinguished for their knowledge of astronomy and astrology are Pliny the Elder, Valerius Maximus, Aulus Gellius, Cato the Elder, Lucretius, and Juvenal. Horace in his \"Carpe diem\" ode speaks of the \"Babylonian calculations\" (\"Babylonii numeri\"), the horoscopes of astrologers consulted regarding the future.\nIn the late antiquity, a variant of Aramaic that was used in some books of the Bible was misnamed as \"Chaldean\" by Jerome of Stridon. That inaccurate usage continued down the centuries in Western Europe, and it was still customary during the nineteenth century, until the misnomer was corrected by scholars. In West Asian, Greek and Hebraic sources, however, the term for the language spoken in Mesopotamia was commonly \"Assyrian\" and later also \"Syriac\". Accordingly, in the earliest recorded \"Western\" mentions of the Christians of what is now Iraq and nearby countries, \"Chaldean\" is used with reference to their language. In 1220/1, Jacques de Vitry wrote that \"they denied that Mary was the Mother of God and claimed that Christ existed in two persons. They consecrated leavened bread and used the 'Chaldean' (Syriac) language\". In the fifteenth century the term \"Chaldeans\" was first applied specifically to Assyrians living in Cyprus who entered a union with Rome, and no longer merely with reference to their language but the name of a new church.\nImpact on Assyrian identity.\nAfter an absence from history for many years, the name was revived during the formation of the Chaldean Catholic Church. The church was not founded and populated by the long extinct Chaldean tribes of southeastern Mesopotamia, but founded in northern Mesopotamia by a breakaway group of ethnic Assyrians who had been members of the Church of the East before entering communion with Rome.\nThe naming by Rome is believed to be due to a misinterpretation of the term \"Ur Kasdim\", the supposed north Mesopotamian birthplace of Abraham in Hebraic tradition as \"Ur of the Chaldees\", and a reluctance to use the earlier terms, such as Assyrians, East Assyrians, East Syrians and Nestorians, due to their connotations with the Church of the East and Syriac Orthodox Church. In modern times, Chaldea has been associated with attempts to declare Chaldeans as a separate ethnicity from Assyrians, through the belief that their descent is based in southern Babylonia. While some religious leaders of the Chaldean Catholic Church and activists in the West have advocated for a separate identity based on this notion, historians and international organizations generally treat Chaldeans as ethnic Assyrians, owing to genetic, linguistic, geographic, and modern historical factors. \nHowever, across the rest of Mesopotamia (particularly the North) after Chaldea fell, the terms \"Assyrian\", and its derivative \"Syrian\" remained the common ethnic term for the Aramaic-speaking inhabitants. These were used by the people themselves and their Persian, Armenian, Arab, Greek, Georgian and Kurdish neighbours both before and after the advent of Christianity in Iraq, Northeast Syria, Southeast Turkey and Northwest Iran. The Assyrian continuity in these regions is well documented.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "6600", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6600", "title": "Currying", "text": "Transforming a function in such a way that it only takes a single argument\nIn mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of families of functions, each taking a single argument.\nIn the prototypical example, one begins with a function formula_1 that takes two arguments, one from formula_2 and one from formula_3 and produces objects in formula_4 The curried form of this function treats the first argument as a parameter, so as to create a family of functions formula_5 The family is arranged so that for each object formula_6 in formula_7 there is exactly one function formula_8, such that for any formula_9 in formula_10, formula_11.\nIn this example, formula_12 itself becomes a function that takes formula_13 as an argument, and returns a function that maps each formula_6 to formula_15 The proper notation for expressing this is verbose. The function formula_13 belongs to the set of functions formula_17 Meanwhile, formula_8 belongs to the set of functions formula_19 Thus, something that maps formula_6 to formula_8 will be of the type formula_22 With this notation, formula_12 is a function that takes objects from the first set, and returns objects in the second set, and so one writes formula_24 This is a somewhat informal example; more precise definitions of what is meant by \"object\" and \"function\" are given below. These definitions vary from context to context, and take different forms, depending on the theory that one is working in.\nCurrying is related to, but not the same as, partial application. The example above can be used to illustrate partial application; it is quite similar. Partial application is the function formula_25 that takes the pair formula_13 and formula_6 together as arguments, and returns formula_15 Using the same notation as above, partial application has the signature formula_29 Written this way, application can be seen to be adjoint to currying.\nThe currying of a function with more than two arguments can be defined by induction. \nCurrying is useful in both practical and theoretical settings. In functional programming languages, and many others, it provides a way of automatically managing how arguments are passed to functions and exceptions. In theoretical computer science, it provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in simpler theoretical models which provide only one argument. The most general setting for the strict notion of currying and uncurrying is in the closed monoidal categories, which underpins a vast generalization of the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence of proofs and programs to a correspondence with many other structures, including quantum mechanics, cobordisms and string theory.\nThe concept of currying was introduced by Gottlob Frege, developed by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel,\nand further developed by Haskell Curry.\nUncurrying is the dual transformation to currying, and can be seen as a form of defunctionalization. It takes a function formula_13 whose return value is another function formula_31, and yields a new function formula_32 that takes as parameters the arguments for both formula_13 and formula_31, and returns, as a result, the application of formula_13 and subsequently, formula_31, to those arguments. The process can be iterated.\nMotivation.\nCurrying provides a way for working with functions that take multiple arguments, and using them in frameworks where functions might take only one argument. For example, some analytical techniques can only be applied to functions with a single argument. Practical functions frequently take more arguments than this. Frege showed that it was sufficient to provide solutions for the single argument case, as it was possible to transform a function with multiple arguments into a chain of single-argument functions instead. This transformation is the process now known as currying. All \"ordinary\" functions that might typically be encountered in mathematical analysis or in computer programming can be curried. However, there are categories in which currying is not possible; the most general categories which allow currying are the closed monoidal categories.\nSome programming languages almost always use curried functions to achieve multiple arguments; notable examples are ML and Haskell, where in both cases all functions have exactly one argument. This property is inherited from lambda calculus, where multi-argument functions are usually represented in curried form.\nCurrying is related to, but not the same as partial application. In practice, the programming technique of closures can be used to perform partial application and a kind of currying, by hiding arguments in an environment that travels with the curried function.\nHistory.\nThe \"Curry\" in \"Currying\" is a reference to logician Haskell Curry, who used the concept extensively, but Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel had the idea six years before Curry. The alternative name \"Sch\u00f6nfinkelisation\" has been proposed. In the mathematical context, the principle can be traced back to work in 1893 by Frege.\nThe originator of the word \"currying\" is not clear. David Turner says the word was coined by Christopher Strachey in his 1967 lecture notes Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages, but that source introduces the concept as \"a device originated by Sch\u00f6nfinkel\", and the term \"currying\" is not used, while Curry is mentioned later in the context of higher-order functions. John C. Reynolds defined \"currying\" in a 1972 paper, but did not claim to have coined the term.\nDefinition.\nCurrying is most easily understood by starting with an informal definition, which can then be molded to fit many different domains. First, there is some notation to be established. The notation formula_37 denotes all functions from formula_2 to formula_10. If formula_13 is such a function, we write formula_41. Let formula_42 denote the ordered pairs of the elements of formula_2 and formula_10 respectively, that is, the Cartesian product of formula_2 and formula_10. Here, formula_2 and formula_10 may be sets, or they may be types, or they may be other kinds of objects, as explored below.\nGiven a function\nformula_49,\ncurrying constructs a new function\nformula_50.\nThat is, formula_31 takes an argument of type formula_2 and returns a function of type formula_53. It is defined by\nformula_54\nfor formula_6 of type formula_2 and formula_9 of type formula_10. We then also write\nformula_59\nUncurrying is the reverse transformation, and is most easily understood in terms of its right adjoint, the function formula_60\nSet theory.\nIn set theory, the notation formula_61 is used to denote the set of functions from the set formula_2 to the set formula_10. Currying is the natural bijection between the set formula_64 of functions from formula_65 to formula_66, and the set formula_67 of functions from formula_68 to the set of functions from formula_69 to formula_66. In symbols:\nformula_71\nIndeed, it is this natural bijection that justifies the exponential notation for the set of functions. As is the case in all instances of currying, the formula above describes an adjoint pair of functors: for every fixed set formula_69, the functor formula_73 is left adjoint to the functor formula_74.\nIn the category of sets, the object formula_61 is called the exponential object.\nFunction spaces.\nIn the theory of function spaces, such as in functional analysis or homotopy theory, one is commonly interested in continuous functions between topological spaces. One writes formula_76 (the Hom functor) for the set of \"all\" functions from formula_2 to formula_10, and uses the notation formula_61 to denote the subset of continuous functions. Here, formula_80 is the bijection\nformula_81\nwhile uncurrying is the inverse map. If the set formula_61 of continuous functions from formula_2 to formula_10 is given the compact-open topology, and if the space formula_10 is locally compact Hausdorff, then\nformula_86\nis a homeomorphism. This is also the case when formula_2, formula_10 and formula_61 are compactly generated,chapter 5 although there are more cases.\nOne useful corollary is that a function is continuous if and only if its curried form is continuous. Another important result is that the application map, usually called \"evaluation\" in this context, is continuous (note that eval is a strictly different concept in computer science.) That is,\nformula_90\nis continuous when formula_61 is compact-open and formula_10 locally compact Hausdorff. These two results are central for establishing the continuity of homotopy, i.e. when formula_2 is the unit interval formula_94, so that formula_95 can be thought of as either a homotopy of two functions from formula_10 to formula_97, or, equivalently, a single (continuous) path in formula_98.\nAlgebraic topology.\nIn algebraic topology, currying serves as an example of Eckmann\u2013Hilton duality, and, as such, plays an important role in a variety of different settings. For example, loop space is adjoint to reduced suspensions; this is commonly written as\nformula_99\nwhere formula_100 is the set of homotopy classes of maps formula_101, and formula_102 is the suspension of \"A\", and formula_103 is the loop space of \"A\". In essence, the suspension formula_104 can be seen as the cartesian product of formula_2 with the unit interval, modulo an equivalence relation to turn the interval into a loop. The curried form then maps the space formula_2 to the space of functions from loops into formula_97, that is, from formula_2 into formula_109. Then formula_80 is the adjoint functor that maps suspensions to loop spaces, and uncurrying is the dual.\nThe duality between the mapping cone and the mapping fiber (cofibration and fibration)chapters 6,7 can be understood as a form of currying, which in turn leads to the duality of the long exact and coexact Puppe sequences.\nIn homological algebra, the relationship between currying and uncurrying is known as tensor-hom adjunction. Here, an interesting twist arises: the Hom functor and the tensor product functor might not lift to an exact sequence; this leads to the definition of the Ext functor and the Tor functor.\nDomain theory.\nIn order theory, the theory of lattices of partially ordered sets, formula_80 is a continuous function when the lattice is given the Scott topology. Scott-continuous functions were first investigated in the attempt to provide a semantics for lambda calculus (as ordinary set theory is inadequate to do this). More generally, Scott-continuous functions are now studied in domain theory, which encompasses the study of denotational semantics of computer algorithms. Note that the Scott topology is quite different than many common topologies one might encounter in the category of topological spaces; the Scott topology is typically finer, and is not sober.\nThe notion of continuity makes its appearance in homotopy type theory, where, roughly speaking, two computer programs can be considered to be homotopic, i.e. compute the same results, if they can be \"continuously\" refactored from one to the other.\nLambda calculi.\nIn theoretical computer science, currying provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in very simple theoretical models, such as the lambda calculus, in which functions only take a single argument. Consider a function formula_112 taking two arguments, and having the type formula_113, which should be understood to mean that \"x\" must have the type formula_2, \"y\" must have the type formula_10, and the function itself returns the type formula_97. The curried form of \"f\" is defined as\nformula_117\nwhere formula_118 is the abstractor of lambda calculus. Since curry takes, as input, functions with the type formula_119, one concludes that the type of curry itself is\nformula_120\nThe \u2192 operator is often considered right-associative, so the curried function type formula_121 is often written as formula_122. Conversely, function application is considered to be left-associative, so that formula_123 is equivalent to\nformula_124.\nThat is, the parenthesis are not required to disambiguate the order of the application.\nCurried functions may be used in any programming language that supports closures; however, uncurried functions are generally preferred for efficiency reasons, since the overhead of partial application and closure creation can then be avoided for most function calls.\nType theory.\nIn type theory, the general idea of a type system in computer science is formalized into a specific algebra of types. For example, when writing formula_41, the intent is that formula_2 and formula_10 are types, while the arrow formula_128 is a type constructor, specifically, the function type or arrow type. Similarly, the Cartesian product formula_42 of types is constructed by the product type constructor formula_130.\nThe type-theoretical approach is expressed in programming languages such as ML and the languages derived from and inspired by it: Caml, Haskell, and F#.\nThe type-theoretical approach provides a natural complement to the language of category theory, as discussed below. This is because categories, and specifically, monoidal categories, have an internal language, with simply typed lambda calculus being the most prominent example of such a language. It is important in this context, because it can be built from a single type constructor, the arrow type. Currying then endows the language with a natural product type. The correspondence between objects in categories and types then allows programming languages to be re-interpreted as logics (via Curry\u2013Howard correspondence), and as other types of mathematical systems, as explored further, below.\nLogic.\nUnder the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence, the existence of currying and uncurrying is equivalent to the logical theorem formula_131 (also known as exportation), as tuples (product type) corresponds to conjunction in logic, and function type corresponds to implication.\nThe exponential object formula_132 in the category of Heyting algebras is normally written as material implication formula_133. Distributive Heyting algebras are Boolean algebras, and the exponential object has the explicit form formula_134, thus making it clear that the exponential object really is material implication.\nCategory theory.\nThe above notions of currying and uncurrying find their most general, abstract statement in category theory. Currying is a universal property of an exponential object, and gives rise to an adjunction in cartesian closed categories. That is, there is a natural isomorphism between the morphisms from a binary product formula_49 and the morphisms to an exponential object formula_136.\nThis generalizes to a broader result in closed monoidal categories: Currying is the statement that the tensor product and the internal Hom are adjoint functors; that is, for every object formula_68 there is a natural isomorphism:\nformula_138\nHere, \"Hom\" denotes the (external) Hom-functor of all morphisms in the category, while formula_139 denotes the internal hom functor in the closed monoidal category. For the category of sets, the two are the same. When the product is the cartesian product, then the internal hom formula_139 becomes the exponential object formula_141.\nCurrying can break down in one of two ways. One is if a category is not closed, and thus lacks an internal hom functor (possibly because there is more than one choice for such a functor). Another way is if it is not monoidal, and thus lacks a product (that is, lacks a way of writing down pairs of objects). Categories that do have both products and internal homs are exactly the closed monoidal categories.\nThe setting of cartesian closed categories is sufficient for the discussion of classical logic; the more general setting of closed monoidal categories is suitable for quantum computation.\nThe difference between these two is that the product for cartesian categories (such as the category of sets, complete partial orders or Heyting algebras) is just the Cartesian product; it is interpreted as an ordered pair of items (or a list). Simply typed lambda calculus is the internal language of cartesian closed categories; and it is for this reason that pairs and lists are the primary types in the type theory of LISP, Scheme and many functional programming languages.\nBy contrast, the product for monoidal categories (such as Hilbert space and the vector spaces of functional analysis) is the tensor product. The internal language of such categories is linear logic, a form of quantum logic; the corresponding type system is the linear type system. Such categories are suitable for describing entangled quantum states, and, more generally, allow a vast generalization of the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence to quantum mechanics, to cobordisms in algebraic topology, and to string theory. The linear type system, and linear logic are useful for describing synchronization primitives, such as mutual exclusion locks, and the operation of vending machines.\nContrast with partial function application.\nCurrying and partial function application are often conflated. One of the significant differences between the two is that a call to a partially applied function returns the result right away, not another function down the currying chain; this distinction can be illustrated clearly for functions whose arity is greater than two.\nGiven a function of type formula_142, currying produces formula_143. That is, while an evaluation of the first function might be represented as formula_144, evaluation of the curried function would be represented as formula_145, applying each argument in turn to a single-argument function returned by the previous invocation. Note that after calling formula_146, we are left with a function that takes a single argument and returns another function, not a function that takes two arguments.\nIn contrast, partial function application refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity. Given the definition of formula_13 above, we might fix (or 'bind') the first argument, producing a function of type formula_148. Evaluation of this function might be represented as formula_149. Note that the result of partial function application in this case is a function that takes two arguments.\nIntuitively, partial function application says \"if you fix the first argument of the function, you get a function of the remaining arguments\". For example, if function \"div\" stands for the division operation \"x\"/\"y\", then \"div\" with the parameter \"x\" fixed at 1 (i.e., \"div\" 1) is another function: the same as the function \"inv\" that returns the multiplicative inverse of its argument, defined by \"inv\"(\"y\") =\u00a01/\"y\".\nThe practical motivation for partial application is that very often the functions obtained by supplying some but not all of the arguments to a function are useful; for example, many languages have a function or operator similar to codice_1. Partial application makes it easy to define these functions, for example by creating a function that represents the addition operator with 1 bound as its first argument.\nPartial application can be seen as evaluating a curried function at a fixed point, e.g. given formula_142 and formula_151 then formula_152 or simply formula_153 where formula_154 curries f's first parameter.\nThus, partial application is reduced to a curried function at a fixed point. Further, a curried function at a fixed point is (trivially), a partial application. For further evidence, note that, given any function formula_112, a function formula_156 may be defined such that formula_157. Thus, any partial application may be reduced to a single curry operation. As such, curry is more suitably defined as an operation which, in many theoretical cases, is often applied recursively, but which is theoretically indistinguishable (when considered as an operation) from a partial application.\nSo, a partial application can be defined as the objective result of a single application of the curry operator on some ordering of the inputs of some function.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is historically best known as the name of several Persian kings, most notably including Cyrus the Great, who founded the Achaemenid Empire in 550 BC. It remains widespread among Zoroastrians, particularly in India, and is also relatively common in the Anglophone world.\nEtymology.\nCyrus, as a word in English, is the Latinized form of the Greek \u039a\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \"K\u0233ros\", from Old Persian \"K\u016bru\u0161\". According to the inscriptions, the name is reflected in Elamite \"Kura\u0161\", Babylonian \"Ku(r)-ra\u0161/-ra-\u00e1\u0161\" and Imperial Aramaic \"kwr\u0161\". The modern Persian form of the name is \"K\u016bro\u0161\".\nThe etymology of Cyrus has been and continues to be a topic of discussion amongst historians, linguists, and scholars of Iranology. The Old Persian name \"kuru\u0161\" has been interpreted in various forms such as \"the Sun\", \"like Sun\", \"young\", \"hero,\" and \"humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest\" and the Elamite \"kura\u0161\" has been translated as one \"who bestows care\".\nThe name has appeared on many monuments and inscriptions in Old Persian. There is also the record of a small inscription in Morghab (southwestern Iran) on which there is the sentence (\"adam k\u016bru\u0161 x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya hax\u0101mani\u0161iya\") in Old Persian meaning (\"I am Cyrus the Achaemenian King\"). After a questionable proposal by the German linguist F. H. Weissbach that Darius the Great was the first to inscribe in Persian, it had previously been concluded by some scholars that the inscription in Morghab refers to Cyrus the Younger. This proposal resulted from a false interpretation of a passage in paragraph 70 of the Behistun inscription by Darius the Great. Based on many arguments, the accepted theory among modern scholars is that the inscription does belong to Cyrus the Great.\nThere are interpretations of the name of Cyrus by classical authors identifying with or referring to the Persian word for \"Sun\". The Historian Plutarch (46\u2013120) states that \"the sun, which, in the Persian language, is called Cyrus\". Also, the Physician Ctesias who served in the court of the Persian king Artaxerxes II of Persia writes in his book \"Persica\" as summarized by Photios that the name Cyrus is from the Persian word \"Khur\" (the sun). These are, however, not accepted by modern scholars.\nRegarding the etymology of Old Persian \"kuru\u0161\", linguists have proposed various etymologies based on Iranian languages as well as non-Indo-European ones. According to Tavernier, the name \"kura\u0161\", attested in Elamite texts, is likely \"the original form\" as there is no Elamite or Babylonian spelling \"ku-ru-u\u0161\" in the transcriptions of Old Persian \"ku-u-r(u)-u-\u0161\". That is, according to Tavernier, \"kura\u0161\" is an Elamite name and means \"to bestow care\". Others, such as Schmitt, Hoffmann maintain that the Persian \"Kuru\u0161\", which according to Skalmowsky, may be connected to (or borrowing from) the IE \"K\u00faru-\" from Old Indic can give an etymology of the Elamite \"kura\u0161\". In this regard, the Old Persian \"kuru\u0161\" is considered with the following etymologies: One proposal is discussed by the linguist Janos Harmatta that refers to the common Iranian root \"kur-\" (be born) of many words in Old, middle, and new Iranian languages (e.g. Kurdish). Accordingly, the name K\u016bru\u0161 means \"young, youth...\". Other Iranian etymologies have been proposed. The Indian proposal of Skalmowsky goes down to \"to do, accomplish\". Another theory is the suggestion of Karl Hoffmann that \"kuru\u0161\" goes down to a \"-ru\" derivation from the IE root \"*(s)kau\" meaning \"to humiliate\" and accordingly \"kuru\u0161\" (hence \"Cyrus\") means \"\"humiliator\" (of the enemy in verbal contest)\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Dmbox/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Name listThis page or section lists people that share the same given name or the same family name.

{"id": "6604", "revid": "47183495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6604", "title": "Rendering (computer graphics)", "text": "Process of generating an image from a model\nRendering is the process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from input data such as 3D models. The word \"rendering\" (in one of its senses) originally meant the task performed by an artist when depicting a real or imaginary thing (the finished artwork is also called a \"rendering\"). Today, to \"render\" commonly means to generate an image or video from a precise description (often created by an artist) using a computer program.\nA software application or component that performs rendering is called a rendering engine, render engine, , graphics engine, or simply a renderer.\nA distinction is made between real-time rendering, in which images are generated and displayed immediately (ideally fast enough to give the impression of motion or animation), and offline rendering (sometimes called pre-rendering) in which images, or film or video frames, are generated for later viewing. Offline rendering can use a slower and higher-quality renderer. Interactive applications such as games must primarily use real-time rendering, although they may incorporate pre-rendered content.\nRendering can produce images of scenes or objects defined using coordinates in 3D space, seen from a particular viewpoint. Such 3D rendering uses knowledge and ideas from optics, the study of visual perception, mathematics, and software engineering, and it has applications such as video games, simulators, visual effects for films and television, design visualization, and medical diagnosis. Realistic 3D rendering requires modeling the propagation of light in an environment, e.g. by applying the rendering equation.\nReal-time rendering uses high-performance \"rasterization\" algorithms that process a list of shapes and determine which pixels are covered by each shape. When more realism is required (e.g. for architectural visualization or visual effects) slower pixel-by-pixel algorithms such as \"ray tracing\" are used instead. (Ray tracing can also be used selectively during rasterized rendering to improve the realism of lighting and reflections.) A type of ray tracing called \"path tracing\" is currently the most common technique for photorealistic rendering. Path tracing is also popular for generating high-quality non-photorealistic images, such as frames for 3D animated films. Both rasterization and ray tracing can be sped up (\"accelerated\") by specially designed microprocessors called GPUs.\nRasterization algorithms are also used to render images containing only 2D shapes such as polygons and text. Applications of this type of rendering include digital illustration, graphic design, 2D animation, desktop publishing and the display of user interfaces.\nHistorically, rendering was called image synthesisxxi but today this term is likely to mean AI image generation. The term \"neural rendering\" is sometimes used when a neural network is the primary means of generating an image but some degree of control over the output image is provided. Neural networks can also assist rendering without replacing traditional algorithms, e.g. by removing noise from path traced images.\nFeatures.\nPhotorealistic rendering.\nA large proportion of computer graphics research has worked towards producing images that resemble photographs. Fundamental techniques that make this possible were invented in the 1980s, but at the end of the decade, photorealism for complex scenes was still considered a distant goal.x Today, photorealism is routinely achievable for offline rendering, but remains difficult for real-time rendering.\nIn order to produce realistic images, rendering must simulate how light travels from light sources, is reflected, refracted, and scattered (often many times) by objects in the scene, passes through a camera lens, and finally reaches the film or sensor of the camera. The physics used in these simulations is primarily geometrical optics, in which particles of light follow (usually straight) lines called \"rays\", but in some situations (such as when rendering thin films, like the surface of soap bubbles) the wave nature of light must be taken into account.\nEffects that may need to be simulated include:\nIn realistic scenes, objects are illuminated both by light that arrives directly from a light source (after passing mostly unimpeded through air), and light that has bounced off other objects in the scene. The simulation of this complex lighting is called global illumination. In the past, indirect lighting was often faked (especially when rendering animated films) by placing additional hidden lights in the scene, but today path tracing is used to render it accurately.3108\nFor true photorealism, the camera used to take the photograph must be simulated. The \"thin lens approximation\" allows combining perspective projection with depth of field (and bokeh) emulation. Camera lens simulations can be made more realistic by modeling the way light is refracted by the components of the lens. Motion blur is often simulated if film or video frames are being rendered. Simulated lens flare and bloom are sometimes added to make the image appear subjectively brighter (although the design of real cameras tries to reduce these effects).12.4\nRealistic rendering uses mathematical descriptions of how different surface materials reflect light, called \"reflectance models\" or (when physically plausible) \"bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs)\". Rendering materials such as marble, plant leaves, and human skin requires simulating an effect called subsurface scattering, in which a portion of the light travels into the material, is scattered, and then travels back out again.143 The way color, and properties such as roughness, vary over a surface can be represented efficiently using texture mapping.6.1\nOther styles of 3D rendering.\nFor some applications (including early stages of 3D modeling), simplified rendering styles such as wireframe rendering may be appropriate, particularly when the material and surface details have not been defined and only the shape of an object is known.5.3 Games and other real-time applications may use simpler and less realistic rendering techniques as an artistic or design choice, or to allow higher frame rates on lower-end hardware.\nOrthographic and isometric projections can be used for a stylized effect or to ensure that parallel lines are depicted as parallel in CAD rendering.4.73.7\nNon-photorealistic rendering (NPR) uses techniques like edge detection and posterization to produce 3D images that resemble technical illustrations, cartoons, or other styles of drawing or painting.ch 15\n2D rendering.\nIn 2D computer graphics the positions and sizes of shapes are specified using 2D coordinates (x and y) instead of 3D coordinates (x, y, and z). 2D rendering APIs often use a resolution-independent coordinate system, with a viewport determining how to convert coordinates to pixel indexes called \"device coordinates\".46 Transformations such as scaling, translation, and rotation may be applied before rendering the shapes. These affine transformations are often represented by 3 \u00d7 3 matrices, allowing easier composition of transformations.\nHigher-quality 2D rendering engines such as SVG renderers usually implement anti-aliasing to reduce the jagged appearance of rasterized lines and shape edges.2.5.6 When rendering overlapping shapes, renderers commonly use a \"painter's model\" in which the shapes are drawn in some determined order, or their contributions to each pixel are composited using blending operations that may depend on the order of the inputs.3.3 Renderers may allow giving shapes a \"z index\" or \"stacking order\" to specify the rendering or blending order (unlike the z coordinate used in 3D rendering, this third coordinate only indicates an order, not a distance, and cannot be meaningfully rotated together with the x and y coordinates).3.4\n2D rendering typically does not simulate light propagation (which would likely require specifying 3D positions or thickness for the shapes). Effects such as drop shadows and transparency are defined by mathematical functions with no physical basis.9.125\n2D rendering for print output may need to support very high resolutions, e.g. 600 or 1200 DPI for a typical laser printer, or 2400 DPI or higher for an imagesetter or platesetter. Grayscale and color images require halftones (or some form of dithering or stochastic screening) and color separations. A rendering engine called a \"raster image processor\" (RIP) converts input data such as PDF files into the high-resolution bitmap images used by the printer.Ch1\u20132\nInputs.\nBefore a 3D scene or 2D image can be rendered, it must be described in a way that the rendering software can understand. Historically, inputs for both 2D and 3D rendering were usually text files, which are easier than binary files for humans to edit and debug. For 3D graphics, text formats have largely been supplanted by more efficient binary formats, and by APIs which allow interactive applications to communicate directly with a rendering component without generating a file on disk (although a scene description is usually still created in memory prior to rendering).1.2, 3.2.6, 3.3.1, 3.3.7\nTraditional rendering algorithms use geometric descriptions of 3D scenes or 2D images. Applications and algorithms that render visualizations of data scanned from the real world, or scientific simulations, may require different types of input data.\nThe PostScript format (which is often credited with the rise of desktop publishing) provides a standardized, interoperable way to describe 2D graphics and page layout. The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is also text-based, and the PDF format uses the PostScript language internally. In contrast, although many 3D graphics file formats have been standardized (including text-based formats such as VRML and X3D), different rendering applications typically use formats tailored to their needs, and this has led to a proliferation of proprietary and open formats, with binary files being more common.3.2.3, 3.2.5, 3.3.7vii16.5.2.\n2D vector graphics.\nA vector graphics image description may include:\n3D geometry.\nA geometric scene description may include:Ch. 4-7, 8.7\nMany file formats exist for storing individual 3D objects or \"models\". These can be imported into a larger scene, or loaded on-demand by rendering software or games. A realistic scene may require hundreds of items like household objects, vehicles, and trees, and 3D artists often utilize large libraries of models. In game production, these models (along with other data such as textures, audio files, and animations) are referred to as \"assets\".Ch. 4\nVolumetric data.\nScientific and engineering visualization often requires rendering volumetric data generated by 3D scans or simulations. Perhaps the most common source of such data is medical CT and MRI scans, which need to be rendered for diagnosis. Volumetric data can be extremely large, and requires specialized data formats to store it efficiently, particularly if the volume is \"sparse\" (with empty regions that do not contain data).14.3.1\nBefore rendering, level sets for volumetric data can be extracted and converted into a mesh of triangles, e.g. by using the marching cubes algorithm. Algorithms have also been developed that work directly with volumetric data, for example to render realistic depictions of the way light is scattered and absorbed by clouds and smoke, and this type of volumetric rendering is used extensively in visual effects for movies. When rendering lower-resolution volumetric data without interpolation, the individual cubes or \"voxels\" may be visible, an effect sometimes used deliberately for game graphics.4.613.10, Ch. 14, 16.1\nPhotogrammetry and scanning.\nPhotographs of real world objects can be incorporated into a rendered scene by using them as textures for 3D objects. Photos of a scene can also be stitched together to create panoramic images or environment maps, which allow the scene to be rendered very efficiently but only from a single viewpoint. Scanning of real objects and scenes using structured light or lidar produces point clouds consisting of the coordinates of millions of individual points in space, sometimes along with color information. These point clouds may either be rendered directly or converted into meshes before rendering. (Note: \"point cloud\" sometimes also refers to a minimalist rendering style that can be used for any 3D geometry, similar to wireframe rendering.)13.3, 13.91.3\nNeural approximations and light fields.\nA more recent, experimental approach is description of scenes using radiance fields which define the color, intensity, and direction of incoming light at each point in space. (This is conceptually similar to, but not identical to, the light field recorded by a hologram.) For any useful resolution, the amount of data in a radiance field is so large that it is impractical to represent it directly as volumetric data, and an approximation function must be found. Neural networks are typically used to generate and evaluate these approximations, sometimes using video frames, or a collection of photographs of a scene taken at different angles, as \"training data\".\nAlgorithms related to neural networks have recently been used to find approximations of a scene as 3D Gaussians. The resulting representation is similar to a point cloud, except that it uses fuzzy, partially-transparent blobs of varying dimensions and orientations instead of points. As with neural radiance fields, these approximations are often generated from photographs or video frames.\nOutputs.\nThe output of rendering may be displayed immediately on the screen (many times a second, in the case of real-time rendering such as games) or saved in a raster graphics file format such as JPEG or PNG. High-end rendering applications commonly use the OpenEXR file format, which can represent finer gradations of colors and high dynamic range lighting, allowing tone mapping or other adjustments to be applied afterwards without loss of quality.Ch. 14, Ap. B\nQuickly rendered animations can be saved directly as video files, but for high-quality rendering, individual frames (which may be rendered by different computers in a cluster or \"render farm\" and may take hours or even days to render) are output as separate files and combined later into a video clip.1.5, 3.11, 8.11\nThe output of a renderer sometimes includes more than just RGB color values. For example, the spectrum can be sampled using multiple wavelengths of light, or additional information such as depth (distance from camera) or the material of each point in the image can be included (this data can be used during compositing or when generating texture maps for real-time rendering, or used to assist in removing noise from a path-traced image). Transparency information can be included, allowing rendered foreground objects to be composited with photographs or video. It is also sometimes useful to store the contributions of different lights, or of specular and diffuse lighting, as separate channels, so lighting can be adjusted after rendering. The OpenEXR format allows storing many channels of data in a single file. Renderers such as Blender and Pixar RenderMan support a large variety of configurable values called Arbitrary Output Variables (AOVs).Ch. 14, Ap. B\nTechniques.\nChoosing how to render a 3D scene usually involves trade-offs between speed, memory usage, and realism (although realism is not always desired). The &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;algorithms developed over the years follow a loose progression, with more advanced methods becoming practical as computing power and memory capacity increased. Multiple techniques may be used for a single final image.\nAn important distinction is between image order algorithms, which iterate over pixels in the image, and object order algorithms, which iterate over objects in the scene. For simple scenes, object order is usually more efficient, as there are fewer objects than pixels.Ch. 4\n The vector displays of the 1960s-1970s used deflection of an electron beam to draw line segments directly on the screen. Nowadays, vector graphics are rendered by rasterization algorithms that also support filled shapes. In principle, any 2D vector graphics renderer can be used to render 3D objects by first projecting them onto a 2D image plane. 93, 431, 505, 553\n Adapts 2D rasterization algorithms so they can be used more efficiently for 3D rendering, handling hidden surface removal via scanline or z-buffer techniques. Different realistic or stylized effects can be obtained by coloring the pixels covered by the objects in different ways. Surfaces are typically divided into meshes of triangles before being rasterized. Rasterization is usually synonymous with \"object order\" rendering (as described above).560-561, 575-5908.5Ch. 9\n Uses geometric formulas to compute the first object that a ray intersects.8 It can be used to implement \"image order\" rendering by casting a ray for each pixel, and finding a corresponding point in the scene. Ray casting is a fundamental operation used for both graphical and non-graphical purposes,6 e.g. determining whether a point is in shadow, or checking what an enemy can see in a game.\n Simulates the bouncing paths of light caused by specular reflection and refraction, requiring a varying number of ray casting operations for each path. Advanced forms use Monte Carlo techniques to render effects such as area lights, depth of field, blurry reflections, and soft shadows, but computing global illumination is usually in the domain of path tracing.9-13\n A finite element analysis approach that breaks surfaces in the scene into pieces, and estimates the amount of light that each piece receives from light sources, or indirectly from other surfaces. Once the irradiance of each surface is known, the scene can be rendered using rasterization or ray tracing.888-890, 1044-1045\n Uses Monte Carlo integration with a simplified form of ray tracing, computing the average brightness of a sample of the possible paths that a photon could take when traveling from a light source to the camera (for some images, thousands of paths need to be sampled per pixel8). It was introduced as a statistically unbiased way to solve the rendering equation, giving ray tracing a rigorous mathematical foundation.11-13\nEach of the above approaches has many variations, and there is some overlap. Path tracing may be considered either a distinct technique or a particular type of ray tracing.846, 1021 Note that the usage of terminology related to ray tracing and path tracing has changed significantly over time.7\nRay marching is a family of algorithms, used by ray casting, for finding intersections between a ray and a complex object, such as a volumetric dataset or a surface defined by a signed distance function. It is not, by itself, a rendering method, but it can be incorporated into ray tracing and path tracing, and is used by rasterization to implement screen-space reflection and other effects.13\nA technique called photon mapping traces paths of photons from a light source to an object, accumulating data about irradiance which is then used during conventional ray tracing or path tracing.1037-1039 Rendering a scene using only rays traced from the light source to the camera is impractical, even though it corresponds more closely to reality, because a huge number of photons would need to be simulated, only a tiny fraction of which actually hit the camera.7-9587\nSome authors call conventional ray tracing \"backward\" ray tracing because it traces the paths of photons backwards from the camera to the light source, and call following paths from the light source (as in photon mapping) \"forward\" ray tracing.7-9 However, sometimes the meaning of these terms is reversed. Tracing rays starting at the light source can also be called \"particle tracing\" or \"light tracing\", which avoids this ambiguity.924.5.4\nReal-time rendering, including video game graphics, typically uses rasterization, but increasingly combines it with ray tracing and path tracing.2 To enable realistic global illumination, real-time rendering often relies on pre-rendered (\"baked\") lighting for stationary objects. For moving objects, it may use a technique called \"light probes\", in which lighting is recorded by rendering omnidirectional views of the scene at chosen points in space (often points on a grid to allow easier interpolation). These are similar to environment maps, but typically use a very low resolution or an approximation such as spherical harmonics. (Note: Blender uses the term 'light probes' for a more general class of pre-recorded lighting data, including reflection maps.)\nRasterization.\nThe term \"rasterization\" (in a broad sense) encompasses many techniques used for 2D rendering and real-time 3D rendering. 3D animated films were rendered by rasterization before ray tracing and path tracing became practical.\nA renderer combines rasterization with \"geometry processing\" (which is not specific to rasterization) and \"pixel processing\" which computes the RGB color values to be placed in the \"framebuffer\" for display.2.19\nThe main tasks of rasterization (including pixel processing) are:2, 3.8, 23.1.1\n3D rasterization is typically part of a \"graphics pipeline\" in which an application provides lists of triangles to be rendered, and the rendering system transforms and projects their coordinates, determines which triangles are potentially visible in the \"viewport\", and performs the above rasterization and pixel processing tasks before displaying the final result on the screen.2.19\nHistorically, 3D rasterization used algorithms like the \"Warnock algorithm\" and \"scanline rendering\" (also called \"scan-conversion\"), which can handle arbitrary polygons and can rasterize many shapes simultaneously. Although such algorithms are still important for 2D rendering, 3D rendering now usually divides shapes into triangles and rasterizes them individually using simpler methods.\nHigh-performance algorithms exist for rasterizing 2D lines, including anti-aliased lines, as well as ellipses and filled triangles. An important special case of 2D rasterization is text rendering, which requires careful anti-aliasing and rounding of coordinates to avoid distorting the letterforms and preserve spacing, density, and sharpness.9.1.1\nAfter 3D coordinates have been projected onto the image plane, rasterization is primarily a 2D problem, but the 3rd dimension necessitates \"hidden surface removal\". Early computer graphics used geometric algorithms or ray casting to remove the hidden portions of shapes, or used the \"painter's algorithm\", which sorts shapes by depth (distance from camera) and renders them from back to front. Depth sorting was later avoided by incorporating depth comparison into the scanline rendering algorithm. The \"z-buffer\" algorithm performs the comparisons indirectly by including a depth or \"z\" value in the framebuffer. A pixel is only covered by a shape if that shape's z value is lower (indicating closer to the camera) than the z value currently in the buffer. The z-buffer requires additional memory (an expensive resource at the time it was invented) but simplifies the rasterization code and permits multiple passes. Memory is now faster and more plentiful, and a z-buffer is almost always used for real-time rendering.2.5.2\nA drawback of the basic z-buffer algorithm is that each pixel ends up either entirely covered by a single object or filled with the background color, causing jagged edges in the final image. Early \"anti-aliasing\" approaches addressed this by detecting when a pixel is partially covered by a shape, and calculating the covered area. The A-buffer (and other supersampling and multi-sampling techniques) solve the problem less precisely but with higher performance. For real-time 3D graphics, it has become common to use complicated heuristics (and even neural-networks) to perform anti-aliasing.9.35.4.2\nIn 3D rasterization, color is usually determined by a \"pixel shader\" or \"fragment shader\", a small program that is run for each pixel. The shader does not (or cannot) directly access 3D data for the entire scene (this would be very slow, and would result in an algorithm similar to ray tracing) and a variety of techniques have been developed to render effects like shadows and reflections using only texture mapping and multiple passes.17.8\nOlder and more basic 3D rasterization implementations did not support shaders, and used simple shading techniques such as \"flat shading\" (lighting is computed once for each triangle, which is then rendered entirely in one color), \"Gouraud shading\" (lighting is computed using normal vectors defined at vertices and then colors are interpolated across each triangle), or \"Phong shading\" (normal vectors are interpolated across each triangle and lighting is computed for each pixel).9.2\nUntil relatively recently, Pixar used rasterization for rendering its animated films. Unlike the renderers commonly used for real-time graphics, the Reyes rendering system in Pixar's RenderMan software was optimized for rendering very small (pixel-sized) polygons, and incorporated stochastic sampling techniques more typically associated with ray tracing.2, 6.3\nRay casting.\nOne of the simplest ways to render a 3D scene is to test if a ray starting at the viewpoint (the \"eye\" or \"camera\") intersects any of the geometric shapes in the scene, repeating this test using a different ray direction for each pixel. This method, called \"ray casting\", was important in early computer graphics, and is a fundamental building block for more advanced algorithms. Ray casting can be used to render shapes defined by \"constructive solid geometry\" (CSG) operations.8-9\nEarly ray casting experiments include the work of Arthur Appel in the 1960s. Appel rendered shadows by casting an additional ray from each visible surface point towards a light source. He also tried rendering the density of illumination by casting random rays from the light source towards the object and plotting the intersection points (similar to the later technique called \"photon mapping\").\nWhen rendering scenes containing many objects, testing the intersection of a ray with every object becomes very expensive. Special data structures are used to speed up this process by allowing large numbers of objects to be excluded quickly (such as objects behind the camera). These structures are analogous to database indexes for finding the relevant objects. The most common are the \"bounding volume hierarchy\" (BVH), which stores a pre-computed bounding box or sphere for each branch of a tree of objects, and the \"k-d tree\" which recursively divides space into two parts. Recent GPUs include hardware acceleration for BVH intersection tests. K-d trees are a special case of \"binary space partitioning\", which was frequently used in early computer graphics (it can also generate a rasterization order for the painter's algorithm). \"Octrees\", another historically popular technique, are still often used for volumetric data.36.2\nGeometric formulas are sufficient for finding the intersection of a ray with shapes like spheres, polygons, and polyhedra, but for most curved surfaces there is no analytic solution, or the intersection is difficult to compute accurately using limited precision floating point numbers. Root-finding algorithms such as Newton's method can sometimes be used. To avoid these complications, curved surfaces are often approximated as meshes of triangles. Volume rendering (e.g. rendering clouds and smoke), and some surfaces such as fractals, may require ray marching instead of basic ray casting.1314, 17.3\nRay tracing.\nRay casting can be used to render an image by tracing light rays backwards from a simulated camera. After finding a point on a surface where a ray originated, another ray is traced towards the light source to determine if anything is casting a shadow on that point. If not, a \"reflectance model\" (such as Lambertian reflectance for matte surfaces, or the Phong reflection model for glossy surfaces) is used to compute the probability that a photon arriving from the light would be reflected towards the camera, and this is multiplied by the brightness of the light to determine the pixel brightness. If there are multiple light sources, brightness contributions of the lights are added together. For color images, calculations are repeated for multiple wavelengths of light (e.g. red, green, and blue).11.2.28\n\"Classical ray tracing\" (also called \"Whitted-style\" or \"recursive\" ray tracing) extends this method so it can render mirrors and transparent objects. If a ray traced backwards from the camera originates at a point on a mirror, the reflection formula from geometric optics is used to calculate the direction the reflected ray came from, and another ray is cast backwards in that direction. If a ray originates at a transparent surface, rays are cast backwards for both reflected and refracted rays (using Snell's law to compute the refracted direction), and so ray tracing needs to support a branching \"tree\" of rays. In simple implementations, a recursive function is called to trace each ray.11.2.29\nRay tracing usually performs anti-aliasing by taking the average of multiple samples for each pixel. It may also use multiple samples for effects like depth of field and motion blur. If evenly spaced ray directions or times are used for each of these features, many rays are required, and some aliasing will remain. \"Cook-style\", \"stochastic\", or \"Monte Carlo ray tracing\" avoids this problem by using random sampling instead of evenly spaced samples. This type of ray tracing is commonly called \"distributed ray tracing\", or \"distribution ray tracing\" because it samples rays from probability distributions. Distribution ray tracing can also render realistic \"soft\" shadows from large lights by using a random sample of points on the light when testing for shadowing, and it can simulate chromatic aberration by sampling multiple wavelengths from the spectrum of light.1025\nReal surface materials reflect small amounts of light in almost every direction because they have small (or microscopic) bumps and grooves. A distribution ray tracer can simulate this by sampling possible ray directions, which allows rendering blurry reflections from glossy and metallic surfaces. However, if this procedure is repeated recursively to simulate realistic indirect lighting, and if more than one sample is taken at each surface point, the tree of rays quickly becomes huge. Another kind of ray tracing, called \"path tracing\", handles indirect light more efficiently, avoiding branching, and ensures that the distribution of all possible paths from a light source to the camera is sampled in an unbiased way.\nRay tracing was often used for rendering reflections in animated films, until path tracing became standard for film rendering. Films such as Shrek 2 and Monsters University also used distribution ray tracing or path tracing to precompute indirect illumination for a scene or frame prior to rendering it using rasterization.\nAdvances in GPU technology have made real-time ray tracing possible in games, although it is currently almost always used in combination with rasterization.2 This enables visual effects that are difficult with only rasterization, including reflection from curved surfaces and interreflective objects,305 and shadows that are accurate over a wide range of distances and surface orientations.159-160 Ray tracing support is included in recent versions of the graphics APIs used by games, such as DirectX, Metal, and Vulkan.\nRay tracing has been used to render simulated black holes, and the appearance of objects moving at close to the speed of light, by taking spacetime curvature and relativistic effects into account during light ray simulation.\nRadiosity.\nRadiosity (named after the radiometric quantity of the same name) is a method for rendering objects illuminated by light bouncing off rough or matte surfaces. This type of illumination is called \"indirect light\", \"environment lighting\", \"diffuse lighting\", or \"diffuse interreflection\", and the problem of rendering it realistically is called \"global illumination\". Rasterization and basic forms of ray tracing (other than distribution ray tracing and path tracing) can only roughly approximate indirect light, e.g. by adding a uniform \"ambient\" lighting amount chosen by the artist. Radiosity techniques are also suited to rendering scenes with \"area lights\" such as rectangular fluorescent lighting panels, which are difficult for rasterization and traditional ray tracing. Radiosity is considered a physically-based method, meaning that it aims to simulate the flow of light in an environment using equations and experimental data from physics, however it often assumes that all surfaces are opaque and perfectly Lambertian, which reduces realism and limits its applicability.10, 11.2.1888, 8936\nIn the original radiosity method (first proposed in 1984) now called \"classical radiosity\", surfaces and lights in the scene are split into pieces called \"patches\", a process called \"meshing\" (this step makes it a finite element method). The rendering code must then determine what fraction of the light being emitted or diffusely reflected (scattered) by each patch is received by each other patch. These fractions are called \"form factors\" or \"view factors\" (first used in engineering to model radiative heat transfer). The form factors are multiplied by the albedo of the receiving surface and put in a matrix. The lighting in the scene can then be expressed as a matrix equation (or equivalently a system of linear equations) that can be solved by methods from linear algebra.46888, 896\nSolving the radiosity equation gives the total amount of light emitted and reflected by each patch, which is divided by area to get a value called \"radiosity\" that can be used when rasterizing or ray tracing to determine the color of pixels corresponding to visible parts of the patch. For real-time rendering, this value (or more commonly the irradiance, which does not depend on local surface albedo) can be pre-computed and stored in a texture (called an \"irradiance map\") or stored as vertex data for 3D models. This feature was used in architectural visualization software to allow real-time walk-throughs of a building interior after computing the lighting.89011.5.1332\nThe large size of the matrices used in classical radiosity (the square of the number of patches) causes problems for realistic scenes. Practical implementations may use Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iterations, which is equivalent (at least in the Jacobi case) to simulating the propagation of light one bounce at a time until the amount of light remaining (not yet absorbed by surfaces) is insignificant. The number of iterations (bounces) required is dependent on the scene, not the number of patches, so the total work is proportional to the square of the number of patches (in contrast, solving the matrix equation using Gaussian elimination requires work proportional to the cube of the number of patches). Form factors may be recomputed when they are needed, to avoid storing a complete matrix in memory.\nThe quality of rendering is often determined by the size of the patches, e.g. very fine meshes are needed to depict the edges of shadows accurately. An important improvement is \"hierarchical radiosity\", which uses a coarser mesh (larger patches) for simulating the transfer of light between surfaces that are far away from one another, and adaptively sub-divides the patches as needed. This allows radiosity to be used for much larger and more complex scenes.\nAlternative and extended versions of the radiosity method support non-Lambertian surfaces, such as glossy surfaces and mirrors, and sometimes use volumes or \"clusters\" of objects as well as surface patches. Stochastic or Monte Carlo radiosity uses random sampling in various ways, e.g. taking samples of incident light instead of integrating over all patches, which can improve performance but adds noise (this noise can be reduced by using deterministic iterations as a final step, unlike path tracing noise). Simplified and partially precomputed versions of radiosity are widely used for real-time rendering, combined with techniques such as \"octree radiosity\" that store approximations of the light field.4911.5\nPath tracing.\nAs part of the approach known as \"physically based rendering\", path tracing has become the dominant technique for rendering realistic scenes, including effects for movies. For example, the popular open source 3D software Blender uses path tracing in its Cycles renderer. Images produced using path tracing for global illumination are generally noisier than when using radiosity (the main competing algorithm for realistic lighting), but radiosity can be difficult to apply to complex scenes and is prone to artifacts that arise from using a tessellated representation of irradiance.975-976, 1045\nLike \"distributed ray tracing\", path tracing is a kind of \"stochastic\" or \"randomized\" ray tracing that uses Monte Carlo or Quasi-Monte Carlo integration. It was proposed and named in 1986 by Jim Kajiya in the same paper as the rendering equation. Kajiya observed that much of the complexity of distributed ray tracing could be avoided by only tracing a single path from the camera at a time (in Kajiya's implementation, this \"no branching\" rule was broken by tracing additional rays from each surface intersection point to randomly chosen points on each light source). Kajiya suggested reducing the noise present in the output images by using \"stratified sampling\" and \"importance sampling\" for making random decisions such as choosing which ray to follow at each step of a path. Even with these techniques, path tracing would not have been practical for film rendering, using computers available at the time, because the computational cost of generating enough samples to reduce variance to an acceptable level was too high. Monster House, the first feature film rendered entirely using path tracing, was not released until 20 years later.\nIn its basic form, path tracing is inefficient (requiring too many samples) for rendering caustics and scenes where light enters indirectly through narrow spaces. Attempts were made to address these weaknesses in the 1990s. \"Bidirectional path tracing\" has similarities to photon mapping, tracing rays from the light source and the camera separately, and then finding ways to connect these paths (but unlike photon mapping it usually samples new light paths for each pixel rather than using the same cached data for all pixels). \"Metropolis light transport\" samples paths by modifying paths that were previously traced, spending more time exploring paths that are similar to other \"bright\" paths, which increases the chance of discovering even brighter paths. \"Multiple importance sampling\" provides a way to reduce variance when combining samples from more than one sampling method, particularly when some samples are much noisier than the others.\nThis later work was summarized and expanded upon in Eric Veach's 1997 PhD thesis, which helped raise interest in path tracing in the computer graphics community. The Arnold renderer, first released in 1998, proved that path tracing was practical for rendering frames for films, and that there was a demand for unbiased and physically based rendering in the film industry; other commercial and open source path tracing renderers began appearing. Computational cost was addressed by rapid advances in CPU and cluster performance.\nPath tracing's relative simplicity and its nature as a Monte Carlo method (sampling hundreds or thousands of paths per pixel) have made it attractive to implement on a GPU, especially on recent GPUs that support ray tracing acceleration technology such as Nvidia's RTX and OptiX. However bidirectional path tracing and Metropolis light transport are more difficult to implement efficiently on a GPU.\nResearch into improving path tracing continues. Many variations of bidirectional path tracing and Metropolis light transport have been explored, and ways of combining path tracing with photon mapping. Recent \"path guiding\" approaches construct approximations of the light field probability distribution in each volume of space, so paths can be sampled more effectively. Techniques have been developed to denoise the output of path tracing, reducing the number of paths required to achieve acceptable quality, at the risk of losing some detail or introducing small-scale artifacts that are more objectionable than noise; neural networks are now widely used for this purpose.\nNeural rendering.\nNeural rendering is a rendering method using artificial neural networks. Neural rendering includes image-based rendering methods that are used to reconstruct 3D models from 2-dimensional images. One of these methods are photogrammetry, which is a method in which a collection of images from multiple angles of an object are turned into a 3D model. There have also been recent developments in generating and rendering 3D models from text and coarse paintings by notably Nvidia, Google and various other companies.\nHardware acceleration.\nRendering is usually limited by available computing power and memory bandwidth, and so specialized hardware has been developed to speed it up (\"accelerate\" it), particularly for real-time rendering. Hardware features such as a framebuffer for raster graphics are required to display the output of rendering smoothly in real time.\nHardware acceleration does not replace the use of software for rendering, rather it speeds up selected operations or calculations using dedicated circuits, or runs portions of the software's code on a different type of processor.\nHistory.\nIn the era of vector monitors (also called \"calligraphic displays\"), a display processing unit (DPU) was a dedicated CPU or coprocessor that maintained a list of visual elements and redrew them continuously on the screen by controlling an electron beam. Advanced DPUs such as Evans &amp; Sutherland's Line Drawing System-1 (and later models produced into the 1980s) incorporated 3D coordinate transformation features to accelerate rendering of wire-frame images. Evans &amp; Sutherland also made the Digistar planetarium projection system, which was a vector display that could render both stars and wire-frame graphics (the vector-based Digistar and Digistar II were used in many planetariums, and a few may still be in operation). A Digistar prototype was used for rendering 3D star fields for the film \u2013 some of the first 3D computer graphics sequences ever seen in a feature film.\nShaded 3D graphics rendering in the 1970s and early 1980s was usually implemented on general-purpose computers, such as the PDP-10 used by researchers at the University of Utah. It was difficult to speed up using specialized hardware because it involves a pipeline of complex steps, requiring data addressing, decision-making, and computation capabilities typically only provided by CPUs (although dedicated circuits for speeding up particular operations were proposed ). Supercomputers or specially designed multi-CPU computers or clusters were sometimes used for ray tracing. In 1981, James H. Clark and Marc Hannah designed the Geometry Engine, a VLSI chip for performing some of the steps of the 3D rasterization pipeline, and started the company Silicon Graphics (SGI) to commercialize this technology.\nHome computers and game consoles in the 1980s contained graphics coprocessors that were capable of scrolling and filling areas of the display, and drawing sprites and lines, though they were not useful for rendering realistic images. Towards the end of the 1980s PC graphics cards and arcade games with 3D rendering acceleration began to appear, and in the 1990s such technology became commonplace. Today, even low-power mobile processors typically incorporate 3D graphics acceleration features.\nGPUs.\nThe 3D graphics accelerators of the 1990s evolved into modern GPUs. GPUs are general-purpose processors, like CPUs, but they are designed for tasks that can be broken into many small, similar, mostly independent sub-tasks (such as rendering individual pixels) and performed in parallel. This means that a GPU can speed up any rendering algorithm that can be split into subtasks in this way, in contrast to 1990s 3D accelerators which were only designed to speed up specific rasterization algorithms and simple shading and lighting effects (although tricks could be used to perform more general computations).ch3\nDue to their origins, GPUs typically still provide specialized hardware acceleration for some steps of a traditional 3D rasterization pipeline, including hidden surface removal using a z-buffer, and texture mapping with mipmaps, but these features are no longer always used.ch3 Recent GPUs have features to accelerate finding the intersections of rays with a bounding volume hierarchy, to help speed up all variants of ray tracing and path tracing, as well as neural network acceleration features sometimes useful for rendering.\nGPUs are usually integrated with high-bandwidth memory systems to support the read and write bandwidth requirements of high-resolution, real-time rendering, particularly when multiple passes are required to render a frame, however memory latency may be higher than on a CPU, which can be a problem if the critical path in an algorithm involves many memory accesses. GPU design accepts high latency as inevitable (in part because a large number of threads are sharing the memory bus) and attempts to \"hide\" it by efficiently switching between threads, so a different thread can be performing computations while the first thread is waiting for a read or write to complete.ch3\nRendering algorithms will run efficiently on a GPU only if they can be implemented using small groups of threads that perform mostly the same operations. As an example of code that meets this requirement: when rendering a small square of pixels in a simple ray-traced image, all threads will likely be intersecting rays with the same object and performing the same lighting computations. For performance and architectural reasons, GPUs run groups of around 16-64 threads called \"warps\" or \"wavefronts\" in lock-step (all threads in the group are executing the same instructions at the same time). If not all threads in the group need to run particular blocks of code (due to conditions) then some threads will be idle, or the results of their computations will be discarded, causing degraded performance.ch3\nHardware and software rendering.\nHistorically, the term \"hardware rendering\" (possibly an abbreviation of \"hardware accelerated rendering\" or \"hardware-assisted rendering\") was sometimes used to mean rendering using a hardware-accelerated rasterization pipeline (typically for real-time rendering). In contrast, \"software rendering\" meant offline rendering using software that was not limited by the capabilities of graphics hardware, and could use more realistic and higher quality techniques.1.5 Both hardware and software have evolved, and although these terms are still used, their meaning may now be context-dependent.\nWhen OpenGL and Direct3D were introduced in the 1990s, there was a need to use these APIs on computers that did not have hardware acceleration for 3D graphics. \"Fallback\" rendering implementations were provided that did not require special hardware, and these are sometimes called \"software renderers\" (today hardware acceleration is almost always available, and these CPU-only implementations are used primarily for testing).Ch2,13 More recently, \"software rendering\" may also mean rendering that does not use graphics APIs such as OpenGL, Metal, Direct3D, or Vulkan.Intr.\nTypes of renderers that in the past might have been called \"software renderers\" (e.g. path tracing renderers used for offline rendering for movies) now commonly use GPU acceleration, often via APIs such as CUDA or OpenCL, which are not graphics-specific. Since these latter APIs allow running C++ code on a GPU, it is now possible to run the same rendering code on either a CPU or GPU.\nChronology of algorithms and techniques.\nThe following is a rough timeline of frequently mentioned rendering techniques, including areas of current research. Note that even in cases where an idea was named in a specific paper, there were almost always multiple researchers or teams working in the same area (including earlier related work). When a method is first proposed it is often very inefficient, and it takes additional research and practical efforts to turn it into a useful technique.887\nThe list focuses on academic research and does not include hardware.

( ) is a publisher of tabletop role-playing games established by Greg Stafford in 1975. Chaosium's major titles include \"Call of Cthulhu\", based on the horror fiction stories of H. P. Lovecraft\"; RuneQuest Glorantha\"; \"Pendragon\", based on Thomas Mallory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\"; and \"7th Sea\", \"swashbuckling and sorcery\" set in a fantasy 17th-century Europe.\nMany of Chaosium's product lines are based upon literary sources. While Stafford himself has been described as \"one of the most decorated game designers of all time\" and \"the grand shaman of gaming\", multiple other notable game designers have written for Chaosium. These include David Conyers, Matthew Costello, Larry DiTillio, Paul Fricker, David A. Hargrave, Rob Heinsoo, Keith Herber, Jennell Jaquays, Katharine Kerr, Reiner Knizia, Charlie Krank, Robin Laws, Penelope Love, Mark Morrison, Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen, Ken Rolston, Ken St. Andre, Jonathan Tweet, John Wick, and Lynn Willis; among others.\nHistory.\n1975\u20131980.\nGreg Stafford founded \"The Chaosium\" in 1975, deriving the name partly from his apartment (which he described as a house of chaos), which was near the Oakland Coliseum, combining \"coliseum\" with \"chaos\". His purpose was to publish his first fantasy war game \"White Bear and Red Moon\" (later renamed \"Dragon Pass\"), a board game set in his fantasy world of Glorantha.\nIn 1978, Chaosium published Steve Perrin's roleplaying game \"RuneQuest\", also set in Glorantha, following up with a second edition in 1980 and various supplements over the next six years.\nIn 1979, Chaosium entered the board wargame market with \"Reich\", \"Raiders and Traders\", and (in 1980) \"Panzer Pranks\". Although all received positive reviews, none of the games found an audience.\n1980s: Growth and licensing with Avalon Hill.\nIn 1980, the company officially incorporated as Chaosium Inc. That year, Stafford and Lynn Willis simplified the \"RuneQuest\" rules into the 16-page Basic Role-Playing (BRP). These simulationist, skill-based generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium's later \"d100\" RPGs, most notably \"Call of Cthulhu\", first published in 1981.\nChaosium entered into a licensing agreement with Avalon Hill in 1983 to produce a third edition of \"RuneQuest\". Avalon Hill manufactured and marketed the game, while Chaosium was responsible for acquisitions, design, development, and layout. Ken Rolston managed the line as \"Rune Czar\".\nOne of the first RPGs by a female lead designer was published by Chaosium: Kerie Campbell-Robson's 1986 release Hawkmoon. 1986 also saw the release of \"Ghostbusters\" with West End Games. Designed by Sandy Petersen, Lynn Willis, and Greg Stafford, it was the first RPG to use the dice pool mechanic. West End would also use the system as the basis of \"\" and, eventually, the D6 System.\nLate 1990s\u2013early 2010s: Financial struggle.\nIn 1996, it was prematurely reported that Chaosium had secured the rights to publish a collectible card game based on the video game Doom.\nIn 1998, following the financial failure of the collectible card game \"Mythos\", Greg Stafford resigned as Chaosium president and left the company, along with Sandy Petersen (although they both remained shareholders). Chaosium effectively split up into various successor companies, each maintaining its focus on a few of the company's products. Stafford took the rights to his game setting Glorantha, setting up the company Issaries, Inc. to continue publishing this line (later licensing it to Moon Design Publications, along with the game HeroQuest).\nLong-time employees and part-owners Charlie Krank and Lynn Willis remained at Chaosium as President and Editor-in-Chief respectively, continuing on with \"Call of Cthulhu\" as the main product line. Lynn Willis retired in 2008 due to poor health and died in 2013.\nMid 2010s: The return of Stafford and Petersen.\nProblems and delays fulfilling the Kickstarters for the 7th edition of \"Call of Cthulhu\" led Stafford and Petersen to return to active roles at Chaosium in June 2015. Charlie Krank subsequently left the company.\nLater that year at Gen Con 2015, Stafford and Petersen announced Moon Design Publications were now part of the Chaosium ownership, and the four principals of Moon Design (Rick Meints, Jeff Richard, Michael O'Brien, and Neil Robinson) had become the new Chaosium management team. Chaosium once again became the licensed publisher for \"RuneQuest\", \"HeroQuest\", and other products related to Glorantha and continued to publish the \"Call of Cthulhu\" line. Stafford served as chair of the company board and creative consultant until his death in October 2018. Since retiring from the board in 2019, Petersen has done occasional freelance work for the company, as did original RuneQuest creator Steve Perrin until his death in 2021.\nAs part of its financial reorganization, the new management closed the company office and warehouse in Hayward, California, ending Chaosium's long association with the San Francisco Bay Area. The company is now based in Ann Arbor, Michigan and uses a fulfillment house model for distribution of product.\nDelivery of the core rewards of the Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition Kickstarter finally commenced in April 2016. The new edition went on to win nine of the ten awards it was nominated for at the Gen Con 2017 ENnie Awards.\nLate 2010s to Present: Expansion.\nAfter the consolidation and reorganization of the mid-decade, the company was again poised to expand its offerings through a combination of acquisitions, new licenses, and distribution deals.\nGreg Stafford's \"King Arthur Pendragon\" and \"\" roleplaying games returned to Chaosium ownership on December 11, 2018.\nOn April 2, 2019, Chaosium acquired the rights to the \"7th Sea\" product line (both Second Edition and Khitai Kickstarters) from John Wick, including back stock of books published so far.\nOn November 30, 2019, Chaosium acquired the rights to produce a role-playing game based on Ben Aaronovitch's \"Rivers of London\" urban fantasy novels.\nIn the spring of 2020, Chaosium took over distribution of the English translations of Spanish fantasy game \"Aquelarre\" and French Ice Age roleplaying game \"W\u00fcrm\", both of which had been successfully kickstarted by Nocturnal Media. In February 2021, they added \"Upwind\", an original game kickstarted by Nocturnal Media and Biohazard Games, to that list.\nOn August 20, 2021, Chaosium acquired the rights to \"Cthulhu Britannica\" and \"World War Cthulhu\", formerly produced under license by Cubicle 7 until 2017.\nOn October 26, 2021, Moon Design Publishing announced it was forming a partnership with Black Monk Games of Poland and a new company, The Chaosium Group, was being formed to manage both.\nFiction.\nChaosium began publishing a line of non-game books (primarily fiction) in 1993. Many titles are themed around H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and related topics, although the first work published was Greg Stafford's fantasy work \"King of Sartar\", set in his mythic world Glorantha.\n\"Cassilda's Song\", a 2015 anthology based on Robert W. Chambers's King in Yellow and written entirely by women, was nominated for two 2016 World Fantasy Awards.\nIn May 2017, Chaosium appointed award-winning author and editor James Lowder as executive editor of fiction. Lowder had previously served as a consultant for Chaosium, helping the company and freelancers resolve payment and contract problems with past fiction projects.\nAlthough not published by Chaosium, the ongoing \"Wild Cards\" series of superhero science fiction originated from a long-running \"Superworld\" campaign gamemastered by Game of Thrones author George R.

{"id": "6610", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6610", "title": "Carolina Panthers", "text": "National Football League franchise in Charlotte, North Carolina\nThe Carolina Panthers are a professional American football team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Panthers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The team is headquartered in Bank of America Stadium in Uptown Charlotte, which also serves as the team's home field. The Panthers are supported throughout the Carolinas; although the team has played its home games in Charlotte since 1996, it played its home games at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina, during its first season in 1995.\nThe Panthers were announced as the league's 29th franchise in 1993 and began play in 1995 under founding owner Jerry Richardson. The Panthers played well in their first two years, finishing 7\u20139 in 1995 (an all-time best record for an NFL expansion team's first season) and 12\u20134 the following year, winning the NFC West before ultimately losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. They did not have another winning season until 2003 when they won the NFC Championship Game and reached Super Bowl XXXVIII, losing 32\u201329 to the New England Patriots. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 (3rd NFC Championship appearance) and 2008, the team failed to make another playoff appearance until 2013, the first of three consecutive NFC South titles. After losing in the divisional round to the San Francisco 49ers in 2013 and the Seattle Seahawks in 2014, the Panthers returned to the Super Bowl in 2015 but lost to the Denver Broncos. Since then, the team has appeared in the playoffs only once, in 2017. The team's five NFC South titles since the division's establishment in 2002 rank third to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints who are both tied at seven.\nThe franchise is legally registered as Panther Football, LLC, and is controlled by David Tepper, whose purchase of the team from founder Jerry Richardson was unanimously approved by league owners on May 22, 2018. The club, which \"Forbes\" valued at approximately US$2.3\u00a0billion in 2018, is estimated at $4.1 billion in 2023.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nOn December 15, 1987, entrepreneur Jerry Richardson announced his bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1959 league championship bonus to co-franchise the first Hardee's restaurant in Spartanburg, SC, eventually expanding to a chain of franchises as co-founder of Spartan Food Systems before becoming president and CEO of Flagstar. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, and a number of businessmen from North and South Carolina who were also recruited to be limited partners. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte.\nTo highlight the demand for professional football in the Carolinas, Richardson Sports held preseason games around the area from 1989 to 1991. The first two games were held at Carter\u2013Finley Stadium in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Kenan Memorial Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, while the third and final game was held at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. The matchups were between existing NFL teams. In 1991, the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot, and on October 26, 1993, the 28 NFL owners unanimously named the Carolina Panthers as the 29th member of the NFL. In the 1995 NFL draft, the Panthers selected quarterback Kerry Collins out of Penn State with their first ever draft selection.\nJerry Richardson era (1995\u20132017).\nThe Panthers first competed in the 1995 NFL season; they were one of two expansion teams to begin playing that year, the other being the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Panthers were put in the NFC West to increase the size of that division to five teams; there were already two other southeastern teams in the division, the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints. Former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Dom Capers was named the first head coach. The Panthers played their first regular season game in Week 1 of the 1995 season. The team fell to the Atlanta Falcons 23\u201320 in overtime. After a 0\u20135 start, with three close losses, the Panthers won their first game in franchise history, a 26\u201315 win over the New York Jets. The team finished its inaugural season 7\u20139, the best performance ever from a first-year expansion team. They performed even better in their second season, finishing with a 12\u20134 record and winning the NFC West division, as well as securing a first-round bye. The Panthers beat the defending Super Bowl champions Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round 26\u201317 before losing the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers 30\u201313. The team managed only a 7\u20139 finish in 1997 and slipped to 4\u201312 in 1998, leading to Capers' dismissal as head coach.\nThe Panthers hired former San Francisco 49ers head coach George Seifert to replace Capers, and he led the team to an 8\u20138 record in 1999. The team finished 7\u20139 in 2000 and fell to 1\u201315 in 2001, winning their first game but losing their last 15. This performance tied the NFL record for most losses in a single season, and it broke the record held by the winless 1976 Buccaneers for most consecutive losses in a single season (both records have since been broken by the 2008 Lions), leading the Panthers to fire Seifert. One highlight from the loss-ridden 2001 season was the drafting of future franchise wide receiver Steve Smith. He was a third-round selection in the 2001 NFL draft by the team.\nJohn Fox years (2002\u20132010).\nAfter the NFL's expansion to 32 teams in 2002, the Panthers were relocated from the NFC West to the newly created NFC South division. The Panthers' rivalries with the Falcons and Saints were maintained, and they would be joined by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Panthers had the second overall pick in the 2002 NFL draft. The team selected future Hall of Fame defensive end Julius Peppers out of North Carolina. New York Giants defensive coordinator John Fox was hired to replace Seifert and led the team to a 7\u20139 finish in 2002. Although the team's defense gave up very few yards, ranking the second-best in the NFL in yards conceded, they were hindered by an offense that ranked as the second-worst in the league in yards gained.\nPrior to the 2003 season, the team signed quarterback Jake Delhomme. The Panthers improved to 11\u20135 in the 2003 regular season, winning the NFC South. The Panthers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 29\u201310 in the Wild Card Round, the St. Louis Rams 29\u201323 in the Divisional Round, and the Philadelphia Eagles 14\u20133 in the NFC Championship. They advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII before losing to the New England Patriots, 32\u201329. The game was immediately hailed by sportswriter Peter King as the \"Greatest Super Bowl of all time\". King felt the game \"was a wonderful championship battle, full of everything that makes football dramatic, draining, enervating, maddening, fantastic, exciting\" and praised, among other things, the unpredictability, coaching, and conclusion. The game is still viewed as one of the best Super Bowls of all time, and in the opinion of Charlotte-based NPR reporter Scott Jagow, the Panthers' Super Bowl appearance represented the arrival of Charlotte onto the national scene.\nFollowing a 1\u20137 start in 2004, the Panthers rebounded to win six of their last seven games despite losing 14 players for the season due to injury. They lost their last game to New Orleans, finishing the 2004 season at 7\u20139. Had they won the game, the Panthers would have made the playoffs. The team improved to 11\u20135 in 2005, finishing second in the division behind Tampa Bay and clinching a playoff berth as a wild card. In the first round of the playoffs, the Panthers went on the road to face the New York Giants, beating them 23\u20130 for the NFL's first playoff shutout against a home team since 1980. The following week, they beat Chicago 29\u201321 on the road, but lost key players Julius Peppers, a defensive end, and DeShaun Foster, a running back, who were both injured during the game. The Panthers were then defeated 34\u201314 by the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game, ending their season. Although the Panthers went into the 2006 season as favorites to win the NFC South and the free agent signing of Keyshawn Johnson, they finished with a disappointing 8\u20138 record. The team finished the 2007 season with a 7\u20139 record after losing quarterback Jake Delhomme early in the season due to an elbow injury.\nIn 2008, the Panthers rebounded with a 12\u20134 regular season record, winning the NFC South and securing a first round bye. They were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs, losing 33\u201313 to the eventual NFC Champion Arizona Cardinals after Delhomme turned the ball over six times. Delhomme's struggles carried over into the 2009 season, where he threw 18 interceptions in the first 11 games before breaking a finger in his throwing hand. The Panthers were at a 4\u20137 record before Delhomme's season-ending injury, and his backup, Matt Moore, led the team to a 4\u20131 finish to the season for an 8\u20138 overall record. In 2010, after releasing Delhomme in the offseason, the Panthers finished with a league-worst (2\u201314) record; their offense was the worst in the league. John Fox's contract expired after the season ended, and the team did not retain him or his staff.\nRon Rivera years (2011\u20132019).\nThe team hired Ron Rivera to replace Fox as head coach and drafted Auburn's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Cam Newton with the first overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft. The Panthers opened the 2011 season 2\u20136, but finished with a 6\u201310 record, and Newton was awarded the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award after setting the NFL record for most rushing touchdowns from a quarterback (14) in a single season and becoming the first rookie NFL quarterback to throw for over 4,000\u00a0yards in a single season, thus setting the NFL rookie record. He also was the first rookie quarterback to rush for over 500\u00a0yards in a single season. \nAfter strengthening the defense with future all-pro Luke Kuechly in the first round of the 2012 draft, the Panthers again opened the 2012 season poorly, losing five out of their first six games, leading longtime general manager Marty Hurney to be fired in response. The team slid to a 2\u20138 record before winning five of their last six games, resulting in a 7\u20139 record. This strong finish helped save Rivera's job. \nThe Panthers had a winning season the following year, finishing with a 12\u20134 record and winning their third NFC South title and another playoff bye, but they were beaten by the 49ers in the Divisional Round. In 2014, the Panthers opened the season with two wins, but after 12 games, sat at 3\u20138\u20131 due in part to a seven-game winless streak. A four-game winning streak to end the season secured the team their second consecutive NFC South championship and a playoff berth, despite a losing record of 7\u20138\u20131. The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals, 27\u201316, in the wild card round to advance to the divisional playoffs, where they lost to eventual NFC champion Seattle, 31\u201317. The 2015 season saw the Panthers start the season 14\u20130 and finish the season 15\u20131, which tied for the best regular-season record in NFC history. The team had the league's top-scoring offense. During the same season, Cam Newton was named NFL MVP. The Panthers also secured their third consecutive NFC South championship, as well as their first overall top-seeded playoff berth. In the 2015\u201316 playoffs, the Panthers defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Divisional playoffs, 31\u201324, after shutting them out in the first half, 31\u20130, and the Arizona Cardinals, 49\u201315, in the NFC Championship Game to advance to Super Bowl 50, their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2003 season. The Panthers lost a defensive struggle to the AFC champion Denver Broncos, 24\u201310. In the 2016 season, the Panthers regressed on their 15\u20131 record from 2015, posting a 6\u201310 record and a last-place finish in the NFC South, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2012, and losing the division title to the second-seeded Falcons, who went on to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LI. In 2017, the Panthers finished with an 11\u20135 record and a #5 seed. However, they lost to the New Orleans Saints 31\u201326 in the Wild Card Round, their first loss in that round in franchise history.\nDavid Tepper era (2018\u2013present).\nOn May 16, 2018, David Tepper, formerly a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, finalized an agreement to purchase the Panthers. The sale price was nearly $2.3 billion, a record. The agreement was approved by the league owners on May 22, 2018. The sale officially closed on July 9, 2018. After starting 6\u20132, the Panthers finished the 2018 season 7\u20139. They began the 2019 season 5\u20133 but lost the last eight games to finish 5\u201311; late in the season, Tepper fired Rivera as head coach. Perry Fewell finished the season as interim coach, going 0\u20134. The 2019 season was marred with a season-ending injury to Cam Newton, who only played in two games that year. The Panthers turned to Kyle Allen and Will Grier at quarterback after Newton was out.\nMatt Rhule years (2020\u20132022).\nOn January 7, 2020, the Panthers hired Baylor head coach Matt Rhule as head coach. On January 15, 2020, Luke Kuechly announced his retirement from the league. On March 17, 2020, the Panthers signed Teddy Bridgewater to a three-year $63 million contract. On March 24, the Carolina Panthers released their 2011 first overall pick and 2015 MVP quarterback Cam Newton. The Panthers had a difficult 2020 season, losing several close games. They would finish 5\u201311 for the second straight year.\nFollowing the season, the Panthers traded for Sam Darnold from the New York Jets and shipped Bridgewater to the Denver Broncos. On November 11, 2021, the Panthers signed Cam Newton to a one-year deal after Darnold was put on injured reserve. However, the Panthers' struggles continued; despite winning their first three games of the 2021 season, they finished 5\u201312 and ended the season on a seven-game losing streak.\nAfter the Panthers began the season with a 1\u20134 record, Rhule was fired as head coach on October 10, 2022, finishing his tenure with an 11\u201327 record in two and a half seasons. Steve Wilks was named interim head coach as a result. The Panthers then initiated a rebuild, trading players such as Robbie Anderson and Christian McCaffrey. Steve Wilks would go 6\u20136 as the interim head coach, as the Panthers would finish the season with a 7\u201310 record.\nFrank Reich year (2023).\nOn January 26, 2023, former Indianapolis Colts head coach Frank Reich was hired as head coach. Reich was the first starting QB in Panthers history in 1995. Prior to the draft, the Panthers traded with the Chicago Bears to move up to the first overall pick. The trade involved Carolina swapping spots with the Bears and giving up their 2023 second-round pick, 2024 first-round pick, 2025 second-round pick, and wide receiver D. J. Moore. In the 2023 NFL draft, Reich's first and only as the Panthers head coach, the Panthers selected their potential franchise quarterback in Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young out of Alabama with the first overall pick.\nOn November 27, 2023, Reich was fired after a 1\u201310 start. Special teams coordinator Chris Tabor coached the remainder of the 2023 season, going 1\u20135 in those games as the Panthers finished with a league-worst 2\u201315 record.\nDave Canales (2024).\nOn January 25, 2024, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Dave Canales was hired as head coach. In the first regular season game of the season, the Panthers lost to the New Orleans saints with a score of 10\u201347 with Bryce Young registering 13 completions from 30 attempts and being intercepted twice. The Panthers finished with a 5\u201312 record in the 2024 season.\nLogo and uniforms.\nLogo.\nThe shape of the Panthers logo was designed to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina. The Panthers changed their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an \"aggressive, contemporary look\" as well as to give it a more three-dimensional feel. The primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth, where the features, particularly the muscular brow and fangs, are more pronounced, creating a more menacing look. The revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo, compared to the old design, which had a shade similar to teal on top of black.\nUniforms.\nBy the time they had been announced as the 29th NFL team in October 1993, the Panthers' logo and helmet design had already been finalized, but the uniform design was still under creation. After discussion, the Panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white, black, and blue and pants colored white and silver. The exact tone of blue, which they decided would be \"process blue\" (a shade lighter than Duke's and darker than North Carolina's), was the most difficult color to choose.\nThe team's uniform has remained largely the same since its creation, with only minor alterations, such as changing the sock color of the team's black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team's shoes from white to black. Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, said that no major uniform changes would be made in his lifetime.\nThe Panthers have three main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, designated their alternate uniforms, are the newest and were introduced in 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. Usually the Panthers opt for white or blue when the weather is expected to be hot and for black when the weather is expected to be cold.\nThe Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants and blue socks, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants and black socks; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.\nThe first such instance was in 1998 when the team paired their white jerseys with silver pants in a game against the Indianapolis Colts. The second instance was in 2012 during a game against the Denver Broncos when they paired their black jerseys with new black pants; this created an all-black uniform, with the exception of blue socks and silver helmets. The decision to wear blue socks was made by team captain Steve Smith, who felt the blue socks gave the uniforms a more distinct appearance compared with other teams that have all-black uniforms. The all-black uniforms won the \"Greatest Uniform in NFL History\" contest, a fan-voted contest run by NFL.com in July 2013. In July 2013, the team's equipment manager, Jackie Miles, said the Panthers intended to use the all-black uniform more in the future. The Panthers wore the all-black uniform three times the following season, once each in the preseason and regular season, and the third time during the home divisional round playoff game vs the 49ers. During the Panthers' 2015 Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys, they debuted an all-blue uniform as part of Nike's \"Color Rush\" series.\nThe team's uniform did not change significantly after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase \"Keep Pounding\". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying \"When I found out I had cancer, there were two things I could do \u2013 quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!\"\nIn 2019, the Panthers unveiled new uniforms. The new uniforms are Nike's \"Vapor Untouchable\" and have only minor differences: the tapered strips on the pants are replaced by stripes that extend down to the socks, the reflective shoulder cloth was replaced and the hip logos were also removed. The uniforms keep the same basic look, colors, and numbers as the originals.\nIn 2022, after the NFL reinstated the use of alternate helmets, the Panthers unveiled secondary black helmets, which featured no white elements on the team logo.\nStadium and practice facilities.\nThe Panthers played their first season at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina, as their facility in uptown Charlotte was still under construction. Ericsson Stadium, called Bank of America Stadium since 2004, opened in the summer of 1996. The stadium was specially designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group for football and also serves as the headquarters and administrative offices of the Panthers. On some days, the stadium offers public tours for a fee. Private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week, though there are some exceptions, and such tours must be arranged in advance.\nTwo bronze panther statues flank each of the stadium's three main entrances; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the United States. The names of the team's original PSL owners are engraved on the base of each statue. The first two people in the Panthers Hall of Honor, team executive Mike McCormack and linebacker Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium. Mills, in addition to being the only player in the Hall of Honor for over 20 years, is the only player to have had his jersey number (#51) retired by the Panthers as of 2016[ [update]].\nThe Panthers have three open-air fields next to Bank of America Stadium where they currently hold their practices; during the 1995 season, when the team played their home games in South Carolina, the team held their practices at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Because the practice fields, along with the stadium, are located in uptown Charlotte, the fields are directly visible from skyscrapers as well as from a four-story condominium located across the street. According to Mike Cranston, a running joke said that the Panthers' division rivals had pooled their resources to purchase a room on the building's top floor and that a fire at the condominium was caused by the Panthers organization. In order to prevent people from seeing inside the field while the team is practicing, the team has added \"strategically planted trees and a tarp over the\u00a0... fence surrounding the fields\". Additionally, they employ a security team to watch for and chase away any people who stop alongside the fence surrounding the field. In the event of bad weather, the team moves their practices to an indoor sports facility about from the stadium. The team does not own this facility. The Panthers have hosted their annual training camp at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, since 1995.\nTeam headquarters.\nThe Panthers were planning on building a $1 billion team headquarters and training facility on a in Rock Hill, South Carolina, nicknamed \"The Rock\". After six months of discussions and state approval of $115 million in incentives, the formal announcement of the team's plan for a new practice facility came on June 5, 2019. Rock Hill mayor John Gettys described the project at that time as the biggest in the city's history. Groundbreaking took place in July 2019, and it was expected to be completed by summer 2023. The agreement with Rock Hill, however, ended up being terminated on April 19, 2022, with owner David Tepper filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nCulture.\nThe Panthers are supported in both North Carolina and South Carolina; South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley declared July 30, 2012, \"Carolina Panthers Day\" in her state, saying that \"when it comes to professional teams, the Carolina Panthers are the team that South Carolina calls their own\". During the 2015 NFC Championship and Super Bowl, the hashtag #OneCarolina was used by college and professional sports teams from North Carolina and South Carolina to show unified support for the Panthers.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" graded the Panthers as having the 10th highest \"NFL Fan Value Experience\" in 2007, attributing much of the fan atmosphere to the team's newness when compared to the established basketball fanbase. They also observed that the stadium has scattered parking lots, each of which has a different tailgating style. Some have fried chicken, pork, or Carolina-style barbecue, while others have live bands and televisions. Pickup football games in the parking lots are common. The Carolina Panthers have a home stadium capacity of just under 75,000, with home attendance ranking in the NFL's top ten since 2006.\nMascot, cheerleaders, and drumline.\nSir Purr, an anthropomorphic black panther who wears a jersey numbered '00', has been the Panthers' mascot since their first season. During games, Sir Purr provides sideline entertainment through skits and \"silly antics\". The mascot participates in a number of community events year-round, including a monthly visit to the patients at Levine Children's Hospital. Sir Purr also hosts the annual Mascot Bowl, an event which pits pro and college mascots against each other during halftime at a selected Panthers home game.\nThe team's cheerleaders are the Carolina Topcats who lead cheers and entertain fans at home games. The TopCats participate in both corporate and charity events. In March 2022, the Carolina Topcats became the first NFL cheerleading team to have a transgender member, Justine Lindsay. The team's drumline is PurrCussion, an ensemble of snare, tenor, and bass drummers as well as cymbal players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.\nKeep Pounding Drum.\nStarting with the 2012 season, the Panthers introduced the Keep Pounding Drum, inspired by the aforementioned motivational speech by Sam Mills before the team's 2004 playoff game against the Cowboys. Prior to each home game, an honorary drummer hits the six-foot-tall drum four times to signify the four quarters of an American football game. According to the team, the drummers \"come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations, but all have overcome a great trial or adversity that has not only made them strong but also pushes them to make others around them stronger\". Drummers have included current and former Panthers players, military veterans, Make-A-Wish children, and athletes from other sports, including NBA MVP and Charlotte native Stephen Curry, US women's national soccer team players Whitney Engen and Heather O'Reilly, and 7 time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson.\nSongs and traditions.\nDuring the inaugural season of the Panthers, the team had an official fight song, which the team played before each home game. The song, \"Stand and Cheer\", remains the team's official fight song, but the team does not typically play it before home games. Due to negative fan reaction \"Stand and Cheer\" was pulled in 1999. Since 2006, the song has returned. The team plays Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" after home victories.\nA \"keep pounding\" chant was introduced during the 2012 season which starts before the opening kickoff of each home game. As prompted by the video boards, one side of the stadium shouts \"keep\" and the other side replies with \"pounding\". The chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games.\nCharity and community work.\nThe Carolina Panthers support a variety of non-profits in North and South Carolina through the Carolina Panthers Charities. Four annual scholarships are awarded to student athletes through the Carolina Panthers Graduate Scholarship and the Carolina Panthers Players Sam Mills Memorial Scholarship programs. Carolina Panthers Charities also offers grants to non-profits that support education, athletics, and human services in the community. The Panthers and Fisher Athletic have provided six equipment grants to high school football teams in the Carolinas each year since 2010. Carolina Panthers Charities raises funds at three annual benefits: the Countdown to Kickoff Luncheon, the team's first public event each season; Football 101, an educational workshop for fans; and the Weekend Warrior Flag Football Tournament, a two-day non-contact flag football tournament. Another annual benefit is Taste of the Panthers, a gourmet food tasting which raises funds for Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina.\nIn 2003 the Panthers and Carolinas HealthCare Foundation established the Keep Pounding Fund, a fundraising initiative to support cancer research and patient support programs. The Panthers community has raised more than $1.4 million for the fund through direct donations, charity auctions, blood drives, and an annual 5k stadium run. The Panthers and Levine Children's Hospital coordinate monthly hospital visits and VIP game-day experiences for terminally ill or hospitalized children.\nIn addition to these team-specific efforts, the Panthers participate in a number of regular initiatives promoted by the NFL and USA Football, the league's youth football development partner. These include USA Football Month, held throughout August to encourage and promote youth football; A Crucial Catch, the league's Breast Cancer Awareness Month program; Salute to Service, held throughout November to support military families and personnel; and PLAY 60, which encourages young NFL fans to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.\nRadio and television.\nRadio coverage is provided by flagship station WRFX and through the Carolina Panthers Radio Network, with affiliates throughout the Carolinas and Virginia. The Panthers' radio broadcasting team is led by play-by-play voice Anish Shroff, with Jake Delhomme as color analyst, and WBT sports director Jim Szoke as studio host. The radio network broadcasts pre-game coverage, games with commentary, and post-game wrap-ups. It also live-broadcasts \"Panther Talk\", a weekly event at Bank of America Stadium which offers fans a chance to meet a player and ask questions of the staff.\nNational broadcasting and cable television networks cover regular-season games, as well as some preseason games. Locally, Fox affiliate WJZY airs most regular-season games, while home games against an AFC team typically air on CBS affiliate WBTV. Any appearances on Monday Night Football are simulcast on ABC affiliate WSOC-TV, while any appearances on Thursday Night Football are simulcast on WSOC. Sunday night and some Thursday night games are aired on NBC affiliate WCNC-TV.\nAll preseason games and team specials are televised by the Carolina Panthers Television Network on flagship station WSOC-TV in Charlotte and fourteen affiliate stations throughout the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. WSOC took over as the Panthers' television partner for the 2019 season, replacing longtime television partner WCCB, which had retained this role after losing the Fox affiliation to WJZY in 2013. As of 2021, the preseason television broadcasting team consists of play-by-play commentator Taylor Zarzour, color analyst and former Panthers player Steve Smith, and sideline reporter Kristen Balboni. The network also hosts \"The Panthers Huddle\", a weekly show focusing on the Panthers' upcoming opponent.\nThe Panthers also offer game broadcasts in Spanish throughout both Carolinas and Mexico, with Jaime Moreno and To\u00f1o Ramos providing commentary.\nRivalries.\nThe Panthers have developed heated rivalries with the three fellow members of the NFC South (the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New Orleans Saints). The team's fiercest rivals are the Falcons and Buccaneers.\nThe Falcons are a natural geographic rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only south on I-85. The two teams have played each other twice a year since the Panthers' inception, and games between the two teams feature large numbers of the visiting team's fans. As of the 2023 season, the Falcons lead the all-time series 36\u201322. The teams have never met in the postseason.\nThe Panthers' rivalry with Tampa Bay has been described as the most intense in the NFC South. The rivalry originated in 2002 with the formation of the NFC South, but became particularly heated before the 2003 season with verbal bouts between players on the two teams. It escalated further when the Panthers went to Tampa Bay and beat them in what ESPN.com writer Pat Yasinskas described as \"one of the most physical contests in recent memory\". The rivalry has resulted in a number of severe injuries for players on both teams, some of which were caused by foul play. One of these plays, an illegal hit on Tampa Bay punt returner Clifton Smith, sparked a brief melee between the teams in 2009. As of 2023, the Panthers lead the all-time series 25\u201322. The two teams have never met in the postseason.\nAs of the 2023 season, the Saints lead the all-time series against the Panthers 31\u201328. The teams faced off in their lone postseason meeting in the 2017\u201318 postseason in the Wild Card Round with the Saints being victorious 31\u201326.\nPlayers.\nHall of Honor.\nThe Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor was established in 1997 to honor individuals for their contributions to the Carolina Panthers organization.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Carolina Panthers have retired one number.\nPro Football Hall of Fame enshrinees.\nNominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which \"honor[s] individuals who have made outstanding contributions to professional football\", are determined by a 46-member selection committee. At least 80% of voters must approve the nominee for him to be inducted.\nOwnership and administration.\nJerry Richardson.\nJerry Richardson was the founder and first owner of the Carolina Panthers. Richardson and his family owned about 48% of the team, with the remaining 52% owned by a group of 14 limited partners. Richardson and the other investors paid $206\u00a0million for the rights to start the team in 1993.\nTeam president.\nMike McCormack, a Hall of Fame lineman for the Cleveland Browns and former coach and executive for the Seattle Seahawks, was the Panthers' first team president, presiding in that role from 1994 until his retirement in 1997; McCormack was inducted as the first person in the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor later that year. Jerry Richardson's son, Mark, was appointed as the team's second president in 1997 and served in that role until he stepped down in 2009. His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father. Mark Richardson was replaced by Danny Morrison, who had previously served as the athletic director of both Texas Christian University and Wofford College, Richardson's alma mater. Morrison resigned in early 2017. The role was vacant until August 2018, when Tom Glick was hired as team president. He had previously served as the COO of Manchester City.\nDavid Tepper.\nOn May 16, 2018, David Tepper, formerly a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, finalized an agreement to purchase the Carolina Panthers, for nearly $2.3 billion, a record at the time. The agreement was approved by the league owners on May 22, 2018. According to \"Forbes\", the Panthers are worth approximately $2.3\u00a0billion as of 2018[ [update]]. They ranked the Carolina Panthers as the 21st-most valuable NFL team and the 36th-most valuable sports team in the world.\nCoaches.\nThe Carolina Panthers have had ten head coaches. Eight have served in official capacity with two being interim coaches. Dom Capers was the head coach from 1995 to 1998 and led the team to one playoff appearance. Counting playoff games, he finished with a record of 31\u201335 (.470). George Seifert coached the team from 1999 to 2001, recording 16 wins and 32 losses (.333). John Fox, the team's longest-tenured head coach, led the team from 2002 to 2010 and coached the team to three playoff appearances including Super Bowl XXXVIII which the Panthers lost. Including playoff games, Fox ended his tenure with a 78\u201374 (.513) record, making him the first Panthers coach to finish his tenure with the team with a winning record. Ron Rivera held the position from 2011 to 2019 and led the team to four playoff appearances including Super Bowl 50. Counting playoff games, he has a career record of 79\u201367\u20131 (.541). Statistically, Rivera holds the highest winning percentage of any Panthers head coach. On December 3, 2019, following a home loss against the Washington Redskins that sent the team's record to 5\u20137, Rivera was fired by David Tepper. Perry Fewell, then the defensive backs coach for the team, was named interim head coach the same day. On January 7, 2020, Matt Rhule was hired to be the Panthers head coach. Rhule was fired during his third season, with Steve Wilks taking over on an interim basis. Frank Reich was hired head coach on January 26, 2023. Frank Reich was let go as head coach on November 27, 2023. Dave Canales was hired as head coach on January 25, 2024.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSince they began playing football in 1995, the Panthers have been to four NFC Championship Games; they lost two (1996 and 2005) and won two (2003 and 2015). The Panthers have won six division championships: the NFC West championship in 1996 and the NFC South championship in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They have finished as runners-up in their division six times, finishing second-place in the NFC West in 1997 and 1999 and finishing second-place in the NFC South in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012. They have qualified for the playoffs 8 times, most recently in 2017.\nTeam records.\nKicker John Kasay is the team's career points leader. Kasay scored 1,482 points during his 16 seasons (1995\u20132010) with the Panthers. Quarterback Cam Newton is the Panthers' career passing leader; he threw for 29,041 yards over his nine seasons with the team (2011\u20132020). Running back Jonathan Stewart is the career rushing leader for the Carolina Panthers. Stewart, during his tenure with the team (2008\u20132018), rushed for 6,868 yards with the Panthers. Wide receiver Steve Smith, the team's leading receiver, recorded 12,197 receiving yards during his 13-year (2001\u20132013) tenure with the team.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6611", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6611", "title": "Chicago Bears", "text": "American football team based in Chicago\nThe Chicago Bears are a professional American football team based in Chicago. The Bears compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are one of two remaining franchises from the NFL founding in 1920, along with the Arizona Cardinals, which also began in Chicago. The Bears played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's North Side through the 1970 season; they have played since then at Soldier Field on the Near South Side, adjacent to Lake Michigan.\nThe franchise was founded in Decatur, Illinois, on September 20, 1919, became professional on September 17, 1920, and moved to Chicago in 1921. The Bears have won nine NFL Championships, eight before the AFL\u2013NFL merger and one Super Bowl. They hold the NFL records for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears' NFL championships and overall victories are second behind the Green Bay Packers, with whom they have a long-standing rivalry. The Bears reached their greatest modern period of success in the 1980s under head coach Mike Ditka, with whom they won Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. The Bears appeared in their second Super Bowl during the 2006 season, which they lost to the Indianapolis Colts. \nSince 2006, the Bears have struggled to find regular success, winning their last playoff game in 2011 and last division title in 2018. During that time, the Bears have had 23 different starting quarterbacks and six different head coaches. The team headquarters, Halas Hall, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities there during the season, and began hosting training camp at Halas Hall in 2020 after major renovations. In September 2025, a sale of a minority stake in the team valued the Bears at $8.9 billion.\nHistory.\n1919\u20131939: Early Bears.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In March of 1920 a man telephoned me ... George Chamberlain and he was general superintendent of the A.E. Staley Company ... In 1919, [the company's Fellowship Club] had formed a football team. It had done well against other local teams but Mr. Staley wanted to build it into a team that could compete successfully with the best semi-professional and industrial teams in the country ... Mr. Chamberlain asked if I would like to come to Decatur and work for the Staley Company.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOriginally named the Decatur Staleys, the club was established by the A. E. Staley food starch company of Decatur, Illinois, as a company team. This was the typical start for several early professional football franchises. The team played independently in 1919, winning the Central Illinois Championship. The company hired George Halas and Edward \"Dutch\" Sternaman in 1920 to run the team. The 1920 Decatur Staleys season was their inaugural regular season completed in the newly formed American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922).\nFull control of the team was turned over to Halas and Sternaman in 1921. Official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.\nThe team moved to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the Chicago Staleys; Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, they received US$5,000 to keep the name \"Staleys\" for the 1921 season.\nIn 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears. The team moved into Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city's baseball team (bears' young are called \"cubs\"). Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the University of Illinois, and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is Pantone 5395, navy blue, and the orange is Pantone 1665, similar to burnt orange).\nThe Staleys/Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the Canton Bulldogs (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4\u20134\u20132 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.\nThe Bears' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.\nThe franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in 1921 and remaining competitive throughout the decade.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn December 7, 1924, the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the Cleveland Bulldogs, even putting the title \"World's Champions\" on their 1924 team photo. The NFL had ruled, however, that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland. Their only losing season came in 1929.\nDuring the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player Red Grange within a day of his final game as a collegian.\nDespite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000\u20136,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000\u201350,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21\u20130. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback Joey Sternaman. Later in 1925, the Bears went on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17\u20137 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60\u20133 win over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.\nAny hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to a team in the newly-formed American Football League (AFL), the New York Yankees, which was owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback Joey Sternaman, who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man who replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.\nAfter the financial losses of the 1932 Championship season, Halas's partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the 1932 \"Unofficial\" NFL Championship, the Bears defeated the Portsmouth Spartans in the first NFL playoff game. Due to blizzard conditions in Chicago, the game was played at Chicago Stadium, marking it as the first indoor American football game.\nThe success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the first NFL Championship, the Bears played against the New York Giants, defeating them 23\u201321. The teams met again in the 1934 NFL Championship where the Giants, wearing sneakers defeated the Bears 30\u201313 on a cold, icy day at the Polo Grounds.\n1940s: The Monsters of the Midway.\nFrom 1940 to 1947, quarterback Sid Luckman led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the University of Chicago's discarded nickname \"Monsters of the Midway\" and their famous helmet wishbone-C, as well as a newly penned theme song that declared them \"The Pride and Joy of Illinois\". One famous victory during that period was their 73\u20130 victory over the favored Washington Redskins at Griffith Stadium in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results. The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The T-formation, as Halas named it, involved two running backs instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman established himself as one of the franchise's most elite quarterbacks. Between 1939 and 1950, he set the Bears' passing records for most career touchdowns, yards, and completions. Many of Luckman's records stood for decades before they were eclipsed by Jay Cutler in 2014.\nCutler then went on to break Luckman's franchise record for most career passing touchdowns a year later in 2015.\n1950s\u20131968: Late-Halas era.\nAfter declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in 1963 to capture its eighth NFL Championship, which would be its last until 1985. The late 1960s and early-1970s produced notable players like Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, and Brian Piccolo, who died of embryonal carcinoma in 1970. The American television network ABC aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled \"Brian's Song\", starring James Caan and Billy Dee Williams in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; Jack Warden won an Emmy Award for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era.\nHalas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between the NFL and the American Football League, the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the National Football Conference, a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC Championship trophy as the George Halas Memorial Trophy.\n1969\u20131982: Struggles.\nAfter the merger, the Bears finished the 1970 season last place in their division, a repeat of their placing in the 1969 season. In 1975, the Bears drafted Walter Payton from Jackson State University with their first pick. He won the NFL Most Valuable Player award in the 1977\u201378 season. Payton would go on to eclipse Jim Brown's NFL career rushing record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until 2002, when Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys surpassed it. Payton's career and personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him \"Sweetness\". He died from a rare form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.\nOn November 1, 1983, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the chairman of the board. Their son Michael became the third president in team history. Virginia holds the honorary title of \"secretary of the board of directors\", but has been called the glue that holds the franchise together. Virginia's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a heart attack in 1979. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her \"The First Lady of Sports\", and the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" has listed her as one of Chicago's most powerful women.\n1983\u20131985: Contenders, then Super Bowl champions.\nMike Ditka, a tight end for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team by George Halas in 1982. His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\". The team reached the NFC Championship game, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 23\u20130, in 1984. In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears\u2013Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315-pound defensive tackle \"Refrigerator\" Perry as a running back in a touchdown play at Lambeau Field, against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the AFL-NFL merger, in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary 46 defense and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a Monday night affair in which they were defeated by the Miami Dolphins. At the time, much was made of the fact that the 1972 Dolphins were the only franchise in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the New England Patriots in the AFC title game. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.\n1986\u20132003: Post-Super Bowl era.\nAfter the 1985 championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the Super Bowl under Ditka. Throughout the remainder of his tenure, Ditka led the Bears to five more postseason berths, getting as far as the NFC Championship in the 1988 season. Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of Lovie Smith, the Bears had two head coaches, Dave Wannstedt and Dick Jauron. While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.\nBefore the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, Dave McGinnis (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms. Soon after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with Ted Phillips and promoting Michael to chairman of the board. Phillips became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team. From 1997 to 2000, the Bears suffered four consecutive last place finishes within the division.\nIn the 2001 season, Jim Miller took over as the primary starting quarterback and helped lead the Bears to a resurgent 13\u20133 record and division title. The 2001 team did not see any postseason success as they fell 33\u201319 to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round. The 2002 season saw a setback as the team went 4\u201312. The team improved to a 7\u20139 record in 2003 but still missed the postseason. Jauron was fired after the 2003 season.\n2004\u20132012: Lovie Smith era.\nLovie Smith, hired on January 15, 2004, is the third post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful Tampa 2 defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then Illinois head coach Ron Turner to improve the Bears' struggling offense. In 2005, the Bears won their division and reached the playoffs for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in 2001. The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 13 of the 2006 season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to Super Bowl XLI. However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29\u201317 to the Indianapolis Colts. After the 2006 season, the club gave Smith\u2014the lowest-paid head coach in the NFL\u2014a contract extension through 2011, at roughly $5\u00a0million per year.\nThe club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in 1920. Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins with 704 and had an overall record of 704\u2013512\u201342 (687\u2013494\u201342 during the regular season, 17\u201318 in the playoffs). On November 18, 2010, the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 against the Miami Dolphins.\nOn April 2, 2009, the Bears made one of the biggest trades in franchise history: acquiring Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler from the Denver Broncos for Kyle Orton and draft picks. After a disappointing 2009 campaign with the team going 7\u20139, Mike Martz was hired as the team's offensive coordinator on February 1, 2010. On March 5, 2010, the Bears signed defensive end Julius Peppers, running back Chester Taylor, and tight end Brandon Manumaleuna, spending over $100\u00a0million on the first day of free agency. Also during the 2010 offseason, Michael McCaskey was replaced by brother George McCaskey as chairman of the Bears. With a 38\u201334 win against the New York Jets, the Bears clinched the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye for the 2010\u201311 NFL playoffs. In their first Playoff game since Super Bowl XLI, The Bears defeated the No. 4 seed Seattle Seahawks 35\u201324 in the Divisional Round. The Bears reached the NFC Championship Game, where they played Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field \u2013 only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals, the only other game played in 1941. The Bears lost the game, 21\u201314.\nThe team started the 2011 season strong with a 7\u20133 record, and running back Matt Fort\u00e9 led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage. Eventually, quarterback Jay Cutler fractured his thumb, and Fort\u00e9 also was lost for the season against the Kansas City Chiefs after spraining his MCL, and the Bears, with Caleb Hanie playing, lost five straight before winning against the Minnesota Vikings with Josh McCown starting over Hanie. At season's end, general manager Jerry Angelo was fired, and former Chiefs director of scouting and former Bears scout Phil Emery was brought in. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz resigned, and eventually retired, and was replaced by offensive line coach Mike Tice. The Bears made another notable move by trading for Miami Dolphins receiver and Pro Bowl MVP Brandon Marshall. The Bears became the first team in NFL history to return six interceptions for touchdowns in the first seven games of the season, with another pick-six by Brian Urlacher in Week 9 bringing Chicago two behind the record set by the 1961 San Diego Chargers. However, the Bears missed the playoffs with a record of 10\u20136 (after starting the season 7\u20131, the first team to start with the record and miss the playoffs since the 1996 Washington Redskins), and Smith was fired on December 31.\n2013\u20132014: Marc Trestman years.\nThen-CFL head coach and former NFL journeyman Marc Trestman was hired to succeed Smith after an exhaustive search that included at least 13 known candidates. On March 20, 2013, Brian Urlacher's 13-year tenure with the Bears ended when both sides failed to agree on a contract. The Trestman era began on September 8 with a 24\u201321 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, making Trestman the fourth head coach in Bears history to win in his coaching debut, after George Halas (1920), Neill Armstrong (1978) and Dick Jauron (1999). The Bears ended the 2013 season 8\u20138, barely missing the playoffs after losing in the final week of the season to the Packers. Despite having a second-ranked offense that set numerous franchise records, the defense greatly worsened as it set franchise worsts in categories like yards allowed (6,313).\nThe following season was a disaster for the Bears, with the offense regressing to finish outside the top 20 in scoring. The team also allowed 50-point games in two straight weeks against the Patriots and Packers, including a franchise-high 42 points and NFL-record six touchdowns allowed in the first half against the latter, to become the first team since the 1923 Rochester Jeffersons to allow at least 50 points in consecutive games. The Bears ended the year 5\u201311 and last in the NFC North. Trestman and Emery were fired after the season ended.\n2015\u20132017: John Fox years.\nThe Bears hired Ryan Pace of the New Orleans Saints to be their new general manager on January 8, 2015. On January 16, 2015, John Fox accepted a four-year deal to become head coach. In Fox's first season as head coach, the Bears saw improvements from 2014; after \"USA Today\" projected the Bears to win three games, they doubled that total and finished the season with a 6\u201310 record, including a Thanksgiving win over the Packers at Lambeau Field.\nDuring the 2016 season, however, the Bears regressed heavily, compiling a 3\u201313 record (their worst since the NFL's change to 16-game seasons in 1978). The season included several injuries to starters and secondary players, including Jay Cutler, who only played five games as a result of two separate injuries. Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer started the next three games before a broken arm put him out for the season. He was replaced by Matt Barkley, who made his first career start with the Bears. None of the three quarterbacks returned for the 2017 season.\nIn the 2017 NFL draft, the team selected quarterback Mitchell Trubisky with the second-overall pick, who sat behind newly signed quarterback Mike Glennon for the first four games before taking over. The Bears ended the season 5\u201311 and again finished last in the NFC North. On January 1, 2018, Fox was fired, ending his tenure in Chicago with a 14\u201334 record.\n2018\u20132021: Matt Nagy years.\nThe Bears hired Matt Nagy from the Kansas City Chiefs as their new head coach in January 2018. General manager Ryan Pace signed receivers Taylor Gabriel, Allen Robinson, and Trey Burton in the offseason to complement second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. The Bears also acquired linebacker Khalil Mack in a block-blockbuster trade from the Oakland Raiders to further bolster their defense, sending a package of draft picks that includes 2019 and 2020 1st round draft picks in exchange. Nagy's Bears clinched the NFC North on December 16, 2018, for the first time since 2010 with a 24\u201317 victory over the Green Bay Packers. The Bears finished the 2018 season with a 12\u20134 record. They lost to the defending Super Bowl Champions Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round of the playoffs after Cody Parkey's game-winning field goal attempt was partially tipped and hit the uprights in the final seconds of the game, a play coined the \"Double Doink\". Despite the first-round exit, Nagy was named Coach of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) and Associated Press (AP). He was the first Bears coach to be given the AP award since Lovie Smith in 2005 and the fifth in team history.\nIn 2019, the team regressed to an 8\u20138 record, though Nagy's combined 20 wins in 2018 and 2019 were the most by a Bears head coach in his first two seasons. During the year, renovations to Halas Hall were completed, allowing the team to move Training Camp from Ward Field on the campus of Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais, Illinois to Lake Forest for 2020.\nThe Bears opened the 2020 season with a 5\u20131 record. However, they lost their next six games. The Bears won three of their last four games to finish the season with an 8\u20138 record. Despite their finish, the Bears qualified for the 2020\u201321 NFL playoffs, which was expanded to include one additional wildcard team from each conference. The New Orleans Saints defeated the Bears in the opening round of the playoffs, 21\u20139. The team did not re-sign Trubisky after the 2020 season and instead allowed him to become a free agent.\nBefore the 2021 season, the Bears traded up in the 2021 NFL draft to select quarterback Justin Fields 11th overall. The team also signed veteran quarterback Andy Dalton in free agency. Dalton was initially declared the Bears starting quarterback, but Fields won the position after Dalton was injured. The Bears finished the season with a 6\u201311 record and missed the playoffs. Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace were fired after the season's conclusion. Nagy posted a 34\u201333 record over four seasons with two playoff berths, while Pace compiled a 48\u201365 record over seven seasons.\n2022\u20132024: Matt Eberflus years.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Bears hired Ryan Poles as their general manager. The team hired Matt Eberflus as the franchise's 17th head coach two days later. The Bears struggled throughout the 2022 season, which included a franchise-record 10-game losing streak. They finished with an NFL worst 3\u201314 record, which secured the team the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft. The Bears traded the first overall pick to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for wide receiver D. J. Moore and multiple draft picks. The Bears opened the 2023 season with a 0\u20134 record, extending the team losing streak to 14 (longest in team history; dating back to the 2022 season). The team bounced back by winning five of their last eight games, but finished with a 7\u201310 record, placing last in the NFC North for the second consecutive season. However, the team acquired the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, which was part of their previous trade with the Panthers, who finished the 2023 season with worst record in the NFL. The first overall pick was used on USC quarterback Caleb Williams. The Bears fired Eberflus on November 29, with five games remaining in the 2024 NFL season. Eberflus, who a posted a 14\u201332 overall record with the Bears, was the first head coach in team history to be fired mid-season.\n2025\u2013present: Ben Johnson years.\nOn January 21, 2025, the Bears hired Ben Johnson as the franchise's 18th head coach.\nKnown for his offensive creativity, Johnson was brought in to help develop quarterback Caleb Williams and lead a new era of the team.\nOwnership.\nThe team is primarily owned by the heirs of George Halas. Before her passing, his daughter, Virginia Halas McCaskey (held 22.6% of the team shares), was the principal owner. She not only voted her shares, but those of her 11 children and two nephews (who each own 3.8%) as well as the Brizzolara family (who own 8.33%). This effectively gave her an 80.33% ownership stake, allowing her to control the team. Former chairman and CEO of Aon Corp. Pat Ryan (17.67%) and former Aon director Andrew J. McKenna's estate (2%) own the remainder 19.67% of the club. Ryan is also a board member. The McCaskey family has right of first refusal on stock sale, while Ryan's block has second refusal rights.\nIn 2020, \"Forbes\" magazine reported that the franchise is worth $3.525\u00a0billion, making it the seventh richest franchise in the NFL. Chicago is the third largest media market in the United States.\nIn a \"Crain's Chicago Business\" article, one businessman described his wishes for the team to maximize its potential. In 2009, \"Yahoo! Sports\" listed the McCaskeys as the third worst owner in the NFL, stating \"[T]hey get less for what they've got than any team in our league.\"\nOwnership history.\nThe club was founded by A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company owner Augustus Eugene Staley in 1919 and was owned by the company until 1921. In 1921, Staley felt he could no longer afford the expensive burden of pro-football and transferred team ownership to Halas and paid him $5,000 for a sponsorship deal that kept the Staleys name for one more year. Halas than added Edward \"Dutch\" Sternaman as a second owner. On January 28, 1922, the Bears were incorporated at an NFL meeting, as \"a new league team\" after its name change. At season's end, the two competed with agent Bill Harley for ownership of the Staleys, after he negotiated a contract that was to give his brother Chic Harley and himself one-third ownership of the team as part of his contract. However, Halas and Sternaman claimed that the contract was voided when a physical revealed health impairments resultant from Harley's time in the war. The other league owners agreed to nullify the deal in favor of the Halas/Sternaman partnership by an 8\u20132 vote. In addition, Halas and Sternaman offered a share of the team to Paddy Driscoll, but the move was blocked by the owners in the NFL's June meeting, after the Chicago Cardinals (Driscoll's team) activated the league's reserve clause.\nIn 1931, Sternaman offered to sell his stake to Halas for $38,000 to focus on his other businesses. Halas' purchase agreement with Sternaman was to be paid off in installments, and stipulated that if Halas defaulted on any of the payments, ownership of the team reverted to Sternaman. Halas raised the initial funding by selling an 8.33% ownership stake to Ralph Brizzolara, as well as $5,000 of shares to Jim McMillen, and George Trafton's mother, who paid $20,000 (Halas later bought her out for $40,000). Charles Bidwill purchased $5,000 in stock in 1933 (which was later bought off of his widow Violet for $50,000 in 1949) and he also arranged a bank loan for the remaining $5,000 needed to pay off Sternaman:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But it was a mighty close call. As I remember, I finally got all the money together at 11:10 a.m. on the day the final note came due. Forfeit time was 12 o'clock noon.\u2014\u200a\nHalas remained the club's president and principal owner until his death on October 31, 1983.\nHalas' children, George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. and Virginia McCaskey acquired stock in the team through gifts and sales. After Mugs' death in 1979, Halas Sr. owned a 49.35% interest in the Bears, Mugs' estate owned a 19.67% interest, while Virginia McCaskey, Jim Finks (3.5%, which he later relinquished when he resigned as the team GM), Charles Brizzolara, Robert and Carol Brizzolara in joint tenancy, and Nancy Lorenz owned the remaining outstanding shares. In 1981, the shareholders merged the Bears with a newly formed Delaware-incorporated organization, the Chicago Bears Football Club, Inc..\nIn 1987, Mugs' estate executor wanted to sell his ownership stake and challenged the legality of a 1981 corporate reorganization and the other owners' right of first refusal, while his heirs, Christine and Stephen Halas, wanted to keep their father's stake, asking a Cook County Probate Court judge not to allow the sale. Ultimately they failed to block the Chicago Bears from buying their father's 19.67% ownership stake of the team, which sold for $17.5 million in 1988. Bears then-president Michael McCaskey called the purchase a \"terrific financial burden\", and the team would later sell the stake to Chicago-area businessmen Andrew McKenna and Patrick Ryan for a then-undisclosed sum in 1990. At the time it was also speculated that they invested to help the Bears lobby lawmakers for a domed stadium. In 2017, the NFL approved a sale of shares from Mugs' children (unreported whom or how much) to the McCaskey family for an undisclosed sum.\nOn February 6, 2025, Virginia McCaskey died at the age of 102.\nIn September 2025, following the passing of Andrew McKenna two years prior, the McKenna family sold their minority stake of 2.35% to the McCaskey and Ryan families in a deal that valued the team at $8.9 billion.\nSponsorships.\nThe team has major sponsorship deals with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Miller Brewing Company, PNC Financial Services, United Airlines, Verizon, Xfinity, and Proven IT. The team was the first in the NFL to have a presenting sponsor, with the 2004 season advertised as \"Bears Football presented by BankOne\". Additionally, the Bears have an agreement with WFLD (the Fox owned-and-operated station in Chicago) to broadcast pre-season football games.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe club has had few official logos throughout their history. When the team was known as the Decatur Staleys in 1920, they used A. E. Staley's logo as football was intended to help promote the company. The first Chicago Bears logo was introduced in 1940, depicting a black bear running with a football. The next logo, introduced in 1946, featured a navy blue bear on top of a football.\nIn 1962, the Bears introduced their trademark \"wishbone-C\" logo for the first time. Initially white with a black outline, the logo is similar to the \"C\" long worn on the Cincinnati Reds' baseball caps, and very closely resembles the University of Chicago Maroons' \"C\" logo introduced in 1898. The change in the Bears' logo was due to the addition of logos on helmets, which professional football teams began adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nIn 2023, the Bears made their primary logo the orange bear head, which was previously their secondary logo since 1999. Despite demoting the \"C\" to a secondary logo, the team will still retain it on their helmets and at the home field's 50-yard line.\nTeam culture.\nMascots and cheerleaders.\nBefore the 2003 season, the team had two unofficial mascots named \"Rocky\" and \"Bearman\". \"Rocky\" was a man who donned a #1 Bears jersey, carried a megaphone, and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, in a fashion similar to Fireman Ed. The identity of \"Rocky\" is unknown, but he presumably lives in northwestern Indiana. Don Wachter, also known as \"Bearman\", is a season ticket holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading, similar to Rocky. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score (a role more recently done by the Bears 4th Phase and Bears captains). In 1996, he donned his \"costume\" of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number 46 jersey. \"Bearman\" was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of Staley Da Bear in 2003, but in 2005 Wachter was allowed in costume again.\nStaley Da Bear is an anthropomorphic bear with a customized No. 00 jersey, with blue and orange eyes, synonymous with the team's main colors. His name is eponymous to starch processing company A. E. Staley, who founded the Bears' franchise. Like Rocky and Bearman, he entertains Bears fans, but like other NFL mascots, and mascots in general, Staley also visits charity events, parties, Chicago Rush AFL games, and other Bears-related events, as well as taking part in games with his \"furballs\" against youth football teams at halftime.\nThe team had a cheerleading squad called the Chicago Honey Bears beginning in 1976. However, Bears owner Virginia Halas McCaskey terminated them after the 1985 season. The squad's uniforms changed three times: from 1976 to 1979, the uniform was a white bodysuit with navy blue sleeves; from 1980 to 1984 it was a white bodysuit with orange sleeves and the navy was moved to the trim, and for the squad's final season in 1985, the uniform was redesigned with an orange sequin vest.\nPhilanthropy.\nSince 1998, the Bears have partnered with 'A Safe Place,' a domestic violence shelter in Waukegan, Illinois. In June 2017, existing and former Bears employees helped renovate the shelter by ripping up carpet, painting walls, demolishing a kitchen and building a fence. The Bears have also provided financial support throughout the years.\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThe Green Bay Packers are the Bears' biggest rivals since their team's inception in 1920. The Green Bay Packers currently have the lead at 103\u201395\u20136, and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33\u201314, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21\u201314, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20\u20130. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14\u201310. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3\u20130 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other. The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.\nDetroit Lions.\nThe Detroit Lions and Bears have faced off since the Lions' inception in 1930, when they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, with the Spartans winning, 7\u20136, and Chicago winning the second meeting, 14\u20136. Since then, the Bears have led the series, 99\u201374\u20135. The rivalry grew in 1932, when the Bears and Spartans met in the first-ever postseason game in NFL history, with the Bears winning the game 9\u20130. The game also was known as the first pro \"indoor football\" game, as the game took place in indoor Chicago Stadium due to a blizzard at the time. The game also started the forward pass.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nChicago and Minnesota took each other on in the Vikings' inaugural game, with the Vikings defeating the Bears in a 37\u201313 rout, and Minnesota currently holds the series lead 60\u201354\u20132.\nHistoric.\nChicago/St. Louis/Arizona Cardinals.\nThe oldest continuing matchup in the NFL belongs to the Bears and the Arizona Cardinals, the only remaining NFL teams from the 1920 APFA season. It began as intense intra-city rivalry between the Bears and the Chicago Cardinals, which the Bears were leading 47\u201319\u20136 through 1959, when the Cardinals moved to St. Louis. The rivalry's importance waned further after the Cardinals moved to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1988. The Bears lead the all-time series 59\u201328\u20136. The teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.\nNew York Giants.\nThe Bears and the New York Giants squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common match-up in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. The Bears won four of the six championship games, which included the Sneakers Game that the Giants won in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). As of the 2025 season, the Bears lead the all-time series 37\u201325\u20132.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nThe Bears and San Francisco 49ers were regular foes while both played in the Western Conference. The rivalry grew during the 1980s, as both teams were constant playoff contenders in the NFC. The 49ers currently hold the series lead 35\u201333\u20131 and 3\u20130 in the playoffs. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and 49ers play at least once every four years.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe Bears holds historic rivalry with its former NFC Central foe Tampa Bay Buccaneers. as of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 40\u201322. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Bucs play at least once every four years.\nWashington Commanders.\nAlthough the teams never played in the same division, the Bears and the Washington Commanders have a historically significant rivalry, dating back to 1932, when the Commanders were located in Boston and were known as the Braves. The rivalry started to heat up in 1937, when Washington drafted quarterback Sammy Baugh and both teams were often met in the NFL Championship Game. The most memorable game from that era was in 1940, when the Bears set a record by defeating the Commanders 73-0 in the NFL Championship game, to this day, the largest margin of victory in league history. The series regained steam in the 1980s, when both teams were fighting for the NFC supremacy. Washington holds a slight edge in the all-time series 27-25-1 (2\u20131 in the playoffs and 2\u20132 in championship games). Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Commanders play at least once every four years.\nMinor.\nCleveland/Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams.\nThe Cleveland/Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams and the Bears played in the same division the 1937 NFL season to the 1969 NFL season (with the 1958 game attracting 100,470 fans, the largest in Bears history), while the two franchises continue to play annually until the 1980 NFL season. From 1995 to 2015 the two teams were part of the Chicago-St. Louis rivalries in the major professional leagues. As of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 54\u201339\u20133 (1\u20131 in the playoffs). It is the Rams' longest-running, non-division series. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Rams play at least once every four years.\nMiami Dolphins.\nThe AFC member Miami Dolphins and the Bears met less than 15 times but most of them were memorable. The most notable was the 1985 shootout at Monday Night, as Miami handing Chicago their first, and only, regular-season loss for the year, while keeping the 1972 Dolphins as the only perfect team in NFL history. As of the 2023 season, Miami currently holds the series lead 10\u20134. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the teams play at least once every four years.\nDefunct.\nRock Island Independents.\nChicago had a fierce instate rivalry with the Rock Island Independents in the league's first decade, with the Bears winning the series 8\u20131\u20134.\nCanton/Cleveland Bulldogs.\nThe Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs and the Staleys/Bears rivalry was between the two NFL's powerhouses in the 1920s, with games usually attracting the most fans, and the outcome often decided the fate of NFL Championship (1921\u20131924). The rivalry grow after the 1921 season, when the Staleys star Guy Chamberlin joined the Bulldogs and led them to three consecutive championships, including a tiebreaker win over the Bears in 1924. Chicago won the series 4\u20133.\nFacilities.\nStadium.\nSoldier Field, located on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, is the home of the Bears. The Bears moved to Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing Wrigley Field, the team's home for 50 years. After the AFL-NFL Merger, the league preferred their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with portable bleachers that the team set up at Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000. At first, the Bears were supposed to play at Dyche Stadium (later called Ryan Field), but Northwestern University's residential neighbors objected, and the agreement was cancelled. The original home of the Bears was Staley Field at Decatur, Illinois, when the team was known as the Decatur Staleys, before they moved to Chicago in 1921.\nSoldier Field's playing surface was changed from natural grass to astroturf before the 1971 season, and then back to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. Throughout its history, Soldier Field's field maintenance has been done by the Chicago Park District (the municipal entity from which the Bears lease the field) by disparate district employees, rather than a permanent team-employed grounds crew, generating some controversy among players for its rough surface. This arrangement caused disagreements with the city throughout the years, with the Bears attempting to agree on a new stadium since 1986. The stadium was the site of the infamous Fog Bowl playoff game between the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles.\nIn 2002, the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, the day after the Bears lost in the playoffs. It reopened on September 27, 2003, after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history). Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as \"New Soldier Field\". During the 2002 season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium in Champaign, where they went 3\u20135.\nMultiple critics have negative views of the new stadium, believing that its structure has made it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the \"Mistake on the Lake\". Soldier Field was stripped of its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.\nIn the 2005 season, the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006, against the Carolina Panthers. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since the stadium reopened.\nThe stadium's end zones and midfield were unpainted until the 1982 season. The design sported on the field included the bolded word \"Chicago\" rendered in Highway Gothic in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, with the addition of a large wishbone \"C\" Bears logo painted at midfield. These field markings remained unchanged until the 1996 season. In 1996 the midfield wishbone \"C\" was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the end zone design were painted with \"Bears\" in cursive. This design remained until the 1999 season, when the artwork was returned to the classic \"Chicago\" and \"C\". In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked with the word \"Chicago\" bolded in one end zone and the other having \"Bears\".\nIn June 2021, the Bears submitted a bid to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights, Illinois from Churchill Downs. Despite negotiations between the city of Chicago to upgrade Soldier Field again, the Bears entered into an agreement with Churchill Downs to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in September 2021 for $197.2 million. The sale of the property, which includes of space for potential development, closed on February 15, 2023.\nIn 2024, the Bears considered building a new stadium in the parking area south of Soldier Field on Museum Campus. The team revealed plans for a $4.7 billion domed lakefront stadium development. Due to a lack of public funding, the Bears informed Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson in May 2025 that they aimed to build a new stadium on the Arlington Heights property. Team president Kevin Warren repeated that the funding and public support were key challenges. On September 8, Warren confirmed the Bears are moving to Arlington Heights and intend to finalize stadium plans later in the year, which will not require state money.\nTraining camp locations.\nUntil 1930, the Staleys/Bears conducted their summer training camp in their home stadiums: Staley Field (Decatur, Illinois) and later Cubs' Park (Chicago).\nIn 1930, the Bears moved to Mills Stadium in Chicago. From 1931 to 1934, they moved successively to Loyola University Chicago, Logan Square Baseball Park, Notre Dame University, and Lane Tech College Prep High School.\nIn 1935, the Bears began a nine-year run of holding training camp at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin.\nIn 1944, the Bears moved to St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana and stayed there for 30 years. On July 27, 1964, Bears players Willie Galimore and Bo Farrington were killed a few miles from the team's training camp when Galimore's Volkswagen left the road on a curve and rolled.\nFrom 1975 to 1984, the Bears conducted their summer training camp in Lake Forest College, at the original Halas Hall (the practice and front office facility for the Bears from 1977 until 1997). The practice field was later renamed Farwell Field and serves as the main field for Foresters football and soccer.\nFrom 1984 to 2001, the Bears held pre-season training camp in Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium at University of Wisconsin\u2013Platteville. They were considered a member of the \"Cheese League\", which in 1999 consisted of the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints, and Kansas City Chiefs, with each team practicing at a different university in Wisconsin.\nIn 2001, the Illinois General Assembly asked the Bears to move to an Illinois practice facility to raise funds to remodel Soldier Field. Before the Bears left, they donated $250,000 () to UW\u2013Platteville for a new computer lab, which was named \"The Bears Den\".\nOn June 16, 2014, the UW\u2013Platteville stadium was damaged by a tornado, and the Bears donated $50,000 () to the school relief fund.\nFrom 2002 to 2019, the Bears held their summer training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. Although the Bears had an agreement to continue practicing there through 2022, they moved the camp into the recently renovated Halas Hall in 2020.\nHeadquarters.\nThe team headquarters, Halas Hall, named after founder George Halas, is located in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities during the season. The location is west of the original Halas Hall, which had opened in 1977, and it was named after George Halas Jr., who had died unexpectedly in 1979. It was located at Lake Forest College and contained two practice fields (one regulation-size outdoor field, as well as a 70-yard practice field) and front office facilities, which is used by the Foresters Athletics Department.\nOn March 3, 1997, the complex opened. It was later expanded, in 2013 and 2018.\nThe team also has a corporate office in downtown Chicago, located at 123 N. Wacker Dr, for sales, corporate partnerships, and events departments employees.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1971 American TV movie \"Brian's Song\" starred Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers and James Caan as Brian Piccolo. The film told how Piccolo helped Sayers return to greatness on the field after a devastating knee injury, and how Sayers helped the Piccolo family through Brian's fatal illness. A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred Sean Maher as Piccolo and Mekhi Phifer as Sayers.\nThe Super Bowl XX champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s. The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\", which reached number forty-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award. The music video for the song depicts the team rapping that they are \"not here to start no trouble\" but instead \"just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle\". The team took a risk by recording and releasing the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a then-record margin of 46\u201310. That game was one of the most-watched television events in history according to the Nielsen ratings system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it seventh in all-time television history.\nThe Bears' success in the 1980s \u2013 and especially the personality of head coach Mike Ditka \u2013 inspired a recurring sketch on the American sketch comedy program \"Saturday Night Live\", called \"Bill Swerski's Superfans\". The sketch featured \"Cheers\" co-star George Wendt, a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to WGN radio's \"The Sportswriters\"), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski (Robert Smigel), Pat Arnold (Mike Myers) and Todd O'Connor (Chris Farley). To hear them tell it, \"Da Bears\" and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists chugging beer and eating lots of Polish sausage, and often featured Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered CPR). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout victories for Bears games. Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought back by \"SNL\", with the exception of a single appearance by Horatio Sanz as a Super Fan for the Cubs on \"Weekend Update\" in 2003. Outside of \"SNL\", George Wendt reprised his role of Swerski in the opening promo of Super Bowl XL on ABC.\nOn TV shows based in Chicago such as \"The Bob Newhart Show\", \"Married... with Children\", \"Family Matters\", \"Still Standing\", \"According to Jim\", \"Early Edition\" and \"The Bernie Mac Show\", the main characters are all Bears fans, and have worn Bears' jerseys and T-shirts on some occasions. Some episodes even show them watching Bears games. \"Roseanne\" is another TV show based in Illinois (albeit not in Chicago itself) to feature the Bears as the consensus household favorite, as 'Dan Connor' John Goodman is seen wearing Bears hats in several episodes. \"That '70s Show\" featured several Bears references, as it was based in Wisconsin, home of the Packers. On one episode while the gang is at a Bears vs. Packers game, Eric comes to the seat in a Walter Payton jersey and is booed by the surrounding Packers fans. In an episode of the Disney Channel show \"Shake It Up\", based in Chicago, recurring character Dina Garcia (Ainsley Bailey) sold scalped Chicago Bears tickets. More recently, \"Modern Family\" character Cameron Tucker has been shown as a Bears fan. In an episode of the Disney Channel show \"I Didn't Do It\", based in Chicago, Lindy Watson (Olivia Holt) and Logan Watson (Austin North) try to get a football signed by NFL Hall of Famer Dick Butkus after destroying their fathers Butkus signed ball, Alshon Jeffery also makes a cameo appearance as well.\nDitka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the \"NFL on NBC\" and CBS's \"The NFL Today\", and he currently works on ESPN's \"Sunday NFL Countdown\" and provided Friday night analysis on the Bears on WBBM-TV's \"2 on Football\" with former WBBM-TV sports director Mark Malone. He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games. Ditka also co-starred himself alongside actor Will Ferrell in the 2005 comedy film \"Kicking &amp; Screaming\".\nAlso, Ditka, Dick Butkus, Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, William \"Refrigerator\" Perry and Brian Urlacher are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. Urlacher, whose jersey was among the league's best-selling in 2002, was featured on Nike commercials with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick.\nIn the 1961 Hanna-Barbera animated short \"Rah Rah Bear\", Yogi Bear helps the Bears beat the New York Giants.\nThe Bears were later depicted in an episode of the 1985 cartoon version of the NBC sitcom \"Punky Brewster\", where the Bears are playing the Green Bay Packers.\nClark Griswold (Chevy Chase) from the \"National Lampoon's Vacation series\" appears in some scenes wearing a navy blue with burnt orange scripting Chicago Bears ball cap. He wears the same Chicago Bears cap throughout all four \"Vacation\" movies.\nBroadcast media.\nRadio.\nCurrently, WMVP (1000 AM) broadcast Bears games with Jeff Joniak doing the play-by-play, along with color commentator Tom Thayer, who played for the Bears from 1985 to 1992. Over the years, many Bears play-by-play broadcasters have included play-by-play announcers Jack Brickhouse, Joe McConnell and Wayne Larrivee, and color commentators Hub Arkush, Dick Butkus, Jim Hart and Irv Kupcinet.\nSpanish radio station WLEY-FM aired the Bears games from 2012 to 2014. Since 2015, WRTO and WVIV-FM air Bears games in Spanish.\nTelevision.\nPreseason games air on WFLD (channel 32). The announcers are Adam Amin (play-by-play), Jim Miller (color commentary) and Lou Canellis (sideline reporter). WFLD also carries the majority of the team's regular season games through the \"NFL on Fox\". Any Bears home games against AFC teams are aired on the CBS O&amp;O station, WBBM-TV, which was the Bears' unofficial \"home\" station from 1956 until Fox won the NFC rights in 1995. Sunday Night games are broadcast on WMAQ-TV, the NBC O&amp;O station, with \"ESPN Monday Night Football\" games airing either on ESPN or WLS-TV, the ABC affiliate.\nStatistics and records.\nPatrick Mannelly holds the record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 16. On the other hand, Steve McMichael holds the record for most consecutive games played by a Bear with 191; he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game in a span of 13 seasons.\nKicker Robbie Gould became the Bears' all-time scoring leader in Week 5 of 2015 season overtaking placekicker Kevin Butler who previously held the club record for scoring the most points in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed by running back Walter Payton, with 750 points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726. That was an NFL record until Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in 2002. Former Bears running back Matt Forte, who started playing for the Bears in 2008, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,985 yards. Forte also holds the team's single season record for rookies in rushing attempts, rushing yards and receptions. Mark Bortz holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, Dennis Gentry, Dan Hampton, Jay Hilgenberg, Steve McMichael, Ron Rivera, Mike Singletary, and Keith Van Horne, who have each played in 12 playoff games.\nThe 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game, including both playoff and regular season games, with a 73\u20130 victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship Game. The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61\u20137 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52\u20130 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942; unlike the 1972 Miami Dolphins, however, they did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13\u20130 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the club completed an 11\u20130 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat \u2013 a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger. Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324. Halas' victories record stood until Don Shula surpassed Halas in 1993. Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.\nDuring the 2006 season, return specialist Devin Hester set several kick return records. He currently holds the franchise record for most return yards with 2,261. He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season. In 2007, he recorded another six touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown. The record tied former teammate Nathan Vasher's previous record, which was set almost a year earlier. Hester set a Super Bowl record as the first player to return an opening kick of a Super Bowl for a touchdown. On December 20, 2010, Hester set an NFL record for most touchdowns on a punt or kickoff return with his 14th career return coming against the Minnesota Vikings. In 2011, Hester broke the record for the most punt returns against the Carolina Panthers.\nIn 2012, Charles Tillman set the record for most forced fumbles in a single game with four against the Tennessee Titans. Against the Titans, Chicago became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, an interception return for a touchdown, and a blocked kick/punt for a score in the same quarter. Tillman and teammate Lance Briggs became the first pair in NFL history to return an interception for a touchdown in consecutive games against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys.\nSeason-by-season results.\nThis is a partial list of the Bears' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of Chicago Bears seasons.\n\"Note: The finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.\"\nPlayers of note.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nIn the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Bears have the most enshrined primary members with 32; the club also has had nine Hall of Famers spend a minor portion of their career with the franchise. Founder, owner, head coach, and player George Halas, halfback Bronko Nagurski, and Red Grange were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963. The franchise saw 14 individuals inducted into the Hall of Fame from 1963 to 1967. The most recent Bears to be inducted were Devin Hester and Steve McMichael in 2024 (primary contributors) and Jared Allen (minor contributor) in 2025.\nIn addition, Ray Bray was enshrined in Helms Athletic Foundation Pro Football Hall of Fame, which was established in 1950 and preceded the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He's the only Bears member from the Helms Athletic Foundation hall to not be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nChicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.\nThe Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1979 and honors sports greats associated with the Chicago metropolitan area. As of 2023, there are 59 honorees enshrined in the hall with connection to the Bears.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Bears have retired 14 uniform numbers, which is the most in the NFL, and ranks fourth behind the basketball Boston Celtics (23), baseball New York Yankees (21), and hockey Montreal Canadiens (15) for the most in major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Bears retired Mike Ditka's number 89 jersey on December 9, 2013. It is the last number that the Bears retired.\n100 greatest Bears list.\nIn honor of the team's centennial anniversary, on May 20, 2019, the Chicago Bears unveiled the Top 100 players in franchise history, as voted on by Hall of Fame writers Don Pierson and Dan Pompei, two prominent journalists who covered the club. The list included 27 Pro Football Hall of Famers when it was released; Jim Covert and Ed Sprinkle joined the hall in the 2020 Centennial class.\nFour then-active players made the list: safety Eddie Jackson (96), defensive lineman Akiem Hicks (75), offensive lineman Kyle Long (74), and Khalil Mack (60), who had only played only one season with the team at the time. Long would retire the following year.\nChicagobears.com later released \"Top 10: Best of the rest\", a list of the \"top 10 snubs\" from the centennial list: Alex Brown, Thomas Jones, Dave Whitsell, Curtis Conway, Tim Jennings, Leslie Frazier, Roberto Garza, Marty Booker, Nathan Vasher and William Perry. Pompei would later say that the last two players who didn't make the list were Brown and Frazier.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 Helms Athletic Foundation Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 PFRA Hall of Very Good inductee.\nAll-Time Team.\nDuring the week of June 3, 2019, the All-Time Team was announced in parts each day starting with the All-Time defensive players, followed by the All-Time specialists and then the All-Time offensive players. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nLarry Mayer of the Chicagobears.com would later state, that according to the voters \"if they had included a long-snapper on the team it would have been Patrick Mannelly\".\nMinor league affiliates.\nThe NFL, contrary to the four other major sports leagues in North America, does not have a formal farm system (beside the short-lived Association of Professional Football Leagues), and over the years some teams had \"independent\" minor affiliates throughout their existence. The Bears, along with the New York Giants, were at the forefront of those endeavors when in 1939, Halas purchased the American Association's Newark Tornadoes and renamed them the \"Bears\". Halas stocked the team with talent that did not make the Chicago roster, and used the club to incubate talent and for easy return for injured players, thus making it pro football's first true farm team. Newark's most notable names included Joe Zeller as coach and Gene Ronzani (that year Chicago also assigned Sid Luckman to Newark playoff game, which the Bears won 13\u20136, to win the Southern Division title). This practice continued sporadically until 1972, and ended with the collapse of several minor leagues along with the NFL labor disputes in the 1970s.\nOther notable players assigned includes: George Gulyanics, Ed Ecker, Lloyd Reese, Raymond Schumacher, Jack Karwales and Doug McEnulty.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "6612", "revid": "50545613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6612", "title": "Cincinnati Bengals", "text": "National Football League franchise in Cincinnati, Ohio\nThe Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.\nFormer Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season. Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975.\nAfter being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.\nAfter Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.\nThe Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope. Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out.\nThe team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs. The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27\u201324 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23\u201320. They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs by a score of 23\u201320.\nThe team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is the Bengals' \"de facto general manager\" because he handles most personnel decisions. In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.\nIn a \"Forbes\" article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.\nHistory.\nBrown family era (1968\u2013present).\nIn 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\". Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger.\nIn a possible insult to Art Modell \u2013 or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers \u2013 Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width. The Bengals began play in the 1968 season.\nIn 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League. Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams.\nFor the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million \u2013 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.\nPrior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\" However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970.\nThere was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities \u2013 issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park.\nWhile New York City \u2013 which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco \u2013 had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location.\nWith assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium.\nWith the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.\nPaul Brown and Bill Johnson years (1968\u20131978).\nFor their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3\u201311 record and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.\nFounder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.\nIn 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too. The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11\u20133 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12\u20132 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31\u201328 in the divisional playoffs.\nForrest Gregg/Sam Wyche years (1980\u20131991).\nThe Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s \u2013 in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII \u2013 and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times. The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.\nBefore the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82. Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team. The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts.\nMarvin Lewis years (2003\u20132018).\nThe Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2\u201314, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003. Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season. The team finished with an 8\u20138 record and missed the postseason in 2004. Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Round to the Pittsburgh Steelers 31\u201317 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.\nThe Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals \u2013 the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens \u2013 had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4\u201312 record.\nFollowing the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL. He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.\nThe Bengals improved to 9\u20137 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot. Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31\u201310, in the Wild Card round. In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982. However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19\u201313.\nIn the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11\u20135 record. But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27\u201310. Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0\u20135 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43\u201317. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10\u20135\u20131 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26\u201310, in the first round of the playoffs. This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons.\nIn 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8\u20130 start with a 31\u201310 win over the Cleveland Browns. Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12\u20134 mark. Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18\u201316, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games. This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6\u20139\u20131 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27\u201327 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.\nFollowing a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0\u20133, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5\u20139. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7\u20139. The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.\nThe 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4\u20131 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes, A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season. The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6\u201310 and finished last place in the AFC North. On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.\nZac Taylor years (2019\u2013present).\nIn 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor. The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21\u201320 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster. The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0\u201311 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22\u20136, in Cincinnati. They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38\u201335, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft. They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2\u201314, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.\nIn 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins. Starting the season with a 2\u20135\u20131 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans. Finishing the season 4\u201311\u20131.\nIn 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10\u20137 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens. Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34\u201331, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26\u201319, in the Wild Card round. After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19\u201316, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21\u20133 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27\u201324. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23\u201320.\nIn Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23\u201320, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4\u20134 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs. They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24\u201317, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard. Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27\u201310 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history. Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23\u201320, in another thrilling game.\nIn the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season. The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury. The Bengals finished the season 9\u20138 and missed the playoffs.\nThe 2024 season, with Burrow returning, came with high expectations for the Bengals; however, Cincinnati limped to a 4\u20138 start to the season thanks primarily to a porous defense; the Bengals lost four games where they scored at least 33 points; an NFL record. The team finished strong, winning their final five games to finish with a 9\u20138 record for the second straight season, however, they missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season after the Denver Broncos shutout the Kansas City Chiefs. Burrow led the NFL in passing yards; wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase won the triple crown leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, and defensive end Trey Hendrickson led the league in sacks.\nOn April 3, 2025, Bengals executive V.P. Katie Blackburn stated that \"We could, I guess, go wherever we wanted after this year if we didn't pick the option up\" in regards to the team's lease on Paycor Stadium. At the time the Bengals were struggling to reach an agreement on the lease with the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. Blackburn also stated that she likes the stadium's downtown location and hopes to secure the team's future there. The Bengals had proposed a $120 million renovation of the stadium which would've seen 90% of the funds raised from taxpayers, which drew fire from Hamilton County commissioners as the Bengals only pay $158,526 in rent per year.\nLogos and uniforms.\nWhen the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.\nThe Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. \"Sports Illustrated\" likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"\nIn 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders. A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced. The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor.\nIn 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.\nThe club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season. The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.\nIn 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets. This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.\nIn 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after \"Madden NFL 25\" leaked the option to the public. The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.\nMascots.\nThe team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey. Its jersey number is 1. Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad, which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.\nCarol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"\nThe Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nCleveland Browns.\nThe Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns. The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals. The Bengals lead the series 55\u201348 as of the end of the 2024 season.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nThe Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs. The Steelers lead the overall series 71\u201340 and the postseason series 2\u20130. However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28\u20137 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer, while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16\u201315 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nThe Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 32\u201327 as of the 2024 season. The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.\nContributions to NFL culture.\nNo-huddle offense.\nA no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play\u2014often within 5\u201310 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds\u2014the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made.\nThe hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff. Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984. Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect.\nWest Coast offense.\nThe West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh. Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971. Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack. The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.\nZone blitz.\nThe defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.\nPlayers.\nRetired numbers.\nIn addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation:\nPro Football Hall of Fame members.\nThere are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career.\n40th Anniversary Team.\nIn 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.\n50th Anniversary Team.\nIn 2017, in celebration of their 50th anniversary, a team was created based on \"career statistics, team records and votes from the Bengals First 50.\"\nSource:\nRing of Honor.\nThe Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021. The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach, with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.\nRadio and television.\nThe Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner, with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games with them hosting an NFC opponent, are telecast on WXIX-TV, channel 19, the Fox affiliate they also air games streaming on Amazon Prime Video and YouTube. Mike Watts and Anthony Mu\u00f1oz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter. Most regular season games are televised on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the local CBS affiliate, they also air games streaming on Netflix alongside CBS games. NBC affiliate WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts not on ABC. ABC affiliate WCPO-TV airs it otherwise.\nThe radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).\nCulture.\nFight song.\n\"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told \"The Athletic\" recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere. \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals. The song is mainly played before kickoffs to intimidate visiting teams.\nWho Dey chant.\n\"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\" The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.\nSaying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.\nThe full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals. While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.\nThe chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRolfe, Ben. \"Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl History: Appearances, Wins, Record, and More.\" PFSN, 1 Aug. 2024, www.profootballnetwork.com/Cincinnati-Bengals-Super Bowl-history-appearances-wins-record-more/.\nStatista.com. \"Cincinnati Bengals Career Rushing Leaders March 2025: Cincinnati Bengals All-Time Rushing Leaders as of March 2025 (in Yards).\" ProFootballReference.Com, Statista.com &amp; ProFootballReference.com, 15 Mar. 2025, www.statista.com/statistics/811032/Cincinnati-Bengals-career-rushing-yards-leaders.

{"id": "6613", "revid": "49709014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6613", "title": "Yangtze", "text": "Longest river in Asia\nThe Yangtze River, Yangzi River ( or ) or Chang Jiang () is the longest river in China and the third-longest river in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows, including the Dam Qu River, the longest source of the Yangtze, in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea. It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.\nThe Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP, and the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world. In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports to create a new economic belt alongside the river.\nThe Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species, including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or ) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution, agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nEtymology.\nChinese.\n (), meaning \"Long River\", is the name for the river in Chinese. However, the Chinese have given different names to sections of the river (it is from an ancient name to only a part of the river that the modern English name derives \u2013 see below).\nIn Old Chinese, the Yangtze was simply called \"Jiang/Kiang\" , a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical with the homophone (now pronounced , but \"*k\u02e4o\u014b\" in Old Chinese). \"Kong\" was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to \"*krong\" in Proto-Vietnamese and \"krung\" in Mon, all meaning \"river\", it is related to modern Vietnamese \"s\u00f4ng\" (river) and Khmer \"krung\" (city on riverside), whence Thai \"krung\" (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07 capital city), not \"k\u00f4ngkea\" (water) which is from the Sanskrit root \"g\u00e1\u1e45g\u0101\".\nBy the Han dynasty, had come to mean \"any\" river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" (). The epithet (simplified version ), meaning \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.\nVarious sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the () or \"Sichuan River\". In Hubei, the river is also called the () or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name after the shorthand name for Anhui, (\u7696). Jinsha (\"Gold Sands\") River refers to the of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai, while the Tongtian (\"Leading to Heaven\") River describes the section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River.\n () or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called or (). Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.\nEnglish.\nIn the West, the river was called Quian () and Quianshui () by Marco Polo, and appeared on the earliest English maps as Kian or Kiam. By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as Kiang.\nA related form also popularized in English was \"Kian-ku,\" also spelled \"Keeang-Koo\" and \"Kyang Kew\", derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (, \"Ji\u0101ngk\u01d2u\") as the name of the river itself.\nThe name Blue River began to be applied in the 18th century, apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy with the Yellow River, but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of \"Jiang\", \"Jiangkou\", or \"Yangzijiang\". Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river's Chinese names and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.\nMatteo Ricci's 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the \"Ian\u017fu\" and \"Ian\u017fuchian.\" The posthumous account's translation of the name as Fils de la Mer (\"Son of the Ocean\") shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic rather than the usual . Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, Yangzhou was the lower river's principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang's important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River's principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze.)\n (), or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou (see above). Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.\nBy 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name as Yang-tse or Yang-tse\u00a0Kiang. The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to Yang-tzu Chiang as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing's and first published in 1867. The spellings Yangtze and Yangtze\u00a0Kiang was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC's First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling Yangzi has also been used.\nTibetan.\nThe source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai. In Tibetan, the Tuotuo headwaters are the \"Machu\" (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b, Wylie: \"rma-chu\", lit. \"Red Water\"). The Tongtian is the \"Drichu\" (\u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b, 'Bri Chu'), literally \"Water of the Female Yak\"; transliterated into ).\nGeography.\nThe river originates from several tributaries in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, two of which are commonly referred to as the \"source.\" Traditionally, the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains. This source is found at and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at above sea level. The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately southeast of Geladandong. This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at and above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai. As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above to less than . Thus, over the first of its length, the river has fallen more than .\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several large tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\nAfter entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45\u00a0million years ago in the Eocene, but this dating has been disputed.\nHistory.\nGeologic history.\nAlthough the mouth of the Yellow River has fluctuated widely north and south of the Shandong peninsula within the historical record, the Yangtze has remained largely static. Based on studies of sedimentation rates, however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene (c.\u200911 Ma). Prior to this, its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River.\nEarly history.\nThe Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan. Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago, and by the 5th millennium\u00a0BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium\u00a0BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain. What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the \"Yue\" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions \u2013 blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves \u2013 and were considered barbarous by the northerners.\nThe Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures. Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age).\nIn the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the \"Gouwu\" in southern Jiangsu and the \"Yuyue\" in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence starting in the 9th century\u00a0BC. Traditional accounts credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.\nWhether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period's Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States' Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital Ying in 506\u00a0BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473\u00a0BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333\u00a0BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, the previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Xiang River to expand into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north.\nSince the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods. By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443\u2013&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 of the nation's revenues.\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.\nHistorically, the Yangtze was the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because crossing the river was difficult. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period.\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin\u2013Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin. The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year.\nPolitically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911\u20131912, 1927\u20131937, and 1945\u20131949.\nAge of steam.\nThe \"Jardine\", the first steamship to sail the river, was built for the British firm Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. in 1835. This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island, Macao, and Huangpu. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a \"fire-ship\" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip. On the \"Jardine's\" first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters. The \"Jardine\" in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.Subsequently, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the \"suggestions\" of William Jardine to declare war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship, the \"Royal Saxon\", the British started the first of the Opium Wars. Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laying waste to several coastal forts along the way. Eventually, they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself.\nThe China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated.\nNavigation on the upper river.\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as a \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.\nArchibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built \"Kuling\" but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their craft caused by steamship wakes. \"Kuling\" was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native craft.\nIn 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built \"Leechuan\", to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March \"Leechuan\" completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. \"Leechuan\" was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.\nIn 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on \"Leechuan\" at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS \"Pioneer\" built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. \"Pioneer\" was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS \"Kinsha\". Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS \"Suixing\" ended in catastrophe. On \"Suixing's\" maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.\nIn 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS \"Shutung\" and SS \"Shuhun\". Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.\nHe also wrote \"Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River\", a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. \"Shutung\" was commandeered by warlords and \"Shuhun\" was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.\nIn 1921, when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.\nStandard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were collectively destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.\nContemporary events.\nChinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.\nIn 2002, Danish adventurer and sailor Troels Kl\u00f8vedal sailed up the Yangtze, from Shanghai to past the Three Gorges Dam, in the collectively owned \"Nordkaperen\" sailing ship. Kl\u00f8vedal had spent 12 years preparing and gathering the required permissions, and with a crew of Danes, his family members, a Chinese interpreter and several local maritime pilots, he became the first foreigner since 1949 to navigate the Yangtze. His months-long journey was documented both in his 2004 book \"Kineserne syr med lang tr\u00e5d\" and the TV show \"Kl\u00f8vedal i Kina\" by DR.\nThe Jetour Zongheng G700 became the first vehicle in history to successfully cross the Yangtze. The crossing took place on October 16, 2025 and took 22 minutes to complete.\nHydrology.\nPeriodic floods.\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\nThe 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7\u00a0million and 4\u00a0million. The Yangtze flooded again in 1935, causing great loss of life.\nFrom June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\nThe 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.\nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15\u00a0million homeless and $26\u00a0billion in economic loss. Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180\u00a0million people were affected. A staggering were evacuated, 13.3\u00a0million houses were damaged or destroyed. The floods caused $26\u00a0billion in damages.\nThe 2016 China floods caused US$22\u00a0billion in damages.\nIn 2020, the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect \u2013 a major increase in rain. Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system, but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.\nDegradation of the river.\nBeginning in the 1950s, dams and dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation, and control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from in the 1950s to in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.\nIn 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.\nContribution to ocean pollution.\nThe Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. Ten rivers transport 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans, with the Yangtze River being the biggest polluter.\nReconnecting lakes.\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005, Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea. In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering . As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and . The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3\u00a0billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.\nDischarge.\nThe Yangtze River is the longest and most economically important river in Asia and the fifth largest in the world in terms of flow. It is also the largest river entirely within a single country. Its estuary had an estimated annual flow of between 1955 and 2021.\nThe last gauging station on the river is at Datong (). At this location, the water flow is regularly monitored. The chart below is based on average flows between 1950 and 2020.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCrossings.\nUntil 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the \"Zhong'anlun\" disaster (October 15, 1945).\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West.\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River. The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing. It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance. Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway. A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995. By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008). The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued. The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.\nA number of power line crossings have also been built across the river.\nDams.\nAs of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze River: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Baihetan Dam is the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam, and the Xiluodu Dam is the 4th largest power station in the world.\nTributaries.\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\nThe Huai River flowed into the Yellow Sea until the 20th century, but now primarily discharges into the Yangtze.\nWildlife.\nThe Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.\nFish.\nAs of 2011[ [update]], 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze basin, including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160). 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin. Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above , are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river. The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.\nMany Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list. Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, \"Anabarilius liui liui\" and \"Atrilinea macrolepis\"), two that are extinct in the wild (\"Anabarilius polylepis\", \"Schizothorax parvus\"), four that are critically endangered \"Euchiloglanis kishinouyei\", \"Megalobrama elongata\", \"Schizothorax longibarbus\" and \"Leiocassis longibarbus\"). Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens. Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct. Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals. The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged. The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of ; the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as , but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.\nThe largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems. About &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin, but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin. In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover, and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze. Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective. For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon, while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel. In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream. In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.\nWhile many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed. Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, \"Takifugu\" pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.\nOther animals.\nDue to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a \"baiji\". However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the \"baiji\" is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. \"Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.\" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.\nNumerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and P\u00e8re David's deer.\nIn addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.\nMore than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world's largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander. It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution. The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct. In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.\nThe Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics. A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid \"Sinopotamon\". The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range. It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed, but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.\nThe freshwater jellyfish \"Craspedacusta sowerbii\", now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.\nTourism.\nThe Yangtze River cruise, also called the \"Three Gorges cruise\", is a popular tourist attraction.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6614", "revid": "44535253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6614", "title": "Chrono Trigger", "text": "1995 video game\n is a 1995 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first installment of the \"Chrono\" series. The game's plot follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.\nThe game's development team included three designers that Square dubbed the \"Dream Team\": Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Square's \"Final Fantasy\" series; Yuji Horii, creator of Enix's \"Dragon Quest\" series; and Akira Toriyama, character designer of \"Dragon Quest\" and author of the \"Dragon Ball\" manga series. In addition, Takashi Tokita co-directed the game and co-wrote the scenario, Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game, while Masato Kato wrote most of the story.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" was a critical and commercial success upon release, receiving multiple accolades from gaming publications, and is considered one of fourth-generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the greatest video games of all time. \"Nintendo Power\" magazine described aspects of the game as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related side-quests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics. The game's soundtrack, scored by Yasunori Mitsuda with assistance from veteran \"Final Fantasy\" composer Nobuo Uematsu, has been hailed as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. \"Chrono Trigger\" was the second best-selling game of 1995 in Japan, and the various incarnations of the game have shipped more than 5 million copies worldwide. \nThe game has been re-released on several other platforms with varying differences. A port by Tose for the PlayStation was released only in Japan in 1999, which was later repackaged with a \"Final Fantasy IV\" port as \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" (2001) exclusively in North America. A slightly enhanced \"Chrono Trigger\", again ported by Tose, was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan and North America in 2008, and PAL regions in 2009. The game has also been ported to i-mode, the Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS, and Android. In 2018, a higher resolution version was released for Windows via Steam.\nGameplay.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" features standard turn-based role-playing video game gameplay. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's two-dimensional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. \"Chrono Trigger\"'s gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.\nPlayers and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of hit points; successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, which can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, they faint; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, a player can equip their characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles. Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in treasure chests. By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through \"Chrono Trigger\"'s story.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" uses an \"Active Time Battle\" system\u2014a recurring element of Square's \"Final Fantasy\" game series designed by Hiroyuki Ito for \"Final Fantasy IV\"\u2014named \"Active Time Battle 2.0\". Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed statistic counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called \"Techs\". Techs deplete a character's magic points (a numerical meter similar to hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of \"Chrono Trigger\"'s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist. Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning Cyclone Tech can be combined with Lucca's Flame Toss to create Fire Whirl. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" features several other distinct gameplay traits, including time travel. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called \"time gates\", as well as a time machine named \"Epoch\". The game contains twelve unique endings (thirteen in DS, iOS, Android and Steam versions); the ending the player receives depends on when and how they reach and complete the game's final battle. The DS version of \"Chrono Trigger\" features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss. \"Chrono Trigger\" also introduces a New Game Plus option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character levels, techniques, and equipment, excluding money, with which they ended the previous playthrough. However, certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has employed the New Game Plus concept in later games including \"Chrono Cross\" and \"Final Fantasy XV\" among others.\nStory.\nSetting.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" takes place in an Earth-like world, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year \u221e), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the \"Wings of Time,\" nicknamed the \"Epoch\" (this default name can be changed by the player when the vehicle is acquired). The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.\nCharacters.\n\"Chrono Trigger\"'s six playable characters (plus one optional character) come from different eras of history. \"Chrono Trigger\" begins in 1000 AD with Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a katana in battle. Marle, revealed to be Princess Nadia, lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, she is at heart a princess who seeks independence from her royal identity. Lucca is a childhood friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of 2300 AD comes Robo, or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with a near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude. The fiercely confident Ayla dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid reptiles known as Reptites.\nThe last two playable characters are Frog and Magus. Frog originated in 600 AD. He is a former squire once known as Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in 600 AD is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful sorcerer. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, Schala. Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in 1999 AD, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.\nPlot.\nIn 1000 AD, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new teleporter at the Millennial Fair in the Kingdom of Guardia. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn. After Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in 600 AD, they locate Marle, only to see her vanish before their eyes. Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle (who is actually Princess Nadia of Guardia) for Queen Leene, an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a grandfather paradox. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by rescuing Leene. After the three part ways with Frog and return to the present, Crono is framed for kidnapping Marle and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia. Lucca and Marle help Crono escape prison, haphazardly using another time portal to evade their pursuers. This portal lands them in 2300 AD, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999 AD, and find the last remnants of humanity living in underground domes subsisting off of machine energy in place of food. The three vow to find a way to prevent the future destruction of their world. After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage residing in an atemporal space known as the End of Time, who offers them the ability to travel through time by way of several pillars of light. (The party is able to challenge Lavos at any point after this scene, with completion of the game prior to its final chapter unlocking one of twelve different endings.)\nThe party discover that a powerful mage named Magus summoned Lavos into the world in 600 AD. To stop Magus, Frog requires the legendary sword, Masamune, to open the way to the mage's castle. In search of ore to re-forge the sword, the party travel to prehistoric times and meet Ayla, the chief of an ancient hunter-gatherer tribe. The subsequent battle with Magus disrupts his spell to summon Lavos, opening a temporal distortion that throws Crono and his friends to prehistory. The party assist Ayla in battling the Reptites, enemies of prehistoric humans. The battle is cut short as the party witness the true origin of Lavos, who descends from deep space and crashes into the planet before burrowing to its core. Entering a time gate created by Lavos's impact, the party arrive in the ice age of 12,000 BC. There, the utopic Kingdom of Zeal resides on islands raised above the icy surface using energy harnessed from Lavos's body beneath the earth's crust via a machine housed on the ocean floor. The party are imprisoned by the Queen of Zeal on the orders of its mysterious Prophet, and are ultimately banished, with the time gate leading to 12,000 BC sealed by the Prophet. Seeking a way to return, the party discover a time machine in 2300 AD called the Wings of Time (or \"Epoch\"), which can access any time period at will. The party return to 12,000 BC, where Zeal inadvertently awakens Lavos, leading the Prophet to reveal himself as Magus, who tries and fails to kill the creature. Lavos defeats Magus and kills Crono, before the remaining party are transported to the safety of the surface by Schala, Zeal's princess. Lavos annihilates the Kingdom of Zeal, whose fallen continent causes devastating floods that submerge most of the world's landmass.\nMagus confesses to the party that he used to be Prince Janus of Zeal, Schala's brother, and that in the original timeline, he and the Gurus of Zeal were scattered across time by Lavos's awakening in 12,000 BC. Stranded as a child in 600 AD, Janus took the title of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister. Magus tried once more after the party's battle in his castle returned him to Zeal, where he disguised himself as the Prophet. At this point, Magus is either killed by the party, killed in a duel with Frog, or spared and convinced to join the party. The ruined Ocean Palace then rises into the air as the Black Omen, Queen Zeal's floating fortress. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a \"Chrono Trigger\", a device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with an identical doppelg\u00e4nger (doing so is optional, and the game's ending will change depending on the player's decision). The party then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar's instructions. Their journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics, stopping Robo's maniacal AI creator, giving Frog closure for Cyrus's death, locating and charging up the mythical Sun Stone, retrieving the legendary Rainbow Shell, unmasking Guardia's Chancellor as a saboteur, restoring a forest destroyed by a desert monster, and preventing an accident that disabled Lucca's mother. The party then enter the Black Omen and defeat Queen Zeal, after which they battle Lavos. They discover that Lavos is self-directing his evolution via absorbing DNA and energy from every living creature before razing the planet's surface in 1999 AD, so that it could spawn a new generation to destroy other worlds and continue the evolutionary cycle. The party slay Lavos, and celebrate at the final night of the Millennial Fair before returning to their own times.\nIf Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala. If Crono was resurrected before defeating Lavos, his sentence for kidnapping Marle is revoked by her father, King Guardia XXXIII, thanks to testimonies from Marle's ancestors and descendants, whom Crono had helped during his journey. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the Millennial Fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. If Crono was not resurrected, Frog, Robo, and Ayla (along with Magus if he was recruited) chase Gaspar to the Millennial Fair and back again, revealing that Gaspar knows how to resurrect Crono; Marle and Lucca then use the Epoch to travel through time to accomplish this. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. If resurrected, Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.\n\"Chrono Trigger DS\" added two new scenarios to the game. In the first, Crono and his friends can help a \"lost sanctum\" of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to \"Trigger\"'s sequel, \"Chrono Cross\". In a New Game Plus, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia. The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the \"Time Devourer\"\u2014a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in \"Chrono Cross\". A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.\nDevelopment.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" was conceived in October 1992 by Hironobu Sakaguchi, producer and creator of the \"Final Fantasy\" series; Yuji Horii, writer, game designer and creator of the \"Dragon Quest\" series; and Akira Toriyama, character designer of \"Dragon Quest\" and creator of the \"Dragon Ball\" manga series. Traveling to the United States to research computer graphics, the three, that Square dubbed the \"Dream Team\", decided to create something that \"no one had done before\". Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, later credited the concept to a fusion of \"Dragon Quest plus Final Fantasy\", and arranged for Enix to lend Yuji Horii to Squaresoft for development. After spending over a year considering the difficulties of developing a new game, the three received a call from Kazuhiko Aoki, who offered to produce. The four met and spent four days brainstorming ideas for the game. Square convened 50\u201360 developers, including scenario writer Masato Kato, whom Square designated story planner; development started in early 1993. An uncredited Square employee suggested that the team develop a time travel-themed game, which Kato initially opposed, fearing repetitive, dull gameplay. Kato and Horii then met several hours per day during the first year of development to write the game's plot; Horii desired a silent protagonist from the outset. Square intended to license the work under the \"Mana\" franchise and gave it the working title \"Maru Island\"; Hiromichi Tanaka (the future producer of \"Chrono Cross\") monitored Toriyama's early designs. The team hoped to release it on Nintendo's planned Super Famicom Disk Drive; when Nintendo canceled the project, Square reoriented the game for release on a Super Famicom cartridge and rebranded it as \"Chrono Trigger\". Tanaka credited the ROM cartridge platform for enabling seamless transition to battles on the field map. While \"Chrono Trigger\" had been planned for a 24-megabit cartridge, Square ultimately chose a 32-megabit platform, enabling additional graphics and music. Torishima later reflected that at least one early revision of the game had been scrapped.\nAoki ultimately produced \"Chrono Trigger\", while director credits were attributed to Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era. Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs. Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development. The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style. Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas. Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists. Yasuhiko Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film \"Alien\" as an inspiration for the game's lighting. Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of \"Secret of Mana\" and the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Features originally intended to be used in \"Secret of Mana\" or \"Final Fantasy IV\", also under development at the same time, were appropriated by the \"Chrono Trigger\" team. According to Tanaka, \"Secret of Mana\" (which itself was originally intended to be \"Final Fantasy IV\") was codenamed \"Chrono Trigger\" during development before being called \"Seiken Densetsu 2\" (\"Secret of Mana\"), and then the name \"Chrono Trigger\" was adopted for a new project. After its release, the development team of \"Final Fantasy VI\" was folded into the \"Chrono Trigger\" team.\nYuji Horii, a fan of time travel fiction (such as the TV series \"The Time Tunnel\"), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of \"Chrono Trigger\" with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, \"If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in.\" Horii also devised Lavos as the final boss, having wanted the final boss to be an ancient evil. Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as \"a long string of errands [...] [such as] 'do this', 'take this', 'defeat these monsters', or 'plant this flag'.\" Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an \"Active Time Event Logic\" system, \"where you can move your character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you\", and with players \"talking to different people and steering the conversation in different directions\", allowing each scene to \"have many permutations.\" Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous \"Final Fantasy\" games, which used static enemy graphics.\nHironobu Sakaguchi likened the development of \"Chrono Trigger\" to \"play[ing] around with Toriyama's universe,\" citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game that would have been \"impossible with something like \"Final Fantasy\".\" When Square suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game's testers had previously complained that \"Chrono Trigger\" was too difficult; as Horii explained, \"It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily.\" Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or \"travel through time again\" as an affirmation of the New Game Plus feature: \"Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details [...] I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest.\" The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.\nMusic.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" was scored primarily by Yasunori Mitsuda, with contributions from veteran \"Final Fantasy\" composer Nobuo Uematsu and one track by Noriko Matsueda. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music. Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score \"Chrono Trigger\", remarking, \"maybe your salary will go up.\" Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of pieces composed over the previous two years. He reflected, \"I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre [...] music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing.\" Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain pieces\u2014such as the game's ending theme, \"To Far Away Times\"\u2014to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before \"Chrono Trigger\", reflecting that the tune was made in dedication to \"a certain person with whom [he] wanted to share a generation\". He also tried to use leitmotifs of the \"Chrono Trigger\" main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack. Mitsuda wrote each tune to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time. Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten pieces and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.\nAt the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented\u2014the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing. Square also released a one-disc acid jazz arrangement called \"The Brink of Time\" by Guido that year. \"The Brink of Time\" came about because Mitsuda wanted to do something that no one else was doing, and he noted that acid jazz and its related genres were uncommon in the Japanese market. Mitsuda considers \"Chrono Trigger\" a landmark game which helped mature his talent. While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was \"rough around the edges\", he maintains that it had \"significant influence on [his] life as a composer\". In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of the game, featuring orchestral tracks used in cutscenes. Tsuyoshi Sekito composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack. Some fans were displeased by Mitsuda's absence in creating the port, whose instruments sometimes aurally differed from the original game's. Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the \"Chrono\" series for Play! video game music concerts, presenting the main theme, \"Frog's Theme\", and \"To Far Away Times\". He worked with Square Enix to ensure that the music for the Nintendo DS would sound closer to the Super NES version. Mitsuda encouraged feedback about the game's soundtrack from contemporary children (who he thought would expect \"full symphonic scores blaring out of the speakers\"). Fans who preordered the DS version received a special music disc containing two orchestral arrangements of the game's music directed by Natsumi Kameoka; Square Enix also held a random prize drawing for two signed copies of \"Chrono Trigger\" sheet music. Mitsuda expressed difficulty in selecting the tune for the orchestral medley, eventually picking a tune from each era and certain character themes. Mitsuda later wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I feel that the way we interact with music has changed greatly in the last 13 years, even for me. For better or for worse, I think it would be extremely difficult to create something as \"powerful\" as I did 13 years ago today. But instead, all that I have learned in these 13 years allows me to compose something much more intricate. To be perfectly honest, I find it so hard to believe that songs from 13 years ago are loved this much. Keeping these feelings in mind, I hope to continue composing songs which are powerful, and yet intricate...I hope that the extras like this bonus CD will help expand the world of Chrono Trigger, especially since we did a live recording. I hope there's another opportunity to release an album of this sort one day.\nMusic from the game was performed live by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra in 1996 at the Orchestral Game Concert in Tokyo, Japan. A suite of music including \"Chrono Trigger\" is a part of the symphonic world-tour with video game music Play! A Video Game Symphony, where Mitsuda was in attendance for the concert's world-premiere in Chicago on May 27, 2006. His suite of \"Chrono\" music, comprising \"Reminiscence\", \"Chrono Trigger\", \"Chrono Cross~Time's Scar\", \"Frog's Theme\", and \"To Far Away Times\" was performed. Mitsuda has also appeared with the Eminence Symphony Orchestra as a special guest. Video Games Live has also featured medleys from \"Chrono Trigger\" and \"Chrono Cross\". A medley of Music from \"Chrono Trigger\" made of one of the four suites of the \"Symphonic Fantasies\" concerts in September 2009 which was produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series, conducted by Arnie Roth. Square Enix re-released the game's soundtrack, along with a video interview with Mitsuda in July 2009. \"Frog's Theme\" and \"Robo's Theme\" were among the video game music performed during the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In 2022, the main theme continued to feature in the setlist of the 8-Bit Big Band, led by Charlie Rosen.\nRelease.\nThe team planned to release \"Chrono Trigger\" in late 1994, but release was pushed back to the following year. Early alpha versions of \"Chrono Trigger\" were demonstrated at the 1994 and 1995 \"V Jump\" festivals in Japan. A few months prior to the game's release, Square shipped a beta version to magazine reviewers and game stores for review. An unfinished build of the game dated November 17, 1994, it contains unused music tracks, locations, and other features changed or removed from the final release\u2014such as a dungeon named \"Singing Mountain\" and its eponymous tune. Some names also differed; the character Soysaw (Slash in the US version) was known as Wiener, while Mayonnay (Flea in the US version) was named Ketchappa. The ROM image for this early version was eventually uploaded to the internet, prompting fans to explore and document the game's differences, including two unused world map NPC character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain non-player characters. Around the game's release, Yuji Horii commented that \"Chrono Trigger\" \"went beyond [the development team's] expectations\", and Hironobu Sakaguchi congratulated the game's graphic artists and field designers. Sakaguchi intended to perfect the \"sense of dancing you get from exploring Toriyama's worlds\" in the event that they would make a sequel.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" used a 32-megabit ROM cartridge with battery-backed RAM for saved games, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors. The Japanese release of \"Chrono Trigger\" included art for the game's ending and running counts of items in the player's status menu. Developers created the North American version before adding these features to the original build, inadvertently leaving in vestiges of \"Chrono Trigger\"'s early development (such as the piece \"Singing Mountain\"). Hironobu Sakaguchi asked translator Ted Woolsey to localize \"Chrono Trigger\" for English audiences and gave him roughly thirty days to work. Lacking the help of a modern translation team, he memorized scenarios and looked at drafts of commercial player's guides to put dialogue in context. Woolsey later reflected that he would have preferred &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 months, and blames his rushed schedule on the prevailing attitude in Japan that games were children's toys rather than serious works. Some of his work was cut due to space constraints, though he still considered \"Trigger\" \"one of the most satisfying games [he] ever worked on or played\". Nintendo of America censored certain dialogue, including references to breastfeeding, consumption of alcohol, and religion.\nThe original SNES edition of \"Chrono Trigger\" was released on the Wii download service Virtual Console in Japan on April 26, 2011, in the US on May 16, 2011, and in Europe on May 20, 2011. Previously in April 2008, a \"Nintendo Power\" reader poll had identified \"Chrono Trigger\" as the third-most wanted game for the Virtual Console. The game has also been ported to i-mode, the Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS, Android, and Windows.\nPlayStation.\nSquare released an enhanced port of \"Chrono Trigger\" developed by Tose in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of \"Chrono Cross\", the 1999 sequel to \"Chrono Trigger\", to familiarize new players with the story leading up to it. This version included anime cutscenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's Bird Studio and animated at Toei Animation, as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cutscenes would illustrate subtle ties to \"Chrono Cross\". The port was released in North America in 2001\u2014along with a newly translated version of \"Final Fantasy IV\"\u2014as \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\". Reviewers criticized \"Chronicles\" for its lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features. This same iteration was also re-released as a downloadable game on the PlayStation Network on October 4, 2011, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable.\nNintendo DS.\nOn July 2, 2008, Square Enix announced that they were planning to bring \"Chrono Trigger\" to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda was pleased with the project, exclaiming \"finally!\" after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, \"it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it.\" Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, \"I wanted it to be based on the original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the PlayStation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That's how it struck me and I told the staff so later on.\" Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.\nThe DS re-release contains all of the bonus material from the PlayStation port, as well as other enhancements. The added features include a more accurate and revised translation by Tom Slattery, a dual-screen mode which clears the top screen of all menus, a self-completing map screen, and a default \"run\" option. It also features the option to choose between two control schemes: one mirroring the original SNES controls, and the other making use of the DS's touch screen. Masato Kato participated in development, overseeing the addition of the monster-battling Arena, two new areas, the Lost Sanctum and the Dimensional Vortex, and a new ending that further foreshadows the events of \"Chrono Cross\". One of the areas within the Vortex uses the \"Singing Mountain\" song that was featured on the original \"Chrono Trigger\" soundtrack. Additionally, one of the dungeons absent from the original game was remade within the Vortex. These new dungeons met with mixed reviews; GameSpot called them \"frustrating\" and \"repetitive\", while \"IGN\" noted that \"the extra quests in the game connect extremely well.\" It was a nominee for \"Best RPG for the Nintendo DS\" in \"IGN\"'s 2008 video game awards. The Nintendo DS version of \"Chrono Trigger\" was the 22nd best-selling game of 2008 in Japan.\nMobile.\nA cellphone version was released in Japan on i-mode distribution service on August 25, 2011. An iOS version was released on December 8, 2011. This version is based on the Nintendo DS version, with graphics optimized for iOS. The game was later released for Android on October 29, 2012. An update incorporating most of the features of the Windows version\u2014including the reintroduction of the animated cutscenes, which had been absent from the initial mobile release\u2014was released on February 27, 2018, for both iOS and Android.\nWindows.\nSquare Enix released \"Chrono Trigger\" without an announcement for Windows via Steam on February 27, 2018. This version includes most content from the Nintendo DS port besides the arena mode, as well as the higher resolution graphics from the mobile device releases, support for mouse and keyboard controls, and autosave features, along with additional content such as wallpapers and music. The PC port initially received a negative reception due to its inferior graphical quality, additional glitches, UI adapted for touchscreens, and failure to properly adapt the control scheme for keyboards and controllers. In response, Square Enix provided various UI updates and several other improvements including adding an original graphics option based on the game's original version, fixing glitches introduced, and adding a true 16:9 widescreen presentation for the first time, to address the aforementioned complaints. In total, five major updates were released\u2014the first on April 10, 2018, and the last on August 3, 2018\u2014all of which have substantially improved its overall reception. On March 11, 2022, a sixth major patch was released; it added ultrawide 21:9 support and other quality of life features and improvements.\nReception.\nSNES release.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" received critical acclaim upon its original SNES release. The gameplay received praise, with \"Nintendo Power\" and \"Next Generation\" considering it innovative. Both magazines and \"Super Play\" cited the visibility of enemies in the overworld map and the use of combos as reasons for their enjoyment. Both \"Edge\" and \"GamePro\" felt the game was easier than \"Final Fantasy VI\", though \"GamePro\" enjoyed it nonetheless. The graphics and music received praise by \"Nintendo Power\", \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", and \"Nintendo Magazine System\". \"GamePro\" found them better than in prior role-playing video games such as \"Final Fantasy VI\", and \"Game Informer\" felt the graphical upgrades shortened the quests, though \"Edge\" considered them lacking \"Final Fantasy VI\"'s grandness. Evaluations of the story and characters were more mixed. The critics for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" generally found the storyline compelling, and \"Game Informer\" felt that the game's character arcs were well-developed. \"Next Generation\" and \"Super Play\" disagreed; they both negatively compared the character arcs to \"Final Fantasy VI\", with \"Super Play\" finding Frog's story to be the only meaningful one.\nWindows release.\nIn contrast to the critical acclaim of \"Chrono Trigger\"'s original SNES release, the 2018 Windows port of \"Chrono Trigger\" was critically panned. Grievances noted by reviewers included tiling errors on textures, the addition of aesthetically intrusive sprite filters, an unattractive GUI carried over from the 2011 mobile release, a lack of graphic customization options, and the inability to remap controls. In describing the port, \"Forbes\" commented: \"From pretty awful graphical issues, such as tiling textures and quite a painful menu system, this port really doesn't do this classic game justice.\" \"USGamer\" characterized the Windows release as carrying \"all the markings of a project farmed out to the lowest bidder. It's a shrug in Square-Enix's mind, seemingly not worth the money or effort necessary for a half-decent port.\" In a Twitter post detailing his experiences with the Windows version, indie developer Fred Wood derisively compared the port to \"someone's first attempt at an RPG Maker game\", a comment which was republished across numerous articles addressing the poor quality of the rerelease. Square Enix released six major updates to address the complaints, thus improving its overall reception; Alex Donaldson of \"VG247\", commenting on the improvements, wrote that \"Square Enix took the criticism to heart and over the course of a string of hefty patches have slowly turned this into something that actually could be argued as the best version of \"Chrono Trigger\".\"\nSales.\nThe game was a best-seller in Japan, where two million copies were sold in only two months. It ended the year as the second best-selling game of 1995 in Japan, below \"\". \"Chrono Trigger\" was also met with substantial success upon release in North America, and its re-release on the PlayStation as part of the \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" package topped the NPD TRSTS PlayStation sales charts for over six weeks. By March 2003, the game's SNES and PS1 iterations had shipped 2.65 million copies worldwide, including 2.36 million in Japan and 290,000 abroad. The PS1 version was re-released in 2003 as part of Sony's Greatest Hits line. The original SNES version had sold 2.5 million copies by 2006. \"Chrono Trigger DS\" sold 790,000 copies worldwide, as of March 2009, including 490,000 in Japan, 240,000 in North America and 60,000 in Europe. The SNES, PS1 and DS versions shipped a combined 3.44 million copies worldwide by March 2009. Excluding the PC version, the game had shipped over 3.5 million copies worldwide by February 2018. As of March 2025, all versions together have shipped more than 5 million copies worldwide.\nAwards and accolades.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" is frequently listed among the greatest video games of all time. In 1997 \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" ranked it the 29th best console video game of all time; while noting that it was not as good as \"Final Fantasy VI\" (which ranked 9th), they gave superlative praise to its handling of time travel and its combat engine. It has placed highly on all six of multimedia website \"IGN\"'s \"top 100 games of all time\" lists\u20144th in 2002, 6th in early 2005, 13th in late 2005, 2nd in 2006, 18th in 2007, and 2nd in 2008. \"Game Informer\" called it its 15th favorite game in 2001. Its staff thought that it was the best non-\"Final Fantasy\" game Square had produced at the time. \"GameSpot\" included \"Chrono Trigger\" in \"The Greatest Games of All Time\" list released in April 2006, and it also appeared as 28th on an \"All Time Top 100\" list in a poll conducted by Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" the same year. In 2004, \"Chrono Trigger\" finished runner up to \"Final Fantasy VII\" in the inaugural GameFAQs video game battle. In 2008, readers of \"Dengeki Online\" voted it the eighth best game ever made. \"Nintendo Power\"'s twentieth anniversary issue named it the fifth best Super NES game. In 2009, \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" ranked the DS version of the game 31st on a list of greatest Nintendo games. In 2012, it came 32nd place on \"GamesRadar\"'s \"100 best games of all time\" list, and 1st place on its \"Best JRPGs\" list. \"GamesRadar\" named \"Chrono Trigger\" the 2nd best Super NES game of all time, behind \"Super Metroid\". In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their \"Best JRPGs of All Time\" list.\nLegacy.\nAdd-ons.\n\"Chrono Trigger\" inspired several related releases; the first were three games released for the Satellaview on July 31, 1995. They included \"Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special\", a racing video game based on a minigame from the original; \"Chrono Trigger: Character Library\", featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and \"Chrono Trigger: Music Library\", a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of \"Character Library\" and \"Music Library\" were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of \"Chrono Trigger\". Production I.G created a 16-minute OVA, \"Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar\", which was shown at the Japanese \"V Jump\" festival of July 31, 1996.\nFangames.\nThere have been two notable attempts by \"Chrono Trigger\" fans to unofficially remake parts of the game for PC with a 3D graphics engine. \"Chrono Resurrection\", an attempt at remaking ten small interactive cutscenes from \"Chrono Trigger\", and \"Chrono Trigger Remake Project\", which sought to remake the entire game, were forcibly terminated by Square Enix by way of a cease and desist order. Another group of fans created a sequel via a ROM hack of \"Chrono Trigger\" called \"\"; developed from 2004 to 2009; although feature-length and virtually finished, it also was terminated through a cease &amp; desist letter days before its May 2009 release. The letter also forbade the dissemination of existing \"Chrono Trigger\" ROM hacks and documentation. After the cease and desist was issued, an incomplete version of the game was leaked in May 2009, though due to the early state of the game, playability was limited.\nThis was followed by a more complete ROM leak in January 2011, which allowed the game to be played from beginning to end.\nSequels.\nSquare released a related Satellaview game in 1996, named \"Radical Dreamers\". Having thought that \"Trigger\" ended with \"unfinished business\", scenarist Masato Kato wrote and directed the game. \"Dreamers\" functioned as a side story to \"Chrono Trigger\", resolving a loose subplot from its predecessor. A short, text-based game relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan\u2014though it was translated by fans to English in April 2003. Square planned to release \"Radical Dreamers\" as an easter egg in the PlayStation edition of \"Chrono Trigger\", but Kato was unhappy with his work and halted its inclusion.\nSquare released \"Chrono Cross\" for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. \"Cross\" is a sequel to \"Chrono Trigger\" featuring a new setting and cast of characters. Presenting a theme of parallel worlds, the story followed the protagonist Serge\u2014a teenage boy thrust into an alternate reality in which he died years earlier. With the help of a thief named Kid, Serge endeavors to discover the truth behind his apparent death and obtain the Frozen Flame, a mythical artifact. Regarded by writer and director Masato Kato as an effort to \"redo \"Radical Dreamers\" properly\", \"Chrono Cross\" borrowed certain themes, scenarios, characters, and settings from \"Dreamers\". Yasunori Mitsuda also adapted certain songs from \"Radical Dreamers\" while scoring \"Cross\". \"Radical Dreamers\" was consequently removed from the series' main continuity, considered an alternate dimension. \"Chrono Cross\" shipped 1.5 million copies and was widely praised by critics.\nThere are no plans as of 2025[ [update]] for a new title, despite a statement from Hironobu Sakaguchi in 2001 that the developers of \"Chrono Cross\" wanted to make a new \"Chrono\" game. The same year, Square applied for a trademark for the names \"Chrono Break\" in the United States and \"Chrono Brake\" in Japan. However, the United States trademark was dropped in 2003. Director Takashi Tokita mentioned \"Chrono Trigger 2\" in a 2003 interview which has not been translated to English. Yuji Horii expressed no interest in returning to the Chrono franchise in 2005, while Hironobu Sakaguchi remarked in April 2007 that his creation \"Blue Dragon\" was an \"extension of [Chrono Trigger].\" During a Cubed\u00b3 interview on February 1, 2007, Square Enix's Senior Vice President Hiromichi Tanaka said that although no sequel is currently planned, some sort of sequel is still possible if the \"Chrono Cross\" developers can be reunited. Yasunori Mitsuda has expressed interest in scoring a new game, but warned that \"there are a lot of politics involved\" with the series. He stressed that Masato Kato should participate in development. The February 2008 issue of \"Game Informer\" ranked the \"Chrono\" series eighth among the \"Top Ten Sequels in Demand\", naming the games \"steadfast legacies in the Square Enix catalogue\" and asking, \"what's the damn holdup?!\" In Electronic Gaming Monthly's June 2008 \"Retro Issue\", writer Jeremy Parish cited \"Chrono\" as the franchise video game fans would be most thrilled to see a sequel to. In the first May \"Famitsu\" of 2009, \"Chrono Trigger\" placed 14th out of 50 in a vote of most-wanted sequels by the magazine's readers. At E3 2009, SE Senior Vice President Shinji Hashimoto remarked, \"If people want a sequel, they should buy more!\"\nIn July 2010, Obsidian Entertainment designer Feargus Urquhart, replying to an interview question about what franchises he would like to work on, said that \"if [he] could come across everything that [he] played\", he would choose a \"Chrono Trigger\" game. At the time, Obsidian was making \"Dungeon Siege III\" for Square Enix. Urquhart said: \"You make RPGs, we make RPGs, it would be great to see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together.\" Yoshinori Kitase stated that he used the time travel mechanics of \"Chrono Trigger\" as a starting point for that of \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Trust conducts both land and marine conservation programmes.\nHistory.\nThe Cornwall Wildlife Trust is a charitable organisation founded in 1962 that is concerned with the conservation and preservation of Cornwall's wildlife, geology and habitats, both on land and in the marine environment. Frank Turk, Stella Turk and Jean Paton were all involved in the founding of the organisation. The Trust is part of The Wildlife Trusts partnership of 46 wildlife trusts in the United Kingdom. It works in conjunction with the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust on some matters. The Trust is based at Allet near Truro in Cornwall. The headquarters and offices are adjacent to the Trust's Five Acres nature reserve. This reserve includes two ponds, as well as mixed broadleaved and conifer woodland. As of 2024[ [update]] the Trust's chief executive is Matt Walpole. The Trust is run by a group of elected volunteer trustees, as of 2024[ [update]] chaired by Oliver Blount.\nActivities.\nThe trust deals with the conservation and preservation of Cornwall's wildlife, geology and habitats, managing over 50 nature reserves covering approximately , amongst them Looe Island. Cornwall Wildlife Trust produces a thrice-yearly magazine called \"Wild Cornwall\".\nThe direction and work that the Trust currently does is guided by the Cornwall Biodiversity action plan. Living Seas and Living Landscapes are two such projects. The Trust runs ERCCIS (Environmental Records Centre for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly), a county wide database of sightings of animals and plants, and records of geology. It also gives planning advice (CEC - Cornwall Environmental Consultants) to land developers.\nIn 2024 the Trust received a National Lottery grant of \u00a3265,000, with a possible follow-up grant of \u00a33m, allowing the Trust to launch a rewilding campaign, named the Tor to Shore project.\nList of reserves.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6617", "revid": "48654379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6617", "title": "Compactification (mathematics)", "text": "Embedding a topological space into a compact space as a dense subset\nIn mathematics, in general topology, compactification is the process or result of making a topological space into a compact space. A compact space is a space in which every open cover of the space contains a finite subcover. The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from \"going off to infinity\" by in some way adding \"points at infinity\" or preventing such an \"escape\".\nAn example.\nConsider the real line with its ordinary topology. This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right. It is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single \"point at infinity\" which we will denote by \u221e. The resulting compactification is homeomorphic to a circle in the plane (which, as a closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean plane, is compact). Every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to \u221e in this compactification. The direction in which a number approaches infinity on the number line (either in the - direction or + direction) is still preserved on the circle; for if a number approaches towards infinity from the - direction on the number line, then the corresponding point on the circle can approach \u221e from the left for example. Then if a number approaches infinity from the + direction on the number line, then the corresponding point on the circle can approach \u221e from the right.\nIntuitively, the process can be pictured as follows: first shrink the real line to the open interval on the \"x\"-axis; then bend the ends of this interval upwards (in positive \"y\"-direction) and move them towards each other, until you get a circle with one point (the topmost one) missing. This point is our new point \u221e \"at infinity\"; adding it in completes the compact circle.\nA bit more formally: we represent a point on the unit circle by its angle, in radians, going from \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0 for simplicity. Identify each such point \"\u03b8\" on the circle with the corresponding point on the real line tan(\"\u03b8\"/2). This function is undefined at the point \u03c0, since tan(\u03c0/2) is undefined; we will identify this point with our point\u00a0\u221e.\nSince tangents and inverse tangents are both continuous, our identification function is a homeomorphism between the real line and the unit circle without \u221e. What we have constructed is called the \"Alexandroff one-point compactification\" of the real line, discussed in more generality below. It is also possible to compactify the real line by adding \"two\" points, +\u221e and \u2212\u221e; this results in the extended real line.\nDefinition.\nAn embedding of a topological space \"X\" as a dense subset of a compact space is called a compactification of \"X\". It is often useful to embed topological spaces in compact spaces, because of the special properties compact spaces have.\nEmbeddings into compact Hausdorff spaces may be of particular interest. Since every compact Hausdorff space is a Tychonoff space, and every subspace of a Tychonoff space is Tychonoff, we conclude that any space possessing a Hausdorff compactification must be a Tychonoff space. In fact, the converse is also true; being a Tychonoff space is both necessary and sufficient for possessing a Hausdorff compactification.\nThe fact that large and interesting classes of non-compact spaces do in fact have compactifications of particular sorts makes compactification a common technique in topology.\nAlexandroff one-point compactification.\nFor any noncompact topological space \"X\" the (Alexandroff) one-point compactification \u03b1\"X\" of \"X\" is obtained by adding one extra point \u221e (often called a \"point at infinity\") and defining the open sets of the new space to be the open sets of \"X\" together with the sets of the form \"G\"\u00a0\u222a\u00a0{\u221e}, where \"G\" is an open subset of \"X\" such that formula_1 is closed and compact. The one-point compactification of \"X\" is Hausdorff if and only if \"X\" is Hausdorff and locally compact.\nStone\u2013\u010cech compactification.\nOf particular interest are Hausdorff compactifications, i.e., compactifications in which the compact space is Hausdorff. A topological space has a Hausdorff compactification if and only if it is Tychonoff. In this case, there is a unique (up to homeomorphism) \"most general\" Hausdorff compactification, the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification of \"X\", denoted by \"\u03b2X\"; formally, this exhibits the category of Compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps as a reflective subcategory of the category of Tychonoff spaces and continuous maps.\n\"Most general\" or formally \"reflective\" means that the space \"\u03b2X\" is characterized by the universal property that any continuous function from \"X\" to a compact Hausdorff space \"K\" can be extended to a continuous function from \"\u03b2X\" to \"K\" in a unique way. More explicitly, \"\u03b2X\" is a compact Hausdorff space containing \"X\" such that the induced topology on \"X\" by \"\u03b2X\" is the same as the given topology on \"X\", and for any continuous map \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"K\", where \"K\" is a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique continuous map \"g\" : \"\u03b2X\" \u2192 \"K\" for which \"g\" restricted to \"X\" is identically\u00a0\"f\".\nThe Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification can be constructed explicitly as follows: let \"C\" be the set of continuous functions from \"X\" to the closed interval [0, 1]. Then each point in \"X\" can be identified with an evaluation function on \"C\". Thus \"X\" can be identified with a subset of [0, 1]\"C\", the space of \"all\" functions from \"C\" to [0, 1]. Since the latter is compact by Tychonoff's theorem, the closure of \"X\" as a subset of that space will also be compact. This is the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification.\nSpacetime compactification.\nWalter Benz and Isaak Yaglom have shown how stereographic projection onto a single-sheet hyperboloid can be used to provide a compactification for split complex numbers. In fact, the hyperboloid is part of a quadric in real projective four-space. The method is similar to that used to provide a base manifold for group action of the conformal group of spacetime.\nProjective space.\nReal projective space RP\"n\" is a compactification of Euclidean space R\"n\". For each possible \"direction\" in which points in R\"n\" can \"escape\", one new point at infinity is added (but each direction is identified with its opposite). The Alexandroff one-point compactification of R we constructed in the example above is in fact homeomorphic to RP1. Note however that the projective plane RP2 is \"not\" the one-point compactification of the plane R2 since more than one point is added.\nComplex projective space CP\"n\" is also a compactification of C\"n\"; the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the plane C is (homeomorphic to) the complex projective line CP1, which in turn can be identified with a sphere, the Riemann sphere.\nPassing to projective space is a common tool in algebraic geometry because the added points at infinity lead to simpler formulations of many theorems. For example, any two different lines in RP2 intersect in precisely one point, a statement that is not true in R2. More generally, B\u00e9zout's theorem, which is fundamental in intersection theory, holds in projective space but not affine space. This distinct behavior of intersections in affine space and projective space is reflected in algebraic topology in the cohomology rings \u2013 the cohomology of affine space is trivial, while the cohomology of projective space is non-trivial and reflects the key features of intersection theory (dimension and degree of a subvariety, with intersection being Poincar\u00e9 dual to the cup product).\nCompactification of moduli spaces generally require allowing certain degeneracies \u2013 for example, allowing certain singularities or reducible varieties. This is notably used in the Deligne\u2013Mumford compactification of the moduli space of algebraic curves.\nCompactification and discrete subgroups of Lie groups.\nIn the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups, the quotient space of cosets is often a candidate for more subtle compactification to preserve structure at a richer level than just topological.\nFor example, modular curves are compactified by the addition of single points for each cusp, making them Riemann surfaces (and so, since they are compact, algebraic curves). Here the cusps are there for a good reason: the curves parametrize a space of lattices, and those lattices can degenerate ('go off to infinity'), often in a number of ways (taking into account some auxiliary structure of \"level\"). The cusps stand in for those different 'directions to infinity'.\nThat is all for lattices in the plane. In \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space the same questions can be posed, for example about formula_2 This is harder to compactify. There are a variety of compactifications, such as the Borel\u2013Serre compactification, the reductive Borel\u2013Serre compactification, and the Satake compactifications, that can be formed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically, the cotangent space, formula_3 is defined as the dual space of the tangent space at \"formula_1\", formula_5, although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors.\nProperties.\nAll cotangent spaces at points on a connected manifold have the same dimension, equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be \"glued together\" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the cotangent bundle of the manifold.\nThe tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore isomorphic to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a Riemannian metric or a symplectic form gives rise to a natural isomorphism between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.\nFormal definitions.\nDefinition as linear functionals.\nLet formula_2 be a smooth manifold and let formula_1 be a point in formula_2. Let formula_5 be the tangent space at formula_1. Then the cotangent space at formula_1 is defined as the dual space of formula_5:\nformula_13\nConcretely, elements of the cotangent space are linear functionals on formula_5. That is, every element formula_15 is a linear map\nformula_16\nwhere formula_17 is the underlying field of the vector space being considered, for example, the field of real numbers. The elements of formula_3 are called cotangent vectors.\nAlternative definition.\nIn some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on formula_2. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions \"f\" and \"g\" are equivalent at a point formula_1 if they have the same first-order behavior near formula_1, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions \"f\" and \"g\" have the same first order behavior near formula_1 if and only if the derivative of the function \"f\" \u2212 \"g\" vanishes at formula_1. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near formula_1.\nLet formula_2 be a smooth manifold and let formula_1 be a point in formula_2. Let formula_28be the ideal of all functions in formula_29 vanishing at formula_1, and let formula_31 be the set of functions of the form formula_32, where formula_33. Then formula_28 and formula_31 are both real vector spaces and the cotangent space can be defined as the quotient space formula_36 by showing that the two spaces are isomorphic to each other.\nThis formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the Zariski tangent space in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to locally ringed spaces.\nThe differential of a function.\nLet formula_37 be a smooth manifold and let formula_38 be a smooth function. The differential of formula_39 at a point formula_1 is the map\nformula_41\nwhere formula_42 is a tangent vector at formula_1, thought of as a derivation. That is formula_44 is the Lie derivative of formula_39 in the direction formula_46, and one has formula_47. Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write\nformula_48\nIn either case, formula_49 is a linear map on formula_50 and hence it is a tangent covector at formula_1.\nWe can then define the differential map formula_52 at a point formula_1 as the map which sends formula_39 to formula_49. Properties of the differential map include:\nThe differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Since for all formula_61 there exist formula_62 such that formula_63, we have,\nformula_64 \nSo that all function in formula_65 have differential zero, it follows that for every two functions formula_66, formula_67, we have formula_68. We can now construct an isomorphism between formula_3 and formula_70 by sending linear maps formula_71 to the corresponding cosets formula_72. Since there is a unique linear map for a given kernel and slope, this is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.\nThe pullback of a smooth map.\nJust as every differentiable map formula_73 between manifolds induces a linear map (called the \"pushforward\" or \"derivative\") between the tangent spaces\nformula_74\nevery such map induces a linear map (called the \"pullback\") between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:\nformula_75\nThe pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the pushforward. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:\nformula_76\nwhere formula_77 and formula_78. Note carefully where everything lives.\nIf we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let formula_79 be a smooth function on formula_80 vanishing at formula_81. Then the pullback of the covector determined by formula_79 (denoted formula_83) is given by\nformula_84\nThat is, it is the equivalence class of functions on formula_37 vanishing at formula_1 determined by formula_87.\nExterior powers.\nThe formula_88-th exterior power of the cotangent space, denoted formula_89, is another important object in differential and algebraic geometry. Vectors in the formula_88-th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the formula_88-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle, are called differential formula_88-forms. They can be thought of as alternating, multilinear maps on formula_88 tangent vectors. \nFor this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called \"one-forms\"."}

Their distinguishing features are an uncentralized nervous system distributed throughout a gelatinous body and the presence of cnidocytes or cnidoblasts, specialized cells with ejectable organelles used mainly for envenomation and capturing prey. Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living, jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. Many cnidarian species can reproduce both sexually and asexually.\nCnidarians mostly have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes, which are specialized stinging cells used to capture prey. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Cnidarians also have rhopalia, which are involved in gravity sensing and sometimes chemoreception. Several free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually, but many species have complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae stages. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage, and the parasitic classes evolved to have neither form.\nCnidarians were formerly grouped with ctenophores, also known as comb jellies, in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Most cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish); Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa (a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and which has both sessile members, such as \"Hydra\", and colonial swimmers (such as the Portuguese man o' war)). Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the highly derived parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were firmly recognized as cnidarians only in 2007.\nMost cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from symbiotic dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals\u2014which form the structural foundation for coral reefs\u2014possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.\nCnidarians are a very ancient phylum, with fossils having been found in rocks formed about https://\u00a0million years ago during the Ediacaran period, preceding the Cambrian Explosion. Other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before https://\u00a0million years ago and diversified a few million years later. Molecular clock analysis of mitochondrial genes suggests an even older age for the crown group of cnidarians, estimated around https://\u00a0million years ago, almost 200 million years before the Cambrian period, as well as before any fossils. Recent phylogenetic analyses support monophyly of cnidarians, as well as the position of cnidarians as the sister group of bilaterians.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"cnidaria\" derives from the Ancient Greek word \"kn\u00edd\u0113\" (\u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7 \"nettle\"), signifying the coiled thread reminiscent of cnidocytes.\nDistinguishing features.\nCnidarians form a phylum of animals that are more complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. Both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire harpoon-like structures that are mainly used to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes can also be used as anchors. Cnidarians are also distinguished by the fact that they have only one opening in their body for ingestion and excretion i.e. they do not have a separate mouth and anus.\nLike sponges and ctenophores, cnidarians have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence, cnidarians and ctenophores have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer. As a result, some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, and it has been suggested that cnidarians evolved from triploblastic ancestors.\nDescription.\nBasic body forms.\nMost adult cnidarians appear as either free-swimming medusae or sessile polyps, and many hydrozoans species are known to alternate between the two forms.\nBoth are radially symmetrical, like a wheel and a tube respectively. Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth).\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with cnidocytes around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of zooids that serve different purposes, such as defence, reproduction and catching prey. The mesoglea of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of jet propulsion.\nSkeletons.\nIn medusae, the only supporting structure is the mesoglea. \"Hydra\" and most sea anemones close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as \"Tubularia\" use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate spicules and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.\nIn some colonial polyps, a chitinous epidermis gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.\nA mineralized exoskeleton made of calcium carbonate is found in subphylum Anthozoa in the order Scleractinia (stony corals; class Hexacorallia) and the class Octocorallia, and in subphylum Medusozoa in three hydrozoan families in order Anthoathecata; Milleporidae, Stylasteridae and Hydractiniidae (the latter with a mix of calcified and uncalcified species).\nMain cell layers.\nCnidaria are diploblastic animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are triploblasts having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form epithelia that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous basement membrane, which they secrete. They also secrete the jelly-like mesoglea that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the ectoderm (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:\nIn addition to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm (\"stomach skin\") contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes. In some species it also contains low concentrations of cnidocytes, which are used to subdue prey that is still struggling.\nThe mesoglea contains small numbers of amoeba-like cells, and muscle cells in some species. However, the number of middle-layer cells and types are much lower than in sponges.\nPolymorphism.\nPolymorphism refers to the occurrence of structurally and functionally more than two different types of individuals within the same organism. It is a characteristic feature of cnidarians, particularly the polyp and medusa forms, or of zooids within colonial organisms like those in Hydrozoa. In Hydrozoans, colonial individuals arising from individual zooids will take on separate tasks. For example, in \"Obelia\" there are feeding individuals, the gastrozooids; the individuals capable of asexual reproduction only, the gonozooids, blastostyles and free-living or sexually reproducing individuals, the medusae.\nCnidocytes.\nThese \"nettle cells\" function as harpoons, since their s remain connected to the bodies of the cells by threads. Three types of cnidocytes are known:\nThe main components of a cnidocyte are:\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48\u00a0hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.\nLocomotion.\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.\nHydras and some sea anemones can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like inchworms, or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.\nNervous system and senses.\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures. These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, chemical changes, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system. As well as forming the \"signal cables\" between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as bilaterians, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and glycine. Serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, octopamine, histamine, and acetylcholine, on the other hand, are absent.\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration by means of statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing the strength of the swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have ocelli (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light. However, the agile box jellyfish are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.\nFeeding and excretion.\nCnidarians feed in several ways: predation, absorbing dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles out of the water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the corals \"Hetroxenia\" and \"Leptogorgia\", depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, and protection against predators.\nPredatory species use their cnidocytes to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous nematocysts may start digestion by injecting digestive enzymes. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae, the tentacles around the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. These \"oral arms\" aid in cnidarians' ability to move prey towards their mouth once it has been poisoned and entangled. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of cilia whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of mucus to trap particles. Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is ammonia, which is removed by the external and internal water currents.\nRespiration.\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.\nCnidaria that carry photosynthetic symbionts may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove toxic. The animals produce large quantities of antioxidants to neutralize the excess oxygen.\nRegeneration.\nAll cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.\nReproduction.\n\u00a01\u00a0\n\u00a02\u00a0\n\u00a03\u00a0\n\u00a04\u00a0\n\u00a05\u00a0\n\u00a06\u00a0\n\u00a07\u00a0\n\u00a08\u00a0\n\u00a09\u00a0\n\u00a010\u00a0\n\u00a011\u00a0\n\u00a012\u00a0\n\u00a013\u00a0\n\u00a014\u00a0\nLife cycle of a jellyfish:1\u20133 Larva searches for site4\u20138 Polyp grows9\u201311 Polyp strobilates12\u201314 Medusa grows\nSexual.\nCnidarian sexual reproduction often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies), a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adult medusae have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a free-swimming medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually) is sometimes called \"alternation of asexual and sexual phases\" or \"metagenesis\", but should not be confused with the alternation of generations as found in plants.\nShortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. \"hydra\") have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (\"Turritopsis dohrnii\" and \"Laodicea undulata\") and Scyphozoa (\"Aurelia\" sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage\u00a0\u2014 one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere (blastula) and then a depression forms at one end (gastrulation) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the animal pole), while in bilaterians it forms at the other end (vegetal pole). The larvae, called planulae, swim or crawl by means of cilia. They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.\nAnthozoan larvae either have large yolks or are capable of feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.\nAsexual.\nAll known cnidarians can reproduce asexually by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult. The ability of cnidarians to asexually reproduce ensures a greater number of mature medusa that can mature to reproduce sexually.\nDNA repair.\nTwo classical DNA repair pathways, nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair, are present in hydra, and these repair pathways facilitate unhindered reproduction. The identification of these pathways in hydra is based, in part, on the presence in the hydra genome of genes homologous to genes in other genetically well studied species that have been demonstrated to play key roles in these DNA repair pathways.\nClassification.\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as \"Hydra\" and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.\nStauromedusae, small sessile cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, have traditionally been classified as members of the Scyphozoa, but recent research suggests they should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.\nThe Myxozoa, microscopic parasites, were first classified as protozoans. Research then found that \"Polypodium hydriforme\", a non-myxozoan parasite \"within\" the egg cells of sturgeon, is closely related to the Myxozoa and suggested that both \"Polypodium\" and the Myxozoa were intermediate between cnidarians and bilaterian animals. More recent research demonstrates that the previous identification of bilaterian genes reflected contamination of the myxozoan samples by material from their host organism, and they are now firmly identified as heavily derived cnidarians, and more closely related to Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa than to Anthozoa.\nSome researchers classify the extinct conulariids as cnidarians, while others propose that they form a completely separate phylum.\nCurrent classification according to the World Register of Marine Species: \nEcology.\nMany cnidarians are limited to shallow waters because they depend on endosymbiotic algae for much of their nutrients. The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which are limited to locations that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. Hydrozoans have a worldwide range: some, such as \"Hydra\", live in freshwater; \"Obelia\" appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and \"Liriope\" can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among anthozoans, a few scleractinian corals, sea pens and sea fans live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near hydrothermal vents over below sea-level. Reef-building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30\u00b0N and 30\u00b0S with a maximum depth of , temperatures between , high salinity, and low carbon dioxide levels. Stauromedusae, although usually classified as jellyfish, are stalked, sessile animals that live in cool to Arctic waters. Cnidarians range in size from a mere handful of cells for the parasitic myxozoans through \"Hydra\"'s length of , to the lion's mane jellyfish, which may exceed in diameter and in length.\nPrey of cnidarians ranges from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, flatworms and comb jellies, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense (nematocysts used by cnidarian predators are referred to as kleptocnidae); starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clownfish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.\nCoral reefs form some of the world's most productive ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support a wide range of other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and seagrass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.\nEvolutionary history.\nFossil record.\nThe earliest widely accepted animal fossils are rather modern-looking cnidarians, possibly from around https://\u00a0million years ago, although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation can only be dated approximately. The identification of some of these as embryos of animals has been contested, but other fossils from these rocks strongly resemble tubes and other mineralized structures made by corals. Their presence implies that the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages had already diverged. Although the Ediacaran fossil \"Charnia\" used to be classified as a jellyfish or sea pen, more recent study of growth patterns in \"Charnia\" and modern cnidarians has cast doubt on this hypothesis, leaving the Canadian polyp \"Haootia\" and the British \"Auroralumina\" as the only recognized cnidarian body fossils from the Ediacaran. \"Auroralumina\" is the earliest known animal predator. Few fossils of cnidarians without mineralized skeletons are known from more recent rocks, except in Lagerst\u00e4tten that preserved soft-bodied animals.\nA few mineralized fossils that resemble corals have been found in rocks from the Cambrian period, and corals diversified in the Early Ordovician. These corals, which were wiped out in the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event about https://\u00a0million years ago, did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part. During the Mesozoic era, rudist bivalves were the main reef-builders, but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event https://\u00a0million years ago, and since then the main reef-builders have been scleractinian corals.\nHydroconozoa is an extinct class of cnidarians, established by K.B. Korde in 1964 based on Lower Cambrian fossils from Tuva, USSR. These conical and cylindrical organisms, including genera like Hydroconus and Tuvaeconus, possessed external skeletons with features resembling both scyphozoans and tetracorals. Their unique skeletal structures suggest a distinct lineage within early cnidarian evolution.\nPhylogeny.\nIt is difficult to reconstruct the early stages in the evolutionary \"family tree\" of animals using only morphology (their shapes and structures) because of the large differences between the major groups of animals. Hence, reconstructions now rely almost entirely on molecular phylogenetics, which groups organisms based on their biochemistry, most commonly by analyzing DNA or RNA sequences.\nIn 1866, it was proposed that Cnidaria and Ctenophora were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called Coelenterata (\"hollow guts\") because both rely on the flow of water in and out of a single cavity for feeding, excretion and respiration. In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, such as a middle layer of cells (mesoglea in Ctenophora, mesoderm in Bilateria) between the outer and inner layer found in other animals. However, more recent analyses indicate that these similarities were evolved independently in both lineages, instead of being present in their common ancestor. The current view is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"Planulozoa\", named so because the earliest Bilateria were probably similar to the planula larvae of Cnidaria.\nIn 2005, Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have striated muscle, which in bilaterians arises from the mesoderm. They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.\nResolving the evolutionary relationships within Cnidaria has also been challenging, with almost every possible combination of clades being proposed. As time went on though, a semi-consensus has started to emerge. The enigmatic \"Polypodium hydriforme\" and subphylum Myxozoa have been firmly placed within the Cnidaria and have been shown to be closely related to the Medusozoa. In addition, these two groups have been found to likely be each other's closest relatives which, if true, would form the clade \"Endocnidozoa\". The relationships within the Medusozoa are currently probably the most contentious part of the tree. Traditionally, the class Scyphozoa also included Staurozoa and Cubozoa, but significant morphological differences eventually lead to the split of the three. The group containing them has since been named \"Acraspeda\". The relationships between these three and Hydrozoa have since and still are debated. A relationship between Scyphozoa and Cubozoa with Staurozoa as its sister has seen support in nearly all studies, but the position of the remaining class, Hydrozoa, is not understood. Several studies have found that Acraspeda is paraphyletic, with Hydrozoa being more closely related to Scyphozoa than to the other classes. At the same time, other studies have recovered Acraspeda as being monophyletic. The subphylum Anthozoa is argued to have either two or three classes, but the relationships between them is not disputed; the tube-dwelling anemones of the class Ceriantharia have consistently shown to be more closely related to the Hexacorallia than to the Octocorallia.\nIn molecular phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important groups of developmental genes show the same variety in cnidarians as in chordates. In fact cnidarians, and especially anthozoans (sea anemones and corals), retain some genes that are present in bacteria, protists, plants and fungi but not in bilaterians.\nInteraction with humans.\nJellyfish stings killed about 1,500 people in the 20th century, and cubozoans are particularly dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.\nThe dangerous \"sea wasp\" \"Chironex fleckeri\"\nBeaches protected from tides and storms by coral reefs are often the best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, because much of the organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.\nSome large jellyfish species of the Rhizostomeae order are commonly consumed in Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. In parts of the range, fishing industry is restricted to daylight hours and calm conditions in two short seasons, from March to May and August to November. The commercial value of jellyfish food products depends on the skill with which they are prepared, and \"Jellyfish Masters\" guard their trade secrets carefully. Jellyfish is very low in cholesterol and sugars, but cheap preparation can introduce undesirable amounts of heavy metals.\nThe \"sea wasp\" \"Chironex fleckeri\" has been described as the world's most venomous jellyfish and is held responsible for 67\u00a0deaths, although it is difficult to identify the animal as it is almost transparent. Most stingings by \"C. fleckeri\" cause only mild symptoms. Seven other box jellies can cause a set of symptoms called Irukandji syndrome, which takes about 30\u00a0minutes to develop, and from a few hours to two\u00a0weeks to disappear. Hospital treatment is usually required, and there have been a few deaths.\nA number of the parasitic myxozoans are commercially important pathogens in salmonid aquaculture. A Scyphozoa species \u2013 \"Pelagia noctiluca\" \u2013 and a Hydrozoa \u2013 \"Muggiaea atlantica\" \u2013 have caused repeated mass mortality in salmon farms over the years around Ireland. A loss valued at \u00a31 million struck in November 2007, 20,000 died off Clare Island in 2013 and four fish farms collectively lost tens of thousands of salmon in September 2017.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6623", "revid": "18285885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6623", "title": "Conservative Judaism", "text": "Jewish religious movement\nConservative Judaism, also known as Masorti Judaism, is a Jewish religious movement that regards the authority of Jewish law and tradition as emanating primarily from the assent of the people through the generations, more than from divine revelation. It therefore views Jewish law, or \"Halakha\", as both binding and subject to historical development. The Conservative rabbinate employs modern historical-critical research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency, when determining its stance on matters of practice. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of \"Halakhic\" discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.\nWhile regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel's 19th-century positive-historical school in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and the New York\u2013based Jewish Theological Seminary of America operates as its largest rabbinic seminary. Globally, affiliated communities are united within the umbrella organization Masorti Olami. Conservative Judaism is the third-largest Jewish religious movement worldwide, estimated to represent close to 1.1 million people, including over 600,000 registered adult congregants and many non-member identifiers.\nTheology.\nAttitude.\nConservative Judaism was marked by ambivalence and ambiguity in all theological matters from its earliest stages. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, considered its intellectual progenitor, believed the very notion of theology was alien to traditional Judaism. He was often accused of obscurity on the subject by his opponents, both Reform and Orthodox. The American movement largely espoused a similar approach, and its leaders mostly avoided the field. Only in 1985 did a course about Conservative theology open in the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). The hitherto sole major attempt to define a clear credo was made in 1988, with the Statement of Principles \"Emet ve-Emunah\" (Truth and Belief) formulated and issued by the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism. The introduction stated that \"lack of definition was useful\" in the past, but a need to articulate one now arose. The platform provided many statements citing key concepts such as God, revelation, and election, but also acknowledged that a variety of positions and convictions existed within its ranks, eschewing strict delineation of principles and often expressing conflicting views. In a 1999 special edition of \"Conservative Judaism\" dedicated to the matter, leading rabbis Elliot N. Dorff and Gordon Tucker stated that \"the great diversity\" within the movement \"makes the creation of a theological vision shared by all neither possible nor desirable\".\nGod and eschatology.\nConservative Judaism largely upholds the theistic notion of a personal God. \"Emet ve-Emunah\" stated, \"We affirm our faith in God as the Creator and Governor of the universe. His power called the world into being; His wisdom and goodness guide its destiny.\"\nConcurrently, the platform also noted that his nature was \"elusive\" and subject to many options of belief. A naturalistic conception of divinity, regarding it as inseparable from the mundane world, once had an important place within the movement, especially represented by Mordecai Kaplan. After Kaplan's Reconstructionism fully coalesced into an independent movement, these views were marginalized.\nA similarly inconclusive position is expressed toward other precepts. Most theologians adhere to the immortality of the soul, but while references to the resurrection of the dead are maintained, English translations of the prayers obscure the issue. In \"Emet\", it was stated that death is not tantamount to the end of one's personality. Relating to the Messiah, the movement rephrased most petitions for the restoration of the sacrifices into past tense, rejecting a renewal of animal offerings, though not opposing a return to Zion and even a Third Temple. The 1988 platform announced that \"some\" believe in classic eschatology, but dogmatism in this matter was \"philosophically unjustified\". The notions of the election of Israel and God's covenant with it were basically retained as well.\nRevelation.\nConservative conception of revelation encompasses an extensive spectrum. Zecharias Frankel himself applied critical-scientific methods to analyze the stages in the development of the Oral Torah, pioneering modern study of the Mishnah. He regarded Chazal as innovators who added their own original contribution to the canon, not merely as expounders and interpreters of a legal system given in its entirety to Moses on Mount Sinai. Yet he also vehemently rejected utilizing these disciplines in the Pentateuch, maintaining it was beyond human reach and wholly celestial in origin. Frankel never elucidated his beliefs, and the exact correlation between human and divine in his thought is still subject to scholarly debate. A similar negative approach toward Higher Criticism, while accepting an evolutionary understanding of Oral Law, defined Rabbi Alexander Kohut, Solomon Schechter and the early generation of American Conservative Judaism. When JTS faculty began to embrace Biblical criticism in the 1920s, they adapted a consistent theological view: an original, verbal revelation did occur at Sinai, but the text itself was composed by later authors. The latter, classified by Dorff as a relatively moderate metamorphosis of the old one, is still espoused by few traditionalist right-wing Conservative rabbis, though it is marginalized among senior leadership.\nA small but influential segment within the JTS and the movement adhered, from the 1930s, to Mordecai Kaplan's philosophy, denying any revelation but viewing all scripture as a purely human product. Along with other Reconstructionist tenets, it dwindled as the latter consolidated into a separate group. Kaplan's views and the permeation of Higher Criticism gradually swayed most Conservative thinkers towards a non-verbal understanding of theophany, which became dominant in the 1970s. This was in sync with the wider trend of lowering rates of Americans who accepted the Bible as the Word of God. Dorff categorized the proponents of this into two schools. One maintains that God projected some form of message that inspired the human authors of the Pentateuch to record what they perceived. The other is often strongly influenced by Franz Rosenzweig and other existentialists, but also attracted many Objectivists who consider human reason paramount. The second school states that God merely conferred his presence on those he influenced, without any communication, and the experience drove them to spiritual creativity. While they differ in the theoretical level surrounding revelation, both practically regard all scripture and religious tradition as a human product with certain divine inspiration\u2014providing an understanding that recognizes Biblical criticism and also justifies major innovation in religious conduct. The first doctrine, advocated by such leaders as rabbis Ben-Zion Bokser and Robert Gordis, largely imparted that some elements within Judaism are fully divine but determining which would be impractical and therefore received forms of interpretation should be basically upheld. Exponents of the latter view, among them rabbis Louis Jacobs and Neil Gillman, also emphasized the encounter of God with the Jews as a collective and the role of religious authorities through the generations in determining what it implied. The stress on the supremacy of community and tradition, rather than individual consciousness, defines the entire spectrum of Conservative thought.\nIdeology.\nThe Conservative mainstay was the adoption of the historical-critical method in understanding Judaism and setting its future course. In accepting an evolutionary approach to the religion, as something that developed over time and absorbed considerable external influences, the movement distinguished between the original meaning implied in traditional sources and the manner they were grasped by successive generations, rejecting belief in an unbroken chain of interpretation from God's original Revelation, immune to any major extraneous effects. This evolutionary perception of religion, while relatively moderate in comparison with more radical modernizers\u2014the scholarship of the Positive-Historical school, for example, sought to demonstrate the continuity and cohesiveness of Judaism over the years\u2014still challenged Conservative leaders.\nThey regarded tradition and received mores with reverence, especially the continued adherence to the mechanism of Religious Law (\"Halakha\"), opposing indiscriminate modification, and emphasized they should be changed only with care and caution and remain observed by the people. Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, summarizing his movement's position, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We may now understand the apparent contradiction between theory and practice... One may conceive of the origin of Sabbath as the professor at university would, yet observe the smallest detail known to strict Orthodoxy... The sanctity of the Sabbath reposes not upon the fact that it was proclaimed on Sinai, but on the fact that it found for thousands of years its expression in Jewish souls. It is the task of the historian to examine the beginnings and developments of customs and observances; practical Judaism, on the other hand, is not concerned with origins but regards the institutions as they have come to be.\nThis discrepancy between scientific criticism and insistence on heritage had to be compensated by a conviction that would forestall either deviation from accepted norms or laxity and apathy.\nA key doctrine which was to fulfil this capacity was the collective will of the Jewish people. Conservatives lent great weight in determining religious practice, both in historical precedent and as a means to shape present conduct. Zecharias Frankel pioneered this approach; as Michael A. Meyer commented, \"the extraordinary status which he ascribed to the ingrained beliefs and practices of the community is probably the most original element of his thought.\" He turned it into a source of legitimacy for both change and preservation, but mostly the latter. The basic moderation and traditionalism of the majority among the people were to guarantee a sense of continuity and unity, restraining the guiding rabbis and scholars who at his age were intent on reform but also allowing them manoeuvrability in adopting or discarding certain elements. Solomon Schechter espoused a similar position. He turned the old rabbinic concept of \"K'lal Yisrael\", which he translated as \"Catholic Israel\", into a comprehensive worldview. For him, the details of divine Revelation were of secondary significance, as historical change dictated its interpretation through the ages notwithstanding: \"The centre of authority is actually removed from the Bible\", he surmised, \"and placed in some living body... in touch with the ideal aspirations and the religious needs of the age, best able to determine... This living body, however, is not represented by... Priesthood, or Rabbihood, but by the collective conscience of Catholic Israel.\"\nThe scope, limits and role of this corpus were a matter for contention in Conservative ranks. Schechter himself used it to oppose any major break with either traditionalist or progressive elements within American Jewry of his day, while some of his successors argued that the idea became obsolete due to the great alienation of many from received forms, that had to be countered by innovative measures to draw them back. The Conservative rabbinate often vacillated on to which degree may the non-practicing, religiously apathetic strata be included as a factor within Catholic Israel, providing impulse for them in determining religious questions; even avant-garde leaders acquiesced that the majority could not serve that function. Right-wing critics often charged that the movement allowed its uncommitted laity an exaggerated role, conceding to its demands and successively stretching \"halakhic\" boundaries beyond any limit.\nThe Conservative leadership had limited success in imparting their worldview to the general public. While the rabbinate perceived itself as bearing a unique, original conception of Judaism, the masses lacked much interest, regarding it mainly as a compromise offering a channel for religious identification that was more traditional than Reform Judaism yet less strict than Orthodoxy. Only a low percentage of Conservative congregants actively pursue an observant lifestyle: in the mid-1980s, Charles Liebman and Daniel J. Elazar calculated that barely 3 to 4 per cent held to one quite thoroughly. This gap between principle and the public, more pronounced than in any other Jewish movement, is often credited at explaining the decline of the Conservative movement. While some 41 per cent of American Jews identified with it in the 1970s, it had shrunk to an estimated 18 per cent (and 11 per cent among those under 30) in 2013.\nJewish law.\nRole.\nFidelity and commitment to \"Halakha\", while subject to criticism as disingenuous both from within and without, were and remain a cornerstone doctrine of Conservative Judaism. The movement views the legalistic system as normative and binding, and believes Jews must practically observe its precepts, like Sabbath, dietary ordinances, ritual purity, daily prayer with phylacteries and the like. Concurrently, examining Jewish history and rabbinic literature through the lens of academic criticism, it maintained that these laws were always subject to considerable evolution, and must continue to do so. \"Emet ve-Emunah\" titled its chapter on the subject with \"The Indispensability of Halakha\", stating that \"\"Halakha\" in its developing form is an indispensable element of a traditional Judaism which is vital and modern.\" Conservative Judaism regards itself as the authentic inheritor of a flexible legalistic tradition, charging the Orthodox with petrifying the process and Reform with abandoning it.\nThe tension between \"tradition and change\"\u2014which were also the motto adopted by the movement since the 1950s\u2014and the need to balance them were always a topic of intense debate within Conservative Judaism. In its early stages, the leadership opposed pronounced innovation, mostly adopting a relatively rigid position. Mordecai Kaplan's Reconstructionism raised the demand for thoroughgoing modification without much regard for the past or \"Halakhic\" considerations, but senior rabbis opposed him vigorously. Even in the 1940s and 1950s, when Kaplan's influence grew, his superiors rabbis Louis Ginzberg, Louis Finkelstein and Saul Lieberman espoused a very conservative line. Since the 1970s, with the strengthening of the liberal wing within the movement, the majority in the Rabbinic Assembly opted for quite radical reformulations in religious conduct, but rejected the Reconstructionist \"Non-Halakhic\" approach, insisting that the legalistic method be maintained. The \"Halakhic\" commitment of Conservative Judaism has been subject to much criticism, from within and without. Right-wing discontents, including the Union for Traditional Judaism which seceded in protest of the 1983 resolution to ordain women rabbis\u2014adopted at an open vote, where all JTS faculty regardless of qualification were counted\u2014contested the validity of this description, as well as progressives like Rabbi Neil Gillman, who exhorted the movement to cease describing itself as \"Halakhic\" in 2005, stating that after repeated concessions, \"Our original claim has died a death by a thousand qualifications... It has lost all factual meaning.\"\nThe main body entrusted with formulating rulings, responsa and statues is the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), a panel with 25 voting legalistic specialists and further 11 observers. There is also the smaller \"Va'ad ha-Halakha\" (Law Committee) of Israel's Masorti Movement. Every responsa must receive a minimum of six voters to be considered an official position of the CJLS. Conservative Judaism explicitly acknowledges the principle of \"halakhic\" pluralism, enabling the panel to adopt more than one resolution in any given subject. The final authority in each Conservative community is the local rabbi, the \"Mara D'Atra\" (Lord of the Locality, in traditional terms), enfranchised to adopt either minority or majority opinions from the CJLS or maintain local practice. Thus, on the issue of admitting openly homosexual rabbinic candidates, the Committee approved two resolutions, one in favour and one against; the JTS took the lenient position, while the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano still adheres to the latter. Likewise, while most Conservative synagogues approved of egalitarianism for women in religious life, some still maintain traditional gender roles and do not count women for prayer quorums.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Conservative treatment of \"Halakha\" is defined by several features, though the entire range of its \"Halakhic\" discourse cannot be sharply distinguished from either the Traditional or Orthodox one. Rabbi David Golinkin, who attempted to classify its parameters, stressed that quite often rulings merely reiterate conclusions reached in older sources or even Orthodox ones. For example, in the details of preparing Sabbath ritual enclosures, it draws directly on the opinions of the \"Shulchan Aruch\" and Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi. Another tendency prevalent among the movement's rabbis, yet again not particular to it, is the adoption of the more lenient positions on the matters at question\u2014though this is not universal, and responsa also took stringent ones not infrequently.\nA more distinctive characterization is a greater proclivity to base rulings on earlier sources, in the \"Rishonim\" or before them, as far back as the Talmud. Conservative decisors frequently resort to less canonical sources, isolated responsa or minority opinions. They demonstrate more fluidity in regards to established precedent and continuum in rabbinic literature, mainly those by the later authorities, and lay little stress on the perceived hierarchy between major and minor legalists of the past. They are far more inclined to contend (\"machloket\") with old rulings, to be flexible towards custom or to wholly disregard it. This is especially expressed in less hesitancy to rule against or notwithstanding the major codifications of Jewish Law, like \"Mishneh Torah\", \"Arba'ah Turim\" and especially the \"Shulchan Aruch\" with its Isserles Gloss and later commentaries. Conservative authorities, while often relying on the \"Shulchan Aruch\" themselves, criticize the Orthodox for relatively rarely venturing beyond it and overly canonizing Rabbi Joseph Karo's work. In several occasions, Conservative rabbis discerned that the \"Shulchan Aruch\" ruled without firm precedent, sometimes deriving his conclusions from the \"Kabbalah\". An important example is the ruling of Rabbi Golinkin\u2014contrary to the majority consensus among the \"Acharonim\" and the more prominent \"Rishonim\", but based on many opinions of the lesser \"Rishonim\" which is derived from a minority view in the Talmud\u2014that the Sabbatical Year is not obligatory in present times at all (neither \"de'Oraita\" nor \"de'Rabanan\") but rather an act of piety.\nEthical considerations and the weight due to them in determining \"halakhic\" issues, mainly to what degree may modern sensibilities shape the outcome, are subject to much discourse. Right-wing decisors, like Rabbi Joel Roth, maintained that such elements are naturally a factor in formulating conclusions, but may not alone serve as a justification for adopting a position. The majority, however, basically subscribed to the opinion evinced already by Rabbi Seymour Siegel in the 1960s, that the cultural and ethical norms of the community, the contemporary equivalents of Talmudic \"Aggadah\", should supersede the legalistic forms when the two came into conflict and there was a pivotal ethical concern. Rabbi Elliot Dorff concluded that in contrast to the Orthodox, Conservative Judaism maintains that the juridical details and processes mainly serve higher moral purposes and could be modified if they no longer do so: \"In other words, the \"Aggadah\" should control the \"Halakha\".\" The liberal Rabbi Gordon Tucker, along with Gillman and other progressives, supported a far-reaching implementation of this approach, making Conservative Judaism much more \"Aggadic\" and allowing moral priorities an overriding authority at all occasions. This idea became very popular among the young generation, but it was not fully embraced either. In the 2006 resolution on homosexuals, the CJLS chose a middle path: they agreed that the ethical consideration of human dignity was of supreme importance, but not sufficient to uproot the express Biblical prohibition on not to lie with mankind as with womankind (traditionally understood as banning full anal intercourse). All other limitations, including on other forms of sexual relations, were lifted. A similar approach is manifest in the great weight ascribed to sociological changes in deciding religious policy. The CJLS and the Rabbinical Assembly members frequently state that circumstances were profoundly transformed in modern times, fulfilling the criteria mandating new rulings in various fields (based on general talmudic principles like \"Shinui ha-I'ttim\", \"Change of Times\"). This, along with the ethical aspect, was a main argument for revolutionizing the role of women in religious life and embracing egalitarianism.\nThe most distinctive feature of Conservative legalistic discourse, in which it is conspicuously and sharply different from Orthodoxy, is the incorporation of critical-scientific methods into the process. Deliberations almost always delineate the historical development of the specific issue at hand, from the earliest known mentions until modern times. This approach enables a thorough analysis of the manner in which it was practiced, accepted, rejected or modified in various periods, not necessarily in sync with the received rabbinic understanding. Archaeology, philology and Judaic Studies are employed; rabbis use comparative compendiums of religious manuscripts, sometimes discerning that sentences were only added later or include spelling, grammar and transcription errors, changing the entire understanding of certain passages. This critical approach is central to the movement, for its historicist underpinning stresses that all religious literature has an original meaning relevant in the context of its formulation. This meaning may be analyzed and discerned, and is distinct from the later interpretations ascribed by traditional commentators. Decisors are also far more prone to include references to external scientific sources in relevant fields, like veterinarian publications in \"Halakhic\" matters concerning livestock.\nConservative authorities, as part of their promulgation of a dynamic \"Halakha\", often cite the manner in which the sages of old used rabbinic statutes (\"Takkanah\") that enabled the bypassing of prohibitions in the Pentateuch, like the \"Prozbul\" or \"Heter I'ska\". In 1948, when employing those was first debated, Rabbi Isaac Klein argued that since there was no consensus on leadership within Catholic Israel, formulation of significant \"takkanot\" should be avoided. Another proposal, to ratify them only with a two-thirds majority in the RA, was rejected. New statues require a simple majority, 13 supporters among the 25 members of the CJLS. In the 1950s and 1960s, such drastic measures\u2014as Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman cited in a 1996 writ allowing members of the priestly caste to marry divorcees, \"Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... fear that invoking this principle would create the proverbial slippery slope, thereby weakening the entire \"halakhic\" structure... thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate\"\u2014were carefully drafted as temporal, emergency ordinances (\"Horaat Sha'ah\"), grounded on the need the avoid a total rift of many nonobservant Jews. Later on, these ordinances became accepted and permanent on the practical level. The Conservative movement issued a wide range of new, thoroughgoing statues, from the famous 1950 responsum that allowed driving to the synagogue on the Sabbath and up to the 2000 decision to ban rabbis from inquiring about whether someone was a \"mamzer\", de facto abolishing this legal category.\nRulings and policies.\nOver the years, the RA and CJLS decided many things, shaping a distinctive profile for Conservative practice and worship. In the 1940s, when the public demanded mixed seating in synagogues, some rabbis argued there was no precedent but obliged on the grounds of dire need. Others noted that archaeological research showed no mehitsot (gender partitions) in ancient synagogues. Mixed seating became commonplace in almost all congregations.\nIn 1950, it was ruled that using electricity (that is, closure of an electrical circuit) did not constitute kindling a fire unto itself, not even in incandescent bulbs, and therefore was not a forbidden labour and could be done on the Sabbath. On that basis, while performing banned labours is forbidden\u2014for example, video recording is still considered writing\u2014switching lights and other functions are allowed. However, the RA strongly urges adherents to keep the sanctity of the Sabbath (refraining from doing anything that may imitate the atmosphere of weekdays, like loud noise reminiscent of work).\nThe need to encourage arrival at synagogue also motivated the CJLS, during the same year, to issue a temporal statue allowing driving on that day, for that purpose alone; it was supported by decreeing that the combustion of fuel did not serve any of the acts prohibited during the construction of the Tabernacle, and could therefore be classified, according to their interpretation of the Tosafists' opinion, as \"redundant labour\" (\"Sh\u2019eina Tzricha L\u2019gufa\") and be permitted. The validity of this argument was heavily disputed within the movement. In 1952, members of the priestly caste were allowed to marry divorcees, conditioned on forfeiture of their privileges, as termination of marriage became widespread and women who underwent it could not be suspected of unsavory acts. In 1967, the ban on priests marrying converts was also lifted.\nIn 1954, the issue of \"agunot\" (women refused divorce by their husbands) was largely settled by adding a clause to the prenuptial contract under which men had to pay alimony as long as they did not concede. In 1968, this mechanism was replaced by a retroactive expropriation of the bride price, rendering the marriage void. In 1955, more girls were celebrating Bat Mitzvah and demanded to be allowed ascents to the Torah, the CJLS agreed that the ordinance under which women were banned from this due to respect for the congregation (\"Kvod ha'Tzibur\") was no longer relevant. In 1972 it was decreed that rennet, even if derived from unclean animals, was so transformed that it constituted a wholly new item (\"Panim Chadashot ba'u l'Khan\") and therefore all hard cheese could be considered kosher.\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of women's rights on the main agenda. Growing pressure led the CJLS to adopt a motion that females may be counted as part of a quorum, based on the argument that only the \"Shulchan Aruch\" explicitly stated that it consist of men. While accepted, this was very controversial in the committee and heavily disputed. A more complete solution was offered in 1983 by Rabbi Joel Roth, and was also enacted to allow women rabbinic ordination. Roth noted that some decisors of old acknowledged that women may bless when performing positive time-bound commandments (from which they are exempted, and therefore unable to fulfill the obligation for others), especially citing the manner in which they assumed upon themselves the Counting of the Omer. He suggested that women voluntarily commit to pray thrice a day et cetera, and his responsa was adopted. Since then, female rabbis were ordained at JTS and other seminaries. In 1994, the movement accepted Judith Hauptman's principally egalitarian argument, according to which equal prayer obligations for women were never banned explicitly and it was only their inferior status that hindered participation. In 2006, openly gay rabbinic candidates were also to be admitted into the JTS. In 2012, a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples was devised, though not defined as \"kiddushin\". In 2016, the rabbis passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.\nConservative Judaism in the United States held a relatively strict policy regarding intermarriage. Propositions for acknowledging Jews by patrilineal descent, as in the Reform movement, were overwhelmingly dismissed. Unconverted spouses were largely barred from community membership and participation in rituals; clergy are banned from any involvement in interfaith marriage on pain of dismissal. However, as the rate of such unions rose dramatically, Conservative congregations began describing gentile family members as \"K'rov Yisrael\" (Kin of Israel) and be more open toward them. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism stated in 1995: \"we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews.\"\nDespite the centralization of legal deliberation on matters of Jewish law in the CJLS individual synagogues and communities must, in the end, depend on their local decision-makers. The rabbi in his or her or their community is regarded as the \"Mara D'Atra\", or the local \"Halakhic\" decisor. Rabbis trained in the reading practices of Conservative Jewish approaches, historical evaluation of Jewish law and interpretation of Biblical and Rabbinic texts may align directly with the CJLS decisions or themselves opine on matters based on precedents or readings of text that shine light on congregants' questions. So, for instance, a rabbi may or may not choose to permit video streaming on Shabbat despite a majority ruling that allows for use of electronics. A local \"Mara D'Atra\" may rely on the reasoning found in the majority or minority opinions of the CJLS or have other textual and halakhic grounds, i.e., prioritizing Jewish values or legal concepts, to rule one way or another on matters of ritual, family life or sacred pursuits. This balance between a centralization of \"Halakhic\" authority and maintaining the authority of local rabbis reflects the commitment to pluralism at the heart of the Movement.\nOrganization and demographics.\nThe term \"Conservative Judaism\" was used, still generically and not yet as a specific label, already in the 1887 dedication speech of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America by Rabbi Alexander Kohut. By 1901, the JTS alumni formed the Rabbinical Assembly, of which all ordained Conservative clergy worldwide are members. As of 2010, there were 1648 rabbis in the RA. In 1913, the United Synagogue of America, renamed the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991, was founded as a congregational arm of the RA. The movement established the World Council of Conservative Synagogues in 1957. Offshoots outside North America mostly adopted the Hebrew name \"Masorti\" (\"traditional\"), as did the Israeli Masorti Movement, founded in 1979, and the British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues, formed in 1985. The World Council eventually changed its primary designation to \"Masorti Olami.\" Besides the RA, the international Cantors Assembly supplies prayer leaders for congregations worldwide.\nThe United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, covering the United States, Canada and Mexico, is by far the largest constituent of Masorti Olami. While most congregations defining themselves as \"Conservative\" are affiliated with the USCJ, some are independent. While accurate information of Canada is scant, it is estimated that some third of religiously affiliated Canadian Jews are Conservative. In 2008, the more traditional Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues seceded from the parent organization. It numbered seven communities as of 2014. According to the Pew Research Center survey in 2013, 18 per cent of Jews in the United States and in 2020 13 per cent identified with the movement, making it the second largest in the country. Steven M. Cohen calculated that as of 2013, 962,000 U.S. Jewish adults considered themselves Conservative: 570,000 were registered congregants and further 392,000 were not members in a synagogue but identified. In addition, Cohen assumed in 2006 that 57,000 unconverted non-Jewish spouses were also registered (12 per cent of member households had one at the time): 40 per cent of members intermarry. Conservatives are also the most aged group: among those aged under 30 only 11 per cent identified as such, and there are three people over 55 for every single one aged between 35 and 44. As of November 2015, the USCJ had 580 member congregations (a sharp decline from 630 two years prior), 19 in Canada and the remainder in the United States. In 2011 the USCJ initiated a plan to reinvigorate the movement.\nBeyond North America, the movement has little presence\u2014in 2011, Rela Mintz Geffen appraised there were only 100,000 members outside the U.S. (and the former figure including Canada). \"Masorti AmLat\", the MO branch in Latin America, is the largest with 35 communities in Argentina, seven in Brazil, six in Chile and further eleven in the other countries. The British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues has thirteen communities and estimates its membership at over 4000. More than twenty communities are spread across Europe, with three in Australia and two in Africa. The Masorti Movement in Israel incorporates about seventy communities and prayer groups with several thousand members. In addition, while Hungarian Neolog Judaism, with a few thousand adherents and forty partially active synagogues, is not officially affiliated with Masorti Olami, Conservative Judaism regards it as a fraternal, \"non-Orthodox but halakhic\" movement.\nIn New York, the JTS serves as the movement's original seminary and legacy institution, along with the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles; \"Seminario Rab\u00ednico Latinoamericano\" in Buenos Aires, Argentina; and the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. A Conservative institution that does not grant rabbinic ordination but which runs along the lines of a traditional yeshiva is the Conservative Yeshiva, located in Jerusalem. The Neolog Budapest University of Jewish Studies also maintains connections with Conservative Judaism.\nThe current chancellor of the JTS is Shuly Rubin Schwartz, in office since 2020. She is the first woman elected to this position in the history of JTS. The current dean of the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies is Bradley Shavit Artson. The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards is chaired by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, serving since 2007. The Rabbinical Assembly is headed by President Rabbi Debra Newman Kamin, as of 2019, and managed by chief executive officer, Rabbi Jacob Blumenthal. Rabbi Blumenthal holds the joint position as CEO of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. The current USCJ President is Ned Gladstein. In South America, Rabbi Ariel Stofenmacher serves as chancellor in the Seminary and Rabbi Marcelo Rittner as president of Masorti AmLat. In Britain, the Masorti Assembly is chaired by Senior Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg. The Masorti movement's executive director in Israel is Yizhar Hess and chair Sophie Fellman Rafalovitz.\nThe global youth movement is known as NOAM, an acronym for No'ar Masorti; its North American organization is called United Synagogue Youth. Marom Israel is the Masorti movement's organization for students and young adults, providing activities based on religious pluralism and Jewish content. The Women's League for Conservative Judaism is also active in North America.\nThe USCJ maintains the Schechter Day School Network, comprising 76 day schools in 17 American states and 2 Canadian provinces serving Jewish children. Many other \"community day schools\" that are not affiliated with Schechter take a generally Conservative approach, but unlike these, generally have \"no barriers to enrollment based on the faith of the parents or on religious practices in the home\". During the first decade of the 21st century, several schools that were part of the Schechter network transformed into non-affiliated community day schools. The USCJ also maintains the Camp Ramah system, where children and adolescents spend summers in an observant environment.\nHistory.\nPositive-Historical School.\nThe rise of modern, centralized European states by the early 19th century heralded the end of Jewish judicial autonomy and social seclusion. Their communal corporate rights were abolished, and the process of emancipation and acculturation that followed quickly transformed the values and norms of the public. Estrangement and apathy toward Judaism were rampant. The communal, educational and civil reform process could not be restricted from affecting the core tenets of the faith. The new academic, critical study of Judaism (\"Wissenschaft des Judentums\") soon became a source of controversy. Rabbis and scholars argued to what degree, if at all, its findings could be used to determine present conduct. The modernized Orthodox in Germany, like rabbis Isaac Bernays and Azriel Hildesheimer, were content to cautiously study it while stringently adhering to the sanctity of holy texts and refusing to grant \"Wissenschaft\" any say in religious matters. On the other extreme were Rabbi Abraham Geiger, who would emerge as the founding father of Reform Judaism, and his supporters. They opposed any limit on critical research or its practical application, laying more weight on the need for change than continuity.\nThe Prague-born Zecharias Frankel, appointed chief rabbi of the Kingdom of Saxony in 1836, gradually rose to become the leader of those who stood in the middle. Besides working for the civic betterment of local Jews and educational reform, he displayed a keen interest in Wissenschaft. But Frankel was always cautious and deeply reverent towards tradition, privately writing in 1836, \"The means must be applied with such care and discretion... that forward progress will be reached unnoticed, and seem inconsequential to the average spectator.\" He soon found himself embroiled in the disputes of the 1840s. In 1842, during the second Hamburg Temple dispute, he opposed the new Reform siddur. He argued that eliminating petitions for a future return to the Land of Israel in the Messianic Age violated an ancient tenet. However, he also opposed Bernays's ban on the tome, stating this was a primitive behaviour. In the same year, he and the moderate conservative Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport were the only ones of nineteen respondents who negatively answered the Breslau community's enquiry on whether the deeply unorthodox Geiger could serve there.\nIn 1843, Frankel clashed with the radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim, who argued that the act of marriage in Judaism was a civic (\"memonot\") rather than sanctified () matter and could be subject to the Law of the Land. In December 1843 Frankel launched the magazine \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Religi\u00f6sen Interessen des Judenthums\". In the preamble, he attempted to present his approach to the present plight: \"The further development of Judaism cannot be done through Reform that would lead to total dissipation... But must be involved in its study... pursued via scientific research, on a \"positive, historical\" basis.\" The term \"Positive-Historical\" became associated with him and his middle way. The \"Zeitschrift\" was, along the convictions of its publisher, neither dogmatically orthodox nor overly polemic, wholly opposing Biblical criticism and arguing for the antiquity of custom and practice.\nIn 1844, Geiger and like-minded allies arranged a conference in Braunschweig that was to have enough authority (in 1826, Aaron Chorin called for the convocation of a new Sanhedrin) to debate and enact thoroughgoing revisions. Frankel was willing to agree only to a meeting without any practical results, and refused the invitation. When the protocols containing many radical statements were published, he denounced the assembly for \"applying the scalpel of criticism\" and favouring the spirit of the age over tradition. However, he later agreed to attend the second conference, held in Frankfurt am Main on 15 July 1845, despite warnings from Rapoport, who cautioned that compromising with Geiger was impossible. It would only damage his reputation among the traditionalists. On the 16th, the issue of Hebrew in the liturgy arose. Most present were inclined to retain it, but with more German segments. A slight majority adopted a resolution stating there were subjective, but no objective, imperatives to keep it as the language of service. Frankel then astounded his peers by vehemently protesting, saying it was a breach with the past and that Hebrew was of dire importance and great sentimental value. The others immediately began quoting all passages in rabbinic literature allowing prayer to be in the vernacular. Frankel could not contend with the halakhic validity of their decision, but he perceived it as a sign of profound differences between them. On the 17th, he formally withdrew, publishing a lambasting critique of the procedures. \"Opponents of the conference, who feared he went to the other side,\" noted historian Michael A. Meyer, \"now felt reassured of his loyalty\".\nThe rabbi of Saxony had many sympathizers, who supported a similarly moderate approach and change only based on the authority of the Talmud. When Geiger began preparing a third conference in Breslau, Hirsch B\u00e4r Fassel convinced Frankel to organize one of his own in protest. Frankel invited colleagues to an assembly in Dresden, which was to be held on 21 October 1846. He announced that one measure he was willing to countenance was the possible abolition of the second day of festivals, though only if a broad consensus would be reached and not before thorough deliberation. Attendants were to include Rapoport, Fassel, Adolf Jellinek, Leopold L\u00f6w, Michael Sachs, Abraham Kohn and others. However, the Dresden assembly soon drew heated Orthodox resistance, especially from Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, and was postponed indefinitely.\nIn 1854, Frankel was appointed chancellor in the new Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau, Germany's first modern rabbinical seminary. His opponents on both flanks were incensed. Geiger and the Reform camp accused him of theological ambiguity, hypocrisy, and attachment to stagnant remnants. They now protested the \"medieval\" atmosphere in the seminary, which was mainly concerned with teaching Jewish Law. The hardline Samson Raphael Hirsch, who fiercely opposed Wissenschaft des Judentums and emphasized the divine origin of the entire halakhic system in the theophany at Biblical Mount Sinai, was deeply suspicious of Frankel's beliefs, use of science and constant assertions that Jewish Law was flexible and evolving.\nThe final schism between Frankel and the Orthodox occurred after the 1859 publication of his \"Darke ha-Mishna\" \"Ways of the Mishna\". He praised the Chazal, presenting them as bold innovators, but did not affirm the divinity of the Oral Torah. On the ordinances classified as Law given to Moses at Sinai, he quoted Asher ben Jehiel that stated several of those were only apocryphally dubbed as such. He applied the latter's conclusion to all, noting they were \"so evident \"as if\" given at Sinai\". Hirsch branded Frankel a heretic, demanding that he announce whether he believed that both the Oral and Written Torah were of celestial origin. Rabbis Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, Solomon Klein and others published more complaisant tracts, but also requested an explanation. Rapoport marshaled to Frankel's aid, assuring that his words merely reiterated ben Jehiel's and that he would soon release a statement that would belie Hirsch's accusations. However, the Chancellor of Breslau issued an ambiguous defence, writing that his book was not concerned with theology and avoiding giving any clear answer. Rapoport now joined his critics.\nHirsch succeeded, severely tarnishing Frankel's reputation among most concerned. Hirsch and fellow Orthodox Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer launched a protracted public campaign through the 1860s. They ceaselessly stressed the chasm between an Orthodox understanding of \"Halakha\" as derived and revealed, applied differently to different circumstances and subject to human judgement and possibly error, yet unchanging and divine in principle\u2014as opposed to an evolutionary, historicist and non-dogmatic approach in which past authorities were not just elaborating but consciously innovating, as taught by Frankel. Hildesheimer often repeated that this issue utterly overshadowed any specific technical argument with the Breslau School (the students of which were usually more lenient on matters of headcovering for women, Chalav Yisrael and other issues). Hildesheimer was concerned that Jewish public opinion perceived no practical difference between them. However, he cared to distinguish the observant acolytes of Frankel from the Reform camp, he noted in his diary: \"How meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer.\" In 1863, when Breslau faculty member Heinrich Graetz published an article where he appeared to doubt the Messianic belief, Hildesheimer immediately seized upon the occasion to prove once more the dogmatic, rather than practical, divide. He denounced Graetz as a heretic.\nThe Positive-Historical School was influential, but never institutionalized itself as thoroughly as its opponents. Apart from the many graduates of Breslau, Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Adolf Jellinek and Rabbi Moritz G\u00fcdemann led the central congregation in Vienna along a similar path. In Jellinek's local seminary, Meir Friedmann and Isaac Hirsch Weiss followed Frankel's moderate approach to critical research. The rabbinate of the liberal Neolog public in Hungary, which formally separated from the Orthodox, was also permeated with the \"Breslau spirit\". Many of its members studied there, and its Jewish Theological Seminary of Budapest was modeled after it, though the assimilationist congregants cared little for rabbinic opinion. In Germany itself, Breslau alumni founded in 1868 a short-lived society, the J\u00fcdisch-Theologische Verein. It was dissolved within a year, boycotted by both Reform and Orthodox. Michael Sachs led the Berlin congregation in a very conservative style, eventually resigning when an organ was introduced in services. Manuel Jo\u00ebl, another of the Frankelist party, succeeded Geiger in Breslau. He maintained his predecessor's truncated German translation of the liturgy for the sake of compromise, but restored the complete Hebrew text.\nThe Breslau Seminary and the Reform Hochschule f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums maintained very different approaches. Still, on the communal level, the former's alumni failure to organize or articulate a coherent agenda, coupled with the declining prestige of Breslau and the conservatism of the Hochschule's alumni\u2014a necessity in heterogeneous communities which remained unified, especially after the Orthodox gained the right to secede in 1876\u2014imposed a relatively uniform and mild character on what was known in Germany as \"Liberal Judaism\". In 1909, 63 rabbis associated with the Breslau approach founded the Freie J\u00fcdische Vereinigung, another brief attempt at institutionalization that failed soon. Only in 1925 did the Religi\u00f6se Mittelpartei f\u00fcr Frieden und Einheit succeed in driving the same agenda. It won several seats in communal elections, but was small and of little influence.\nJewish Theological Seminary.\nJewish immigration to the United States bred an amalgam of loose communities, lacking strong tradition or stable structures. In this free-spirited environment, a multitude of forces was at work. As early as 1866, Rabbi Jonas Bondi of New York wrote that a Judaism of the \"golden middleway, which was termed Orthodox by the left and heterodox or reformer by the right\" developed in the new country. The rapid ascendancy of Reform Judaism by the 1880s left few who opposed it, merely a handful of congregations and ministers remained outside the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. These included Sabato Morais and Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes of the elitist Sephardi congregations, along with rabbis Bernard Drachman (ordained at Breslau, though he regarded himself as Orthodox) and Henry Schneeberger.\nWhile spearheaded by radical and principled Reformers like Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, the UAHC was also home to more conservative elements. President Isaac Meyer Wise, a pragmatist intent on compromise, hoped to forge a broad consensus that would turn a moderate version of Reform to dominant in America. He kept the dietary laws at home and attempted to assuage traditionalists. On 11 July 1883, apparently due to negligence by the Jewish caterer, non-kosher dishes were served to UAHC rabbis in Wise's presence. Known to posterity as the \"trefa banquet\", it purportedly made some guests abandon the hall in disgust, but little is factually known about the incident. In 1885, the traditionalist forces were bolstered upon the arrival of Rabbi Alexander Kohut, an adherent of Frankel. He publicly excoriated Reform for disdaining ritual and received forms, triggering a heated polemic with Kohler. The debate was one of the main factors which motivated the latter to compose the Pittsburgh Platform, which unambiguously declared the principles of Reform Judaism: \"to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives.\"\nThe explicit wording alienated a handful of conservative UAHC ministers: Henry Hochheimer, Frederick de Sola Mendes, Aaron Wise, Marcus Jastrow, and Benjamin Szold. They joined Kohut, Morais and the others in seeking to establish a traditional rabbinic seminary that would serve as a counterweight to Hebrew Union College. In 1886, they founded the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City. Kohut, professor of Talmud who held to the Positive-Historical ideal, was the main educational influence in the early years, prominent among the founders who encompassed the entire spectrum from progressive Orthodox to the brink of Reform; to describe what the seminary intended to espouse, he used the term \"Conservative Judaism\", which had no independent meaning at the time and was only in relation to Reform. In 1898, Pereira Mendes, Schneeberger and Drachman also founded the Orthodox Union, which maintained close ties with the seminary.\nThe JTS was a small, fledgling institution with financial difficulties, and was ordaining merely a rabbi per year. But soon after Chancellor Morais' death in 1897, its fortunes turned. Since 1881, a wave of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe was inundating the country\u2014by 1920, 2.5 million of them had arrived, increasing American Jewry tenfold. They came from regions where civil equality or emancipation were never granted, while acculturation and modernization made little headway. Whether devout or irreligious, they mostly retained strong traditional sentiments in matters of faith, accustomed to old-style rabbinate; the hardline Agudas HaRabbanim, founded by emigrant clergy, opposed secular education or vernacular sermons, and its members spoke almost only Yiddish. The Eastern Europeans were alienated by the local Jews, who were all assimilated in comparison, and especially aghast by the mores of Reform. The need to find a religious framework that would both accommodate and Americanize them motivated Jacob Schiff and other rich philanthropists, all Reform and of German descent, to donate $500,000 to the JTS. The contribution was solicited by Professor Cyrus Adler. It was conditioned on the appointment of Solomon Schechter as Chancellor. In 1901, the Rabbinical Assembly was established as the fraternity of JTS alumni.\nSchechter arrived in 1902, and at once reorganized the faculty, dismissing both Pereira Mendes and Drachman for lack of academic merit. Under his aegis, the institute began to draw famous scholars, becoming a center of learning on par with HUC. Schechter was both traditional in sentiment and quite unorthodox in conviction. He maintained that theology was of little importance and it was practice that must be preserved. He aspired to solicit unity in American Judaism, denouncing sectarianism and not perceiving himself as leading a new denomination: \"not to create a new party, but to consolidate an old one\". The need to raise funds convinced him that a congregational arm for the Rabbinical Assembly and the JTS was required. On 23 February 1913, he founded the United Synagogue of America (since 1991: United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), which then consisted of 22 communities. He and Mendes first came to major disagreement; Schechter insisted that any alumnus could be appointed to the USoA's managerial board, and not just to serve as communal rabbi, including several the latter did not consider sufficiently devout, or who tolerated mixed seating in their synagogues (though some of those he still regarded as Orthodox). Mendes, president of the Orthodox Union, therefore refused to join. He began to distinguish between the \"Modern Orthodoxy\" of himself and his peers in the OU, and \"Conservatives\" who tolerated what was beyond the pale for him. However, this first sign of institutionalization and separation was far from conclusive. Mendes himself could not clearly differentiate between the two groups, and many he viewed as Orthodox were members of the USoA. The epithets \"Conservative\" and \"Orthodox\" remained interchangeable for decades to come. JTS graduates served in OU congregations; many students of the Orthodox Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and members of the OU's Rabbinical Council of America, or RCA, attended it. In 1926, RIETS and the JTS even negotiated a possible merger, though it was never materialized. Upon Schechter's death in 1915, the first generation of his disciples kept his non-sectarian legacy of striving for a united, traditional American Judaism. He was replaced by Cyrus Adler.\nThe USoA grew rapidly as the Eastern European immigrant population slowly integrated. In 1923 it already had 150 affiliated communities, and 229 before 1930. Synagogues offered a more modernized ritual: English sermons, choir singing, late Friday evening services which tacitly acknowledging that most had to work until after the Sabbath began, and often mixed-gender seating. Men and women sat separately with no partition, and some houses of prayer already introduced family pews. Motivated by popular pressure and frowned upon by both RA and seminary faculty\u2014in its own synagogue, the institute maintained a partition until 1983\u2014this was becoming common among the OU as well. As both social conditions and apathy turned American Jews away from tradition (barely 20 per cent were attending prayers weekly), a young professor named Mordecai Kaplan promoted the idea of transforming the synagogue into a community center, a \"Shul with a Pool\", a policy which indeed stymied the tide somewhat.\nIn 1927, the RA also established its own Committee of Jewish Law, entrusted with determining \"halakhic\" issues. Consisting of seven members, it was chaired by the traditionalist Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, who already distinguished himself in 1922, drafting a responsa that allowed the use of grape juice rather than fermented wine for \"Kiddush\" on the background of Prohibition. Kaplan himself, who rose to become an influential and popular figure within the JTS, concluded that his fellow rabbis' ambiguity in matters of belief and the contradiction between full observance and critical study were untenable and hypocritical. He formulated his own approach of Judaism as a Civilization, rejecting the concept of Revelation and any supernatural belief in favour of a cultural-ethnic perception. While valuing received mores, he eventually suggested giving the past \"a vote, not a veto\". Though popular among students, Kaplan's nascent Reconstructionism was opposed by the new traditionalist Chancellor Louis Finkelstein, appointed in 1940, and a large majority among the faculty.\nTensions within the JTS and RA grew. The Committee of Jewish Law consisted mainly of scholars who had little field experience, almost solely from the seminary's Talmudic department. They were greatly concerned with \"halakhic\" licitness and indifferent to the pressures exerted on the pulpit rabbis, who had to contend with an Americanized public which cared little for such considerations or for tradition in general. In 1935, the RA almost adopted a groundbreaking motion: Rabbi Louis Epstein offered a solution to the agunah predicament, a clause that would have had husbands appoint wives as their proxies to issue divorce. It was repealed under pressure from the Orthodox Union. As late as 1947, CJL Chair Rabbi Boaz Cohen, himself a historicist who argued that the Law evolved much through time, rebuked pulpit clergy who requested lenient or radical rulings, stating he and his peers were content to \"progress in inches... Free setting up of new premises and the introduction of novel categories of ritual upon the basis of pure reason and thinking would be perilous, if not fatal, to the principles and continuity of Jewish Law.\"\nA third movement.\nThe boundaries between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in America were institutionalized only in the aftermath of World War II. The 1940s saw the younger generation of JTS graduates less patient with the prudence of the CJL and Talmud faculty in face of popular demand. Kaplan's Reconstructionism, while its fully committed partisans were few, had much influence. The majority among recent alumni eschewed the epithet \"Orthodox\" and tended to employ \"Conservative\" exclusively. Succeeding Schechter's direct disciples who headed the RA, JTS and United Synagogue in the interwar period, a new strata of activist leaders was rising. Rabbi Robert Gordis, RA president in 1944\u20131946, represented the junior members in advocating more flexibility; Rabbi Jacob Agus, a RIETS graduate who joined the body only in 1945, clamored that \"we need a law making body, not a law interpreting committee.\" Agus argued that the breach between the Jewish public and tradition was too wide to be bridged conventionally, and that the RA would always remain inferior to the Orthodox as long as it retained its policy of merely adopting lenient precedents in rabbinic literature. He offered to extensively apply the tool of \"takkanah\", rabbinic ordinance.\nIn 1946, a committee chaired by Gordis issued the \"Sabbath and Festival Prayerbook\", the first clearly Conservative liturgy: references to the sacrificial cult were in the past tense instead of a petition for restoration, and it rephrased blessings such as \"who hast made me according to thy will\" for women to \"who hast made me a woman\". During the movement's national conference in Chicago, held 13\u201317 May 1948, the pulpit rabbis in the RA gained the upper hand. Spurred by Gordis, Agus and fellow leaders, they voted to reorganize the CJL into a Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, enfranchised to issue \"takkanot\" by a majority. Membership was conditioned on having experience as a congregational rabbi, and unseasoned JTS faculty were thus denied entrance. While the RA was asserting a Conservative distinctive identity, the seminary remained more cautious. Finkelstein opposed sectarianism and preferred the neutral epithet \"traditional\", later commenting that \"Conservative Judaism is a gimmick to get Jews back to real Judaism\". He and the very right-wing Talmud professor Saul Lieberman, who maintained ties with the Orthodox while also viewing them as obstructionist and ossified, dominated the JTS, providing a counterweight to the liberals in the Assembly. Kaplan, meanwhile, spent more time on consolidating his Society for Advancement of Judaism. Abraham Joshua Heschel, who espoused a mysticist understanding of Jewish religion, also became an important figure among the faculty.\nThe CJLS now proceeded to demonstrate its independence. Sabbath was widely desecrated by a large majority of Jews, and the board believed attendance at synagogues should be encouraged. They therefore enacted an ordinance that allowed driving on the Sabbath (for worship alone) and the use of electricity. The driving responsum was later severely criticized by Conservative rabbis, and was charged with imparting that the movement was overly keen to condone the laxity of congregants. It also signified the final break with the Orthodox, who were themselves being bolstered by more strictly observant immigrants from Europe. In 1954, the RCA reversed its 1948 ruling that allowed the use of microphones on Sabbath and festivals and declared that praying without a partition between sexes was banned. Though enforced slowly\u2014in 1997, there were still seven OU congregations with no physical barrier, and so-called \"Conservadox\" remain extant\u2014these two attributes became a demarcation line between Orthodox and Conservative synagogues. RA converts were denied ablution in Orthodox ritual baths, and rabbis from one movement would gradually cease serving in the other's communities.\nRather than a force within American Judaism, the JTS-centered movement emerged as a third movement. The historicist and critical approach to \"halakha\", as well as other features, were emphasized by leaders eager to demonstrate their uniqueness. In their efforts to solidify a coherent identity, Conservative thinkers like Mordecai Waxman in his 1957 \"Tradition and Change\", ventured beyond Schechter's conceptions to Rabbi Zecharias Frankel and Breslau, presenting themselves as its direct inheritors via Alexander Kohut and others. The CJLS continued to issue groundbreaking ordinances and rulings.\nThe postwar decades were a time of immense growth for the Conservative movement. Most of the 500,000 decommissioned Jewish GIs left the densely populated immigrant neighbourhoods of the East Coast, moving to suburbia. They were Americanized but still retained traditional sentiments, and Reform Judaism was too radical for most. The United Synagogue of America offered Jewish education for children and a familiar religious environment which was also comfortable and not strict. It expanded from 350 communities by 1945 to 832 by 1971, becoming the largest denomination, with some 350,000 dues-paying member households (1.5 million people) at synagogues and over 40 per cent of American Jewry identifying with it in polls, adding an estimated million more non-registered supporters.\nAlready in a 1955 study, Marshall Sklare defined Conservative Judaism as the quintessential American Jewish movement, but stressed the gap between laity and clergy, noting \"rabbis now recognize that they are not making decisions or writing responsa, but merely taking a poll of their membership.\" Most congregants, commented Edward S. Shapiro, were \"Conservative Jews because their rabbi kept kosher and the Sabbath... Not because of their religious behavior.\" The movement established its presence outside the U.S. and Canada: In 1962, the young Rabbi Marshall Meyer founded the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires, which would serve as the basis for Conservative expansion in South America. In 1979, four communities formed the Israel Masorti Movement. Rabbi Louis Jacobs, dismissed in 1964 from the British Orthodox rabbinate on the charge of heresy after espousing a non-literal understanding of the Torah, joined with the Conservatives and founded his country's first Masorti community. The new branches were all united within the World Council of Synagogues, later to be named Masorti Olami.\nThe movement peaked in numbers in the 1970s. During that decade, the tensions between the various elements within it intensified. The right wing, conservative in \"halakhic\" matters and often adhering to a verbal understanding of revelation, was dismayed by the failure to bolster observance among the laity and the resurgence of Orthodoxy. The left was influenced by the Reconstructionists, who formed their own seminary in 1968 and were slowly coalescing, as well as the growing appeal of Reform, which turned more traditional and threatened to sway congregants. While the rightists opposed further modifications, their left-wing peers demanded them. The Chavurah movement, consisting of nonaligned prayer quorums of young (and frequently, Conservative-raised) worshipers who sought a more intense religious experience, also weakened congregations. In 1972, the liberal wing gained an influential position with the appointment of Gerson D. Cohen as JTS Chancellor. During the same year, after Reform began to ordain female rabbis, a strong lobby rose to advocate the same. The CJLS rapidly enacted an ordinance which allowed women to be tallied for a \"minyan\", and by 1976 the percentage of synagogues allowing them to bless during the reading of the Torah grew from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. In 1979, ignoring the denominational leadership, Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County accepted the RRC-ordained Rabbi Linda Joy Holtzman. Pressures to allow women to assume rabbinical positions was mounting from the congregational level, though the RA agreed to delay any action until the JTS scholars would concur.\nFemale ordination was a matter of great friction until 1983, when Rabbi Joel Roth devised a solution that entailed women voluntarily accepting the obligation to pray regularly. The leadership passed it not by scholarly consensus but via a popular vote of all JTS faculty, including non-specialists. Two years later, the first JTS-ordained female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, was admitted into the RA. David Weiss Halivni, professor of the Talmud faculty, claimed that Roth's method must have required waiting until a considerable number of women did prove sufficient commitment. He and his sympathizers regarded the vote as belying any claim to \"halakhic\" integrity. They formed the Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism in 1985, a right-wing lobby which numbered some 10,000 supporters from the Conservative observant elite. The UTJC withdrew from the movement and erased the word \"Conservative\" in 1990, attempting to merge with moderate Orthodox organizations.\nIn the very same year, the Reconstructionist also seceded fully, joining the World Union for Progressive Judaism under observer status. The double defection narrowed the movement's spectrum of opinions, at a time when large swaths of congregants were abandoning in favour of Reform, which was more tolerant of intermarriage. RA leaders were engaged in introspection through the later 1980s, resulting in the 1988 \"Emet ve-Emunah\" platform, while Reform slowly bypassed them and became the largest American Jewish movement.\nAfter the issue of egalitarianism for women subsided, LGBT acceptance replaced it as the main source of contention between the declining right wing and the liberal majority. A first attempt was rebuffed in 1992 by a harsh responsum written by Roth. The retirement of Chancellor Ismar Schorsch, a staunch opponent, allowed the CJLS to endorse a motion which still banned anal intercourse but not any other physical contact, and allowed the ordination of openly LGBT rabbis, in 2006. Roth and three other supporters resigned from the panel in protest, claiming the responsum was not valid; Masorti affiliates in South America, Israel and Hungary objected severely. The Seminario is yet to accept the resolution, while several Canadian congregations seceded from the United Synagogue in 2008 to form an independent union in protest of the slide to the left. Since the 2013 Pew survey, which assessed that only 18 per cent of American Jews identify with it, Conservative leadership is engaged in attempting to solve Conservative Judaism's demographic crisis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was part of the UNIX 98 Workstation Product Standard, and was for a long time the Unix desktop associated with commercial Unix workstations. It helped to influence early implementations of successor projects such as KDE and GNOME, which largely replaced CDE following the turn of the century.\nAfter a long history as proprietary software, CDE was released as free software on August 6, 2012, under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.0 or later. Since its release as free software, CDE has been ported to Linux and BSD derivatives.\nHistory.\nHewlett-Packard, IBM, SunSoft, and USL announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. Each development group contributed its own technology to CDE:\nAfter its release, HP endorsed CDE as the new standard desktop for Unix, and provided documentation and software for migrating HP VUE customizations to CDE.\nIn March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the \"new OSF\", a merger of the Open Software Foundation and Unix International;\nin September 1995, the merger of Motif and CDE into a single project, CDE/Motif, was announced. OSF became part of the newly formed Open Group in 1996.\nIn February 1997, the Open Group released their last major version of CDE, version 2.1.\nRed Hat Linux was the only Linux distribution that proprietary CDE was ported to. In 1997, Red Hat began offering a version of CDE licensed from TriTeal Corporation. In 1998, Xi Graphics, a company specializing in the X Windowing System, offered a version of CDE bundled with Red Hat Linux, called \"Xi Graphics maXimum cde/OS\". These were phased out, and Red Hat moved to the GNOME desktop.\nUntil about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the \"de facto\" standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as GNOME and K Desktop Environment 2 were quickly becoming mature, and became widespread on Linux systems.\nIn 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard desktop environment in Solaris in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based Java Desktop System. The OpenSolaris project, begun around the same time, did not include CDE, and had no intent to make Solaris CDE available as open-source. The original release of Solaris 11 in November 2011 only contained GNOME as standard desktop, though some CDE libraries, such as Motif and ToolTalk, remained for binary compatibility but Oracle Solaris 11.4, released in August 2018, removed support for the CDE runtime environment and background services.\nLicense history.\nFrom its launch until 2012, CDE was proprietary software.\nMotif, the toolkit on which CDE is built, was released by The Open Group in 2000 as \"Open Motif,\" under a \"revenue sharing\" license. That license did not meet either the open source or free software definitions. The Open Group had wished to make Motif open source, but did not succeed doing so at that time.\nRelease under the GNU LGPL.\nIn 2006, a petition was created asking The Open Group to release the source code for CDE and Motif under a free license. On August 6, 2012, CDE was released under the LGPL-2.0-or-later license. The CDE source code was then released to SourceForge.\nThe free software project OpenCDE had been started in 2010 to reproduce the look and feel, organization, and feature set of CDE. In August 2012, when CDE was released as free software, OpenCDE was officially deprecated in favor of CDE.\nOn October 23, 2012, the Motif widget toolkit was also released under the LGPL-2.1-or-later license. This allowed CDE to become a completely free and open source desktop environment.\nShortly after CDE was released as free software, a Linux live CD was created based on Debian 6 with CDE 2.2.0c pre-installed, called CDEbian. The live CD has since been discontinued.\nThe Debian-based Linux distribution SparkyLinux offers binary packages of CDE that can be installed with APT. As of March 2023, CDE is also included in the NuTyX GNU/Linux distribution which offers an ISO download image with it, in FreeBSD and in source form in pkgsrc which is the default package manager of NetBSD.\nDevelopment under CDE project.\nIn March 2014, the first stable release of CDE, version 2.2.1, was made since its release as free software.\nBeginning with version 2.2.2, released in July 2014, CDE is able to compile under FreeBSD 10 with the default Clang compiler.\nSince version 2.3.0, released in July 2018, CDE uses TIRPC on Linux, so that the portmapper rpcbind does not need to be run in insecure mode. It does not use Xprint anymore, and can be compiled on the BSDs without installing first a custom version of Motif.

Originally serialized in \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\" in 1976, it was the last \"Dune\" novel to be serialized before book publication.\nAt the end of \"Dune Messiah\", Paul Atreides walks into the desert, a blind man, leaving his sister Alia to rule the universe as regent for his twin children, Leto II and Ghanima. Awakened in the womb by the spice, the children are the heirs to Paul's prescient vision of the fate of the universe, a role that Alia desperately craves. House Corrino schemes to return to the throne, while the Bene Gesserit make common cause with the Tleilaxu and Spacing Guild to gain control of the spice and Paul's children.\nInitially selling over 75,000 copies, it became the first hardcover best-seller in science fiction. The novel was critically well-received for its plot, action, and atmosphere and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1977. \"Dune Messiah\" (1969) and \"Children of Dune\" were collectively adapted by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003 into a miniseries titled \"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune\".\nPlot.\nNine years after Emperor Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides walked into the desert, the ecological transformation of Dune has reached the point where some Fremen are living without stillsuits in the less arid climate and have started to move out of the sietches and into villages and cities. As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the planet of Muad'Dib. The imperial high council has lost its political might and is powerless to control the jihad.\nPaul's young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that their aunt and guardian Alia has succumbed to Abomination\u2014possession by her grandfather Baron Vladimir Harkonnen\u2014and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the terraforming of Dune will kill all the sandworms, thus destroying the source of the spice, but the Baron desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his father, he will become trapped by his prescience.\nMeanwhile, a new religious figure called \"The Preacher\" has risen in the desert, rallying against the religious government's injustices and the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides. Princess Wensicia of the fallen House Corrino on Salusa Secundus plots to assassinate the twins and regain power for her House.\nLady Jessica returns to Arrakis and recognizes that her daughter is possessed, but finds no signs of Abomination in the twins. Leto arranges for Fremen leader Stilgar to protect Ghanima if there is an attempt on their lives. The Preacher journeys to Salusa Secundus to meet Wensicia's son Farad'n, and in return pledges the Duncan Idaho ghola as an agent of House Corrino. Alia attempts to assassinate Jessica, who escapes into the desert with Duncan's help, precipitating a rebellion among the Fremen. The twins anticipate and survive the Corrino assassination plot, faking Leto's death.\nLeto leaves to seek out Jacurutu, a mythical Fremen sietch and possible holdout of the Preacher, while Ghanima, changing her memory with self-hypnosis, reports (and believes) that her brother has been murdered. Duncan and Jessica flee to Salusa Secundus, where Jessica begins to mentor Farad'n in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. He sidelines and publicly denounces his regent mother Wensicia over the assassination attempt, and allies with the Bene Gesserit, who promise to marry him to Ghanima and support his bid to become Emperor.\nA band of Fremen outlaws capture Leto and force him to undergo the spice trance at the suggestion of Gurney Halleck, who has infiltrated the group on Jessica's orders. Leto's spice-induced visions show him a myriad of possible futures where humanity becomes extinct and only one where it survives. He names this future \"The Golden Path\" and resolves to bring it to fruition\u2014something that his father, who had already glimpsed this future, refused to do. He escapes his captors and sacrifices his humanity in pursuit of the Golden Path by physically fusing with a school of sandtrout, the larval form of sandworms, in the process gaining superhuman strength and near-invulnerability. He travels across the desert destroying qanats to slow down the ecological transformation of Dune, and eventually confronts the Preacher, who is indeed Paul.\nDuncan returns to Arrakis and provokes Stilgar into killing him so that Stilgar is forced to take Ghanima and go into hiding. Eventually though, Alia recaptures Ghanima and arranges her marriage to Farad'n, planning to exploit the expected chaos when Ghanima kills him to avenge her brother's murder. Paul and Leto return to the capital, where Jessica and Farad'n have arrived for his betrothal to Ghanima, to confront Alia. Upon arriving, Paul is publicly murdered by agents of Alia's government, to her horror. Leto reveals himself in a display of superhuman strength and triggers the return of Ghanima's genuine memories. He confronts Alia and offers to help her overcome her possession, but the Baron resists. Alia, while fighting the Baron's possession, manages to throw herself off a high balcony, killing both herself and the Baron.\nLeto declares himself Emperor and asserts control over the Fremen. Farad'n enlists in his service and delivers control of the Corrino armies and his Sardaukar. In describing the Golden Path to Farad'n, Leto reveals that he will live for thousands of years due to the sandworm skin and genetics he is encased in. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but because his sandworm skin destroyed his ability to reproduce, he allows Farad'n to be her true consort so the Atreides line can continue. Ghanima reflects that one twin had to follow the Path, but Leto was always the strongest.\nPublication history.\nParts of \"Dune Messiah\" and \"Children of Dune\" were written before \"Dune\" was completed. \"Children of Dune\" was originally serialized in \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\" in 1976, and was the last \"Dune\" novel to be serialized before book publication. \"Dune Messiah\" and \"Children of Dune\" were published in one volume by the Science Fiction Book Club in 2002.\nAnalysis.\nHerbert likened the initial trilogy of novels (\"Dune\", \"Dune Messiah\", and \"Children of Dune\") to a fugue \u2013 \"Dune\" was a heroic melody, \"Dune Messiah\" was its inversion, while \"Children of Dune\" expands the number of interplaying themes. Paul rises to power in \"Dune\" by seizing control of the single critical resource in the universe, melange. His enemies are dead or overthrown, and he is set to take the reins of power and bring a hard but enlightened peace to the universe. Herbert chose in the books that followed to undermine Paul's triumph with a string of failures and philosophical paradoxes.\nCritical reception.\nInitially selling over 75,000 copies, \"Children of Dune\" became the first hardcover best-seller in the science fiction field. The novel was critically well-received for its gripping plot, action, and atmosphere, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1977.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called \"Children of Dune\" \"a major event\", and \"Challenging Destiny\" noted that \"Herbert adds enough new twists and turns to the ongoing saga that familiarity with the recurring elements brings pleasure.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote, \"Ranging from palace intrigue and desert chases to religious speculation and confrontations with the supreme intelligence of the universe, there is something here for all science fiction fans.\" In a 1976 review, Spider Robinson found \"Children of Dune\" unsatisfying, faulting the ending as unconvincing and thematically overfamiliar. The novel is referred to in \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980) by Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari. David Pringle gave the novel a rating of two stars out of four and described the novel as \"dark and convoluted stuff.\"\nAdaptation.\n\"Dune Messiah\" (1969) and \"Children of Dune\" were collectively adapted by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003 into a miniseries titled \"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune\". The three-part, six-hour miniseries covers the bulk of the plot of \"Dune Messiah\" in the first installment, and adapts \"Children of Dune\" in the second and third parts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6629", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6629", "title": "Candide", "text": "1759 satirical novella by Voltaire\n' ( , ) is a French satire written by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment, first published in 1759. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: Optimism\"\"' (1947). A young man, Candide, lives a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise, being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. This lifestyle is abruptly ended, followed by Candide's slow and painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes \"Candide\" with, if not rejecting Leibnizian optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, \"we must cultivate our garden\", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, \"all is for the best\" in the \"best of all possible worlds\".\n\"Candide\" is characterized by its tone as well as its erratic, fantastical, and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story akin to a serious bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clich\u00e9s, in a tone that is bitter and matter-of-fact. The events discussed are often based on historical happenings. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so does Candide, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers. Through \"Candide\", he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.\n\"Candide\" has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned on the grounds of blasphemy and sedition. However, the novel has inspired many later authors and artists; today, \"Candide\" is considered Voltaire's \"magnum opus\" and is often listed as part of the Western canon. It is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. Martin Seymour-Smith listed \"Candide\" as one of the 100 most influential books ever written.\nHistorical and literary background.\nSeveral historical events inspired Voltaire to write \"Candide\", most notably the publication of Leibniz's \"Monadology\", the Seven Years' War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in \"Candide\". The earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints' Day had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. It had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, which insisted on God's benevolence in spite of such events. This concept is often put in the form, \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\" (). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into their optimistic world view.\nVoltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster, convinced that if this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both \"Candide\" and (\"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster\"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters \"in the best of all possible worlds\". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and \"Candide\", has analyzed which sources Voltaire might have referenced, speculating that Voltaire's primary source was the 1755 work by Ange Goudar.\nApart from such events, contemporaneous stereotypes of the German personality may have been a source of inspiration for the text, as they were for , a 1669 satirical picaresque novel written by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen and inspired by the Thirty Years' War. The protagonist of this novel, supposed to embody stereotypically German characteristics, is quite similar to the protagonist of \"Candide\". These stereotypes, according to Voltaire biographer Alfred Owen Aldridge, include \"extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity\", two of Candide's and Simplicius's defining qualities. Aldridge writes, \"Since Voltaire admitted familiarity with fifteenth-century German authors who used a bold and buffoonish style, it is quite possible that he knew as well.\"\nA satirical and parodic precursor of \"Candide\", Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1726) is one of \"Candide\"'s closest literary relatives. This satire tells the story of \"a gullible ingenue\", Gulliver, who (like Candide) travels to several \"remote nations\" and is hardened by the many misfortunes which befall him. As evidenced by similarities between the two books, Voltaire probably drew upon \"Gulliver's Travels\" for inspiration while writing \"Candide\". Other probable sources of inspiration for \"Candide\" are (1699) by Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon and (1753) by Louis-Charles Fougeret de Monbron. \"Candide\"'s parody of the bildungsroman is probably based on , which includes the prototypical parody of the tutor on whom Pangloss may have been partly based. Likewise, Monbron's protagonist undergoes a disillusioning series of travels similar to those of Candide.\nCreation.\nBy the time of the Lisbon earthquake, Voltaire was already a well-established author. \"Candide\" became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political, and artistic works expressing these views. It became a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the \"contes philosophiques\". This genre included previous works of his such as \"Zadig\" and \"Micromegas\".\nIt is unknown exactly when Voltaire wrote \"Candide.\" Scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire is believed to have written a portion of it while living at Les D\u00e9lices near Geneva and also while visiting Charles Th\u00e9odore, the Elector-Palatinate, at Schwetzingen for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that he wrote \"Candide\" in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work by Lucien Pereyand Gaston Maugras.\nThere is only one extant manuscript of \"Candide\" that was written before the work's 1759 publication, discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the \"La Valli\u00e8re Manuscript\". It is believed to have been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Valli\u00e8re in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The \"La Valli\u00e8re Manuscript\", the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of \"Candide\", was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagni\u00e8re, then edited directly. In addition to this manuscript, there is believed to have been another one, copied by Wagni\u00e8re for the Elector Charles-Th\u00e9odore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.\nVoltaire published \"Candide\" simultaneously in five countries no later than 15 January 1759, although the exact date is uncertain. Seventeen versions of \"Candide\" from 1759, in the original French, are known today, and there has been great controversy over which is the earliest. More versions were published in other languages: \"Candide\" was translated once into Italian and thrice into English that same year. The complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of \"Candide\" is described at length in Wade's article \"The First Edition of \"Candide\": A Problem of Identification\". The publication process was extremely secretive, probably the \"most clandestine work of the century\", because of the book's obviously illicit and irreverent content. The greatest number of copies of \"Candide\" were published concurrently in Geneva by Cramer, in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey, in London by Jean Nourse, and in Paris by Lambert.\n\"Candide\" underwent one major revision after its initial publication, in addition to some minor ones. In 1761, a version of \"Candide\" was published that included, along with several minor changes, a major addition by Voltaire to the twenty-second chapter, a section that had been thought weak by the Duke of Valli\u00e8re. The English title of this edition was \"Candide, or Optimism, Translated from the German of Dr. Ralph. With the additions found in the Doctor's pocket when he died at Minden, in the Year of Grace 1759.\" The last edition of \"Candide\" authorised by Voltaire was the one included in Cramer's 1775 edition of his complete works, known as , in reference to the border or frame around each page.\nVoltaire strongly opposed the inclusion of illustrations in his works, as he stated in a 1778 letter to the writer and publisher Charles Joseph Panckoucke:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Je crois que des Estampes seraient fort inutiles. Ces colifichets n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 admis dans les \u00e9ditions de Cic\u00e9ron, de Virgile et d'Horace.\" (I believe that these illustrations would be quite useless. These baubles have never been allowed in the works of Cicero, Virgil and Horace.)\nDespite this protest, two sets of illustrations for \"Candide\" were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, \"Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes de Voltaire\". Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading \"Candide\" that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.\nSynopsis.\n\"Candide\" contains thirty episodic chapters, which may be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, the first half of \"Candide\" constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I\u2013X are set in Europe, XI\u2013XX are set in the Americas, and XXI\u2013XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.\nChapters I\u2013X.\nThe tale of \"Candide\" begins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh in Westphalia, home to the Baron's daughter, Lady Cun\u00e9gonde; his bastard nephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; a chambermaid, Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. The protagonist, Candide, is romantically attracted to Cun\u00e9gonde. He is a young man of \"the most unaffected simplicity\" (), whose face is \"the true index of his mind\" (). Dr. Pangloss, professor of \"\" (English: \"metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology\") and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the \"best of all possible worlds\" and that \"all is for the best\".\nAll is well in the castle until Cun\u00e9gonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cun\u00e9gonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured by Bulgar (Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is flogged, nearly executed, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (an allegory representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, an Anabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar with syphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, that Cun\u00e9gonde and her whole family were killed, and that Cun\u00e9gonde was raped before her death. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail to Lisbon.\nIn Lisbon's harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard. The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the \"brutish sailor\" who let Jacques drown survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit by an earthquake, tsunami, and fire that kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.\nThe next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of the Portuguese Inquisition, and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an \" set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman, who leads him to a house where Lady Cun\u00e9gonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cun\u00e9gonde had been raped and disemboweled. She had been, but Cun\u00e9gonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, who was then threatened by a corrupt Grand Inquisitor into sharing her (Don Issachar gets Cun\u00e9gonde on Mondays, Wednesdays, and the sabbath day). Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas. Along the way, Cun\u00e9gonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her.\nChapters XI\u2013XX.\nThe old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life: born the daughter of Pope Urban X and the Princess of Palestrina, she was kidnapped and enslaved by Barbary pirates, witnessed violent civil wars in Morocco under the bloodthirsty king Moulay Isma\u00efl (during which her mother was drawn and quartered), suffered constant hunger, nearly died from a plague in Algiers, and had a buttock cut off to feed starving Janissaries during the Russian capture of Azov. After traversing all the Russian Empire, she eventually became a servant of Don Issachar and met Cun\u00e9gonde.\nThe trio arrives in Buenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cun\u00e9gonde. Just then, an \"alcalde\" (a Spanish magistrate) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees to Paraguay with his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.\nAt a border post on the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant, who turns out to be Cun\u00e9gonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, the Jesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cun\u00e9gonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.\nCacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, or Orejones; members of the Inca nobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.\nAfter a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a geographically isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cun\u00e9gonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.\nCandide and Cacambo eventually reach Suriname where they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cun\u00e9gonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.\nChapters XXI\u2013XXX.\nThis companion, Martin, is a Manichaean scholar based on the real-life pessimist Pierre Bayle, who was a chief opponent of Leibniz. For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour to Bordeaux and Paris, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based on Admiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time \"pour encourager les autres\" (to encourage the others). Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival in Venice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with a Theatine monk, Brother Girofl\u00e9e. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object since she was forced to become a prostitute, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousand piastres to Paquette and one thousand to Brother Girofl\u00e9e.\nCandide and Martin visit the Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian. That evening, Cacambo\u2014now a slave\u2014arrives and informs Candide that Cun\u00e9gonde is in Constantinople. Prior to their departure, Candide and Martin dine with six strangers who had come for the Carnival of Venice. These strangers are revealed to be dethroned kings: the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III, Emperor Ivan VI of Russia, Charles Edward Stuart (an unsuccessful pretender to the English throne), Augustus III of Poland (deprived, at the time of writing, of his reign in the Electorate of Saxony due to the Seven Years' War), Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, and Theodore of Corsica.\nOn the way to Constantinople, Cacambo reveals that Cun\u00e9gonde\u2014now horribly ugly\u2014currently washes dishes on the banks of the Propontis as a slave for a fugitive Transylvanian prince by the name of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. After arriving at the Bosphorus, they board a galley where, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cun\u00e9gonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. They both relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: \"I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony is the most beautiful thing in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter.\"\nCandide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo arrive at the banks of the Propontis, where they rejoin Cun\u00e9gonde and the old woman. Cun\u00e9gonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cun\u00e9gonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cun\u00e9gonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Girofl\u00e9e\u2014having squandered their three thousand piastres\u2014are reconciled with Candide on a small farm () which he just bought with the last of his finances.\nOne day, the protagonists seek out a dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Candide asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Candide is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them \"free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty\". Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cun\u00e9gonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Girofl\u00e9e all set to work on this \"commendable plan\" () on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him \"we must cultivate our garden\" ().\nStyle.\nAs Voltaire himself described it, the purpose of \"Candide\" was to \"bring amusement to a small number of men of wit\". The author achieves this goal by combining wit with a parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death \"as coolly as a weather report\". The fast-paced and improbable plot\u2014in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance\u2014allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again. In the end, \"Candide\" is primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, \"short, light, rapid and humorous\".\nBehind the playful fa\u00e7ade of \"Candide\" which has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their Inquisition, and the British for the execution of John Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in \"Candide\". For example, Voltaire mocks the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in Paraguay, Cacambo remarks, \"[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all\u00a0...\". Here, Voltaire suggests the Christian mission in Paraguay is taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.\nSatire.\nThe main method of \"Candide\"'s satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world\u2014it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus \"Candide\" derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.\nA simple example of the satire of \"Candide\" is seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by Candide and Martin in Portsmouth harbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to represent John Byng, being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely \"to encourage the others\" (, an expression Voltaire is credited with originating). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng's death. The dry, pithy explanation \"to encourage the others\" thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted from \"Candide\".\nVoltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of \"Candide\" is a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of El Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cun\u00e9gonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation.\nAnother element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works on \"Candide\", calls the \"sentimental foibles of the age\" and Voltaire's attack on them. Flaws in European culture are highlighted as \"Candide\" parodies adventure and romance clich\u00e9s, mimicking the style of a picaresque novel. A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide is supposed to be the drifting rogue of low social class, Cun\u00e9gonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor, and Cacambo the skillful valet. As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cun\u00e9gonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters of \"Candide\" are unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and even marionette-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical. As the initially na\u00efve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion\u2014however noncommittal\u2014the novella is a \"bildungsroman\", if not a very serious one.\nGarden motif.\nGardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role in \"Candide\". The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cun\u00e9gonde are evicted much in the same fashion as Adam and Eve are evicted from the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis. Cyclically, the main characters of \"Candide\" conclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent \"garden\" is El Dorado, which may be a false Eden. Other possibly symbolic gardens include the Jesuit pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.\nThese gardens are probably references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\", and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate \"his garden\" symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the : the main characters of \"Candide\" live in seclusion to \"cultivate [their] garden\", just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in the epistolary correspondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the . Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating \"his garden\" suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates in Les D\u00e9lices and Ferney, and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.\nPhilosophy.\nOptimism.\n\"Candide\" satirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these is Leibnizian optimism (sometimes called \"Panglossianism\" after its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity. Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire's treatment of evil\u2014specifically the theological problem of\nits existence\u2014is the focus of the work. Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder\u2014evils of human design\u2014are explored as extensively in \"Candide\" as are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is \"comprehensive\" in his enumeration of the world's evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.\nFundamental to Voltaire's attack is Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is demonstrable that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles.\nFollowing such flawed reasoning even more doggedly than Candide, Pangloss defends optimism. Whatever their horrendous fortune, Pangloss reiterates \"all is for the best\" (\"\") and proceeds to \"justify\" the evil event's occurrence. A characteristic example of such theodicy is found in Pangloss's explanation of why it is good that syphilis exists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;it was a thing unavoidable, a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not caught in an island in America this disease, which contaminates the source of generation, and frequently impedes propagation itself, and is evidently opposed to the great end of nature, we should have had neither chocolate nor cochineal.\nCandide, the impressionable and incompetent student of Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and eventually despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would see it) of his optimism.\nThis critique of Voltaire's seems to be directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. \"Candide\" does not ridicule Voltaire's contemporary Alexander Pope, a later optimist of slightly different convictions. \"Candide\" does not discuss Pope's optimistic principle that \"all is right\", but Leibniz's that states, \"this is the best of all possible worlds\". However subtle the difference between the two, \"Candide\" is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire's \"Po\u00e8me\" may have been written as a more direct response to Pope's theories. This work is similar to \"Candide\" in subject matter, but very different from it in style: the \"Po\u00e8me\" embodies a more serious philosophical argument than \"Candide\".\nConclusion.\nThe conclusion of the novel, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of \"Candide\" has been written about voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.\nVoltaire develops no formal, systematic philosophy for the characters to adopt. The conclusion of the novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (though what it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy\u2014pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and the conclusion of the work in which Martin plays little part.\nWithin debates attempting to decipher the conclusion of \"Candide\" lies another primary \"Candide\" debate. This one concerns the degree to which Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope for the rest of the human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.\nInside vs. outside interpretations.\nSeparate from the debate about the text's conclusion is the \"inside/outside\" controversy. This argument centers on the matter of whether or not Voltaire was actually prescribing anything. Roy Wolper, professor emeritus of English, argues in a revolutionary 1969 paper that \"Candide\" does not necessarily speak for its author; that the work should be viewed as a narrative independent of Voltaire's history; and that its message is entirely (or mostly) inside it. This point of view, the \"inside\", specifically rejects attempts to find Voltaire's \"voice\" in the many characters of \"Candide\" and his other works. Indeed, writers have seen Voltaire as speaking through at least Candide, Martin, and the Turk. Wolper argues that \"Candide\" should be read with a minimum of speculation as to its meaning in Voltaire's personal life. His article ushered in a new era of Voltaire studies, causing many scholars to look at the novel differently. \nCritics such as Lester Crocker, Henry Stavan, and Vivienne Mylne find too many similarities between \"Candide\"'s point of view and that of Voltaire to accept the \"inside\" view; they support the \"outside\" interpretation. They believe that Candide's final decision is the same as Voltaire's, and see a strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author. Some scholars who support the \"outside\" view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the Old Turk closely mirrors that of Voltaire. Others see a strong parallel between Candide's gardening at the conclusion and the gardening of the author. Martine Darmon Meyer argues that the \"inside\" view fails to see the satirical work in context, and that denying that \"Candide\" is primarily a mockery of optimism (a matter of historical context) is a \"very basic betrayal of the text\".\nReception.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \u2014 Flaubert, \"Correspondance\", \u00e9d. Conard, II, 348; III, 219\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVoltaire made, with this novel, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of all his works\u00a0... His whole intelligence was a war machine. And what makes me cherish it is the disgust which has been inspired in me by the Voltairians, people who laugh about the important things! Was he laughing? Voltaire? He was screeching\u00a0...\n\u2014 Flaubert, \"Correspondance\", \u00e9d. Conard, II, 348; III, 219\nThough Voltaire did not openly admit to having written the controversial \"Candide\" until 1768 (until then he signed with a pseudonym: \"Monsieur le docteur Ralph\", or \"Doctor Ralph\"), his authorship of the work was hardly disputed.\nImmediately after publication, the work and its author were denounced by both secular and religious authorities, because the book openly derides government and church alike. It was because of such polemics that Omer-Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Joly de Fleury, who was Advocate General to the Parisian parliament when \"Candide\" was published, found parts of \"Candide\" to be \"contrary to religion and morals\".\nDespite much official indictment, soon after its publication, \"Candide\"'s irreverent prose was being quoted. \"Let us eat a Jesuit\", for instance, became a popular phrase for its reference to a humorous passage in \"Candide\". By the end of February 1759, the Grand Council of Geneva and the administrators of Paris had banned \"Candide\". \"Candide\" nevertheless succeeded in selling twenty thousand to thirty thousand copies by the end of the year in more than twenty editions, making it a best seller. The Duke de La Valli\u00e8re speculated near the end of January 1759 that \"Candide\" might have been the fastest-selling book ever. In 1762, \"Candide\" was listed in the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\", the Roman Catholic Church's list of prohibited books.\nBannings of \"Candide\" lasted into the twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been considered a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, \"Candide\" was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US customs official in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed \"obscene\", from reaching a Harvard University French class. \"Candide\" was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after \"Candide\"'s detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, \"But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be all right. Then one of us happened to read it. It's a filthy book\".\nLegacy.\n\"Candide\" is the most widely read of Voltaire's many works, and it is considered one of the great achievements of Western literature. William F. Bottiglia opines, \"The physical size of \"Candide\", as well as Voltaire's attitude toward his fiction, precludes the achievement of artistic dimension through plenitude, autonomous '3D' vitality, emotional resonance, or poetic exaltation. \"Candide\", then, cannot in quantity or quality, measure up to the supreme classics\" such as the works of Homer or Shakespeare, Sophocles, Chaucer, Dante, Cervantes, Fielding, Goethe, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Racine, or Moli\u00e8re. Bottiglia instead calls it a miniature classic; but others have been more forgiving of its size. As the only work of Voltaire which has remained popular up to the present day, \"Candide\" is listed in Harold Bloom's \"\". It is included in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica collection \"Great Books of the Western World\". \"Candide\" has influenced modern writers of black humour such as C\u00e9line, Joseph Heller, John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, and Terry Southern. Its parody and picaresque methods have become favourites of black humorists.\nCharles Brockden Brown, an early American novelist, may have been directly affected by Voltaire, whose work he knew well. Mark Kamrath, professor of English, describes the strength of the connection between \"Candide\" and Brown's \"Edgar Huntly; or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker\" (1799): \"An unusually large number of parallels...crop up in the two novels, particularly in terms of characters and plot.\" For instance, the protagonists of both novels are romantically involved with a recently orphaned young woman. Furthermore, in both works the brothers of the female lovers are Jesuits, and each is murdered (although under different circumstances). \nSome twentieth-century novels that may have been influenced by \"Candide\" are some dystopian science-fiction works. Armand Mattelart, a French critic, sees \"Candide\" in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\", George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", and Yevgeny Zamyatin's \"We\", three canonical works of the genre. Specifically, Mattelart writes that in each of these works, there exist references to \"Candide\"'s popularisation of the phrase \"the best of all possible worlds\". He cites as evidence, for example, that the French version of \"Brave New World\" was entitled (lit.\u2009'\"The best of worlds\"').\nReaders of \"Candide\" often compare it with certain works of the modern genre the Theatre of the Absurd. Haydn Mason, a Voltaire scholar, sees in \"Candide\" a few similarities to this brand of literature. For instance, he notes commonalities of \"Candide\" and \"Waiting for Godot\" (1952). In both of these works, and in a similar manner, friendship provides emotional support for characters when they are confronted with harshness of their existences. However, Mason qualifies, \"the must not be seen as a forerunner of the 'absurd' in modern fiction. Candide's world has many ridiculous and meaningless elements, but human beings are not totally deprived of the ability to make sense out of it.\" John Pilling, biographer of Beckett, does state that \"Candide\" was an early and powerful influence on Beckett's thinking. Rosa Luxemburg, in the aftermath of the First World War, remarked upon re-reading \"Candide\": \"Before the war, I would have thought this wicked compilation of all human misery a caricature. Now it strikes me as altogether realistic.\"\nThe American alternative rock band Bloodhound Gang refer to \"Candide\" in their song \"Take the Long Way Home\", from the American edition of their 1999 album \"Hooray for Boobies\".\nDerivative works.\nIn 1760, one year after Voltaire published \"Candide\", a sequel was published with the name . This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. \"Part II\" has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of \"Candide\", but is almost certainly apocryphal. In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of \"Candide\" or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.\n\"Candide\" was adapted for the radio anthology program \"On Stage\" in 1953. Richard Chandlee wrote the script; Elliott Lewis, Cathy Lewis, Edgar Barrier, Byron Kane, Jack Kruschen, Howard McNear, Larry Thor, Martha Wentworth, and Ben Wright performed.\nThe operetta \"Candide\" was originally conceived by playwright Lillian Hellman, as a play with incidental music. Leonard Bernstein, the American composer and conductor who wrote the music, was so excited about the project that he convinced Hellman to do it as a \"comic operetta\". Many lyricists worked on the show, including James Agee, Dorothy Parker, John Latouche, Richard Wilbur, Leonard and Felicia Bernstein, and Hellman. Hershy Kay orchestrated all the pieces except for the overture, which Bernstein did himself. \"Candide\" first opened on Broadway as a musical on 1 December 1956. The premier production was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and conducted by Samuel Krachmalnick. While this production was a box office flop, the music was highly praised, and an original cast album was made. The album gradually became a cult hit, but Hellman's libretto was criticised as being too serious an adaptation of Voltaire's novel. \"Candide\" has been revised and reworked several times. The first New York revival, directed by Hal Prince, featured an entirely new libretto by Hugh Wheeler and additional lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Bernstein revised the work again in 1987 with the collaboration of John Mauceri and John Wells. After Bernstein's death, further revised productions of the musical were performed in versions prepared by Trevor Nunn and John Caird in 1999, and Mary Zimmerman in 2010.\nThe BBC produced a television adaptation in 1973, with Ian Ogilvy as Candide, Emrys James as Dr. Pangloss, and Frank Finlay as Voltaire himself, acting as the narrator.\n\"Candido, ovvero un sogno fatto in Sicilia\" (1977) or simply is a book by Leonardo Sciascia. It was at least partly based on Voltaire's \"Candide\", although the actual influence of \"Candide\" on is a hotly debated topic. A number of theories on the matter have been proposed. Proponents of one say that is very similar to \"Candide\", only with a happy ending; supporters of another claim that Voltaire provided Sciascia with only a starting point from which to work, that the two books are quite distinct.\nNedim G\u00fcrsel wrote his 2001 novel \"Le voyage de Candide \u00e0 Istanbul\" about a minor passage in \"Candide\" during which its protagonist meets Ahmed III, the deposed Turkish sultan. This chance meeting on a ship from Venice to Istanbul is the setting of G\u00fcrsel's book. Terry Southern, in writing his popular novel \"Candy\" with Mason Hoffenberg adapted \"Candide\" for a modern audience and changed the protagonist from male to female. \"Candy\" deals with the rejection of a sort of optimism which the author sees in women's magazines of the modern era; \"Candy\" also parodies pornography and popular psychology. This adaptation of \"Candide\" was adapted for the cinema by director Christian Marquand in 1968.\nIn addition to the above, \"Candide\" was made into a number of minor films and theatrical adaptations throughout the twentieth century. For a list of these, see (1989) with preface and commentaries by Pierre Malandain.\nIn May 2009, a play titled \"Optimism\", based on \"Candide\", opened at the CUB Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne.

{"id": "6631", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6631", "title": "Bus (computing)", "text": "Data transfer channel connecting parts of a computer\nIn computer architecture, a bus (historically also called a data highway or databus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. It encompasses both hardware (e.g., wires, optical fiber) and software, including communication protocols. At its core, a bus is a shared physical pathway, typically composed of wires, traces on a circuit board, or busbars, that allows multiple devices to communicate. To prevent conflicts and ensure orderly data exchange, buses rely on a communication protocol to manage which device can transmit data at a given time.\nBuses are categorized based on their role, such as system buses (also known as internal buses, internal data buses, or memory buses) connecting the CPU and memory. Expansion buses, also called peripheral buses, extend the system to connect additional devices, including peripherals. Examples of widely used buses include PCI Express (PCIe) for high-speed internal connections and Universal Serial Bus (USB) for connecting external devices.\nModern buses utilize both parallel and serial communication, employing advanced encoding methods to maximize speed and efficiency. Features such as direct memory access (DMA) further enhance performance by allowing data transfers directly between devices and memory without requiring CPU intervention.\nAddress bus.\nAn \"address bus\" is a bus that is used to specify a physical address. When a processor or DMA-enabled device needs to read or write to a memory location, it specifies that memory location on the address bus (the value to be read or written is sent on the data bus). The width of the address bus determines the amount of memory a system can transfer simultaneously. For example, a system with a \"32-bit\" address bus can address \"232\" (4,294,967,296) memory locations. If each memory location holds one byte, the addressable memory space is about .\nAddress multiplexing.\nEarly processors used a wire for each bit of the address width. For example, a 16-bit address bus had 16 physical wires making up the bus. As the buses became wider and lengthier, this approach became expensive in terms of the number of chip pins and board traces. Beginning with the Mostek 4096 DRAM, address multiplexing implemented with multiplexers became common. In a multiplexed address scheme, the address is sent in two equal parts on alternate bus cycles. This halves the number of address bus signals required to connect to the memory. For example, a 32-bit address bus can be implemented by using 16 lines and sending the first half of the memory address, immediately followed by the second half memory address.\nTypically two additional pins in the control bus\u00a0\u2013 row-address strobe (RAS) and column-address strobe (CAS)\u00a0\u2013 are used to tell the DRAM whether the address bus is currently sending the first half of the memory address or the second half.\nImplementation.\nAccessing an individual byte frequently requires reading or writing the full bus width (a word) at once. In these instances the least significant bits of the address bus may not even be implemented - it is instead the responsibility of the controlling device to isolate the individual byte required from the complete word transmitted. This is the case, for instance, with the VESA Local Bus which lacks the two least significant bits, limiting this bus to aligned 32-bit transfers.\nHistorically, there were also some examples of computers that were only able to address words\u00a0\u2013 word machines.\nMemory bus.\nThe \"memory bus\" is the bus that connects the main memory to the memory controller in computer systems. Originally, general-purpose buses like VMEbus and the S-100 bus were used, but to reduce latency, modern memory buses are designed to connect directly to DRAM chips, and thus are defined by chip standards bodies such as JEDEC. Examples are the various generations of SDRAM, and serial point-to-point buses like SLDRAM and RDRAM.\nImplementation details.\nBuses can be parallel buses, which carry data words in parallel on multiple wires, or serial buses, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra power and control connections, differential drivers, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in 1-Wire and UNI/O. As data rates increase, the problems of timing skew, power consumption, electromagnetic interference and crosstalk across parallel buses become more and more difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to double pump the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. USB, FireWire, and Serial ATA are examples of this. Multidrop connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use daisy-chain or hub designs.\nThe transition from parallel to serial buses was allowed by Moore's law which allowed for the incorporation of serializer/deserializers in integrated circuits which are used in computers.\nNetwork connections such as Ethernet are not generally regarded as buses, although the difference is largely conceptual rather than practical. An attribute generally used to characterize a bus is that power is provided by the bus for the connected hardware. This emphasizes the busbar origins of bus architecture as supplying switched or distributed power. This excludes, as buses, schemes such as serial RS-232, parallel Centronics, IEEE 1284 interfaces and Ethernet, since these devices also needed separate power supplies. Universal Serial Bus devices may use the bus supplied power, but often use a separate power source. This distinction is exemplified by a telephone system with a connected modem, where the RJ11 connection and associated modulated signalling scheme is not considered a bus, and is analogous to an Ethernet connection. A phone line connection scheme is not considered to be a bus with respect to signals, but the Central Office uses buses with cross-bar switches for connections between phones.\nHowever, this distinction\u200d\u2014\u200cthat power is provided by the bus\u200d\u2014\u200cis not the case in many avionic systems, where data connections such as ARINC 429, ARINC 629, MIL-STD-1553B (STANAG 3838), and EFABus (STANAG 3910) are commonly referred to as \"data buses\" or, sometimes, \"databuses\". Such avionic data buses are usually characterized by having several Line Replaceable Items/Units (LRI/LRUs) connected to a common, shared media. They may, as with ARINC 429, be simplex, i.e. have a single source LRI/LRU or, as with ARINC 629, MIL-STD-1553B, and STANAG 3910, be duplex, allow all the connected LRI/LRUs to act, at different times (half duplex), as transmitters and receivers of data.\nThe frequency or the speed of a bus is measured in Hz such as MHz and determines how many clock cycles there are per second; there can be one or more data transfers per clock cycle. If there is a single transfer per clock cycle it is known as Single Data Rate (SDR), and if there are two transfers per clock cycle it is known as Double Data Rate (DDR) although the use of signaling other than SDR is uncommon outside of RAM. An example of this is PCIe which uses SDR. Within each data transfer there can be multiple bits of data. This is described as the width of a bus which is the number of bits the bus can transfer per clock cycle and can be synonymous with the number of physical electrical conductors the bus has if each conductor transfers one bit at a time. The data rate in bits per second can be obtained by multiplying the number of bits per clock cycle times the frequency times the number of transfers per clock cycle. Alternatively a bus such as PCIe can use modulation or encoding such as PAM4 which groups 2 bits into symbols which are then transferred instead of the bits themselves, and allows for an increase in data transfer speed without increasing the frequency of the bus. The effective or real data transfer speed/rate may be lower due to the use of encoding that also allows for error correction such as 128/130b (b for bit) encoding. The data transfer speed is also known as the bandwidth.\nBus multiplexing.\nThe simplest system bus has completely separate input data lines, output data lines, and address lines.\nTo reduce cost, most microcomputers have a bidirectional data bus, re-using the same wires for input and output at different times.\nSome processors use a dedicated wire for each bit of the address bus, data bus, and the control bus.\nFor example, the 64-pin STEbus is composed of 8 physical wires dedicated to the 8-bit data bus, 20 physical wires dedicated to the 20-bit address bus, 21 physical wires dedicated to the control bus, and 15 physical wires dedicated to various power buses.\nBus multiplexing requires fewer wires, which reduces costs in many early microprocessors and DRAM chips.\nOne common multiplexing scheme, address multiplexing, has already been mentioned.\nAnother multiplexing scheme re-uses the address bus pins as the data bus pins, an approach used by conventional PCI and the 8086.\nThe various \"serial buses\" can be seen as the ultimate limit of multiplexing, sending each of the address bits and each of the data bits, one at a time, through a single pin (or a single differential pair).\nHistory.\nOver time, several groups of people worked on various computer bus standards, including the IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee (BASC), the IEEE Superbus study group, the open microprocessor initiative (OMI), the open microsystems initiative (OMI), the \"Gang of Nine\" that developed EISA, etc.\nFirst generation.\nEarly computer buses were bundles of wire that attached computer memory and peripherals. Anecdotally termed the \"digit trunk\" in the early Australian CSIRAC computer, they were named after electrical power buses, or busbars. Almost always, there was one bus for memory, and one or more separate buses for peripherals. These were accessed by separate instructions, with completely different timings and protocols.\nOne of the first complications was the use of interrupts. Early computer programs performed I/O by waiting in a loop for the peripheral to become ready. This was a waste of time for programs that had other tasks to do. Also, if the program attempted to perform those other tasks, it might take too long for the program to check again, resulting in loss of data. Engineers thus arranged for the peripherals to interrupt the CPU. The interrupts had to be prioritized, because the CPU can only execute code for one peripheral at a time, and some devices are more time-critical than others.\nHigh-end systems introduced the idea of channel controllers, which were essentially small computers dedicated to handling the input and output of a given bus. IBM introduced these on the IBM 709 in 1958, and they became a common feature of their platforms. Other high-performance vendors like Control Data Corporation implemented similar designs. Generally, the channel controllers would do their best to run all of the bus operations internally, moving data when the CPU was known to be busy elsewhere if possible, and only using interrupts when necessary. This greatly reduced CPU load, and provided better overall system performance.\nTo provide modularity, memory and I/O buses can be combined into a unified system bus. In this case, a single mechanical and electrical system can be used to connect together many of the system components, or in some cases, all of them.\nLater computer programs began to share memory common to several CPUs. Access to this memory bus had to be prioritized, as well. The simple way to prioritize interrupts or bus access was with a daisy chain. In this case signals will naturally flow through the bus in physical or logical order, eliminating the need for complex scheduling.\nMinis and micros.\nDigital Equipment Corporation (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced minicomputers, and mapped peripherals into the memory bus, so that the input and output devices appeared to be memory locations. This was implemented in the Unibus of the PDP-11 around 1969.\nEarly microcomputer bus systems were essentially a passive backplane connected directly or through buffer amplifiers to the pins of the CPU. Memory and other devices would be added to the bus using the same address and data pins as the CPU itself used, connected in parallel. Communication was controlled by the CPU, which read and wrote data from the devices as if they are blocks of memory, using the same instructions, all timed by a central clock controlling the speed of the CPU. Still, devices interrupted the CPU by signaling on separate CPU pins.\nFor instance, a disk drive controller would signal the CPU that new data was ready to be read, at which point the CPU would move the data by reading the memory location that corresponded to the disk drive. Almost all early microcomputers were built in this fashion, starting with the S-100 bus in the Altair 8800 computer system.\nIn some instances, most notably in the IBM PC, although similar physical architecture can be employed, instructions to access peripherals (codice_1 and codice_2) and memory (codice_3 and others) have not been made uniform at all, and still generate distinct CPU signals, that could be used to implement a separate I/O bus.\nThese simple bus systems had a serious drawback when used for general-purpose computers. All the equipment on the bus had to talk at the same speed, as it shared a single clock.\nIncreasing the speed of the CPU becomes harder, because the speed of all the devices must increase as well. When it is not practical or economical to have all devices as fast as the CPU, the CPU must either enter a wait state, or work at a slower clock frequency temporarily, to talk to other devices in the computer. While acceptable in embedded systems, this problem was not tolerated for long in general-purpose, user-expandable computers.\nSuch bus systems are also difficult to configure when constructed from common off-the-shelf equipment. Typically each added expansion card requires many jumpers in order to set memory addresses, I/O addresses, interrupt priorities, and interrupt numbers.\nSecond generation.\nSecond-generation bus systems like NuBus addressed some of these problems. They typically separated the computer into two address spaces, the CPU and memory on one side, and the various peripheral devices on the other. A \"bus controller\" accepted data from the CPU side to be moved to the peripherals side, thus shifting the communications protocol burden from the CPU itself. This allowed the CPU and memory side to evolve separately from the peripheral bus. Devices on the bus could talk to each other with no CPU intervention. This led to much better performance but also required the cards to be much more complex. These buses also often addressed speed issues by being bigger in terms of the size of the data path, moving from 8-bit parallel buses in the first generation, to 16 or 32-bit in the second, as well as adding software setup (later standardized as Plug-n-play) to supplant or replace the jumpers.\nHowever, these newer systems shared one quality with their earlier cousins, in that everyone on the bus had to talk at the same speed. While the CPU was now isolated and could increase speed, CPUs and memory continued to increase in speed much faster than the buses they talked to. The result was that the bus speeds were now much slower than what a modern system needed, and the machines were left starved for data. A particularly common example of this problem was that video cards quickly outran even the newer bus systems like PCI, and computers began to include AGP just to drive the video card. By 2004 AGP was outgrown again by high-end video cards and other peripherals and has been replaced by the new PCI Express bus.\nAn increasing number of external devices started employing their own bus systems as well. When disk drives were first introduced, they would be added to the machine with a card plugged into the bus, which is why computers have so many slots on the bus. But through the 1980s and 1990s, new systems like SCSI and IDE were introduced to serve this need, leaving most slots in modern systems empty. Today there are likely to be about five different buses in the typical machine, supporting various devices.\nThird generation.\nThird-generation buses have been emerging into the market since about 2001, including HyperTransport and InfiniBand. They also tend to be very flexible in terms of their physical connections, allowing them to be used both as internal buses, as well as connecting different machines together. This can lead to complex problems when trying to service different requests, so much of the work on these systems concerns software design, as opposed to the hardware itself. In general, these third-generation buses tend to look more like a network than the original concept of a bus, with a higher protocol overhead needed than early systems, while also allowing multiple devices to use the bus at once.\nBuses such as Wishbone have been developed by the open source hardware movement in an attempt to further remove legal and patent constraints from computer design.\nThe Compute Express Link (CXL) is an open standard interconnect for high-speed CPU-to-device and CPU-to-memory, designed to accelerate next-generation data center performance.\nExamples of internal computer buses.\nParallel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSerial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExamples of external computer buses.\nParallel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSerial.\nMany field buses are serial data buses (not to be confused with the parallel data bus section of a system bus or expansion card), several of which use the RS-485 electrical characteristics and then specify their own protocol and connector:\nOther serial buses include:\nExamples of internal/external computer buses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6635", "revid": "12931721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6635", "title": "Chinese checkers", "text": "Abstract strategy board game\nChinese checkers (US) or Chinese chequers (UK), known as Sternhalma in German, is a strategy board game of German origin that can be played by two, three, four, or six people, playing individually or with partners. The game is a modern and simplified variation of the game Halma.\nThe objective is to be first to race all of one's pieces across the hexagram-shaped board into \"home\"\u2014the corner of the star opposite one's starting corner\u2014using single-step moves or moves that &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;jump&lt;/dfn&gt; over other pieces. The remaining players continue the game to establish second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, and last-place finishers. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory and nomenclature.\nThe game was invented in Germany in 1892 under the name \"Stern-Halma\" as a variation of the older American game Halma. Like all Halma games, there is a similarity to checkers. The (German for \"star\") refers to the board's star shape (in contrast to the square board used in Halma).\nThe name \"Chinese checkers\" originated in the United States as a marketing scheme by Bill and Jack Pressman in 1928. The Pressman company's game was originally called \"Hop Ching checkers\".\nThe game is known as () in Chinese. In Japan, the game has a variation called with slightly different rules.\nRules.\nThe aim is to race all one's pieces into the star corner on the opposite side of the board before the opponents do the same. The destination corner is called \"home\". Each player has 10 pieces, except in games between two players, when 15 pieces are used. (On bigger star boards, 15 or 21 pieces are used.)\nIn \"hop across\", the most popular variation, each player starts with their colored pieces on one of the six points or corners of the star and attempts to race them all home into the opposite corner. Players take turns moving a single piece, either by moving one step in any direction to an adjacent empty space, or by jumping in one or any number of available consecutive hops over other single pieces. A player may not combine hopping with a single-step move \u2014 a move consists of one or the other. There is no capturing in Chinese checkers, so pieces that are hopped over remain active and in play. Turns proceed clockwise around the board.\nIn the diagram, Blue might move the topmost piece one space diagonally forward as shown. A \"hop\" consists of jumping over a single adjacent piece, either one's own or an opponent's, to the empty space directly beyond it in the same line of direction. Red might advance the indicated piece by a chain of seven hops in a single move. It is not mandatory to make the most hops possible. (In some instances a player may choose to stop the jumping sequence part way in order to impede the opponent's progress, or to align pieces for planned future moves.)\nStarting layouts.\nSix players.\nCan be played \"all versus all\", or three teams of two. When playing teams, teammates usually sit at opposite corners of the star, with each team member controlling their own colored set of pieces. The first team to advance both sets to their home destination corners is the winner. The remaining players usually continue play to determine second- and third-place finishers, etc.\nFour players.\nThe four-player game is the same as the game for six players, except that two opposite corners will be unused.\nThree players.\nIn a three-player game, all players control either one or two sets of pieces each. If one set is used, pieces race across the board into empty, opposite corners. If two sets are used, each player controls two differently colored sets of pieces at opposite corners of the star.\nTwo players.\nIn a two-player game, each player plays one, two, or three sets of pieces. If one set is played, the pieces usually go into the opponent's starting corner, and the number of pieces per side is increased to 15 (instead of the usual 10). If two sets are played, the pieces can either go into the opponent's starting corners, or one of the players' two sets can go into an opposite empty corner. If three sets are played, the pieces usually go into the opponent's starting corners.\nStrategy.\nA basic strategy is to create or find the longest hopping path that leads closest to home, or immediately into it. (Multiple-jump moves are obviously faster to advance pieces than step-by-step moves.) Since either player can make use of any hopping 'ladder' or 'chain' created, a more advanced strategy involves hindering an opposing player, in addition to helping oneself make jumps across the board. Of equal importance are the players' strategies for emptying and filling their starting and home corners. Games between top players are rarely decided by more than a couple of moves.\nDiffering numbers of players result in different starting layouts, in turn imposing different best-game strategies. For example, if a player's home destination corner starts empty (i.e. is not an opponent's starting corner), the player can freely build a 'ladder' or 'bridge' with their pieces between the two opposite ends. But if a player's opponent occupies the home corner, the player may need to wait for opponent pieces to clear before filling the home vacancies.\nVariants.\nFast-paced or Super Chinese Checkers.\nWhile the standard rules allow hopping over only a single adjacent occupied position at a time (as in checkers), this version of the game allows pieces to catapult over multiple adjacent occupied positions in a line when hopping.\nIn the \"fast-paced\" or \"Super Chinese Checkers\" variant, popular in France, a piece may hop over a \"non-adjacent\" piece. A hop consists of jumping over a distant piece (friend or enemy) to a symmetrical position on the opposite side, in the same line of direction. (For example, if there are two empty positions between the jumping piece and the piece being jumped, the jumping piece lands, leaving exactly two empty positions immediately beyond the jumped piece.) As in the standard rules, a jumping move may consist of any number of a chain of hops. (When making a chain of hops, a piece is usually allowed to enter an empty corner, as long as it hops out again before the move is completed.)\nJumping over two or more pieces in a hop is not allowed. Therefore, in this variant, even more than in the standard version, it is sometimes strategically important to keep one's pieces bunched in order to prevent a long opposing hop.\nAn alternative variant allows hops over \"any\" symmetrical arrangement, including pairs of pieces, pieces separated by empty positions, and so on.\nCapture.\nIn the \"capture\" variant, all sixty game pieces start out in the hexagonal field in the center of the gameboard. The center position is left unoccupied, so pieces form a symmetric hexagonal pattern. Color is irrelevant in this variant, so players take turns hopping any game piece over any other eligible game piece(s) on the board. The hopped-over pieces are captured (retired from the game, as in English draughts) and collected in the capturing player's bin. Only jumping moves are allowed; the game ends when no further jumps are possible. The player with the most captured pieces is the winner.\nThe board is tightly packed at the start of the game. As more pieces are captured, the board frees up, often allowing multiple captures to take place in a single move.\nTwo or more players can compete in this variant, but if there are more than six players, not everyone will get a fair turn.\nThis variant resembles the game Leap Frog. The main difference being that in Leap Frog, the board is a square board.\nDiamond game.\nDiamond game () is a variant of Chinese checkers played in South Korea and Japan. It uses the same jump rule as in Chinese checkers. The aim of the game is to enter all one's pieces into the star corner on the opposite side of the board, before opponents do the same. Each player has ten or fifteen pieces. Ten-piece diamond uses a smaller gameboard than Chinese checkers, with 73 spaces. Fifteen-piece diamond uses the same board as in Chinese checkers, with 121 spaces. To play diamond, each player selects one color and places their 10 or 15 pieces on a triangle. Two or three players can compete.\nUsually, there are one \"king piece\" () and 14 common pieces () on each side. The king piece is the piece at the apex of each area and can jump over the common pieces, but the common pieces cannot jump over the king piece.\nYin and Yang.\nIn Yin and Yang, only two players compete and as in chess, Go, and Othello, only the black and the white marbles are used. For more interesting play, at the start of the game, the triangle placement of the opponents' marbles does not have to be 180 degrees in opposition.\nOrder Out Of Chaos.\nTwo or more players select their coloured marbles and then those marbles are randomly placed in the centre of the board. The object of the game is then for the players to move their marbles out of the chaos to their home corners, creating order; the reverse of half a traditional game.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cantor Fitzgerald's 1,600 employees work in more than 30 locations, including financial centers in the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Together with its affiliates, Cantor Fitzgerald operates in more than 60 offices in 20 countries and has more than 12,000 employees. The firm controls two publicly traded companies: the Newmark Group and BGC Group.\nBefore 2001, the company's headquarters were located between the 101st and 105th floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, just above the impact site of American Airlines Flight 11 during the September 11 attacks. 658 Cantor Fitzgerald employees who were present that day were killed, representing the largest loss of life among any single organization in the attacks.\nThe company was headed by Bernie Cantor from its founding to his death in 1996. From 1996 to 2025, the company was headed by Howard Lutnick, until he took the position of United States secretary of commerce in the second Donald Trump administration. Since 2025, the company has been headed by Lutnick's sons, Brandon and Kyle, who are in their 20s. During his time in the Trump administration, Lutnick has promoted projects that benefit Cantor Fitzgerald, raising conflict of interests questions. 2025 was the firm's most profitable year in its history.\nEarly history.\nCantor Fitzgerald was formed in 1945 by Bernard Gerald Cantor and John Fitzgerald as an investment bank and brokerage business. \nIn 1965, Cantor Fitzgerald began \"large block\" sales/trading of equities for institutional customers. It became the world's first electronic marketplace for US government securities in 1972, and in 1983 it was the first to offer worldwide screen brokerage services in US government securities, becoming in time the market's premier government securities dealer. It also became known for \nIn 1991, Howard Lutnick was named president and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald; he became chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., in 1996.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nCantor Fitzgerald's corporate headquarters and New York City office, on the 101st to the 105th floors of 1 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan (2 to 6 floors above the impact zone of American Airlines Flight 11), were destroyed during the September 11 attacks. At 8:46:46\u00a0a.m., eighteen seconds after the plane struck the tower, a Goldman Sachs server issued an alert saying that its trading system had gone offline because it could not connect with the server. Since all stairwells leading past the impact zone were destroyed by the initial crash or blocked with smoke, fire, or debris, every employee who reported for work that morning located in Cantor's offices between the 101st to the 105th floors was killed in the attacks; 658 of its 960 New York employees were killed or missing, or 68.5% of its total workforce, which was considerably more than any of the other World Trade Center tenants, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority Police Department, the New York City Fire Department, or the Department of Defense. Forty-six contractors, food service workers, and visitors in the Cantor Fitzgerald offices at the time were also killed. CEO Howard Lutnick was not present that day, but his younger brother, Gary, was among those killed. Lutnick vowed to keep the company alive, and the company was able to bring its trading markets back online within a week.\nOn September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25% of the firm's profits for the next five years (that would otherwise have been distributed to its partners), and committed to paying for ten years of health care for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, eSpeed, and TradeSpark employees. In 2006, the company had completed its promise, having paid a total of $180\u00a0million (and an additional $17\u00a0million from a relief fund run by Lutnick's sister, Edie).\nUntil the attacks, Cantor had handled about a quarter of the daily transactions in the multi-trillion dollar treasury security market. Cantor Fitzgerald subsequently rebuilt its infrastructure, partly through the efforts of its London office, and relocated its headquarters to Midtown Manhattan. The company's effort to regain its footing was the subject of Tom Barbash's 2003 book \"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, and 9/11: A Story of Loss and Renewal\" as well as a 2012 documentary, \"Out of the Clear Blue Sky\".\nOn September 2, 2004, Cantor and other organizations filed a civil lawsuit against Saudi Arabia for allegedly providing money to the hijackers and al-Qaeda. It was later joined in the suit by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Most of the claims against Saudi Arabia were dismissed on January 18, 2005.\nIn December 2013, Cantor Fitzgerald settled its lawsuit against American Airlines for $135 million. Cantor Fitzgerald had been suing for loss of property and interruption of business by alleging the airline to have been negligent by allowing hijackers to board Flight 11.\nRecent history.\nIn 2003, the firm launched its fixed-income sales and trading group. Three years later, the Federal Reserve added Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. to its list of primary dealers. The firm later launched Cantor Prime Services in 2009. It was meant to be a provider of multi-asset, perimeter brokerage prime brokerage platforms to exploit its clearing, financing, and execution capabilities. A year after, Cantor Fitzgerald began building its real estate business with the launch of CCRE. Cantor's affiliate, BGC Partners, expanded into commercial real estate services in 2011 by its purchase of Newmark Knight Frank and the assets of Grubb &amp; Ellis, to form Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.\nOn December 5, 2014, two Cantor Fitzgerald analysts were said to be in the top 25 analysts on TipRanks.

It is a member of the genus \"Rhinella\", which includes many true toad species found throughout Central and South America, but it was formerly assigned to the genus \"Bufo\".\nA fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene in Colombia is morphologically indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the \"R. marina\" habitat preferences have long been for open areas. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among anurans, of both dead and living matter. Adults average in length; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of .\nThe cane toad has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Its toxic skin can kill many animals, both wild and domesticated, and cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs. Because of its voracious appetite, the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural pest control. The common name of the species is derived from its use against the cane beetle (\"Dermolepida albohirtum\"), which damages sugar cane. The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions. The 1988 film \"\" documented the trials and tribulations of the introduction of cane toads in Australia.\nTaxonomy.\nHistorically, the cane toad was used to eradicate pests from sugarcane, giving rise to its common name. The cane toad has many other common names, including \"giant toad\" and \"marine toad\"; the former refers to its size, and the latter to the binomial name, \"R. marina\". It was one of many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work \"Systema Naturae\" (1758). Linnaeus based the specific epithet \"marina\" on an illustration by Dutch zoologist Albertus Seba, who mistakenly believed the cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments. Other common names include \"giant neotropical toad\", \"Dominican toad\", \"giant marine toad\", and \"South American cane toad\". In Trinidadian English, they are commonly called \"crapaud\", the French word for toad.\nThe genus \"Rhinella\" is considered to constitute a distinct genus of its own, thus changing the scientific name of the cane toad. In this case, the specific name \"marinus\" (masculine) changes to \"marina\" (feminine) to conform with the rules of gender agreement as set out by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, changing the binomial name from \"Bufo marinus\" to \"Rhinella marina\"; the binomial \"Rhinella marinus\" was subsequently introduced as a synonym through misspelling by Pramuk, Robertson, Sites, and Noonan (2008). Though controversial (with many traditional herpetologists still using \"Bufo marinus\") the binomial \"Rhinella marina\" is gaining in acceptance with such bodies as the IUCN, Encyclopaedia of Life, Amphibian Species of the World and increasing numbers of scientific publications adopting its usage.\nSince 2016, cane toad populations native to Mesoamerica and northwestern South America are sometimes considered to be a separate species, \"Rhinella horribilis\".\nIn Australia, the adults may be confused with large native frogs from the genera \"Limnodynastes\", \"Cyclorana\", and \"Mixophyes\". These species can be distinguished from the cane toad by the absence of large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (\"Heleioporus australiacus\"), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may be confused with species of the genus \"Uperoleia\", but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.\nIn the United States, the cane toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, it could be confused with the southern toad (\"Anaxyrus terrestris\"), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nThe cane toad genome has been sequenced and certain Australian academics believe this will help in understanding how the toad can quickly evolve to adapt to new environments, the workings of its infamous toxin, and hopefully provide new options for halting this species' march across Australia and other places it has spread as an invasive pest.\nStudies of the genome confirm its evolutionary origins in northern part of South America and its close genetic relation to \"Rhinella diptycha\" and other similar species of the genus. Recent studies suggest that \"R. marina\" diverged between 2.75 and 9.40 million years ago.\nA recent split in the species into further subspecies may have occurred approximately 2.7 million years ago following the isolation of population groups by the rising Venezuelan Andes.\nDescription.\nConsidered the largest species in the Bufonidae, the cane toad is very large; the females are significantly longer than males, reaching a typical length of , with a maximum of . Larger toads tend to be found in areas of lower population density. They have a life expectancy of 10 to 15\u00a0years in the wild, and can live considerably longer in captivity, with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35\u00a0years.\nThe skin of the cane toad is dry and warty. Distinct ridges above the eyes run down the snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.\nTypically, juvenile cane toads have smooth, dark skin, although some specimens have a red wash. Juveniles lack the adults' large parotoid glands, so they are usually less poisonous. The tadpoles are small and uniformly black, and are bottom-dwellers, tending to form schools. Tadpoles range from in length.\nEcology, behaviour and life history.\nThe common name \"marine toad\" and the scientific name \"Rhinella marina\" suggest a link to marine life, but cane toads do not live in the sea. However, laboratory experiments suggest that tadpoles can tolerate salt concentrations equivalent to 15% of seawater (~5.4\u2030), and recent field observations found living tadpoles and toadlets at salinities of 27.5\u2030 on Coiba Island, Panama. The cane toad inhabits open grassland and woodland, and has displayed a \"distinct preference\" for areas modified by humans, such as gardens and drainage ditches. In their native habitats, the toads can be found in subtropical forests, although dense foliage tends to limit their dispersal.\nThe cane toad begins life as an egg, which is laid as part of long strings of jelly in water. A female lays 8,000\u201325,000 eggs at once and the strings can stretch up to in length. The black eggs are covered by a membrane and their diameter is about . The rate at which an egg grows into a tadpole increases with temperature. Tadpoles typically hatch within 48\u00a0hours, but the period can vary from 14\u00a0hours to almost a week. This process usually involves thousands of tadpoles\u2014which are small, black, and have short tails\u2014forming into groups. Between 12 and 60\u00a0days are needed for the tadpoles to develop into juveniles, with four weeks being typical. Similarly to their adult counterparts, eggs and tadpoles are toxic to many animals.\nWhen they emerge, toadlets typically are about in length, and grow rapidly. While the rate of growth varies by region, time of year, and sex, an average initial growth rate of per day is seen, followed by an average rate of per day. Growth typically slows once the toads reach sexual maturity. This rapid growth is important for their survival; in the period between metamorphosis and subadulthood, the young toads lose the toxicity that protected them as eggs and tadpoles, but have yet to fully develop the parotoid glands that produce bufotoxin. Only an estimated 0.5% of cane toads reach adulthood, in part because they lack this key defense\u2014but also due to tadpole cannibalism. Although cannibalism does occur in the native population in South America, the rapid evolution occurring in the unnaturally large population in Australia has produced tadpoles 30x more likely to be \"interested\" in cannibalising their siblings, and 2.6x more likely to actually \"do so\". They have also evolved to shorten their tadpole phase in response to the presence of older tadpoles. These changes are likely genetic, although no genetic basis has been determined.\nAs with rates of growth, the point at which the toads become sexually mature varies across different regions. In New Guinea, sexual maturity is reached by female toads with a snout\u2013vent length between , while toads in Panama achieve maturity when they are between in length. In tropical regions, such as their native habitats, breeding occurs throughout the year, but in subtropical areas, breeding occurs only during warmer periods that coincide with the onset of the wet season.\nThe cane toad is estimated to have a critical thermal maximum of and a minimum of around . The ranges can change due to adaptation to the local environment. Cane toads from some populations can adjust their thermal tolerance within a few hours of encountering low temperatures. The toad is able to rapidly acclimate to the cold using physiological plasticity, though there is also evidence that more northerly populations of cane toads in the United States are better cold-adapted than more southerly populations. These adaptations have allowed the cane toad to establish invasive populations across the world. The toad's ability to rapidly acclimate to thermal changes suggests that current models may underestimate the potential range of habitats that the toad can populate. The cane toad has a high tolerance to water loss; some can withstand a 52.6% loss of body water, allowing them to survive outside tropical environments.\nDiet.\nMost frogs identify prey by movement, and vision appears to be the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, it can also locate food using its sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, other small mammals, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates (such as ants, beetles, earwigs, dragonflies, grasshoppers, true bugs, crustaceans, and gastropods), they also eat plants, dog food, cat food, feces, and household refuse.\nDefences.\nThe skin of the adult cane toad is toxic, as well as the enlarged parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across its back. When the toad is threatened, its glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads. Dogs are especially prone to be poisoned by licking or biting toads. Pets showing excessive drooling, extremely red gums, head-shaking, crying, loss of coordination, and/or convulsions require immediate veterinary attention.\nBufotenin, one of the chemicals excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a schedule 9 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and LSD. The effects of bufotenin are thought to be similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.\nIn addition to releasing toxin, the cane toad is capable of inflating its lungs, puffing up, and lifting its body off the ground to appear taller and larger to a potential predator.\nSince 2011, experimenters in the Kimberley region of Western Australia have used poisonous sausages containing toad meat in an attempt to protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, along with the University of Sydney, developed these sausage-shaped baits as a tool in order to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals to stay away from the amphibians.\nYoung cane toads that aren't lethal upon ingestion have also been used to teach native predators avoidance, namely yellow-spotted monitors. 200,000 metamorphs, tadpoles, and eggs in total were released in areas ahead of inevitable invasion fronts. Following invasion by wild cane toads, yellow-spotted monitors in control areas bereft of the \"teacher toads\" were virtually wiped out, but experimental areas still contained substantial populations of yellow-spotted monitors.\nPredators.\nMany species prey on the cane toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, including the broad-snouted caiman (\"Caiman latirostris\"), the banded cat-eyed snake (\"Leptodeira annulata\"), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, and \"Paraponera clavata\" (bullet ants).\nPredators outside the cane toad's native range include the rock flagtail (\"Kuhlia rupestris\"), some species of catfish (order Siluriformes), some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), the whistling kite (\"Haliastur sphenurus\"), the rakali (\"Hydromys chrysogaster\"), the black rat (\"Rattus rattus\") and the water monitor (\"Varanus salvator\"). The tawny frogmouth (\"Podargus strigoides\") and the Papuan frogmouth (\"Podargus papuensis\") have been reported as feeding on cane toads; some Australian crows (\"Corvus\" spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their backs. Kookaburras also prey on the amphibians.\nOpossums of the genus \"Didelphis\" likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, so are able to kill them without reaction. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill or repel the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad. Saw-shelled turtles have also been seen successfully and safely eating cane toads.\nIn Australia rakali (Australian water rats) in two years learnt how to eat cane toads safely. They select the largest toads, turn them over, remove the poisonous gallbladder, and eat the heart and other organs with \"surgical precision\". They remove the toxic skin and eat the thigh muscle. Other animals such as crows and kites turn cane toads inside out and eat non-poisonous organs, also thus avoiding the skin.\nDistribution.\nThe cane toad is native to the Americas, and its range stretches from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas to the central Amazon and southeastern Peru, and some of the continental islands near Venezuela (such as Trinidad and Tobago). This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.\nAs an introduced species.\nThe cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the world\u2014particularly the Pacific\u2014for the biological control of agricultural pests. These introductions have generally been well documented, and the cane toad may be one of the most studied of any introduced species.\nBefore the early 1840s, the cane toad had been introduced into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 in an attempt to reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.\nAs a result, many countries in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. Introduced populations are in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Dait\u014d Islands of Japan, Taiwan Nantou Caotun, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and poses a serious threat to native animals.\nAustralia.\nFollowing the apparent success of the cane toad in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawai\u02bbi and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the cane toad to be released in Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawai\u02bbi and brought to Australia. Queensland's sugar scientists released the toad into cane fields in August 1935. After this initial release, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.\nHowever, the toad was generally unsuccessful in reducing the targeted grey-backed cane beetles (\"Dermolepida albohirtum\"), in part because the cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, and in part because the beetles live at the tops of sugar cane\u2014and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards \"Varanus mertensi\", \"V. mitchelli\", and \"V. panoptes\", the land snakes \"Pseudechis australis\" and \"Acanthophis antarcticus\", and the freshwater crocodile species \"Crocodylus johnstoni\"; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard \"Lophognathus gilberti\"\u2014known to be a prey item of \"V. panoptes\"\u2014has increased. Meat ants, however, are able to kill cane toads. The cane toad has also been linked to decreases in northern quolls in the southern region of Kakadu National Park and even their local extinction.\nCaribbean.\nThe cane toad was introduced to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While it was able to establish itself on some islands, such as Barbados, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, other introductions, such as in Cuba before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of Dominica and Grand Cayman, were unsuccessful.\nThe earliest recorded introductions were to Barbados and Martinique. The Barbados introductions were focused on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from French Guiana before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the mosquito and mole cricket populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no significant effect on the rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other introductions include the release on Antigua\u2014possibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date\u2014and Montserrat, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano eruption in 1995.\nIn 1920, the cane toad was introduced into Puerto Rico to control the populations of white grub (\"Phyllophaga\" spp.), a sugarcane pest. Before this, the pests were manually collected by humans, so the introduction of the toad eliminated labor costs. A second group of toads was imported in 1923, and by 1932, the cane toad was well established. The population of white grubs dramatically decreased, and this was attributed to the cane toad at the annual meeting of the International Sugar Cane Technologists in Puerto Rico. However, there may have been other factors. The six-year period after 1931\u2014when the cane toad was most prolific, and the white grub had a dramatic decline\u2014had the highest-ever rainfall for Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, the cane toad was assumed to have controlled the white grub; this view was reinforced by a \"Nature\" article titled \"Toads save sugar crop\", and this led to large-scale introductions throughout many parts of the Pacific.\nThe cane toad has been spotted in Carriacou and Dominica, the latter appearance occurring in spite of the failure of the earlier introductions. On September 8, 2013, the cane toad was also discovered on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas.\nThe Philippines.\nThe cane toad was first introduced deliberately into the Philippines in 1930 as a biological control agent of pests in sugarcane plantations, after the success of the experimental introductions into Puerto Rico. It subsequently became the most ubiquitous amphibian in the islands. It still retains the common name of \"bak\u00ee\" or \"kamprag\" in the Visayan languages, a corruption of 'American frog', referring to its origins. It is also commonly known as \"bullfrog\" in Philippine English.\nFiji.\nThe cane toad was introduced into Fiji to combat insects that infested sugarcane plantations. The introduction of the cane toad to the region was first suggested in 1933, following the successes in Puerto Rico and Hawai\u02bbi. After considering the possible side effects, the national government of Fiji decided to release the toad in 1953, and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from Hawai\u02bbi. Once the toads were established, a 1963 study concluded, as the toad's diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates, it was considered \"economically neutral\". Today, the cane toad can be found on all major islands in Fiji, although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions.\nNew Guinea.\nThe cane toad was introduced into New Guinea to control the hawk moth larvae eating sweet potato crops. The first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from Hawai\u02bbi, with a second release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests a third release in 1938, consisting of toads being used for human pregnancy tests\u2014many species of toad were found to be effective for this task, and were employed for about 20\u00a0years after the discovery was announced in 1948. Initial reports argued the toads were effective in reducing the levels of cutworms and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the toads were released at Wau, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.\nUnited States.\nThe cane toad naturally exists in South Texas, but attempts (both deliberate and accidental) have been made to introduce the species to other parts of the country. These include introductions to Florida and to Hawai\u02bbi, as well as largely unsuccessful introductions to Louisiana.\nInitial releases into Florida failed. Attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944, intended to control sugarcane pests, were unsuccessful as the toads failed to proliferate. Later attempts failed in the same way. However, the toad gained a foothold in the state after an accidental release by an importer at Miami International Airport in 1957, and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established the toad in other parts of Florida. Today, the cane toad is well established in the state, from the Keys to north of Tampa, and they are gradually extending further northward. In Florida, the toad is a regarded as a threat to native species and pets; so much so, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recommends residents to kill them.\nAround 150 cane toads were introduced to O\u02bbahu in Hawai\u02bbi in 1932, and the population swelled to 105,517 after 17\u00a0months. The toads were sent to the other islands, and more than 100,000 toads were distributed by July 1934; eventually over 600,000 were transported.\nUses.\nOther than the use as a biological control for pests, the cane toad has been employed in a number of commercial and noncommercial applications. Traditionally, within the toad's natural range in South America, the Embera-Wounaan would \"milk\" the toads for their toxin, which was then employed as an arrow poison. The toxins may have been used as an entheogen by the Olmec people. The toad has been hunted as a food source in parts of Peru, and eaten after the careful removal of the skin and parotoid glands. When properly prepared, the meat of the toad is considered healthy and as a source of omega-3 fatty acids. More recently, the toad's toxins have been used in a number of new ways: bufotenin has been used in Japan as an aphrodisiac and a hair restorer, and in cardiac surgery in China to lower the heart rates of patients. New research has suggested that the cane toad's poison may have some applications in treating prostate cancer.\nOther modern applications of the cane toad include pregnancy testing, as pets, laboratory research, and the production of leather goods. Pregnancy testing was conducted in the mid-20th century by injecting urine from a woman into a male toad's lymph sacs, and if spermatozoa appeared in the toad's urine, the patient was deemed to be pregnant. The tests using toads were faster than those employing mammals; the toads were easier to raise, and, although the initial 1948 discovery employed \"Bufo arenarum\" for the tests, it soon became clear that a variety of anuran species were suitable, including the cane toad. As a result, toads were employed in this task for around 20\u00a0years. As a laboratory animal, the cane toad has numerous advantages: they are plentiful, and easy and inexpensive to maintain and handle. The use of the cane toad in experiments started in the 1950s, and by the end of the 1960s, large numbers were being collected and exported to high schools and universities. Since then, a number of Australian states have introduced or tightened importation regulations.\nThere are several commercial uses for dead cane toads. Cane toad skin is made into leather and novelty items. Stuffed cane toads, posed and accessorised, are merchandised at souvenir shops for tourists. Attempts have been made to produce fertiliser from toad carcasses.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, similar games have been recorded back to the late Middle Ages. Today, there are several variations of the game.\nAt its highest level, the game is played internationally with top players coming from Australia, England, Spain, Egypt, South Africa and the United States amongst other countries. \nThe sport can be played equally well by men and women. In 2018, two international championships open to both sexes were won by women.\nVariations.\nIn all forms of croquet, individual players or teams take turns striking the balls, scoring points by knocking them through a hoop. The game ends when a player or team reaches a predetermined number of points. Several variations exist that differ in when and how a stroke may be legally played, when points are scored, the layout of the lawn, and the target score. Commonly, social games adopt further non-standard variations to adapt play to the conditions. In all versions, players of all ages and genders compete on equal terms and are ranked together.\nTwo versions of the game are directly governed by the World Croquet Federation, which organises individual and team World Championships. Other regional variants which developed in parallel remain common in parts of the world.\nAssociation croquet.\nAssociation croquet is played between two individuals or teams, each playing with two balls. The object of the game is to be the first to strike each of one's balls through all six hoops in both directions, in a fixed order, and to strike the central peg. Each of these actions scores a point, with the maximum score being 26 points.\nThe first four turns must be taken to play the four balls onto the lawn from one of two \"baulk lines\" defined as one yard into the lawn on the western half of the south boundary and the eastern half of the north boundary. After this, a player elects at the start of each turn which of their two balls to play for the duration of that turn.\nDuring a turn, a player may earn extra shots in two ways. A player earns a single extra shot by scoring a hoop point (hitting the striker's ball through a hoop), or two extra shots by causing their ball to contact another ball-an action called a \"roquet\". When a roquet is made, the player may pick up their ball and place it in contact with the roqueted ball. The next shot must move both the player's ball and the roqueted ball, and it is the \"croquet\" stroke that gives the game its name. After a successful croquet stroke, the player has a single further shot, known as the \"continuation\". During a turn, each of the other three balls may only be croqueted once between hoop points, but by stringing together a series of roquets, croquets, and scored hoops, several points may be scored in a single turn.\nAdvanced variants of association croquet give further penalties to dissuade skilled players from running every hoop with a ball on a single &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;break&lt;/dfn&gt;, while handicap versions give weaker players chances to continue play after making an error. The extra turns, called \"bisques\" are effective in levelling the odds of winning.\nGolf croquet.\nGolf croquet is played between two individuals or teams, each playing with two balls. The object of the game is to reach a certain number of points, typically seven, earned by being the first to run a hoop.\nThe game opens by playing each ball into the lawn from the fourth (south-eastern) corner of the lawn. Balls must be played in order (for the primary ball colours, this is blue, red, black, and yellow), and this order of play is maintained throughout the game. Hoops are contested in a fixed order, with a point awarded to the owner of the first ball to pass through the hoop in the correct direction. After a point is awarded, all players move on to contest the next hoop. Balls that are played more than halfway to the next hoop before a point is scored are considered offside, and are moved to penalty areas.\nGolf croquet is the fastest-growing version of the game, owing largely to its simplicity and competitiveness. There is an especially large interest in competitive success among players in Egypt. By comparison with association croquet, golf croquet requires a smaller variety of shots and emphasises strategic skills and accurate shot-making. Games are shorter, balls are more likely to be hit harder, and 'jump' shots are more likely to be witnessed, where a ball is played to deliberately jump off the ground and over another ball.\nFive hoop croquet.\nFive hoop croquet is a variation of Golf Croquet created to provide a simple introduction of Golf Croquet to new players. It follows the key principles of Golf Croquet but only plays the first 5 hoops. The winner is the player or team to reach a score of 3 hoops first. This version takes around 15 minutes to play and is normally played on a quarter size croquet lawn. It was originally created to be used for croquet events and is now also listed by Croquet England as a fun variation of the rules. \nAmerican six-wicket.\nThe American-rules version of croquet is the dominant version of the game in the United States and is also widely played in Canada. It is governed by the United States Croquet Association. Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American \"backyard\" croquet. Official rules were first published in 1894 by the Spalding Athletic Library, as adopted by the National American Croquet Association.\nAmerican six-wicket uses the same six-wicket layout as both association croquet and golf croquet, and is also played by two individuals or teams, each owning two balls.\nLike association croquet, the object of the game is to be the first to pass each of their balls through all six hoops in both directions and to strike the central peg, for a total of 26 points. Unlike association croquet, balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow). The limitation of roqueting each ball once between hoop points is, unlike in association croquet, carried over from turn to turn until the ball scores the next hoop. In American six-wicket, this is termed \"deadness\", and a separate board is required to keep track of the deadness for all four balls. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet. In the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop so that the ball goes out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only from the boundary rather than as in association croquet. \"Attacking\" balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.\nNine-wicket.\nNine-wicket croquet, sometimes called \"backyard croquet\", is played mainly in the United States and Canada. In this version of croquet, there are nine wickets, two stakes, and up to six balls. The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake at each end of the course. Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to end. If playing individually (\"Cutthroat\"), the first player to stake out is the winner. In partnership play, all members of a team must stake out, and a player might choose to avoid staking out (becoming a \"Rover\") in order to help a lagging teammate.\nEach time a ball is roqueted, the striker gets two bonus shots.\nFor the first bonus shot, the player has four options:\nThe second bonus shot (\"continuation shot\") is an ordinary shot played from where the striker ball came to rest.\nAn alternative endgame is \"poison\": in this variant, a player who has scored the last wicket but not hit the starting stake becomes a \"poison ball\", which may eliminate other balls from the game by roqueting them. A non-poison ball that roquets a poison ball has the normal options. A poison ball that hits a stake or passes through any wicket (possibly through the action of a non-poison player) is eliminated. The last person remaining is the winner.\nInternational croquet.\nInternational croquet competition is governed by the World Croquet Federation, often referred to as the WCF. Croquet Europe is a subsidiary of the WCF set up to manage European croquet tournaments and provide a closer link to European Clubs in the management of international croquet.\nAs well as club-level games, county-level tournaments, and leagues, there are regular world championships and international matches between croquet-playing countries. The sport has particularly strong followings in the UK, Spain, US, New Zealand, Australia, and Egypt; many other countries also play. Every four years, the top countries play in the World Team Championships in AC (the MacRobertson Shield) and GC (the Openshaw Shield). The current world rankings show England in top place for AC, followed by Australia in second place, and New Zealand in third place, with the United States in fourth position. The same four countries appear in the top six of the GC country rankings, below Egypt in top position, and with Spain at number six.\nIndividual World Championships usually take place every two or three years. The 2025 AC World Championships took place in West Palm Beach, Florida; the winner was Reg Bamford. The current Women's Association Croquet World Champion (2023) is Debbie Lines of England.\nThe most prestigious international team competition in association croquet is the MacRobertson International Croquet Shield. It is contested every three to four years between Australia, England (formerly Great Britain), the United States, and New Zealand. Other nations compete in Tier 2 and Tier 3 World Team Championships. Teams are promoted and relegated between the lower tiers, but there is no relegation to or promotion from the MacRobertson Shield. The current holders of the MacRobertson Shield are England, who won the title in 2023. The next MacRobertson International Croquet Shield competition will take place in London in July/August 2025. At the Golf Croquet World Team Championships, eight nations contest the Openshaw Shield. There is promotion and relegation between Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. The current holders of the Openshaw Shield are the USA, who won in 2025. The world's top 10 association croquet players as of October 2025 were Robert Fletcher (Australia), Jamie Burch (England), Reg Bamford (South Africa), Zack Watson (USA), Mark Avery (England), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), Matthew Essick (USA), Logan McCorkindale (New Zealand), Robert Fulford (England) and Simon Hockey (Australia).\nIn April 2013, Reg Bamford of South Africa beat Ahmed Nasr of Egypt in the final of the Golf Croquet World Championship in Cairo, becoming the first person to simultaneously hold the title in both association croquet and golf croquet. As of 2025, the Golf Croquet World Champion was Blake Fields (USA), and the Women's Golf Croquet World Champion was Jamie Gumbrell (Australia). In 2018, two international championships open to both sexes were won by women: in May, Rachel Gee of England beat Pierre Beaudry of Belgium to win the European Golf Croquet championship, and in October, Hanan Rashad of Egypt beat Yasser Fathy (also from Egypt) to win the World over-50s Golf Croquet championship.\nCroquet was an event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Roque, an American variation on croquet, was an event at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Croquet is recognized as the first Olympic sport to include female participants. In the 1900 Olympic croquet events, France claimed victory in all three competitions. Gaston Aumoitte won the one-ball singles, Chr\u00e9tien Waydelich won the two-ball singles, and the doubles event was won by the pair of Gaston Aumoitte and Georges Johin, securing all the medals as all 10 participants were French.\nHistory.\nThe oldest document to bear the word \"croquet\" with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers' Company of London. This record is now in the Public Record Office. In 1868, the first croquet all-comers meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, and in the same year, the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon, London.\nRegardless of when and by what route it reached the British Isles and the British colonies in its recognizable form, croquet is, like pall-mall and trucco, among the later forms of ground billiards, which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages, with roots in classical antiquity, including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with balls and mallets or other striking sticks (some more akin to modern field hockey sticks). By the 12th century, a team ball game called ' or ', akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football (depending on whether sticks were used), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283.\nIn the book \"Queen of Games: The History of Croquet\", Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet, which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas.\nFrench origin theory.\nThe first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1660\u20131685 reign of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland and was played under the name of ' (among other spellings, today usually \"pall-mall\"), derived ultimately from Latin words for 'ball and mallet' (the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game, '). This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", dated 1877.\nIn his 1801 book \"The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England\", Joseph Strutt described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time:\"Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box[wood] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron, which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed upon, wins. It is to be observed that there are two of these arches, that is, one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James's Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime.\"\nWhile the name \"pall-mall\" and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere (France and Italy), the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century. Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance (as in golf); however, an image in Strutt's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game (balls on the ground, hoop, bats, and peg) being played over a short, garden-sized distance. The image's caption describes the game as \"a curious ancient pastime\", confirming that croquet games were not new in early-19th-century England.\nIn Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary, his definition of \"pall-mall\" clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: \"A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring\". However, there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke, which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game.\nIrish origin theory.\nThe second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived in Ireland during the 1850s, perhaps after being brought there from Brittany, where a similar game was played on the beaches. Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. By no later than the early 15th century, the game \" (itself ancestral to pall-mall and perhaps to indoor billiards) was popular in France, including in the courts of Henry II in the 16th century and Louis XIV of the 17th.\nAt least one version of it, \" ('wheel'), was a multi-ball lawn game. Records show a game called \"crookey\", similar to croquet, being played at Castlebellingham in County Louth, Ireland, in 1834, which was introduced to Galway in 1835 and played on the bishop's palace garden, and in the same year to the genteel Dublin suburb of Kingstown (today D\u00fan Laoghaire) where it was first spelled as \"croquet\". There is, however, no pre-1858 Irish document that describes the way the game was played; in particular, there is no reference to the distinctive croquet stroke, which is described above under \"Variations: Association\". The noted croquet historian Dr. Prior, in his book of 1872, makes the categorical statement, \"One thing only is certain: it is from Ireland that croquet came to England and it was on the lawn of the late Lord Lonsdale that it was first played in this country.\"\nJohn Jaques apparently claimed in a letter to Arthur Lillie in 1873 that he had himself seen the game played in Ireland, writing, \"I made the implements and published directions (such as they were) before Mr. Spratt [mentioned above] introduced the subject to me.\" Whatever the truth of the matter, Jaques certainly played an important role in popularising the game, producing editions of the rules in 1857, 1860, and 1864.\nHeyday and decline.\nCroquet became highly popular as a social pastime in England during the 1860s. It was enthusiastically adopted and promoted by the Earl of Essex, who held lavish croquet parties at Cassiobury House, his stately home in Watford, Hertfordshire, and the Earl even launched his own \"Cassiobury\" brand croquet set. By 1867, Jaques had printed 65,000 copies of his \"Laws and Regulations\" of the game. It quickly spread to other Anglophone countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. No doubt one of the attractions was that the game could be played by both sexes; this also ensured a certain amount of adverse comment.\nIt is no coincidence that the game became popular at the same time as the cylinder lawn mower, since croquet can only be played well on a lawn that is flat and finely-cut.\nBy the late 1870s, however, croquet had been eclipsed by another fashionable game, lawn tennis, and many of the newly created croquet clubs, including the All England Club at Wimbledon, converted some or all of their lawns into tennis courts. There was a revival in the 1890s, but going forward croquet was always a minority sport, with national individual participation amounting to a few thousand players. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club still has a croquet lawn, but has not hosted any significant tournaments. Its championship was won 38 times by Bernard Neal. The English headquarters for the game is now in Cheltenham.\nThe earliest known reference to croquet in Scotland is the booklet \"The Game of Croquet, its Laws and Regulations\", which was published in the mid-1860s for the proprietor of Eglinton Castle, the Earl of Eglinton. On the page facing the title page is a picture of Eglinton Castle with a game of \"croquet\" in full swing.\nThe croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between Eglinton Castle and the Lugton Water. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet, which had small bells on the eight hoops \"to ring the changes\", two pegs, a double hoop with a bell, and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. In 1865, the 'Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet' was published by Edmund Routledge. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist, and one complete set is still used for demonstration games in the West of Scotland.\n# Any ball when it leaves the court has to be replaced on the yard-line\n# The striker's ball after making a roquet must be placed in contact with the roqueted ball\n# The striker's ball when the striker is entitled to a lift\nIn art and literature.\nCroquet is popularly believed to be viciously competitive. That may derive from the fact that (unlike in golf) players will often attempt to move their opponents' balls to unfavourable positions. However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy; successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents.\nThe way croquet is depicted in paintings and books says much about popular perceptions of the game, though little about the reality of modern play.\nClubs.\nAbout 200 croquet clubs across the United States are members of the United States Croquet Association.\nMany colleges have croquet clubs as well, such as The University of Virginia, The University of Chicago, Pennsylvania State University, Bates College, SUNY New Paltz, Harvard University, and Dartmouth College. Notably, St. John's College and the US Naval Academy engage in a yearly match in Annapolis, Maryland. Both schools also compete at the collegiate level and the rivalry continues to be an Annapolis tradition, attracting thousands of spectators each April.\nIn England and Wales, there are over 200 clubs affiliated with Croquet England. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon is famous for its lawn tennis tournament, but retains an active croquet section. There are clubs in many universities and colleges, with an annual varsity match being played between Oxford and Cambridge. With over 1800 participants, the 2011 Oxford University \"Cuppers\" (inter-college) tournament claimed to be not only the largest croquet tournament ever, but the largest sporting event in the university's history.\nIn Spain there are 37 clubs federated to the Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Croquet. Croquet is a growing sport in Spain with 4 new clubs joining the FEC in 2024.\nThere are 112 clubs in New Zealand, affiliated with 19 associations. They are governed by Croquet New Zealand.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6644", "revid": "50477309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6644", "title": "Curling", "text": "Team sport played on ice\nCurling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area that is segmented into four concentric circles. It is related to bowls, boules, and shuffleboard. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called \"rocks\", across the ice \"curling sheet\" toward the \"house\", a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones, with each player throwing two. The goal is to accumulate the highest score for a \"game\"; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each \"end\", which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones once. A game usually consists of eight or ten ends.\nThe player throwing the stone creates a curved trajectory, known as \"curl\", by gently rotating the stone as they release it. The stone\u2019s path can also be influenced by two sweepers using brooms or brushes, who move alongside it and sweep the ice in its path. Sweeping reduces friction, allowing the stone to travel further and in a straighter line, with less curl. Strategy and teamwork play a crucial role in selecting the optimal path and final placement of the stone, and the skill of the players determines how accurately the stone follows the intended course.\nHistory.\nEvidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 found (along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland. The world's oldest curling stone and the world's oldest football are now kept in the same museum (the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum) in Stirling. The first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, in February 1541. Two paintings, \"Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap\" and \"The Hunters in the Snow\" (both dated 1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, depict Flemish peasants curling. Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this time, which is also evident in the history of golf.\nThe word \"curling\" first appears in print in 1620 in Perth, Scotland, in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson. The sport was (and still is, in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand, as well as in Canada) also known as \"the roaring game\" because of the sound the stones make while travelling over the \"pebble\" (droplets of water applied to the playing surface). The verbal noun \"curling\" is formed from the Scots (and English) verb \"curl\", which describes the motion of the stone.\nKilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world, having been formally constituted in 1716; it is still in existence today. Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at Colzium, in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some in size. The International Olympic Committee recognises the Royal Caledonian Curling Club (founded as the Grand Caledonian Curling Club in 1838) as developing the first official rules for the sport. However, although not written as a \"rule book\", this is preceded by Rev James Ramsay of Gladsmuir, a member of the Duddingston Curling Club, who wrote \"An Account of the Game of Curling\" in 1811, which speculates on its origin and explains the method of play.\nIn the early history of curling, the playing stones were simply flat-bottomed stones from rivers or fields, which lacked a handle and were of inconsistent size, shape, and smoothness. Some early stones had holes for a finger and the thumb, akin to ten-pin bowling balls. Unlike today, the thrower had little control over the 'curl' or velocity and relied more on luck than on precision, skill, and strategy. The sport was often played on frozen rivers although purpose-built ponds were later created in many Scottish towns. For example, the Scottish poet David Gray describes whisky-drinking curlers on the Luggie Water at Kirkintilloch.\nIn Darvel, East Ayrshire, the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches using the heavy stone weights from the looms' \"warp beams\", fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose. Central Canadian curlers often used 'irons' rather than stones until the early 1900s. Canada is the only country known to have done this, while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins.\nOutdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries because the climate provided good ice conditions every winter. Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling, the World Curling Federation in Perth, which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, the mother club of curling.\nIn the 19th century, several private railway stations in the United Kingdom were built to serve curlers attending bonspiels, such as those at Aboyne, Carsbreck, and Drummuir.\nToday, the sport is most firmly established in Canada, having been taken there by Scottish emigrants. The Royal Montreal Curling Club, the oldest sports club still active in North America, was established in 1807. The first curling club in the United States was established in 1830, and the sport was introduced to Switzerland and Sweden before the end of the 19th century, also by Scots. Today, curling is played all over Europe and has spread to Brazil, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Korea.\nThe first world championship for curling was limited to men and was known as the \"Scotch Cup\", held in Falkirk and Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959. The first world title was won by the Canadian team from Regina, Saskatchewan, skipped by Ernie Richardson. The \"skip\" is the team member who calls the shots; see below.\nOlympics.\nCurling has been a medal sport in the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics. It currently includes men's, women's, and mixed doubles tournaments (the mixed doubles event was held for the first time in 2018).\nIn February 2002, the International Olympic Committee retroactively decided that the curling competition from the 1924 Winter Olympics (originally called \"Semaine des Sports d'Hiver\", or International Winter Sports Week) would be considered official Olympic events and no longer be considered demonstration events. Thus, the first Olympic medals in curling, which at the time was played outdoors, were retroactively awarded for the 1924 Winter Games, with the gold medal won by Great Britain, two silver medals by Sweden, and the bronze by France. A demonstration tournament was also held during the 1932 Winter Olympic Games between four teams from Canada and four from the United States, with Canada winning 12 games to 4.\nSince the sport's official addition in the 1998 Olympics, Canada has dominated the sport with their men's teams winning gold in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and silver in 1998 and 2002. The women's team won gold in 1998 and 2014, a silver in 2010, and a bronze in 2002 and 2006. The mixed doubles team won gold in 2018.\nEquipment.\nCurling sheet.\nThe playing surface or \"curling sheet\" is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling. It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, in length by in width. The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.\nA target, the \"house\", is centred on the intersection of the \"centre line\", drawn lengthwise down the centre of the sheet and the \"tee line\", drawn from, and parallel to, the backboard. These lines divide the house into quarters. The house consists of a centre circle (the \"button\") and three concentric rings, of diameters 4, 8, and 12 feet, formed by painting or laying a coloured vinyl sheet under the ice and are usually distinguished by colour. A stone must at least touch the outer ring in order to score (see Scoring below); otherwise, the rings are merely a visual aid for aiming and judging which stone is closer to the button.\nTwo \"hog lines\" are drawn from, and parallel to, the backboard.\nThe \"hacks\", which give the thrower something to push against when making the throw, are fixed behind each button. On indoor rinks, there are usually two fixed hacks, rubber-lined holes, one on each side of the centre line, with the inside edge no more than from the centre line and the front edge on the hack line. A single moveable hack may also be used.\nThe ice may be natural, but is usually frozen by a refrigeration plant pumping a brine solution through numerous pipes fixed lengthwise at the bottom of a shallow pan of water. Most curling clubs have an ice maker whose main job is to care for the ice. At the major curling championships, ice maintenance is extremely important. Large events, such as national/international championships, are typically held in an arena that presents a challenge to the ice maker, who must constantly monitor and adjust the ice and air temperatures as well as air humidity levels to ensure a consistent playing surface. It is common for each sheet of ice to have multiple sensors embedded in order to monitor surface temperature, as well as probes set up in the seating area (to monitor humidity) and in the compressor room (to monitor brine supply and return temperatures). The surface of the ice is maintained at a temperature of around .\nA key part of the preparation of the playing surface is the spraying of water droplets onto the ice, which form \"pebble\" on freezing. The pebbled ice surface resembles an orange peel, and the stone moves on top of the pebbled ice. The pebble, along with the concave bottom of the stone, decreases the friction between the stone and the ice, allowing the stone to travel further. As the stone moves over the pebble, any rotation of the stone causes it to \"curl\", or travel along a curved path. The amount of curl (commonly referred to as the \"feet of curl\") can change during a game as the pebble wears; the ice maker must monitor this and be prepared to scrape and re-pebble the surface prior to each game.\nCurling stone.\nThe curling stone (also sometimes called a \"rock\" in North America) is made of granite and is specified by the World Curling Federation, which requires a weight between , a maximum circumference of , and a minimum height of . The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the \"running surface\", a narrow, flat annulus or ring, wide and about in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring, with the inside of the ring hollowed concave to clear the ice. This concave bottom was first proposed by J. S. Russell of Toronto, Ontario, Canada sometime after 1870, and was subsequently adopted by Scottish stone manufacturer Andrew Kay.\nThe granite for the stones comes from two sources: Ailsa Craig, an island located in the Firth of Clyde off the Ayrshire coast of Scotland, and the Trefor Granite Quarry, North of the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, Gwynedd in Wales. These locations provide four variations in colour known as \"Ailsa Craig Common Green\", \"Ailsa Craig Blue Hone\", \"Blue Trefor\" and \"Red Trefor\".\n\"Blue Hone\" has very low water absorption, which prevents the action of repeatedly freezing water from eroding the stone. \"Ailsa Craig Common Green\" is a lesser quality granite than \"Blue Hone\". In the past, most curling stones were made from \"Blue Hone\", but the island is now a wildlife reserve, and the quarry is restricted by environmental conditions that exclude blasting.\nKays of Scotland has been making curling stones in Mauchline, Ayrshire, since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite, granted by the Marquess of Ailsa, whose family has owned the island since 1560. According to the 1881 Census, Andrew Kay employed 30 people in his curling stone factory in Mauchline. The last harvest of Ailsa Craig granite by Kays took place in 2013, after a hiatus of 11 years; 2,000\u00a0tons were harvested, sufficient to fill anticipated orders through at least 2020. Kays have been involved in providing curling stones for the Winter Olympics since Chamonix in 1924 and has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics since the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\"Trefor\" granite comes from the Yr Eifl or Trefor Granite Quarry in the village of Trefor on the north coast of the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales and has produced granite since 1850. \"Trefor\" granite comes in shades of pink, blue, and grey. The quarry supplies curling stone granite exclusively to the Canada Curling Stone Company, which has been producing stones since 1992 and supplied the stones for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\nA handle is attached by a bolt running vertically through a hole in the centre of the stone. The handle allows the stone to be gripped and rotated upon release; on properly prepared ice the rotation will bend (\"curl\") the path of the stone in the direction in which the front edge of the stone is turning, especially as the stone slows. Handles are coloured to identify each team, two popular colours in major tournaments being red and yellow.\nIn competition, an electronic handle known as the Eye on the Hog may be fitted to detect hog line violations. This electronically detects whether the thrower's hand is in contact with the handle as it passes the hog line and indicates a violation by lights at the base of the handle (see \"delivery\" below). The \"eye on the hog\" eliminates human error and the need for hog line officials. It is mandatory in high-level national and international competition, but its cost, around US$650 each, currently puts it beyond the reach of most curling clubs.\nCurling broom.\nThe \"curling broom\", or \"brush\", is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone (see \"sweeping\") and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.\nPrior to the 1950s, most curling brooms were made of corn strands and were similar to household brooms of the day. In 1958, Fern Marchessault of Montreal inverted the corn straw in the centre of the broom. This style of corn broom was referred to as \"the Blackjack\".\nArtificial brooms made from human-made fabrics rather than corn, such as the \"Rink Rat\", also became common later during this time period. Prior to the late sixties, \"Scottish\" curling brushes were used primarily by some of the Scots, as well as by recreational and elderly curlers, as a substitute for corn brooms, since the technique was easier to learn. In the late sixties, competitive curlers from Calgary, Alberta, such as John Mayer, Bruce Stewart, and, later, the world junior championship teams skipped by Paul Gowsell, proved that the curling brush could be just as (or more) effective without all the blisters common to corn broom use. During that time period, there was much debate in competitive curling circles as to which sweeping device was more effective: brush or broom. Eventually, the brush won out with the majority of curlers making the switch to the less costly and more efficient brush. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling; it is rare now to see a curler using a corn broom on a regular basis.\nCurling brushes may have fabric, hog hair, or horsehair heads. Modern curling brush handles are usually hollow tubes made of fibreglass or carbon fibre instead of a solid length of wooden dowel. These hollow tube handles are lighter and stronger than wooden handles, allowing faster sweeping and more downward force to be applied to the broom head with reduced shaft flex.\n In 2014, new \"directional fabric\" brooms were introduced, which could influence the path of a curling stone better than the existing brooms. Concerns arose that these brooms would alter the fundamentals of the sport by reducing the level of skill required and giving players an unfair advantage; at least thirty-four elite teams signed a statement pledging not to use them. This was dubbed the \"broomgate controversy\". The new brooms were temporarily banned by the World Curling Federation and Curling Canada for the 2015\u20132016 season. Since 2016, only one standardized brush head is approved by the World Curling Federation for competitive play.\nShoes.\nCurling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except for special soles; the \"slider shoe\" (usually known as a \"slider\") is designed for the sliding foot and the \"gripper shoe\" (usually known as a \"gripper\") for the foot that kicks off from the hack.\nThe \"slider\" is designed to slide and typically has a Teflon sole. It is worn by the thrower during delivery from the hack and by sweepers or the skip to glide down the ice when sweeping or otherwise traveling down the sheet quickly. Stainless steel and \"red brick\" sliders with lateral blocks of PVC on the sole are also available as alternatives to Teflon. Most shoes have a full-sole sliding surface, but some shoes have a sliding surface covering only the outline of the shoe and other enhancements with the full-sole slider. Some shoes have small disc sliders covering the front and heel portions or only the front portion of the foot, which allow more flexibility in the sliding foot for curlers playing with tuck deliveries. When a player is not throwing, the player's slider shoe can be temporarily rendered non-slippery by using a slip-on gripper. Ordinary athletic shoes may be converted to sliders by using a step-on or slip-on Teflon slider or by applying electrical or gaffer tape directly to the sole or over a piece of cardboard. This arrangement often suits casual or beginning players.\nThe \"gripper\" is worn by the thrower on the foot that kicks off from the hack during delivery and is designed to grip the ice. It may have a normal athletic shoe sole or a special layer of rubbery material applied to the sole of a thickness to match the sliding shoe. The toe of the hack foot shoe may also have a rubberised coating on the top surface or a flap that hangs over the toe to reduce wear on the top of the shoe as it drags on the ice behind the thrower.\nOther equipment.\nOther types of equipment include:\nGameplay.\nThe purpose of a game is to score points by getting stones closer to the house centre, or the \"button\", than the other team's stones. Players from either team alternate in taking shots from the far side of the sheet. An end is complete when all eight rocks from each team have been delivered, a total of sixteen stones. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, often extra ends are played to break the tie. The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed (see Scoring below). A game may be conceded if winning the game is infeasible.\nInternational competitive games are generally ten ends, so most of the national championships that send a representative to the World Championships or Olympics also play ten ends. However, there is a movement on the World Curling Tour to make the games only eight ends. Most tournaments on that tour are eight ends, as are the vast majority of recreational games.\nIn international competition, each side is given 73 minutes to complete all of its throws. Each team is also allowed two minute-long timeouts per 10-end game. If extra ends are required, each team is allowed 10 minutes of playing time to complete its throws and one added 60-second timeout for each extra end. However, the \"thinking time\" system, in which the delivering team's game timer stops as soon as the shooter's rock crosses the t-line during the delivery, is becoming more popular, especially in Canada. This system allows each team 38 minutes per 10 ends, or 30 minutes per 8 ends, to make strategic and tactical decisions, with 4 minutes and 30 seconds an end for extra ends. The \"thinking time\" system was implemented after it was recognized that using shots which take more time for the stones to come to rest was being penalized in terms of the time the teams had available compared to teams which primarily use hits which require far less time per shot.\nDelivery.\nThe process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the \"delivery\" or \"throw\". Players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping; when one player (e.g., the lead) throws, the players not delivering (the second and third) sweep (see Sweeping, below). When the skip throws, the vice-skip takes their role.\nThe \"skip\", or the captain of the team, determines the desired stone placement and the required \"weight\", \"turn\", and \"line\" that will allow the stone to stop there. The placement will be influenced by the tactics at this point in the game, which may involve taking out, blocking, or tapping another stone.\nThe skip may communicate the \"weight\", \"turn\", \"line,\" and other tactics by calling or tapping a broom on the ice. In the case of a takeout, guard, or a tap, the skip will indicate the stones involved.\nBefore delivery, the running surface of the stone is wiped clean and the path across the ice swept with the broom if necessary, since any dirt on the bottom of a stone or in its path can alter the trajectory and ruin the shot. Intrusion by a foreign object is called a \"pick-up\" or \"pick\".\nThe thrower starts from the \"hack\". The thrower's \"gripper\" shoe (with the non-slippery sole) is positioned against one of the hacks; for a right-handed curler the right foot is placed against the left hack and vice versa for a left-hander. The thrower, now \"in the hack\", lines the body up with shoulders square to the skip's broom at the far end for \"line\".\nThe stone is placed in front of the foot now in the hack. Rising slightly from the hack, the thrower pulls the stone back (some older curlers may actually raise the stone in this backward movement) then lunges smoothly out from the hack pushing the stone ahead while the slider foot is moved in front of the gripper foot, which trails behind. The thrust from this lunge determines the \"weight\", and hence the distance the stone will travel. Balance may be assisted by a broom held in the free hand with the back of the broom down so that it slides. One older writer suggests the player keep \"a basilisk glance\" at the mark.\nThere are two common types of delivery currently, the typical flat-foot delivery and the Manitoba tuck delivery where the curler slides on the front ball of their foot.\nWhen the player releases the stone, a rotation (called the \"turn\") is imparted by a slight clockwise or counter-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the twelve o'clock on release. A typical rate of turn is about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 rotations before coming to a rest.\nThe stone must be released before its front edge crosses the near hog line. In major tournaments, the \"Eye on the Hog\" sensor is commonly used to enforce this rule. The sensor is in the handle of the stone and will indicate whether the stone was released before the near hog line. The lights on the stone handle will either light up green, indicating that the stone has been legally thrown, or red, in which case the illegally thrown stone will be immediately pulled from play instead of waiting for the stone to come to rest.\nThe stone must clear the far hog line or else be removed from play (\"hogged\"); an exception is made if a stone fails to come to rest beyond the far hog line after rebounding from a stone in play just past the hog line.\nSweeping.\nAfter the stone is delivered, its trajectory is influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for several reasons: to make the stone travel further, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path. Sweeping is able to make the stone travel further and straighter by slightly melting the ice under the brooms, thus decreasing the friction as the stone travels across that part of the ice. The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance.\nOne of the basic technical aspects of curling is knowing when to sweep. When the ice in front of the stone is swept, a stone will usually travel both further and straighter, and in some situations one of those is not desirable. For example, a stone may be traveling too fast (said to have too much weight), but require sweeping to prevent curling into another stone. The team must decide which is better: getting by the other stone, but traveling too far, or hitting the stone.\nMuch of the yelling that goes on during a curling game is the skip and sweepers exchanging information about the stone's \"line\" and \"weight\" and deciding whether to sweep. The skip evaluates the path of the stone and calls to the sweepers to sweep as necessary to maintain the intended track. The sweepers themselves are responsible for judging the weight of the stone, ensuring that the length of travel is correct and communicating the weight of the stone back to the skip. Many teams use a \"number system\" to communicate in which of 10 zones the sweepers estimate the stone will stop. Some sweepers use stopwatches to time the stone from the back line or tee line to the nearest hog line to aid in estimating how far the stone will travel.\nUsually, the two sweepers will be on opposite sides of the stone's path, although depending on which side the sweepers' strengths lie this may not always be the case. Speed and pressure are vital to sweeping. In gripping the broom, one hand should be one third of the way from the top (non-brush end) of the handle while the other hand should be one third of the way from the head of the broom. The angle of the broom to the ice should be such that the most force possible can be exerted on the ice. The precise amount of pressure may vary from relatively light brushing (\"just cleaning\" - to ensure debris will not alter the stone's path) to maximum-pressure scrubbing.\nSweeping is allowed anywhere on the ice up to the \"tee line\"; once the leading edge of a stone crosses the tee line only one player may sweep it. Additionally, if a stone is behind the tee line one player from the opposing team is allowed to sweep it. This is the only case that a stone may be swept by an opposing team member. In international rules, this player must be the skip, but if the skip is throwing, then the sweeping player must be the third.\n\"Burning\" a stone.\nOccasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part. This is often referred to as \"burning\" a stone. Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of good sportsmanship. Touching a stationary stone when no stones are in motion (there is no delivery in progress) is not an infraction as long as the stone is struck in such a manner that its position is not altered, and this is a common way for the skip to indicate a stone that is to be taken out.\nWhen a stone is touched when stones are in play, the remedies vary between leaving the stones as they end up after the touch, replacing the stones as they would have been if no stone were touched, or removal of the touched stone from play. In non-officiated league play, the skip of the non-offending team has the final say on where the stones are placed after the infraction.\nTypes of shots.\nMany different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:\n\"Guards\" are thrown in front of the house in the \"free guard zone\", usually to protect a stone or to make the opposing team's shot difficult. Guard shots include the \"centre-guard\", on the centreline, and the \"corner-guards\" to the left or right sides of the centre line. See \"Free Guard Zone\" below.\n\"Draws\" are thrown only to reach the house. Draw shots include \"raise\", \"come-around\", and \"freeze\" shots.\n\"Takeouts\" are intended to remove stones from play and include the \"peel\", \"hit-and-roll\", and \"double\" shots.\nFor a more complete listing, see Glossary of curling terms.\nFree guard zone.\nThe \"free guard zone\" is the area of the curling sheet between the hog line and tee line, excluding the house. Until five stones have been played (three from the side without hammer and two from the side with hammer), stones in the free guard zone may not be removed by an opponent's stone, although they can be moved within the playing area. If a stone in the free guard zone is knocked out of play, it is placed back in the position it was in before the shot was thrown and the opponent's stone is removed from play. This rule is known as the \"five-rock rule\" or the \"free guard zone rule\" (previous versions of the free guard zone rule only limited removing guards from play in the first three or four rocks).\nThis rule, a relatively recent addition to curling, was added in response to a strategy by teams of gaining a lead in the game and then \"peeling\" all of the opponents' stones (knocking them out of play at an angle that caused the shooter's stone to also roll out of play, leaving no stones on the ice). By knocking all stones out the opponents could at best score one point, if they had the last stone of the end (called the hammer). If the team peeling the rocks had the hammer they could peel rock after rock which would \"blank the end\" (leave the end scoreless), keeping the last rock advantage for another end. This strategy had developed (mostly in Canada) as ice-makers had become skilled at creating a predictable ice surface and newer brushes allowed greater control over the rock. While a sound strategy, this made for an unexciting game. Observers at the time noted that if two teams equally skilled in the peel game faced each other on good ice, the outcome of the game would be predictable from who won the coin flip to have last rock (or had earned it in the schedule) at the beginning of the game. The 1990 Brier (Canadian men's championship) was considered by many curling fans as boring to watch because of the amount of peeling and the quick adoption of the free guard zone rule the following year reflected how disliked this aspect of the game had become.\nThe free guard zone rule was originally called the Modified Moncton Rule and was developed from a suggestion made by Russ Howard for the Moncton 100 cashspiel in Moncton, New Brunswick, in January 1990. \"Howard's Rule\" (later known as the Moncton Rule), used for the tournament and based on a practice drill his team used, had the first four rocks in play unable to be removed no matter where they were at any time during the end. This method of play was altered by restricting the area in which a stone was protected to the free guard zone only for the first four rocks thrown and adopted as a four-rock free guard zone rule for international competition shortly after. Canada kept to the traditional rules until a three-rock free guard zone rule was adopted for the 1993\u201394 season. After several years of having the three-rock rule used for the Canadian championships and the winners then having to adjust to the four-rock rule in the World Championships, the Canadian Curling Association adopted the four-rock free guard zone in the 2002\u201303 season.\nOne strategy that has been developed by curlers in response to the free guard zone (Kevin Martin from Alberta is one of the best examples) is the \"tick\" game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use, but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical to peeling the guard, but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in it being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in it still being tactically useful for the opposition. There is also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did. Steve Gould from Manitoba popularized ticks played across the face of the guard stone. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that it remains in play even if a bigger chunk of it is hit.\nWith the tick shot reducing the effectiveness of the four-rock rule, the Grand Slam of Curling series of bonspiels adopted a five-rock rule in 2014. In 2017, the five-rock rule was adopted by the World Curling Federation and member organizations for official play, beginning in the 2018\u201319 season.\nHammer.\nThe last rock in an end is called the \"hammer\", and throwing the hammer gives a team a tactical advantage. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a \"draw-to-the-button\" contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win\u2013loss record. In all subsequent ends, the team that did not score in the preceding end gets to throw second, thus having the hammer. In the event that neither team scores, called a \"blanked end\", the hammer remains with the same team. Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points. If only one point is possible, the skip may try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer the next end, giving the team another chance to use the hammer advantage to try to score two points. Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as \"stealing\", or \"a steal\", and is much more difficult.\nStrategy.\nCurling is a game of strategy, tactics, and skill. The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the \"hammer\"). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and although risky the rewards can be great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky. A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.\nIf a team does not have the hammer in an end, it will opt to try to clog up the four-foot zone in the house to deny the opposing team access to the button. This can be done by throwing \"centre line\" guards in front of the house on the centre line, which can be tapped into the house later or drawn around. If a team has the hammer, they will try to keep this four-foot zone free so that they have access to the button area at all times. A team with the hammer may throw a \"corner guard\" as their first stone of an end placed in front of the house, but outside the four-foot zone to utilize the free guard zone. Corner guards are key for a team to score two points in an end, because they can either draw around it later or hit and roll behind it, making the opposing team's shot to remove it more difficult.\nIdeally, the strategy in an end for a team with the hammer is to score two points or more. Scoring one point is often a wasted opportunity, as they will then lose last-stone advantage for the next end. If a team cannot score two points, they will often attempt to \"blank an end\" by removing any leftover opposition stones and rolling out; or, if there are no opposition stones, just throwing the stone through the house so that no team scores any points, and the team with the hammer can try again the next end to score two or more with it. Generally, a team without the hammer would want to either force the team with the hammer to only one point, so that they can get the hammer back, or \"steal\" the end by scoring one or more points of their own.\nLarge leads are often defended by displacing the opponent's stones to reduce their opportunity to score multiple points. However, a comfortably leading team that leaves their own stones in play becomes vulnerable as the opponent can draw around guard stones, stones in the house can be \"tapped back\" if they are in front of the tee line, or \"frozen onto\" if they are behind the tee line. A frozen stone is placed in front of and touching the opponent's stone and is difficult to remove. At this point, a team may opt for \"peels\"; throws with a lot of \"weight\" that can move opposition stones out of play.\nConceding a game.\nIt is common at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning. Competitive games end once the losing team has \"run out of rocks\"\u2014that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.\nDispute resolution.\nMost decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials. However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip. No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined. In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the vice skip is the failure of the vice skips to agree on which stone is closest to the button. An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button. When no independent officials are available, the vice skips measure the distances.\nScoring.\nThe winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends. Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone.\nOnly stones that are \"in the house\" are considered in the scoring. A stone is in the house if it lies within the zone or any portion of its edge lies over the edge of the ring. Since the bottom of the stone is rounded, a stone just barely in the house will not have any actual contact with the ring, which will pass under the rounded edge of the stone, but it still counts. This type of stone is known as a \"biter\".\nIt may not be obvious to the eye which of the two rocks is closer to the button (centre) or if a rock is actually biting or not. There are specialized devices to make these determinations, but these cannot be brought out until after an end is completed. Therefore, a team may make strategic decisions during an end based on assumptions of rock position that turn out to be incorrect.\nThe score is marked on a scoreboard, of which there are two types; the baseball type and the club scoreboard.\n\"The baseball-style scoreboard\" was created for televised games for audiences not familiar with the club scoreboard. The \"ends\" are marked by columns 1 through to the regulation number of ends for the competition (usually with an extra column to account for the possibility of an extra end to break ties) plus an additional column for the total. Below this are two rows, one for each team, containing the team's score for that end and their total score in the right-hand column.\n\"The club scoreboard\" is traditional and used in most curling clubs. Scoring on this board only requires the use of (up to) 11 digit cards, whereas with baseball-type scoring an unknown number of multiples of the digits (especially low digits like \"1\" and especially \"0\") may be needed. The numbered centre row represents various possible scores, and the numbers placed in the team rows represent the end in which that team achieved that cumulative score. If the red team scores three points in the first end (called a \"three-ender\"), then a 1 (indicating the first end) is placed beside the number 3 in the red row. If they score two more in the second end, then a 2 will be placed beside the 5 in the red row, indicating that the red team has five points in total (3 + 2). This scoreboard works because only one team can get points in an end. However, some confusion may arise if neither team scores points in an end, this is called a \"blank end\". The blank end numbers are usually listed in the furthest column on the right in the row of the team that has the \"hammer\" (last rock advantage), or on a special spot for blank ends.\nThe following example illustrates the difference between the two types. The example illustrates the men's final at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nEight points \u2013 all the rocks thrown by one team counting \u2013 is the highest score possible in an end, and is known as an \"eight-ender\" or \"snowman\". Scoring an eight-ender is very difficult; in curling, it is the equivalent of pitching a perfect game in baseball. Probably the best-known snowman came at the 2006 Players' Championships. Future (2007) World Champion Kelly Scott scored eight points in one of her games against 1998 World bronze medalist Cathy King.\nCulture.\nCompetition teams are normally named after the skip, for example, Team Martin after skip Kevin Martin. Amateur league players can (and do) creatively name their teams, but when in competition (a bonspiel) the official team will have a standard name.\nTop curling championships are typically played by all-male or all-female teams. It is known as mixed curling when a team consists of two men and two women. For many years, in the absence of world championship or Olympic mixed curling events, national championships (of which the Canadian Mixed Curling Championship was the most prominent) were the highest-level mixed curling competitions. However, a European Mixed Curling Championship was inaugurated in 2005, a World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship was established in 2008, and the European Mixed Championship was replaced with the World Mixed Curling Championship in 2015. A mixed tournament was held at the Olympic level for the first time in 2018, although it was a doubles tournament, not a four-person.\nCurling tournaments may use the Schenkel system for determining the participants in matches.\nCurling is played in many countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom (especially Scotland), the United States, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, and Japan, all of which compete in the world championships.\nCurling has been depicted by many artists including: George Harvey, John Levack, The Dutch School, Charles Martin Hardie, John Elliot Maguire, John McGhie, and John George Brown.\nCurling is particularly popular in Canada. Improvements in ice making and changes in the rules to increase scoring and promote complex strategy have increased the already high popularity of the sport in Canada, and large television audiences watch annual curling telecasts, especially the Scotties Tournament of Hearts (the national championship for women), the Montana's Brier (the national championship for men), and the women's and men's world championships.\nDespite the Canadian province of Manitoba's small population (ranked 5th of 10 Canadian provinces), Manitoban teams have won the Brier more times than teams from any other province, except for Alberta. The Tournament of Hearts and the Brier are contested by provincial and territorial champions, and the world championships by national champions.\nCurling is the provincial sport of Saskatchewan. From there, Ernie Richardson and his family team dominated Canadian and international curling during the late 1950s and early 1960s and have been considered to be the best male curlers of all time. Sandra Schmirler led her team to the first-ever gold medal in women's curling in the 1998 Winter Olympics. When she died two years later from cancer, over 15,000 people attended her funeral, and it was broadcast on national television.\nGood sportsmanship.\nMore so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship, often referred to as the \"Spirit of Curling\", is an integral part of curling. The Spirit of Curling also leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping, or spectacular form. Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses, or gaffes by one's opponent (unlike most team sports), and one should not celebrate one's own good shots during the game beyond modest acknowledgement of the shot such as a head nod, fist bump, or thumbs-up gesture. Modest congratulation, however, may be exchanged between winning team members after the match. On-the-ice celebration is usually reserved for the winners of a major tournament after winning the final game of the championship. It is completely unacceptable to attempt to throw opposing players off their game by way of negative comment, distraction, or heckling.\nA match traditionally begins with players shaking hands with and saying \"good curling\" or \"have a pleasant game\" to each member of the opposing team. It is also traditional in some areas for the winning team to buy the losing team a drink after the game. Even at the highest levels of play, players are expected to call their own fouls.\nIt is not uncommon for a team to concede a curling match after it believes it no longer has any hope of winning. Concession is an honourable act and does not carry the stigma associated with quitting. It also allows for more socializing. To concede a match, members of the losing team offer congratulatory handshakes to the winning team. Thanks, wishes of future good luck, and hugs are usually exchanged between the teams. To continue playing when a team has no realistic chance of winning can be seen as a breach of etiquette.\nAccessibility.\nCurling has been adapted for wheelchair users and people otherwise unable to throw the stone from the hack. These curlers may use a device known as a \"delivery stick\". The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler. At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone. The Canadian Curling Association \"Rules of Curling\" allows the use of a delivery stick in club play, but does not permit it in championships.\nThe delivery stick was specifically invented for elderly curlers in Canada in 1999. In early 2016 an international initiative started to allow use of the delivery sticks by players over 60 years of age in World Curling Federation Senior Championships, as well as in any projected Masters (60+) Championship that develops in the future.\nFloor curling.\nAn iceless variation of the sport called \"floor curling\" was developed by Hong Konger John Li Shek-chong in 2014. Floor curling is governed by the World FloorCurling Federation which was also set up by Li.\nTerminology.\nTerms used to describe the game include:\nThe ice in the game may be \"fast (keen)\" or \"slow\". If the ice is keen, a rock will travel further with a given amount of weight (throwing force) on it. The speed of the ice is measured in seconds. One such measure, known as \"hog-to-hog\" time, is the speed of the stone and is the time in seconds the rock takes from the moment it crosses the near hog line until it crosses the far hog line. If this number is lower, the rock is moving faster, so again low numbers mean more speed. The ice in a match will be somewhat consistent and thus this measure of speed can also be used to measure how far down the ice the rock will travel. Once it is determined that a rock taking (for example) 13 seconds to go from hog line to hog line will stop on the tee line, the curler can know that if the hog-to-hog time is matched by a future stone, that stone will likely stop at approximately the same location. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 16 seconds for guards, 14 seconds for draws, and 8 seconds for peel weight.\n\"The back line to hog line speed\" is used principally by sweepers to get an initial sense of the weight of a stone. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 4.0 seconds for guards, 3.8 seconds for draws, 3.2 for normal hit weight, and 2.9 seconds for peel weight. Especially at the club level, this metric can be misleading, due to amateurs sometimes pushing stones on release, causing the stone to travel faster than the back-to-hog speed.\nChampions and major championships.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable clubs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Notable curling clubs\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The ground's capacity is 29,589; the record attendance is 49,335, for a game against Millwall in 1938. Next to Bishop's Park on the banks of the River Thames, it was originally a royal hunting lodge and has a history dating back over 300 years.\nThe stadium has also been used by national teams and was formerly the home ground for rugby league club .\nLife.\nPre-Fulham.\nThe original Cottage was built in 1780, by William Craven, the sixth Baron Craven and was located close to where the Johnny Haynes Stand is now. At the time, the surrounding areas were woods which once made up part of Anne Boleyn's hunting grounds.\nThe Cottage was lived in by Edward Bulwer-Lytton (who wrote \"The Last Days of Pompeii\") and other somewhat notable (and moneyed) persons until it was destroyed by fire in May 1888. Following the fire, the site was abandoned. Fulham had had 8 previous grounds before settling in at Craven Cottage for good. Therefore, The Cottagers have had 12 grounds overall (including a temporary stay at Loftus Road.) Of particular note, was Ranelagh House, Fulham's palatial home from 1886 to 1888.\nUnder construction: 1894\u20131905.\nWhen representatives of Fulham first came across the land, in 1894, it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it. A deal was struck for the owners of the ground to carry out the work, in return for which they would receive a proportion of the gate receipts.\nThe first football match at which there were any gate receipts was when Fulham played against Minerva in the Middlesex Senior Cup, on 10 October 1896. The ground's first stand was built shortly after. Described as looking like an \"orange box\", it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats, and later was affectionately nicknamed the \"rabbit hutch\".\nIn 1904 London County Council became concerned with the level of safety at the ground, and tried to get it closed. A court case followed in January 1905, as a result of which Archibald Leitch, a Scottish architect who had risen to prominence after his building of the Ibrox Stadium, a few years earlier, was hired to work on the stadium. In a scheme costing \u00a315,000 (a record for the time), he built a pavilion (the present-day 'Cottage' itself) and the Stevenage Road Stand, in his characteristic red brick style.\nThe stand on Stevenage Road celebrated its centenary in the 2005\u20132006 season and, following the death of Fulham FC's favourite son, former England captain Johnny Haynes, in a car accident in October 2005 the Stevenage Road Stand was renamed the Johnny Haynes Stand after the club sought the opinions of Fulham supporters.\nBoth the Johnny Haynes Stand and Cottage remain among the finest examples of Archibald Leitch football architecture to remain in existence and both have been designated as Grade II listed buildings.\nEstablishing itself as a stadium.\nAn England-Wales match was played at the ground in 1907, followed by a rugby league international between England and Australia in 1911.\nOne of the club's directors, Henry Norris, and his friend William Hall took over Arsenal in the early 1910s, the plan being to merge Fulham with Arsenal to form a \"London superclub\" at Craven Cottage. This move was largely motivated by Fulham's failure to gain promotion to the top division of English football. There were also plans for Norris to build a larger stadium on the other side of Stevenage Road, but little need after the merger idea failed. During this era, the Cottage was used for choir singing and marching bands along with other performances, and Mass.\nIn 1933, there were plans to demolish the ground and start again from scratch with a new 80,000 capacity stadium. These plans never materialised, mainly due to the Great Depression.\nOn 8 October 1938, 49,335 spectators watched Fulham play Millwall. It was the largest attendance ever at Craven Cottage and is unlikely to be bettered because the stadium is now an all-seater with room for no more than 29,700. The ground hosted several football games for the 1948 Summer Olympics and is one of the last extant facilities that did.\nPost-World War II.\nIt was not until after Fulham first reached the top division, in 1949, that further improvements were made to the stadium. In 1962 Fulham became the final side in the first division to erect floodlights. An electronic scoreboard was installed on the Riverside Terrace at the same time and flagpoles flying the flags of all of the other first division teams were flown from them. Following the sale of Alan Mullery to Tottenham Hotspur in 1964 (for \u00a372,500) the Hammersmith End had a roof put over it at a cost of approximately \u00a342,500.\nAlthough Fulham were relegated, the development of Craven Cottage continued. The Riverside terracing, infamous for the fact that fans occupying it would turn their heads annually to watch The Boat Race pass, was replaced by what was officially named the 'Eric Miller Stand', Eric Miller being a director of the club at the time. The stand, which cost \u00a3334,000 and held 4,200 seats, was opened with a friendly game against Benfica in February 1972, (which included Eus\u00e9bio). Pel\u00e9 was also to appear on the ground, with a friendly played against his team Santos F.C. The Miller stand brought the seated capacity up to 11,000 out of a total 40,000. Eric Miller committed suicide five years later after a political and financial scandal, and had shady dealings with trying to move Fulham away from the Cottage. The stand is now better known as the Riverside Stand.\nOn Boxing Day 1963, Craven Cottage was the venue of the fastest hat-trick in the history of the English football league, which was completed in less than three minutes, by Graham Leggat. This helped his Fulham team to beat Ipswich 10\u20131 (a club record). The international record is held by Jimmy O'Connor, an Irish player who notched up his hat trick in 2 minutes 14 seconds in 1967.\nBetween 1980 and 1984, Fulham rugby league played their home games at the Cottage. They have since evolved into the London Crusaders, the London Broncos and Harlequins Rugby League before reverting to London Broncos ahead of the 2012 season. Craven Cottage held the team's largest ever crowd at any ground with 15,013, at a game against Wakefield Trinity on 15 February 1981.\nModern times.\nWhen the Hillsborough disaster occurred in 1989, Fulham were in the second bottom rung of The Football League, but following the Taylor report Fulham's ambitious chairman Jimmy Hill tabled plans in 1996 for an all-seater stadium. These plans never came to fruition, partly due to local residents' pressure groups, and by the time Fulham reached the Premier League, they still had standing areas in the ground, something virtually unheard of at the time. A year remained to do something about this (teams reaching the second tier for the first time are allowed a three-year period to reach the required standards for the top two divisions), but by the time the last league game was played there, against Leicester City on 27 April 2002, no building plans had been made. Two more Intertoto Cup games were played there later that year (against FC Haka of Finland and Egaleo FC of Greece), and the eventual solution was to decamp to Loftus Road, home of local rivals QPR. During this time, many Fulham fans only went to away games in protest of moving from Craven Cottage. 'Back to the Cottage', later to become the 'Fulham Supporters Trust', was set up as a fans pressure group to encourage the chairman and his advisers that Craven Cottage was the only viable option for Fulham Football Club.\nAfter one and a half seasons at Loftus Road, no work had been done on the Cottage. In December 2003, plans were unveiled for \u00a38 million worth of major refurbishment work to bring it in line with Premier League requirements. With planning permission granted, work began in January 2004 in order to meet the deadline of the new season. The work proceeded as scheduled and the club were able to return to their home for the start of the 2004\u201305 season. Their first game in the new-look 22,000 all-seater stadium was a pre-season friendly against Watford on 10 July 2004.\nThe current stadium was one of the Premier League's smallest grounds at the time of Fulham's relegation at the end of the 2013\u201314 season (it was third-smallest, after the KC Stadium and the Liberty Stadium). Much admired for its fine architecture, the stadium has recently hosted a few international games, mostly including Australia. This venue is suitable for Australia because most of the country's top players are based in Europe, and West London has a significant community of expatriate Australians. Also, Greece vs. South Korea was hosted on 6 February 2007. In 2011 Brazil played Ghana, in an international friendly, months after hosting the Women's Champions League final.\nCraven Cottage often hosts other events such as 5-a-side football tournaments and weddings. Some have Sunday Lunch at the Riverside restaurant or the 'Cottage Cafe' on non-match days. Craven Cottage hosted the Oxbridge Varsity Football match annually between 1991 and 2000 and again in 2003, 2006 (the same day as the 'Boat Race'), 2008, 2009, and 2014 as well as having a Soccer Aid warm-up match in 2006. The half-time entertainment includes the SW6ers (previously called The Cravenettes) which are a group of female cheerleaders. Other events have included brass bands, Michael Jackson (although just walking on the pitch, as opposed to performing), Travis playing, Arabic dancing, keepie uppie professionals and presentational awards. Most games also feature the 'Fulham flutter', a half-time draw; and a shoot-out competition of some kind, usually involving scoring through a 'hoop' or 'beat the goalie'. On the first home game of the season, there is a carnival where Fulham fans are encouraged to attend in black-and-white colours.\nThe revived Fulham F.C. Women and reserve teams occasionally play home matches at the Cottage. Other than this, they generally play at the club's training ground at Motspur Park. Craven Cottage is known by several affectionate nicknames from fans, including: The (River) Cottage, The Fortress (or Fortress Fulham), Thameside, The Friendly Confines, SW6, Lord of the Banks, The House of Hope, The Pavilion of Perfection, The 'True' Fulham Palace and The Palatial Home. The Thames at the banks of the Cottage is often referred to as 'Old Father' or The River of Dreams.\nThe most accessible route to the ground is to walk through Bishops Park from Putney Bridge (the nearest Underground station), often known as 'The Green Mile' by Fulham fans (as it is roughly a mile walk through pleasant greenery). In 2016 \"The Daily Telegraph\" ranked the Cottage 9th out of 54 grounds to hold Premier League football.\nPlans.\nOn 27 July 2012, Fulham FC were granted permission to redevelop the Riverside Stand, increasing the capacity of Craven Cottage to 30,000 seats. Beforehand various rumours arose including plans to return to ground-sharing with QPR in a new 40,000 seater White City stadium, although these now appear firmly on hold with the construction of the Westfield shopping centre on the proposed site. The board seem to have moved away from their ambition to make Fulham the \"Manchester United of the south\" as it became clear how expensive such a plan would be. With large spaces of land at a premium in south-west London, Fulham appear to be committed to a gradual increase of the ground's capacity often during the summer between seasons. The capacity of Craven Cottage has been increased during summers for instance in 2008 with a small increase in the capacity of the Hammersmith End. Fulham previously announced in 2007 that they are planning to increase the capacity of Craven Cottage by 4,000 seats, but this is yet to be implemented. There were also proposals for a bridge to span the Thames, for a redeveloped Riverside stand and a museum. \nMore substantial plans arose in October 2011 with the 'Fulham Forever' campaign. With Mohamed Al-Fayed selling Harrods department store for \u00a31.5 billion in May 2010 a detailed plan emerged in the Riverside Stand as the only viable area for expansion. The scheme involved the demolition of the back of the Riverside Stand with a new tier of seating added on top of the current one and a row of corporate boxes; bringing Craven Cottage up to 30,000 capacity. Taking into account local residents, the proposal would: reopen the riverside walk; light pollution would be reduced with the removal of floodlight masts; new access points would make match-day crowds more manageable; and the new stand would be respectful in design to its position on the River Thames. Buckingham Group Contracting were chosen in March 2013 as the construction company for the project. In May 2019, the club confirmed that work on the new Riverside Stand would commence in the summer of 2019. During the 2019\u201320, 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322 seasons, the ground's capacity was temporarily reduced to 19,000. The club announced on 17 March 2022 that the lower tier of the Riverside Stand would be open for the 2022\u201323 season for over 2000 supporters, with season tickets going on sale from 29 March.\nThe ground.\nHammersmith End.\nThe Hammersmith End is the northernmost stand in the ground, the closest to Hammersmith. The roofing was financed through the sale of Alan Mullery to Tottenham Hotspur F.C. It is traditionally the \"home\" end where the more vocal Fulham fans sit, and many stand during games at the back rows of the stand. If Fulham win the toss, they usually choose to play towards the Hammersmith End in the second half. The hardcore fans tend to sit (or rather stand) in the back half of the Hammersmith End, plus the entire Block H5 (known as 'H Block' to the faithful). The stand had terracing until the reopening of the ground in 2004, when it was replaced with seating in order to comply with league rules following the Taylor Report. \nPutney End.\nThe Putney End is the southernmost stand in the ground, nearest to Putney and backing onto Bishops Park. This stand hosts home and away fans, separated by stewards, with away fans usually allocated blocks P5 and P6. Flags of every nationality in the Fulham squad were hung from the roofing, although they were removed after the 2006\u201307 season commenced and there is now an electronic scoreboard in place. There is a plane tree in the corner by the river.\nRiverside Stand.\nThe Riverside was originally terracing that backed onto the Thames. It also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans. In 1971\u201372, an all-seater stand was built, originally known as the Riverside Stand (the name was confirmed in the Fulham v Carlisle United programme on 4 December 1971). Its hard lines and metallic and concrete finish are in stark contrast to the Johnny Haynes stand opposite. The stand was opened for a friendly against S.L. Benfica, who included Eus\u00e9bio in the team. In the Fulham v Burnley programme on 4 October 1977, it was revealed that the stand would be renamed the Eric Miller Stand, following the recent death of the former vice-chairman. It is sometimes incorrectly stated that, contrary to the above, the name of the stand was changed from the Eric Miller Stand to The Riverside Stand after the discovery of Miller's suicide. He had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement. The name of the stand actually reverted to \"Riverside Stand\" in the 1990s.\nThe Riverside Stand backs onto the River Thames and is elevated above pitch level, unlike the other three stands. It contained corporate hospitality seating alongside Fulham fans. Jimmy Hill once referred to the Riverside being \"a bit like the London Palladium\" as Blocks V &amp; W (the middle section) were often filled with the rich and famous (including often Al-Fayed). There were then several Harrods advertising hoardings. Above the advertising hoardings was the gantry, for the press and cameras. Tickets in this area were often the easiest to buy, not surprisingly they were also some of the more expensive. The Hammersmith End is to its left, the Putney End to its right and opposite is the Johnny Haynes Stand.\nDuring the 1970s, Craven Cottage flooded, with water flowing in from the riverside. The stand housed the George Cohen restaurant, while on non-match days there was the Cottage Cafe, located near to the Cottage itself. (The River Caf\u00e9 is also located nearby). Under Tommy Trinder's chairmanship in the 60s, flags of all other teams in the Division 1 were proudly flown along the Thames. However, when Fulham were relegated in 1968, Trinder decided not to change the flags as \"Fulham won't be in this division next season\". True to Trinder's prophecy, Fulham were relegated again. The roof of the stand had been used by sponsors, with VisitFlorida advertising in this way, and Pipex.com, FxPro, Lee Cooper Jeans and LG having previously done so.\nAfter the 2019\u201320 season, the stand was demolished and rebuilt. Upon completion, the capacity of the ground will increase to around 29,600. On 26 November 2019, the Chairman Shahid Khan announced that the new development will be known as Fulham Pier, a destination venue outside of match-day use. Several issues postponed completion from 2021 to 2024.\nAs of February 2025 the stand fit out is still being completed.\nJohnny Haynes Stand.\nOriginally called the Stevenage Road Stand, after the road it backs onto, the Johnny Haynes stand is the oldest remaining football stand in the Football League and professional football, originally constructed in 1905, and is a Grade II listed building. Designed by Archibald Leitch, the stand contains the ticket office and club shop and features original 'Bennet' wooden seating. Following his death in 2005, the stand was renamed after former player Johnny Haynes.\nThe exterior facing Stevenage Road has a brick fa\u00e7ade and features the club's old emblem in the artwork. Decorative pillars show the club's foundation date as 1880 though this is thought to be incorrect. Also, a special stone to commemorate the supporters' fund-raising group Fulham 2000, and The Cottagers' return to Craven Cottage, was engraved on the fa\u00e7ade. The family enclosures are located in the two corners of the stand, one nearest to the Hammersmith End and one nearest to the Putney End. The front of the stand now contains plastic seating, but originally was a standing area. Children were often placed at the front of this enclosure and the area had a distinctive white picket fence to keep fans off the pitch up until the 1970s.\nThe Pavilion.\nThe Cottage Pavilion dates back to 1905 along with the Johnny Haynes Stand, built by renowned football architect Archibald Leitch. Besides being the changing rooms, the Cottage (also called The Clubhouse) is traditionally used by the players' families and friends who sit on the balcony to watch the game. In the past, board meetings used to be held in The Cottage itself as well. There is a large tapestry draped from the Cottage which says \"Still Believe\". It encapsulates the moment, when fans facing defeat against Hamburg SV in the Europa League semi-final roused the players with the chant of \"Stand up if you still believe\". In the three other corners of the ground there are what have been described as large 'filing cabinets', which are corporate boxes on three levels, but the box on the other side of the Putney End has been removed due to the redevelopment of the Riverside.\nInternational matches.\nCraven Cottage hosted the Northern Ireland versus Cyprus 1974 World Cup Qualifier on 8 May 1973, a match moved from Belfast due to The Troubles. Northern Ireland won 3\u20130, Sammy Morgan and a Trevor Anderson brace concluded the scoring in the first half.\nOn 22 February 2000, it hosted England's under 21s international under 21 friendly against Argentina's under 21s team. The hosts won 1\u20130 with Lee Hendrie's sixty seventh-minute goal with 15,747 in attendance.\nIn recent years, Craven Cottage has hosted several International Friendly matches, including the Ireland national team who played Colombia and Nigeria there in May 2008 and May 2009 respectively and Oman in 2012.\nThe South Korea national football team have also used the ground thrice in recent years for international friendlies, first against Greece in February 2007 second against Serbia in November 2009, and then against Croatia in February 2013.\nOn 17 November 2007 Australia beat Nigeria 1\u20130 in an international friendly at Craven Cottage.\nOn 26 May 2011, Craven Cottage hosted the game of 2011 UEFA Women's Champions League Final between Lyon and Potsdam. In September 2011, a friendly between Ghana and Brazil was also held at Craven Cottage. \nOn 15 October 2013, Australia beat Canada 3\u20130 at Craven Cottage. On 28 May 2014 Scotland played out a 2\u20132 draw with a Nigerian team who had qualified for the 2014 World Cup Finals.\nOn 27 March 2018, Australia played host to Colombia in the international friendlies, the match ended 0-0, both teams having qualified for the 2018 World Cup Finals in Russia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the city population was 40,713. Cedar Falls is home to the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), a public university.\nCedar Falls, along with neighboring city Waterloo, Iowa, are the two principal municipalities within the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Cedar River traverses the vicinity to the southeast.\nHistory.\nCedar Falls was first settled in March 1845 by brothers-in-law William R. Sturgis and Erasmus D. Adams. Initially, the city was named Sturgis Falls. The city was called Sturgis Falls until it was merged with Cedar City (another city on the other side of the Cedar River), creating Cedar Falls. The city's founders are honored each year with a week-long community-wide celebration named in their honor \u2013 the Sturgis Falls Celebration.\nBecause of the availability of water power, Cedar Falls developed as a milling and industrial center before the Civil War. The establishment of the Civil War Soldiers' Orphans Home in Cedar Falls changed the direction in which the city developed when, following the war, it became the first building on the campus of the Iowa State Normal School (now the University of Northern Iowa).\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nNatural forest, prairie and wetland areas are found within the city limits at the Hartman Reserve Nature Center.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCedar Falls is part of the Waterloo-Cedar Falls metropolitan area.\n2020 census.\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 40,713 people and 15,254 households.

The 47,000 square foot (4,400\u00a0m2) structure, designed by Struxture Architects, replaced the Carniege-Dayton building in early 2004. As of the 2016 fiscal year, the library's holdings included approximately 8,000 audio materials, 12,000 video materials, and 104,000 books and periodicals, for a total of approximately 124,000 items. Patrons made 245,000 visits to take advantage of circulation services, adult, teen, and youth programming. Circulation of library materials for the fiscal year 2016 was 543,134. The library also provides public access to more than 30 public computers that provide internet access, office software suites, high-resolution color printing, Wi-Fi, and games. The library offers digital loaning through Libby, Hoopla, and other platforms.\nThe mission of the Cedar Falls Public Library is to promote literacy and provide open access to resources that facilitate lifelong learning. The library is a member of the Cedar Valley Library Consortium. Cedar Falls Public Library shares an Integrated Library System (SirsiDynix Symphony) with the Waterloo Public Library. Library management is provided by Kelly Stern, Director of the Cedar Falls Public Library.\nHistorical Society.\nThe Cedar Falls Historical Society has its offices in the Victorian Home and Carriage House Museum. It preserves Cedar Falls' history through its five museums, collections, archives, and public programs.

It is currently the home of the Cedar Falls Community Theatre, which was founded in 1978. The company produces seven or eight shows per season.\nThe Gallagher-Bluedorn Performing Arts Center on the University of Northern Iowa campus hosts many professionally touring Broadway plays and musicals throughout the year. The facility's Great Hall can seat 1,680 patrons.\nEducation.\nIt hosts one of three public universities in Iowa, University of Northern Iowa (UNI).\nCedar Falls Community Schools, which covers most of the city limits, includes Cedar Falls High School, two junior high schools, seven elementary schools. Waterloo Community School District covers a small section of Cedar Falls. There is a private Christian school, Valley Lutheran High School. There is a private Catholic elementary school at St. Patrick Catholic Church, under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque. A significant renovation occurred beginning in May 2014.\nThe Malcolm Price Lab School/Northern University High School, was a state-funded K\u201312 school run by the university. It closed in 2012 following cuts at UNI.\nUtilities and internet access.\nThe city owns its power, gas and water, and cable TV services. Because of this, Cedar Falls Utilities provides gigabit speeds to residents, becoming available on January 14, 2015. Cedar Falls has the power to do so because, unlike 19 other states, Iowa does not prohibit municipal broadband from competing with the private cable TV monopoly.

{"id": "6652", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6652", "title": "Cleveland Guardians", "text": "Major League Baseball franchise in Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Cleveland Guardians are an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland. The Guardians compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central Division. Since 1994, the team has played its home games at Progressive Field (originally known as Jacobs Field after the team's then-owner). Since their establishment as a Major League franchise in 1901, the team has won 13 Central Division titles, six American League pennants, and two World Series championships (in 1920 and 1948). The team's World Series championship drought since 1948 is the longest active among all 30 current Major League teams. The team's name references the \"Guardians of Traffic\", eight monolithic 1932 Art Deco sculptures by Henry Hering on the city's Hope Memorial Bridge, which is adjacent to Progressive Field. The team's mascot is named \"Slider\". The team's spring training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona.\nThe franchise originated in 1896 as the Columbus Buckeyes (also known as the Columbus Senators), a minor league team based in Columbus, Ohio that played in the Western League. The team relocated to Grand Rapids, Michigan midseason in 1899, where they were known as the Grand Rapids Furniture Makers. In 1900, the franchise moved to Cleveland and was called the Cleveland Lakeshores. The Western League itself was renamed the American League prior to the 1900 season while continuing its minor league status. When the American League declared itself a major league in 1901, Cleveland was one of its eight charter franchises. Originally called the Cleveland Bluebirds or Blues, the team was also unofficially called the Cleveland Broncos in 1902. Beginning in 1903, the team was named the Cleveland Napoleons or Naps, after team captain and manager Nap Lajoie.\nLajoie left after the 1914 season, and club owner Charles Somers requested that baseball writers choose a new name. They chose the name Cleveland Indians. That name stuck and remained in use for more than a century. Common nicknames for the Indians were \"the Tribe\" and \"the Wahoos\", the latter referencing their longtime logo, Chief Wahoo. After the Indians name came under criticism as part of the Native American mascot controversy, the team adopted the current name, Guardians, starting with the 2022 season.\nFrom August 24 to September 14, 2017, the team won 22 consecutive games, the longest winning streak in American League history and the second longest winning streak in MLB history.\nAs of the end of the 2025 season[ [update]], the franchise's overall major league record is 9,940\u20139,443\u201391 ().\nEarly Cleveland baseball teams.\nAccording to one historian of baseball, \"in 1857, baseball games were a daily spectacle in Cleveland's Public Squares. City authorities tried to find an ordinance forbidding it; to the joy of the crowd, they were unsuccessful.\"\n1865\u20131872: Forest Citys of Cleveland.\nFrom 1865 to 1868 Forest Citys was an amateur ball club. During the 1869 season, Cleveland was among several cities that established professional baseball teams following the success of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional team. In the newspapers before and after 1870, the team was often called the Forest Citys, in the same generic way that the team from Chicago was sometimes called The Chicagos.\nIn 1871 the Forest Citys joined the new National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), the first professional league. Ultimately, two of the league's western clubs went out of business during the first season and the Chicago Fire left that city's White Stockings impoverished, unable to field a team again until 1874. Cleveland was thus the NA's westernmost outpost in 1872, the year the club folded. Cleveland played its full schedule to July 19 followed by two games versus Boston in mid-August and disbanded at the end of the season.\n1879\u20131884: Cleveland Forest Citys and Blues.\nIn 1876, the National League (NL) supplanted the NA as the major professional league. Cleveland was not among its charter members, but by 1879 the league was looking for new entries and the city gained an NL team. A new Cleveland Forest Citys were recreated, but by 1882 were known as the Cleveland Blues, because the National League required distinct colors for that season. The Blues had mediocre records for six seasons and were ruined by a trade war with the Union Association (UA) in 1884, when its three best players (Fred Dunlap, Jack Glasscock, and Jim McCormick) jumped to the UA after being offered higher salaries. The Cleveland Blues merged with the St. Louis Maroons UA team in 1885.\n1887\u20131899: Cleveland Spiders (nicknamed \"Blues\").\nCleveland went without major league baseball for two seasons until gaining a team in the American Association (AA) in 1887. After the AA's Pittsburgh Alleghenys jumped to the NL, Cleveland followed suit in 1889, as the AA began to crumble. The Cleveland ball club, called the Spiders (supposedly inspired by their \"skinny and spindly\" players), slowly became a power in the league. In 1891, the Spiders moved into League Park, which would serve as the home of Cleveland professional baseball for the next 55 years. Led by native Ohioan Cy Young, the Spiders became a contender in the mid-1890s, playing in the Temple Cup Series (that era's World Series) twice and winning it in 1895. The team began to fade after this success, and was dealt a severe blow under the ownership of the Robison brothers.\nPrior to the 1899 season, Frank Robison, the Spiders' owner, bought the St. Louis Browns, thus owning two clubs at the same time. The Browns were renamed the \"Perfectos\", and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Cy Young, Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace. The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. The Spiders were left with essentially a minor league lineup, and began to lose games at a record pace. Drawing almost no fans at home, they ended up playing most of their season on the road, and became known as \"The Wanderers\". The team ended the season in 12th place, 84 games out of first place, with an all-time worst record of 20\u2013134 (.130 winning percentage). Following the 1899 season, the National League disbanded four teams, including the Spiders franchise. The disastrous 1899 season would actually be a step toward a new future for Cleveland fans the next year.\n1890: Cleveland Infants (nickname \"Babes\").\nThe Cleveland Infants competed in the Players' League, which was well-attended in some cities, but club owners lacked the confidence to continue beyond the one season. The Cleveland Infants finished with 55 wins and 75 losses, playing their home games at Brotherhood Park.\nHistory.\n1896\u20131935: Columbus, Grand Rapids, and the early Cleveland years.\nThe origins of the team date back to 1896, when the team was founded as the Columbus Buckeyes, a team based in Columbus, Ohio and competing in the Western League. The club was owned by Tom Loftus, a close friend of both league president Ban Johnson and Charlie Comiskey, owner of the league's St. Paul Saints. In July 1899, the franchise swapped cities and names midseason with the Grand Rapids franchise of the Interstate League, becoming the Grand Rapids Prodigals while remaining in the Western League. \nIn 1900, the team moved to Cleveland and was named the Cleveland Lake Shores, coinciding with Ban Johnson's change of the league name from the Western League to the American League. In 1900, the American League was still considered a minor league. In 1901, the team was called the Cleveland Bluebirds or Blues when the American League broke with the National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League. The Cleveland franchise was among its eight charter members, and is one of four teams that remain in its original city, along with Boston, Chicago, and Detroit.\nThe new team was owned by coal magnate Charles Somers and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy industrialist and also co-owner of the Boston Americans, lent money to other team owners, including Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, to keep them and the new league afloat. Players did not think the name \"Bluebirds\" was suitable for a baseball team. Writers frequently shortened it to Cleveland Blues due to the players' all-blue uniforms, but the players did not like this unofficial name either. The players themselves tried to change the name to Cleveland Bronchos in 1902, but this name never caught on.\nCleveland suffered from financial problems in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider moving to either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati. Relief came in 1902 as a result of the conflict between the National and American Leagues. In 1901, Napoleon \"Nap\" Lajoie, the Philadelphia Phillies' star second baseman, jumped to the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year\u2014one of the highest-profile players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement between the warring leagues. However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania. Mack, partly to thank Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to the then-moribund Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years. Due to the injunction, however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played against the A's in Philadelphia. Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 10,000 fans to League Park. Soon afterward, he was named team captain, and in 1903 the team was called the Cleveland Napoleons or Naps after a newspaper conducted a write-in contest.\nLajoie was named manager in , and the team's fortunes improved somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908. However, the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season as manager but remained on as a player.\nAfter that, the team began to unravel, leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. Cy Young, who returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining years and Addie Joss died from tubercular meningitis prior to the 1911 season.\nDespite a strong lineup anchored by the potent Lajoie and Shoeless Joe Jackson, poor pitching kept the team below third place for most of the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as the Napkins, \"because they fold up so easily\". The team hit bottom in 1914 and 1915, finishing last place both years.\n1915 brought significant changes to the team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old, was no longer a top hitter in the league, batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud with manager Joe Birmingham, the team sold Lajoie back to the A's.\nWith Lajoie gone, the club needed a new name. Somers asked the local baseball writers to come up with a new name, and based on their input, the team was renamed the Cleveland Indians. The name referred to the nickname \"Indians\" that was applied to the Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, played in Cleveland (1897\u20131899).\nAt the same time, Somers' business ventures began to fail, leaving him deeply in debt. With the Indians playing poorly, attendance and revenue suffered. Somers decided to trade Jackson midway through the 1915 season for two players and $31,500, one of the largest sums paid for a player at the time.\nBy 1916, Somers was at the end of his tether, and sold the team to a syndicate headed by Chicago railroad contractor James C. \"Jack\" Dunn. Manager Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, Stan Coveleski and Jim Bagby and traded for center fielder Tris Speaker, who was engaged in a salary dispute with the Red Sox. All three would ultimately become key players in bringing a championship to Cleveland.\nSpeaker took over the reins as player-manager in , and led the team to a championship in 1920. On August 16, 1920, the Indians were playing the Yankees at the Polo Grounds in New York. Shortstop Ray Chapman, who often crowded the plate, was batting against Carl Mays, who had an unusual underhand delivery. It was also late in the afternoon and the infield was completely shaded with the center field area (the batters' background) bathed in sunlight. As well, at the time, \"part of every pitcher's job was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, tobacco juice; it was deliberately scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, even spiked. The result was a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard to see.\"\nIn any case, Chapman did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch came his way. The pitch hit Chapman in the head, fracturing his skull. Chapman died the next day, becoming the only player to sustain a fatal injury from a pitched ball. The Indians, who at the time were locked in a tight three-way pennant race with the Yankees and White Sox, were not slowed down by the death of their teammate. Rookie Joe Sewell hit .329 after replacing Chapman in the lineup.\nIn September 1920, the Black Sox Scandal came to a boil. With just a few games left in the season, and Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck for first place at 94\u201354 and 95\u201356 respectively, the Chicago owner suspended eight players. The White Sox lost two of three in their final series, while Cleveland won four and lost two in their final two series. Cleveland finished two games ahead of Chicago and three games ahead of the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's .388 hitting, Jim Bagby's 30 victories and solid performances from Steve O'Neill and Stan Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the Brooklyn Robins 5\u20132 in the World Series for their first title, winning four games in a row after the Robins took a 2\u20131 Series lead. The Series included three memorable \"firsts\", all of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the home team. In the first inning, right fielder Elmer Smith hit the first Series grand slam. In the fourth inning, Jim Bagby hit the first Series home run by a pitcher. In the top of the fifth inning, second baseman Bill Wambsganss executed the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple play in World Series history, in fact, the only Series triple play of any kind.\nThe team would not reach the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. Speaker and Coveleski were aging and the Yankees were rising with a new weapon: Babe Ruth and the home run. They managed two second-place finishes but spent much of the decade in last place. In 1927 Dunn's widow, Mrs. George Pross (Dunn had died in 1922), sold the team to a syndicate headed by Alva Bradley.\n1936\u20131946: Bob Feller enters the show.\nThe Indians were a middling team by the 1930s, finishing third or fourth most years. 1936 brought Cleveland a new superstar in 17-year-old pitcher Bob Feller, who came from Iowa with a dominating fastball. That season, Feller set a record with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the league in strikeouts from 1938 to 1941.\nOn August 20, 1938, Indians catchers Hank Helf and Frank Pytlak set the \"all-time altitude mark\" by catching baseballs dropped from the Terminal Tower.\nBy , Feller, along with Ken Keltner, Mel Harder and Lou Boudreau, led the Indians to within one game of the pennant. However, the team was wracked with dissension, with some players (including Feller and Mel Harder) going so far as to request that Bradley fire manager Ossie Vitt. Reporters lampooned them as the Cleveland Crybabies. Feller, who had pitched a no-hitter to open the season and won 27 games, lost the final game of the season to unknown pitcher Floyd Giebell of the Detroit Tigers. The Tigers won the pennant and Giebell never won another major league game.\nCleveland entered 1941 with a young team and a new manager; Roger Peckinpaugh had replaced the despised Vitt; but the team regressed, finishing in fourth. Cleveland would soon be depleted of two stars. Hal Trosky retired in 1941 due to migraine headaches and Bob Feller enlisted in the Navy two days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Starting third baseman Ken Keltner and outfielder Ray Mack were both drafted in 1945 taking two more starters out of the lineup.\n1946\u20131949: The Bill Veeck years.\nIn 1946, Bill Veeck formed an investment group that purchased the Cleveland Indians from Bradley's group for a reported $1.6\u00a0million. Among the investors was Bob Hope, who had grown up in Cleveland, and former Tigers slugger, Hank Greenberg.\nA former owner of a minor league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought to Cleveland a gift for promotion. At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced Max Patkin, the \"Clown Prince of Baseball\" as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box was the sort of promotional stunt that delighted fans but infuriated the American League front office.\nRecognizing that he had acquired a solid team, Veeck soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless League Park to take up full-time residence in massive Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The Indians had briefly moved from League Park to Municipal Stadium in mid-1932, but moved back to League Park due to complaints about the cavernous environment. From 1937 onward, however, the Indians began playing an increasing number of games at Municipal, until by 1940 they played most of their home slate there. League Park was mostly demolished in 1951, but has since been rebuilt as a recreational park.\nMaking the most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence moved as much as between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season. The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then-record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game. On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the World Series against the Boston Braves drew over 84,000. The record stood until the Los Angeles Dodgers drew a crowd in excess of 92,500 to watch Game 5 of the 1959 World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the Chicago White Sox.\nUnder Veeck's leadership, one of Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the color barrier in the American League by signing Larry Doby, formerly a player for the Negro league's Newark Eagles in 1947, 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson signed with the Dodgers. Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season. A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League twice in homers.\nIn 1948, needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant race, Veeck turned to the Negro leagues again and signed pitching great Satchel Paige amid much controversy. Barred from Major League Baseball during his prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed by many as another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black pitcher. Paige ended the year with a 6\u20131 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two shutouts.\nIn , veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and Joe Gordon had career offensive seasons, while newcomers Doby and Gene Bearden also had standout seasons. The team went down to the wire with the Boston Red Sox, winning a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, to go to the World Series. In the series, the Indians defeated the Boston Braves four games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau won the American League MVP Award.\nThe Indians appeared in a film the following year titled \"The Kid From Cleveland\", in which Veeck had an interest. The film portrayed the team helping out a \"troubled teenaged fan\" and featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards the end of the season. That season, Cleveland again contended before falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically eliminated from the pennant race.\nLater in 1949, Veeck's first wife (who had a half-stake in Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the team to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan.\n1950\u20131959: Near misses.\nIn , Al Rosen was an All Star for the second year in a row, was named \"The Sporting News\" Major League Player of the Year, and won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in a unanimous vote playing for the Indians after leading the AL in runs, home runs, RBIs (for the second year in a row), and slugging percentage, and coming in second by one point in batting average. Ryan was forced out in 1953 in favor of Myron Wilson, who in turn gave way to William Daley in . Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team composed of Feller, Doby, Minnie Mi\u00f1oso, Luke Easter, Bobby \u00c1vila, Al Rosen, Early Wynn, Bob Lemon, and Mike Garcia continued to contend through the early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, in 1954, finishing second to the New York Yankees five times.\nThe winningest season in franchise history came in 1954, when the Indians finished the season with a record of 111\u201343 (.721). That mark set an American League record for wins that stood for 44 years until the Yankees won 114 games in 1998 (a 162-game regular season record of 114-48/.704). The Indians' 1954 winning percentage of .721 is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the World Series to face the New York Giants. The team could not bring home the title, however, ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The series was notable for Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch off the bat of Vic Wertz in Game 1. Cleveland remained a talented team throughout the remainder of the decade, finishing in second place in 1959, George Strickland's last full year in the majors.\n1960\u20131993: The 33-year slump.\nFrom 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place finish (in 1968) and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1990, and 1992) but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of the standings, including four seasons with over 100 losses (1971, 1985, 1987, 1991).\nFrank Lane becomes general manager.\nThe Indians hired general manager Frank Lane, known as \"Trader\" Lane, away from the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957. Lane over the years had gained a reputation as a GM who loved to make deals. With the White Sox, Lane had made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years. In a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away Red Schoendienst and Harvey Haddix. Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals he regretted were the ones that he did not make.\nOne of Lane's early trades in Cleveland was to send Roger Maris to the Kansas City Athletics in the middle of 1958. Indians executive Hank Greenberg was not happy about the trade and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane. After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and he received good ballplayers in exchange.\nAfter the Maris trade, Lane acquired 25-year-old Norm Cash from the White Sox for Minnie Mi\u00f1oso and then traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians; Cash went on to hit over 350 home runs for the Tigers. The Indians received Steve Demeter in the deal, who had only five at-bats for Cleveland.\nCurse of Rocky Colavito.\nIn 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn just before Opening Day in .\nIt was a blockbuster trade that swapped the AL home run co-champion (Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in . Kuenn, on the other hand, played only one season for the Indians before departing for San Francisco in a trade for an aging Johnny Antonelli and Willie Kirkland. \"Akron Beacon Journal\" columnist Terry Pluto documented the decades of woe that followed the trade in his book \"The Curse of Rocky Colavito\". Despite being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with Lane.\nLane also engineered a unique trade of managers in mid-season 1960, sending Joe Gordon to the Tigers in exchange for Jimmy Dykes. Lane left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued. In 1965, the Indians traded pitcher Tommy John, who would go on to win 288 games in his career, and 1966 Rookie of the Year Tommy Agee to the White Sox to get Colavito back.\nHowever, Indians' pitchers set numerous strikeout records. They led the league in K's every year from 1963 to 1968, and narrowly missed in 1969. The 1964 staff was the first to amass 1,100 strikeouts, and in 1968, they were the first to collect more strikeouts than hits allowed.\nMove to the AL East division.\nThe 1970s were not much better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, including Graig Nettles, Dennis Eckersley, Buddy Bell and 1971 Rookie of the Year Chris Chambliss, for a number of players who made no impact.\nConstant ownership changes did not help the Indians. In 1963, Daley's syndicate sold the team to a group headed by general manager Gabe Paul. Three years later, Paul sold the Indians to Vernon Stouffer, of the Stouffer Corporation empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially strong owner, Stouffer had some non-baseball related financial setbacks and, consequently, the team was cash-poor. In order to solve some financial problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games in New Orleans with a view to a possible move there. After rejecting an offer from George Steinbrenner and former Indian Al Rosen, Stouffer sold the team in 1972 to a group led by Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Barons owner Nick Mileti. Steinbrenner went on to buy the New York Yankees in 1973.\nOnly five years later, Mileti's group sold the team for $11\u00a0million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Steve O'Neill and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul. O'Neill's death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. O'Neill's nephew Patrick O'Neill did not find a buyer until real estate magnates Richard E. and David H. Jacobs purchased the team in 1986.\nThe team was unable to move out of last place, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One highlight was the acquisition of Gaylord Perry in . The Indians traded fireballer \"Sudden Sam\" McDowell for Perry, who became the first Indian pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. In , Cleveland broke another color barrier with the hiring of Frank Robinson as Major League Baseball's first African American manager. Robinson served as player-manager and provided a franchise highlight when he hit a pinch-hit home run on Opening Day. But the high-profile signing of Wayne Garland, a 20-game winner in Baltimore, proved to be a disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and went 28\u201348 over five years. The team failed to improve with Robinson as manager and he was fired in . In 1977, pitcher Dennis Eckersley threw a no-hitter against the California Angels. The next season, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 17 in 1979.\nThe 1970s also featured the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a 1974 game against the Texas Rangers ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the Indians.\nThere were more bright spots in the 1980s. In May 1981, Len Barker threw a perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays, joining Addie Joss as the only other Indian pitcher to do so. \"Super Joe\" Charboneau won the American League Rookie of the Year award. Charboneau was out of baseball by 1983 due to back injuries and Barker, who was also hampered by injuries, never became a consistently dominant starting pitcher.\nEventually, the Indians traded Barker to the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler and Brook Jacoby, who became mainstays of the team for the remainder of the decade. Butler and Jacoby were joined by Joe Carter, Mel Hall, Julio Franco and Cory Snyder, bringing new hope to fans in the late 1980s.\nCleveland's struggles over the 30-year span were highlighted in the 1989 film \"Major League\", which comically depicted a hapless Cleveland ball club going from worst to first by the end of the film.\nThroughout the 1980s, the Indians' owners had pushed for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years in the 1940s and 1950s. However, during the lean years even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. The old stadium was not aging gracefully; chunks of concrete were falling off in sections and the old wooden pilings were petrifying. In 1984, a proposal for a $150\u00a0million domed stadium was defeated in a referendum 2\u20131.\nFinally, in May 1990, Cuyahoga County voters passed an excise tax on sales of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax proceeds were to be used for financing the construction of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, which would include Jacobs Field for the Indians and Gund Arena for the Cleveland Cavs basketball team.\nThe team's fortunes started to turn in 1989, ironically with a very unpopular trade. The team sent power-hitting outfielder Joe Carter to the San Diego Padres for two unproven players, Sandy Alomar Jr. and Carlos Baerga. Alomar made an immediate impact, not only being elected to the All-Star team but also winning Cleveland's fourth Rookie of the Year award and a Gold Glove. Baerga became a three-time All-Star with consistent offensive production.\nIndians general manager John Hart made a number of moves that finally brought success to the team. In , he hired former Indian Mike Hargrove to manage and traded catcher Eddie Taubensee to the Houston Astros who, with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with Kenny Lofton. Lofton finished second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a .285 average and 66 stolen bases.\nThe Indians were named \"Organization of the Year\" by \"Baseball America\" in 1992, in response to the appearance of offensive bright spots and an improving farm system.\nThe team suffered a tragedy during spring training of , when a boat carrying pitchers Steve Olin, Tim Crews, and Bob Ojeda crashed into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, and Ojeda was seriously injured. (Ojeda missed most of the season, and retired the following year).\nBy the end of the 1993 season, the team was in transition, leaving Cleveland Stadium and fielding a talented nucleus of young players. Many of those players came from the Indians' new AAA farm team, the Charlotte Knights, who won the International League title that year.\n1994\u20132001: New beginnings.\n1994: Jacobs Field opens.\nIndians General Manager John Hart and team owner Richard E. Jacobs managed to turn the team's fortunes around. The Indians opened Jacobs Field in 1994 with the aim of improving on the prior season's sixth-place finish. The Indians were only one game behind the division-leading Chicago White Sox on August 12 when a players strike wiped out the rest of the season.\n1995\u20131996: First AL pennant since 1954.\nHaving contended for the division in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland sprinted to a 100\u201344 record (the season was shortened by 18 games due to player/owner negotiations) in 1995, winning its first-ever divisional title. Veterans Dennis Mart\u00ednez, Orel Hershiser and Eddie Murray combined with a young core of players including Omar Vizquel, Albert Belle, Jim Thome, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Kenny Lofton and Charles Nagy to lead the league in team batting average as well as team ERA.\nAfter defeating the Boston Red Sox in the Division Series and the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, Cleveland clinched the American League pennant and a World Series berth, for the first time since 1954. The World Series ended in disappointment, however: the Indians fell in six games to the Atlanta Braves.\nTickets for every Indians home game sold out several months before opening day in 1996. The Indians repeated as AL Central champions but lost to the wild card Baltimore Orioles in the Division Series.\n1997: Two outs away.\nIn 1997, Cleveland started slow but finished with an 86\u201375 record. Taking their third consecutive AL Central title, the Indians defeated the New York Yankees in the Division Series, 3\u20132. After defeating the Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS, Cleveland went on to face the Florida Marlins in the World Series that featured the coldest game in World Series history. With the series tied after Game 6, the Indians went into the ninth inning of Game Seven with a 2\u20131 lead, but closer Jos\u00e9 Mesa allowed the Marlins to tie the game. In the eleventh inning, \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda drove in the winning run giving the Marlins their first championship. Cleveland became the first team to lose the World Series after carrying the lead into the ninth inning of the seventh game. \n1998\u20132001.\nIn 1998, the Indians made the postseason for the fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card Boston Red Sox 3\u20131 in the Division Series, Cleveland lost the 1998 ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had come into the postseason with a then-AL record 114 wins in the regular season.\nFor the 1999 season, Cleveland added relief pitcher Ricardo Rinc\u00f3n and second baseman Roberto Alomar, brother of catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., and won the Central Division title for the fifth consecutive year. The team scored 1,009 runs, becoming the first (and to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox to score more than 1,000 runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not make it past the first round, losing the Division Series to the Red Sox, despite taking a 2\u20130 lead in the series. In game three, Indians starter Dave Burba went down with an injury in the 4th inning. Four pitchers, including presumed game four starter Jaret Wright, surrendered nine runs in relief. Without a long reliever or emergency starter on the playoff roster, Hargrove started both Bartolo Col\u00f3n and Charles Nagy in games four and five on only three days rest. The Indians lost game four 23\u20137 and game five 12\u20138. Four days later, Hargrove was dismissed as manager.\nIn 2000, the Indians had a 44\u201342 start, but caught fire after the All Star break and went 46\u201330 the rest of the way to finish 90\u201372. The team had one of the league's best offenses that year and a defense that yielded three gold gloves. However, they ended up five games behind the Chicago White Sox in the Central division and missed the wild card by one game to the Seattle Mariners. Mid-season trades brought Bob Wickman and Jake Westbrook to Cleveland. After the season, free-agent outfielder Manny Ram\u00edrez departed for the Boston Red Sox.\nIn 2000, Larry J. Dolan bought the Indians for $320\u00a0million from Richard E. Jacobs, who, along with his late brother David, had paid $45\u00a0million for the club in 1986. The sale set a record at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise.\n2001 saw a return to the postseason. After the departures of Ram\u00edrez and Sandy Alomar Jr., the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former MVP Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, who helped the team win the Central division with a 91\u201371 record. One of the highlights came on August 5, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14\u20132 deficit in the seventh inning to defeat the Seattle Mariners 15\u201314 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won an MLB record-tying 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager Charlie Manuel had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly out of reach.\nSeattle and Cleveland met in the first round of the postseason; however, the Mariners won the series 3\u20132. In the 2001\u201302 offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant, Mark Shapiro, took the reins.\n2002\u20132010: The Shapiro/Wedge years.\nFirst \"rebuilding of the team\".\nShapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent. He traded Roberto Alomar to the New York Mets for a package that included outfielder Matt Lawton and prospects Alex Escobar and Billy Traber. When the team fell out of contention in mid-, Shapiro fired manager Charlie Manuel and traded pitching ace Bartolo Col\u00f3n for prospects Brandon Phillips, Cliff Lee, and Grady Sizemore; acquired Travis Hafner from the Rangers for Ryan Drese and Einar D\u00edaz; and picked up Coco Crisp from the St. Louis Cardinals for aging starter Chuck Finley. Jim Thome left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract.\nYoung Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and under new manager Eric Wedge. They posted strong offensive numbers in , but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 22\u20130 victory over the New York Yankees on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.\nIn early , the offense got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the Indians caught fire in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central Division down to 1.5 games. However, the season came to an end as the Indians went on to lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, missing the playoffs by only two games. Shapiro was named Executive of the Year in 2005. The next season, the club made several roster changes, while retaining its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted by the acquisition of top prospect Andy Marte from the Boston Red Sox. The Indians had a solid offensive season, led by career years from Travis Hafner and Grady Sizemore. Hafner, despite missing the last month of the season, tied the single season grand slam record of six, which was set in by Don Mattingly. Despite the solid offensive performance, the bullpen struggled with 23 blown saves (a Major League worst), and the Indians finished a disappointing fourth.\nIn , Shapiro signed veteran help for the bullpen and outfield in the offseason. Veterans Aaron Fultz and Joe Borowski joined Rafael Betancourt in the Indians bullpen. The Indians improved significantly over the prior year and went into the All-Star break in second place. The team brought back Kenny Lofton for his third stint with the team in late July. The Indians finished with a 96\u201366 record tied with the Red Sox for best in baseball, their seventh Central Division title in 13 years and their first postseason trip since 2001.\nThe Indians began their playoff run by defeating the Yankees in the ALDS three games to one. This series will be most remembered for the swarm of bugs that overtook the field in the later innings of Game Two. They also jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead over the Red Sox in the ALCS. The season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance to the 2007 World Series.\nDespite the loss, Cleveland players took home a number of awards. Grady Sizemore, who had a .995 fielding percentage and only two errors in 405 chances, won the Gold Glove award, Cleveland's first since 2001. Indians Pitcher CC Sabathia won the second Cy Young Award in team history with a 19\u20137 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 241 innings pitched. Eric Wedge was awarded the first Manager of the Year Award in team history. Shapiro was named to his second Executive of the Year in 2007.\nSecond \"rebuilding of the team\".\nThe Indians struggled during the 2008 season. Injuries to sluggers Travis Hafner and Victor Martinez, as well as starting pitchers Jake Westbrook and Fausto Carmona led to a poor start. The Indians, falling to last place for a short time in June and July, traded CC Sabathia to the Milwaukee Brewers for prospects Matt LaPorta, Rob Bryson, and Michael Brantley. and traded starting third baseman Casey Blake for catching prospect Carlos Santana. Pitcher Cliff Lee went 22\u20133 with an ERA of 2.54 and earned the AL Cy Young Award. Grady Sizemore had a career year, winning a Gold Glove Award and a Silver Slugger Award, and the Indians finished with a record of 81\u201381.\nProspects for the 2009 season dimmed early when the Indians ended May with a record of 22\u201330. Shapiro made multiple trades: Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco to the Philadelphia Phillies for prospects Jason Knapp, Carlos Carrasco, Jason Donald and Lou Marson; Victor Martinez to the Boston Red Sox for prospects Bryan Price, Nick Hagadone and Justin Masterson; Ryan Garko to the Texas Rangers for Scott Barnes; and Kelly Shoppach to the Tampa Bay Rays for Mitch Talbot. The Indians finished the season tied for fourth in their division, with a record of 65\u201397. The team announced on September 30, 2009, that Eric Wedge and all of the team's coaching staff were released at the end of the 2009 season. Manny Acta was hired as the team's 40th manager on October 25, 2009.\nOn February 18, 2010, it was announced that Shapiro (following the end of the 2010 season) would be promoted to team President, with current President Paul J. Dolan becoming the new Chairman/CEO, and longtime Shapiro assistant Chris Antonetti filling the GM role.\n2011\u2013present: Antonetti/Chernoff/Francona era.\nOn January 18, 2011, longtime popular former first baseman and manager Mike Hargrove was brought in as a special adviser. The Indians started the 2011 season strong\u00a0\u2013 going 30\u201315 in their first 45 games and seven games ahead of the Detroit Tigers for first place. Injuries led to a slump where the Indians fell out of first place. Many minor leaguers such as Jason Kipnis and Lonnie Chisenhall got opportunities to fill in for the injuries. The biggest news of the season came on July 30 when the Indians traded four prospects for Colorado Rockies star pitcher, Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez. The Indians sent their top two pitchers in the minors, Alex White and Drew Pomeranz along with Joe Gardner and Matt McBride. On August 25, the Indians signed the team leader in home runs, Jim Thome off of waivers. He made his first appearance in an Indians uniform since he left Cleveland after the 2002 season. To honor Thome, the Indians placed him at his original position, third base, for one pitch against the Minnesota Twins on September 25. It was his first appearance at third base since 1996, and his last for Cleveland. The Indians finished the season in 2nd place, 15 games behind the division champion Tigers.\nThe Indians broke Progressive Field's Opening Day attendance record with 43,190 against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5, 2012. The game went 16 innings, setting the MLB Opening Day record, and lasted 5 hours and 14 minutes.\nOn September 27, 2012, with six games left in the Indians' 2012 season, Manny Acta was fired; Sandy Alomar Jr. was named interim manager for the remainder of the season. On October 6, the Indians announced that Terry Francona, who managed the Boston Red Sox to five playoff appearances and two World Series between 2004 and 2011, would take over as manager for 2013.\nThe Indians entered the 2013 season following an active offseason of dramatic roster turnover. Key acquisitions included free agent 1B/OF Nick Swisher and CF Michael Bourn. The team added prized right-handed pitching prospect Trevor Bauer, OF Drew Stubbs, and relief pitchers Bryan Shaw and Matt Albers in a three-way trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds that sent RF Shin-Soo Choo to the Reds, and Tony Sipp to the Arizona Diamondbacks Other notable additions included utility man Mike Avil\u00e9s, catcher Yan Gomes, designated hitter Jason Giambi, and starting pitcher Scott Kazmir. The 2013 Indians increased their win total by 24 over 2012 (from 68 to 92), finishing in second place, one game behind Detroit in the Central division, but securing the number one seed in the American League Wild Card Standings. In their first postseason appearance since 2007, Cleveland lost the 2013 American League Wild Card Game 4\u20130 at home to Tampa Bay. Francona was recognized for the turnaround with the 2013 American League Manager of the Year Award.\nWith an 85\u201377 record, the 2014 Indians had consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1999\u20132001, but they were eliminated from playoff contention during the last week of the season and finished third in the AL Central.\nIn 2015, after struggling through the first half of the season, the Indians finished 81\u201380 for their third consecutive winning season, which the team had not done since 1999\u20132001. For the second straight year, the Tribe finished third in the Central and was eliminated from the Wild Card race during the last week of the season. Following the departure of longtime team executive Mark Shapiro on October 6, the Indians promoted GM Chris Antonetti to President of Baseball Operations, assistant general manager Mike Chernoff to GM, and named Derek Falvey as assistant GM. Falvey was later hired by the Minnesota Twins in 2016, becoming their President of Baseball Operations.\nThe Indians set what was then a franchise record for longest winning streak when they won their 14th consecutive game, a 2\u20131 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in 19 innings on July 1, 2016, at Rogers Centre. The team clinched the Central Division pennant on September 26, their eighth division title overall and first since 2007, as well as returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2013. They finished the regular season at 94\u201367, marking their fourth straight winning season, a feat not accomplished since the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe Indians began the 2016 postseason by sweeping the Boston Red Sox in the best-of-five American League Division Series, then defeated the Blue Jays in five games in the 2016 American League Championship Series to claim their sixth American League pennant and advance to the World Series against the Chicago Cubs. It marked the first appearance for the Indians in the World Series since 1997 and first for the Cubs since 1945. The Indians took a 3\u20131 series lead following a victory in Game 4 at Wrigley Field, but the Cubs rallied to take the final three games and won the series 4 games to 3. The Indians' 2016 success led to Francona winning his second AL Manager of the Year Award with the club.\nFrom August 24 through September 15 during the 2017 season, the Indians set a new American League record by winning 22 games in a row. On September 28, the Indians won their 100th game of the season, marking only the third time in history the team has reached that milestone. They finished the regular season with 102 wins, second-most in team history (behind 1954's 111 win team). The Indians earned the AL Central title for the second consecutive year, along with home-field advantage throughout the American League playoffs, but they lost the 2017 ALDS to the Yankees 3\u20132 after being up 2\u20130.\nIn 2018, the Indians won their third consecutive AL Central crown with a 91\u201371 record, but were swept in the 2018 American League Division Series by the Houston Astros, who outscored Cleveland 21\u20136. In 2019, despite a two-game improvement, the Indians missed the playoffs as they trailed three games behind the Tampa Bay Rays for the second AL Wild Card berth. During the 2020 season (shortened to 60 games because of the COVID-19 pandemic), the Indians were 35\u201325, finishing second behind the Minnesota Twins in the AL Central, but qualified for the expanded playoffs. In the best-of-three AL Wild Card Series, the Indians were swept by the New York Yankees, ending their season.\nIn February 2025, Larry J. Dolan, who owned the team since the year 2000 and served as the longest owner in the history of the Cleveland franchise, died. His son Paul, who is listed as the team's \"Owner/CEO/Chairman,\" has held ownership duties over the team since 2013, and is also the only of Larry J. Dolan's children who has held major leadership roles over the Guardians.\nGuardians rebranding.\nOn December 18, 2020, the team announced that the Indians name and logo would be dropped after the 2021 season, later revealing the replacement to be the Guardians. In their first season as the Guardians, the team won the 2022 AL Central Division crown, marking the 11th division title in franchise history. In the best-of-three AL Wild Card Series, the Guardians won the series against the Tampa Bay Rays 2\u20130, to advance to the AL Division Series. The Guardians lost the series to the New York Yankees 3\u20132, ending their season. In June 2022, sports investor David Blitzer bought a 25% stake in the franchise with an option to acquire controlling interest in 2028.\nFollowing Francona's retirement at the end of the 2023 season, the Guardians named Stephen Vogt as their new manager on November 6, 2023. Vogt would lead the Guardians to a bounce-back season, winning the AL Central with a 92\u201369 record. The Guardians would beat their AL Central rival the Detroit Tigers in the AL Division Series in five games, but would lose to the New York Yankees in the AL Pennant in five games.\nIn 2025, Vogt led the team back from a 15.5 game deficit in July, to overtake Detroit and win the second straight AL Central title under his watch.\nRivalries.\nCincinnati Reds.\nThe rivalry with fellow Ohio team the Cincinnati Reds is known as the Battle of Ohio or Buckeye Series and features the Ohio Cup trophy for the winner. Prior to 1997, the winner of the cup was determined by an annual pre-season baseball game, played each year at minor-league Cooper Stadium in the state capital of Columbus, and staged just days before the start of each new Major League Baseball season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, with the Guardians winning six of them. It ended with the start of interleague play in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.\nSince 1997, the two teams have played each other as part of the regular season, with the exception of 2002. The Ohio Cup was reintroduced in 2008 and is presented to the team who wins the most games in the series that season. Initially, the teams played one three-game series per season, meeting in Cleveland in 1997 and Cincinnati the following year. The teams have played two series per season against each other since 1999, with the exception of 2002, one at each ballpark. A format change in 2013 made each series two games, except in years when the AL and NL Central divisions meet in interleague play, where it is usually extended to three games per series. As of June\u00a02025[ [update]], the Guardians lead the series 77\u201364.\nDetroit Tigers.\nThe Guardians share a rivalry with the Detroit Tigers fueled by geographic proximity between the two cities, and elements from the intense rivalry between Michigan and Ohio State. The rivalry with came to a head on August 7, 2013, with the teams first and second in the AL Central standings. Many Tigers fans who made the short trip to Cleveland started a \"Let's go Tigers!\" chant while the game was tied in the nith inning. Cleveland fans countered with a \"Detroit's bankrupt!\" chant, in reference to the city's 2013 bankruptcy. Footage of the chants from SportsTime Ohio circulated online, with many baseball fans on social media criticizing Cleveland fans for the chant due to the circumstances of Detroit's financial situation. The Tigers ended up defeating Cleveland 6\u20135 in 14 innings. The two teams have played almost evenly over their 125-year history with Detroit holding a narrow 1,168\u20131,167 lead. The teams have met twice in the postseason, with Cleveland winning the 2024 AL Division Series and Detroit winning the 2025 AL Wild Card Series.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Chicago White Sox are another rival, dating back to the 1959 season, when the Sox slipped past the Indians to win the AL pennant. The rivalry intensified when both clubs were moved to the newly created AL Central in 1994. During that season, the two teams challenged for the division title, with the Indians one game back of Chicago when the season ended in August due to the players' strike. During a game in Chicago, the White Sox confiscated Albert Belle's corked bat, followed by an attempt by Indians pitcher Jason Grimsley to crawl through the Comiskey Park clubhouse ceiling to retrieve it. Belle later signed with the White Sox in 1997, adding additional intensity to the rivalry. In 2005, the White Sox led the division by 15 games in July, only to see the Indians trim the lead to a single game late in the season. However, the White Sox swept a three-game series to end the season to win the division by six games; the Sox later won that year's World Series.\nOn August 5, 2023, Cleveland third baseman Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez and Chicago shortstop Tim Anderson instigated a bench-clearing brawl after Anderson applied a tag to Ram\u00edrez. Anderson then attempted to punch Ram\u00edrez, after which Ram\u00edrez wound up knocking Anderson to the ground with a right hook. Anderson and Ram\u00edrez were suspended five and two games, respectively, for their roles in the brawl.\nUniforms.\nThe official team colors are navy blue, red, and white.\nHome.\nThe primary home uniform is white with red and navy blue piping around each sleeve. Across the front of the jersey in script font is the word \"Guardians\" in red with a navy blue outline, with navy blue undershirts, belts, and socks.\nThe alternate home jersey is red with a navy blue \"diamond C\" font \"Guardians\" trimmed in white on the front, and white and navy blue piping on both sleeves, with navy blue undershirts, belts, and socks.\nIn 2024, the team introduced \"City Connect\" uniforms, primarily (but not exclusively) worn on Friday home dates. The jerseys are blue with red and white stripes going down the sleeve, featuring \"CLE\" on the front of the jersey and the player names and numbers on the back (all in a white art deco style font), with sandstone colored pants and red socks featuring a logo which was also introduced in 2024 (a \"Guardians of Traffic\" statue holding a baseball bat).\nThe standard home cap is red with a navy blue bill, and features a navy blue \"diamond C\" on the front and is worn with the primary white uniforms. With the alternate red jerseys, the cap is navy blue with a red bill and red \"diamond C\". The \"City Connect\" home cap is similar to the alternate cap with the exception of the front section over the bill being white.\nRoad.\nThe primary road uniform is gray, with \"Cleveland\" in navy blue \"diamond C\" letters, trimmed in red across the front of the jersey, red and navy blue piping around the sleeves, and navy blue undershirts, belts, and socks.\nThe alternate road jersey is navy blue with a red \"diamond C\" trimmed in white on the front of the jersey, red and white piping around the sleeves, and navy blue undershirts, belts, and socks.\nWith either road jersey, the team wears a navy blue cap with a red bill and red \"diamond C\".\nUniversal.\nFor all games, the team uses a navy blue batting helmet with a red \"diamond C\" on the front.\nAll jerseys (sans the \"City Connect\" version) feature the \"winged G\" logo on one sleeve, and every jersey has a patch from Marathon Petroleum \u2013 in a sponsorship deal lasting through the 2026 season \u2013 on the other. The sleeve featuring the Marathon logo depends on how the player bats \u2013 left handed hitters have it on their right sleeve, as that is the arm facing the main TV camera when he bats, and vice versa for right handed batters.\nFormer name and logo controversy.\nThe club name and its cartoon logo have been criticized for perpetuating Native American stereotypes. In 1997 and 1998, protesters were arrested after effigies were burned. Charges were dismissed in the 1997 case, and were not filed in the 1998 case. Protesters arrested in the 1998 incident subsequently fought and lost a lawsuit alleging that their First Amendment rights had been violated.\nBud Selig (then\u2013commissioner of baseball) said in 2014 that he had never received a complaint about the logo. He has heard that there are some protesting against the mascots, but individual teams such as the Indians and Atlanta Braves, whose name was also criticized for similar reasons, should make their own decisions. An organized group consisting of Native Americans, which had protested for many years, protested Chief Wahoo on Opening Day 2015, noting that this was the 100th anniversary since the team became the Indians. Owner Paul Dolan, while stating his respect for the critics, said he mainly heard from fans who wanted to keep Chief Wahoo, and had no plans to change.\nOn January 29, 2018, Major League Baseball announced that Chief Wahoo would be removed from the Indians' uniforms for the 2019 season, stating that the logo was no longer appropriate for on-field use. The block \"C\" was promoted to the primary logo; at the time, there were no plans to change the team's name.\nIn 2020, protests over the murder of George Floyd, a black man, by a Minneapolis police officer, led the United States into a period of social changes. This made Dolan reconsider use of the Indians name. On July 3, 2020, on the heels of the Washington Redskins announcing that they would \"undergo a thorough review\" of that team's name, the Indians announced that they would \"determine the best path forward\" regarding the team's name and emphasized the need to \"keep improving as an organization on issues of social justice\".\nOn December 13, 2020, it was reported that the Indians name would be dropped after the 2021 season out of respect for the Native American community. It had been hinted by the team that they may move forward without a replacement name (in a similar manner to the Washington Football Team, which used its name for two years until being named the Washington Commanders). It was announced via Twitter on July 23, 2021, that the team will be named the Guardians, after the \"Guardians of Traffic\", eight large Art Deco statues on the Hope Memorial Bridge, located close to Progressive Field.\nThe club, however, found itself amid a trademark dispute with a men's roller derby team called the Cleveland Guardians. The Cleveland Guardians roller derby team has competed in the Men's Roller Derby Association since 2016. In addition, two other entities have attempted to preempt the team's use of the trademark by filing their own registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The roller derby team filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on October 27, 2021, seeking to block the baseball team's name change. On November 16, 2021, the lawsuit was resolved, and both teams were allowed to continue using the Guardians name. The name change from Indians to Guardians became official on November 19, 2021.\nMedia.\nRadio.\nCleveland radio stations WTAM (1100 AM and 106.9 FM) and WMMS (100.7 FM), both owned by iHeartMedia, serve as flagship stations for the Cleveland Guardians Radio Network. Ford C. Frick Award winner Tom Hamilton and Jim Rosenhaus comprise the announcing team and call all games on-site.\nFellow sister station WARF (1350 AM) - while primarily an English language station - serves as the team's Spanish flagship, airing broadcasts of home games. Rafa Hern\u00e1ndez-Brito serves as the primary Spanish announcer, alongside analyst and former Indian Carlos Baerga.\nTV.\nRegular season games not broadcast by MLB's national TV partners are shown exclusively on Guardians TV, operated by MLB Local Media, which launched on February 11, 2025. Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC channel 3 simulcasts select games, plus airs a weekly team centered sportscast titled \"Guardians Tonight\" Sunday nights. \nLead announcer Matt Underwood, analyst and former Indians Gold Glove-winning centerfielder Rick Manning, and field reporter Andre Knott form the TV broadcast team, with Al Pawlowski hosting the pre- and postgame shows, alongside former Indian Chris Gimenez serving as analyst, with various other former Indians/Guardians making guest appearances.

{"id": "6653", "revid": "47988270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6653", "title": "Cape Town", "text": "Legislative capital of South Africa\nCape Town is the legislative capital of South Africa. It is the country's oldest city and the seat of the Parliament of South Africa. Cape Town is the country's second-largest city by population, after Johannesburg, and the largest city in the Western Cape. The city is part of the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality.\nThe city is known for its harbour, its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and Cape Point. Cape Town has been named the best city in the world, and world's best city for travelers, numerous times, including by \"The New York Times\" in 2014, \"Time Out\" in 2025, and \"The Telegraph\" for the past 8 years (2017 through 2025).\nLocated on the shore of Table Bay, the City Bowl area of Cape Town, which contains its central business district (CBD), is the oldest urban area in the Western Cape, with a significant cultural heritage. The metropolitan area has a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, which includes a northern section in the West Beach region, as well as the False Bay area in the south.\nThe Table Mountain National Park is within the city boundaries and there are several other nature reserves and marine-protected areas within and adjacent to the city. These include Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, which contains 5 of South Africa's 6 biomes, and displays many plants native to the Cape region.\nCape Town has South Africa's highest household incomes, lowest rate of unemployment, highest level of infrastructure investment, strongest service delivery performance, largest tourism appeal, and most robust real estate market.\nHistory.\nEarly period.\nThe earliest known remnants of human occupation in the region were found at Peers Cave in Fish Hoek and have been dated to between 15,000 and 12,000 years old.\nBartolomeu Dias, the first European to reach the area, arrived in 1488 and named it \"Cape of Storms\" (). It was later renamed by John II of Portugal as \"Cape of Good Hope\" () because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to the Indian subcontinent and East Indies.\nIn 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama recorded a sighting of the Cape of Good Hope.\nIn 1510, at the Battle of Salt River, the Portuguese admiral Francisco de Almeida and sixty-four of his men were killed and his party was defeated by the \"Goringhaiqua\" in Dutch approximate spelling) using cattle that were specially trained to respond to whistles and shouts. The Gorinaiqua were one of the Khoikhoi clans who inhabited the area.\nIn the late 16th century French, Danish, Dutch, and English, but mainly Portuguese, ships regularly continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper, and iron with the Khoikhoi clans of the region in exchange for fresh meat and other essential traveling provisions.\nDutch period.\nIn 1652, Jan van Riebeeck and other employees of the United East India Company (, VOC) were sent to the Cape Colony to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the Dutch East Indies, and the Fort de Goede Hoop (later replaced by the Castle of Good Hope).\nThe settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the local authorities to import enslaved people from Indonesia and Madagascar. Many of these people are ancestors of modern-day Cape Coloured and Cape Malay communities.\nUnder Van Riebeeck and his successors, as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, a wide range of agricultural plants were introduced to the Cape. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples and citrus, had a large and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region.\nBritish period.\nWith the Dutch Republic being transformed into Revolutionary France's vassal Batavian Republic, Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies, including the colonial possessions of the VOC.\nBritain captured Cape Town in 1795, but it was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the Battle of Blaauwberg when the Batavian Republic allied with Britain's rival, France, during the Napoleonic Wars. Following the conclusion of the war Cape Town was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.\nThe city became the capital of the newly formed Cape Colony, whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s, partially as a result of numerous wars with the amaXhosa on the colony's eastern frontier. In 1833 slavery was abolished in the colony freeing over 5500 slaves in the city, almost a third of the city's population at the time. The Convict Crisis of 1849, marked by substantial civil upheaval, bolstered the push for self-governance in the Cape.\nWith expansion came calls for greater independence from the UK, with the Cape attaining its own parliament (1854) and a locally accountable Prime Minister (1872). Suffrage was established according to the non-racial Cape Qualified Franchise.\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, additional plant species were introduced from Australia by the British authorities. Notably rooikrans was introduced to stabilise the sand of the Cape Flats to allow for a road connecting the peninsula with the rest of the African continent and eucalyptus was used to drain marshes.\nIn 1859 the first railway line was built by the Cape Government Railways and a system of railways rapidly expanded in the 1870s. The discovery of diamonds in Griqualand West in 1867, and the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886, prompted a flood of immigration into South Africa. In 1895 the city's first public power station, the Graaff Electric Lighting Works, was opened.\nConflicts between the Boer republics in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902. Britain's victory in this war led to the formation of a united South Africa. From 1891 to 1901, the city's population more than doubled from 67,000 to 171,000.\nAs the 19th century came to an end, the economic and political dominance of Cape Town in the Southern Africa region during the 19th century started to give way to the dominance of Johannesburg and Pretoria in the 20th century.\nSouth African period.\nIn 1910 Britain established the Union of South Africa which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British colony of Natal. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the Republic of South Africa.\nBy the time of the 1936 census, Johannesburg had overtaken Cape Town as the largest city in the country.\nIn 1945 the expansion of the Cape Town foreshore was completed, adding an additional to the Cape Town CBD, and by extension, the City Bowl region.\nApartheid era.\nPrior to the mid-twentieth century Cape Town was one of the most racially integrated cities in South Africa. In the 1948 national elections the National Party won on a platform of \"apartheid\" (racial segregation) under the slogan of \"swart gevaar\" (Afrikaans for \"black danger\"). This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the Cape's multiracial franchise.\nIn 1950 the apartheid government first introduced the Group Areas Act, which classified and segregated urban areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of residents deemed unlawful by apartheid legislation, or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was the suburb of District Six. After it was declared a whites-only area in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed. Many of these residents were relocated to the Cape Flats.\nThe earliest of the Cape Flats forced removals saw the expulsion of Black South Africans to Langa, Cape Town's first and oldest township, in line with the 1923 Native Urban Areas Act.\nUnder apartheid the Cape was considered a \"Coloured labour preference area\", to the exclusion of \"Bantus\", i.e. Black Africans. The implementation of this policy was widely opposed by trade unions, civil society and opposition parties. It is notable that this policy was not advocated for by any Coloured political group, and its implementation was a unilateral decision by the apartheid government.\nDuring the student-led Soweto Uprising of June 1976, school students from Langa, Gugulethu and Nyanga in Cape Town reacted to the news of the protests against Bantu Education by organising gatherings and marches of their own. A number of school buildings were burnt down and the protest action was met with forceful resistance from the police.\nCape Town has been home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. In Table Bay, from the city is Robben Island. This penitentiary island was the site of a maximum security prison where many famous apartheird-era political prisoners served long prison sentences. Famous prisoners include activist, lawyer and future president Nelson Mandela who served 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment on the island, as well as two other future presidents, Kgalema Motlanthe and Jacob Zuma.\nIn one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech since his imprisonment from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall, hours after being released on 11 February 1990. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country. The first democratic election was held four years later on 27 April 1994.\nNobel Square in the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront features statues of South Africa's four Nobel Peace Prize winners: Albert Luthuli, Desmond Tutu, F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela.\nPost-apartheid era.\nCape Town has undergone significant changes in the years since Apartheid. Cape Town has experienced economic growth and development in the post-apartheid era. The city has become a major economic hub in South Africa, attracting international investment and tourism. The Democratic Alliance (DA), a liberal political party which came to power in Cape Town in 2006, has been credited with improving bureaucratic efficiency, public safety and fostering economic development.\nOpinion polls show that South Africans view the Western Cape as the best governed province, Cape Town as the best governed city in the country. Of South Africa's 257 municipalities, only 38 received a clean financial audit in 2022 from the Auditor-General. Of those, 21 were in the Western Cape.\nThe city's economy has diversified, with growth in sectors such as technology, finance, real estate, and tourism. The establishment of the City Centre Improvement District (CCID) has been particularly successful in revitalizing the city center, bringing businesses and people back into the area. This initiative has transformed public spaces such as Greenmarket Square, Company's Garden, and St George's Mall, attracting both locals and tourists.\nIn 2014 Cape Town was named World Design Capital of the Year. Cape Town was voted the best tourist destination in Africa at the 2023 World Travel Awards in Dubai and continues to be the most important tourist destination in the country. Cape Town has been named the best travel city in the world every year since 2013 in the Telegraph Travel Awards.\nThe legacy of apartheid's spatial planning is still evident, with significant disparities between affluent areas and impoverished townships. 60% of the city's population live in townships and informal settlements far from the city centre. The legacy of Apartheid means Cape Town remains one of the most racially segregated cities in South Africa. Many Black South Africans continue to live in informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. The unemployment rate remains high at 23% (though nearly 10 points lower than the nationwide average), particularly among historically disadvantaged groups, and economic opportunities are unevenly distributed.\nCape Town faced a severe water shortage from 2015 to 2018. According to Oxfam, \"in the face of an imminent water shortage, the city of Cape Town in South Africa successfully reduced its water use by more than half in three years, cutting it from 1.2bn litres per day in February 2015 to 516m litres per day in 2018.\"\nIn 2021 Cape Town also experienced a violent turf war between rival mini-bus taxi firms which led to the deaths of 83 people. Two years later a strike by the mini-bus taxi firms resulted in 5 deaths.\nSince the 2010s, Cape Town and the wider Western Cape province have seen the rise of a small secessionist movement. Support for parties \"which have formally adopted Cape independence\" was around 5% in the 2021 municipal elections.\nGeography and the natural environment.\nCape Town is located at latitude 33.55\u00b0 S (approximately the same as Sydney and Buenos Aires and equivalent to Casablanca and Los Angeles in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25\u00b0 E.\nTable Mountain, with its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over high, and with Devil's Peak and Lion's Head on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop, which creates the City Bowl. This area comprises the Cape Town CBD as well as numerous suburbs on the mountainside.\nA thin strip of cloud, known colloquially as the \"tablecloth\" (\"Karos\" in Afrikaans), sometimes forms on top of the mountain. To the immediate south of the city, the Cape Peninsula is a scenic mountainous spine jutting southward into the Atlantic Ocean and terminating at Cape Point.\nThere are over 70 peaks above within Cape Town's official metropolitan limits. Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the Cape Flats, which extends over to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Town region is characterised by an extensive coastline, rugged mountain ranges, coastal plains and inland valleys.\nExtent.\nThe extent of Cape Town has varied considerably over time. It originated as a small settlement at the foot of Table Mountain and has grown beyond its city limits as a metropolitan area to encompass the entire Cape Peninsula to the south, the Cape Flats, the Helderberg basin and part of the Steenbras catchment area to the east, and the Tygerberg hills, Blouberg and other areas to the north. Robben Island in Table Bay is also part of Cape Town. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and False Bay to the south. To the north and east, the extent is demarcated by boundaries of neighbouring municipalities within the Western Cape province.\nThe official boundaries of the city proper extend between the City Bowl and the Atlantic Seaboard to the east and the Southern Suburbs to the south. The City of Cape Town, the metropolitan municipality that takes its name from the city covers the Greater Cape Town metropolitan area, known as the Cape Metropole, extending beyond the city proper itself to include a number of satellite towns, suburbs and rural areas such as Atlantis, Bellville, Blouberg, Brackenfell, Durbanville, Goodwood, Gordon's Bay, Hout Bay, Khayelitsha, Kraaifontein, Kuilsrivier, Macassar, Melkbosstrand, Milnerton, Muizenberg, Noordhoek, Parow, Philadelphia, Simon's Town, Somerset West, and Strand among others.\nThe Cape Peninsula is long from Mouille Point in the north to Cape Point in the south, with an area of about , and it displays more topographical variety than other similar sized areas in southern Africa, and consequently spectacular scenery. There are diverse low-nutrient soils, large rocky outcrops, scree slopes, a mainly rocky coastline with embayed beaches, and considerable local variation in climatic conditions.\nThe sedimentary rocks of the Cape Supergroup, of which parts of the Graafwater and Peninsula Formations remain, were uplifted between 280 and 21S million years ago, and were largely eroded away during the Mesozoic. The region was geologically stable during the Tertiary, which has led to slow denudation of the durable sandstones. Erosion rate and drainage has been influenced by fault lines and fractures, leaving remnant steep-sided massifs like Table Mountain surrounded by flatter slopes of deposits of the eroded material overlaying the older rocks,\nThere are two internationally notable landmarks, Table Mountain and Cape Point, at opposite ends of the Peninsula Mountain Chain, with the Cape Flats and False Bay to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The landscape is dominated by sandstone plateaux and ridges, which generally drop steeply at their margins to the surrounding debris slopes, interrupted by a major gap at the Fish Hoek\u2013Noordhoek valley.\nIn the south much of the area is a low sandstone plateau with sand dunes. Maximum altitude is 1113m on Table Mountain. The Cape Flats (Afrikaans: Kaapse Vlakte) is a flat, low-lying, sandy area, area to the east the Cape Peninsula, and west of the Helderberg much of which was wetland and dunes within recent history. To the north are the Tygerberg Hills and the Stellenbosch district.\nThe Helderberg area of Greater Cape Town, previously known as the \"Hottentots-Holland\" area, is mostly residential, but also a wine-producing area east of the Cape Flats, west of the Hottentots Holland mountain range and south of the Helderberg mountain, from which it gets its current name. The Helderberg consists of the previous municipalities of Somerset West, Strand, Gordons Bay and a few other towns. Industry and commerce is largely in service of the area.\nAfter the Cape Peninsula, Helderberg is the next most mountainous part of Greater Cape Town, bordered to the north and east by the highest peaks in the region along the watershed of the Helderberg and Hottentots Holland Mountains, which are part of the Cape Fold Belt with Cape Supergroup strata on a basement of Tygerberg Formation rocks intruded by part of the Stellenbosch granite pluton.\nThe region includes the entire catchment of the Lourens and Sir Lowry's rivers, separated by the Schapenberg hill, and a small part of the catchment of the Eerste River to the west. The Helderberg is ecologically highly diverse, rivaling the Cape Peninsula, and has its own endemic ecoregions and several conservation areas.\nTo the east of the Hottentots Holland mountains is the valley of the Steenbras River, in which the Steenbras Dam was built as a water supply for Cape Town. The dam has been supplemented by several other dams around the western Cape, some of them considerably larger. This is almost entirely a conservation area, of high biodiversity. Bellville, Brackenfell, Durbanville, Kraaifontein, Goodwood and Parow are a few of the towns that make up the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town. In current popular culture these areas are often referred to as being beyond the \"boerewors curtain,\" a play on the term \"iron curtain.\"\nUNESCO declared Robben Island in the Western Cape a World Heritage Site in 1999. Robben Island is located in Table Bay, some west of Bloubergstrand, a coastal suburb north of Cape Town, and stands some 30m above sea level. Robben Island has been used as a prison where people were isolated, banished, and exiled for nearly 400 years. It was also used as a leper colony, a post office, a grazing ground, a mental hospital, and an outpost.\nThe coastline of Cape Town is roughly 307\u00a0km long, from Silwerstroomstrand at on the west coast to slightly south of Kogelbaai at on the east coast of False Bay.\nGeology.\nThe Cape Peninsula is a rocky and mountainous peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean at the south-western extremity of the continent. At its tip is Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. The peninsula forms the west side of False Bay and the Cape Flats. On the east side are the Helderberg and Hottentots Holland mountains.\nThe three main rock formations are the late-Precambrian Malmesbury group (sedimentary and metamorphic rock), the Cape Granite suit, comprising the huge Peninsula, Kuilsrivier-Helderberg, and Stellenbosch batholiths, that were intruded into the Malmesbury Group about 630 million years ago, and the Table Mountain group sandstones that were deposited on the eroded surface of the granite and Malmesbury series basement about 450 million years ago.\nThe sand, silt and mud deposits were lithified by pressure and then folded during the Cape Orogeny to form the Cape Fold Belt, which extends in an arc along the western and southern coasts. The present landscape is due to prolonged erosion having carved out deep valleys, removing parts of the once continuous Table Mountain Group sandstone cover from over the Cape Flats and False Bay, and leaving high residual mountain ridges.\nAt times the sea covered the Cape Flats and Noordhoek valley and the Cape Peninsula was then a group of islands. During glacial periods the sea level dropped to expose the bottom of False Bay to weathering and erosion, with the last major regression leaving the entire bottom of False Bay exposed.\nDuring this period an extensive system of dunes was formed on the sandy floor of False Bay. At this time the drainage outlets lay between Rocky Bank Cape Point to the west, and between Rocky Bank and Hangklip Ridge to the east, with the watershed roughly along the line of the contact zone east of Seal Island and Whittle Rock.\nClimate.\nCape Town has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csb\", bordering \"Csa\"), with mild, moderately wet winters and dry, warm summers. Winter, which lasts from June to September, may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant precipitation and strong north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of and minimum of .\nWinters are snow and frost free, except on Table Mountain and on other mountain peaks, where light accumulation of snow and frost can sometimes occur.\nTotal annual rainfall in the city averages although in the Southern Suburbs, close to the mountains, rainfall is significantly higher and averages closer to .\nSummer, which lasts from December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of and minimum of . The region can get uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning \"mountain wind\", blows from the Karoo interior.\nSpring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the south-easter or the Cape Doctor, so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a persistent high-pressure system over the South Atlantic to the west of Cape Town, known as the South Atlantic High, which shifts latitude seasonally, following the sun, and influencing the strength of the fronts and their northward reach. Cape Town receives about 3,100 hours of sunshine per year.\nWater temperatures range greatly, between on the Atlantic Seaboard, to over in False Bay. Average annual ocean surface temperatures are between on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as San Francisco or Big Sur), and in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as Nice or Monte Carlo).\nUnlike other parts of the country the city does not have many thunderstorms, and most of those that do occur, happen around October to December and March to April.\nClimate change.\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Cape Town in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Perth in Australia.\nThe annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the coldest month by , while the temperature of the warmest month would be higher. According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nMoreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Cape Town is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lom\u00e9, Luanda and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050.\nAdditionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.\nSince sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.\nHydrology.\nSea surface temperatures.\nCape Town's coastal water ranges from cold to mild, and the difference between the two sides of the peninsula can be dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual sea surface temperatures average between , the False Bay coast is much warmer, averaging between annually.\nIn summer, False Bay water averages slightly over , with an occasional high. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have colder water due to the wind driven upwellings which contribute to the Benguela Current which originates off the Cape Peninsula, while the water at False Bay beaches may occasionally be warmer by up to at the same time in summer.\nIn summer False Bay is thermally stratified, with a vertical temperature variation of 5 to 9\u02daC between the warmer surface water and cooler depths below 50m, while in winter the water column is at nearly constant temperature at all depths. The development of a thermocline is strongest around late December and peaks in late summer to early autumn. In summer the south easterly winds generate a zone of upwelling near Cape Hangklip, where surface water temperatures can be 6 to 7\u00a0\u00b0C colder than the surrounding areas, and bottom temperatures below 12\u00a0\u00b0C.\nIn the summer to early autumn (January\u2013March), cold water upwelling near Cape Hangklip causes a strong surface temperature gradient between the south-western and north-eastern corners of the bay. In winter the surface temperature tends to be much the same everywhere. In the northern sector surface temperature varies a bit more (13 to 22\u00b0C) than in the south (14 to 20\u00b0C) during the year.\nSurface temperature variation from year to year is linked to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation. During El Ni\u00f1o years the South Atlantic high is shifted, reducing the south-easterly winds, so upwelling and evaporative cooling are reduced and sea surface temperatures throughout the bay are warmer, while in La Ni\u00f1a years there is more wind and upwelling and consequently lower temperatures. Surface water heating during El Ni\u00f1o increases vertical stratification. The relationship is not linear. Occasionally eddies from the Agulhas current will bring warmer water and vagrant sea life carried from the south and east coasts into False Bay.\nFlora and fauna.\nLocated in a Conservation International biodiversity hotspot as well as the unique Cape Floristic Region, the city of Cape Town has one of the highest levels of biodiversity of any equivalent area in the world.\nThese protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain \u2013 more than exist in the whole of the United Kingdom which has 1200 plant species and 67 endemic plant species. Many of these species, including a great many types of proteas, are endemic to the mountain and can be found nowhere else.\nIt is home to a total of 19 different vegetation types, of which several are endemic to the city and occur nowhere else in the world.\nIt is also the only habitat of hundreds of endemic species, and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened. This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro-climates.\nTable Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape Fynbos. The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld and Afromontane forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain.\nRapid population growth and urban sprawl has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently, Cape Town now has over 300 threatened plant species and 13 which are now extinct. The Cape Peninsula, which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town, has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.\nTiny remnant populations of critically endangered or near extinct plants sometimes survive on road sides, pavements and sports fields. The remaining ecosystems are partially protected through a system of over 30 nature reserves \u2013 including the massive Table Mountain National Park.\nCape Town reached first place in the 2019 iNaturalist City Nature Challenge in two out of the three categories: Most Observations, and Most Species. This was the first entry by Capetonians in this annual competition to observe and record the local biodiversity over a four-day long weekend during what is considered the worst time of the year for local observations.\nA worldwide survey suggested that the extinction rate of endemic plants from the City of Cape Town is one of the highest in the world, at roughly three per year since 1900 \u2013 partly a consequence of the very small and localised habitats and high endemicity.\nIn 2025, City of Cape Town enacted the \"Cape Town Biodiversity Spatial Plan (CTBSP) 2025\", a biodiversity policy aimed at guiding development in the city. The plan integrates the Cape Town BioNet 2024 Map, which identifies areas to protect to ensure environmental sustainability, and categorizes them into Protected Areas, Critical Biodiversity Areas, Ecological Support Areas, and Other Natural Areas. The policy will help guide spatial planning, environmental assessments, and natural resource management across sectors, and sets a framework for the internal alignment of environmental responsibilities across all City departments.\n22.72% of Cape Town's municipal land, totaling 55,697 hectares, is under conservation. Of this, 20,039 hectares are managed by the City within 22 nature reserves and 16 Biodiversity Agreement Conservation Areas, many of which are open to the public.\nGovernment.\nCape Town is governed by a 231-member city council elected in a system of mixed-member proportional representation. The city is divided into 116 wards, each of which elects a councillor by first-past-the-post voting. The remaining 115 councillors are elected from party lists so that the total number of councillors for each party is proportional to the number of votes received by that party.\nIn the 2021 Municipal Elections, the Democratic Alliance (DA) kept its majority, this time diminished, taking 136 seats. The African National Congress lost substantially, receiving 43 of the seats. The Democratic Alliance candidate for the Cape Town mayoralty, Geordin Hill-Lewis was elected mayor.\nIn recent years, Cape Town has developed a reputation for good governance, with the city's infrastructure spending and upkeep, political stability, CBD safety, and municipal service delivery being generally regarded as the best out of all the major metropolitan areas in South Africa. In 2025, Cape Town was, for the third year in a row, the only metropolitan municipality in South Africa to receive a clean audit outcome from its Auditor General (AG), Tsakani Maluleke.\nAccording to the AG, municipalities that achieve clean audits display strong financial and performance management, whilst adhering to legislative requirements, and Cape Town is a model of governance and accountability. The AG further stated that Cape Town showed strong leadership, skilled personnel, accurate records, credible reporting to communities, and good quality planning and performance management. The city has maintained its clean audit status since 2021.\nInternational relations.\nCape Town has nineteen active sister city agreements\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nThe City of Cape Town has expressed explicit support for Ukraine during the 2022 invasion of the country by Russia. To show this support the City of Cape Town lit up the Old City Hall in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on 2 March 2022. This has differentiated the city from the officially neutral foreign policy position taken by the South African national government.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the South African National Census of 2011, the population of the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality\u00a0\u2013 an area that includes suburbs and exurbs\u00a0\u2013 is 3,740,026 people.

As of June 2025, the province's average household income is R407,000. This amount is 35% higher than second-place Gauteng, and 50% above the national average.\nThe total number of households grew from 653,085 in 1996 to 1,068,572 in 2011, which represents an increase of 63.6%. The average number of household members declined from 3,92 in 1996 to 3,50 in 2011.

In the 2022 census, the median age of residents in the city was 31. In the same year, approximately 40% of the population of Cape Town was under the age of 25.\nAccording to the 2016 City of Cape Town community survey, there were 4,004,793 people in the City of Cape Town metro. Out of this population, 45.7% identified as Black African, 35.1% identified as Coloured, 16.2% identified as White and 1.6% identified as Asian.\nThe Western Cape province, in which Cape Town is the largest city, has the highest rate of marriage out of all South African provinces, by a significant margin. In the 2022 census, 33.8% of those in the province were legally married \u2013 almost 10% higher than the next province. In the same census, 50.6% of Western Cape residents had never been married \u2013 the lowest out of all South African provinces.\nDuring the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, local media reported that increasing numbers of wealthy and middle-class South Africans have started moving from inland areas of the country to coastal regions \u2013 most notably Cape Town \u2013 in a phenomenon referred to as \"semigration\" \u2013 short for \"semi-emigration\" Declining municipal services in the rest of the country and the South African energy crisis are other cited reasons for semigration.\nIn 2022, the city expected its population to grow by an additional 400,000 residents between 2020 and 2025, with 76% of those new residents falling into the low-income bracket, earning less than R13,000 a month.\nAccording to the United Nations' World Urbanization Prospects (2018), Cape Town's population is projected to continue growing steadily over the next decade. Based on estimates compiled by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2018, the city's population is expected to reach approximately 5.468 million by 2030, and roughly 5.845 million by 2035.\nReligion.\nIn the 2015 General Household Survey 82.3% of respondents self identified as Christian, 8% as Muslim, 3.8% as following a traditional African religion and 3.1% as \"nothing in particular.\"\nMost places of worship in the city are Christian churches and cathedrals: Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), Zion Christian Church, Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa, Assemblies of God, Baptist Union of Southern Africa (Baptist World Alliance), Methodist Church of Southern Africa (World Methodist Council), Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cape Town (Catholic Church), the Orthodox Archbishopric of Good Hope (Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St George) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\nIslam is the city's second largest religion with a long history in Cape Town, resulting in a number of mosques and other Muslim religious sites spread across the city, such as the Auwal Mosque, South Africa's first mosque.\nCape Town's significant Jewish population supports a number of synagogues most notably the historic Gardens Shul, the oldest Jewish congregation in South Africa. Marais Road Shul in the city's Jewish hub, Sea Point, is the largest Jewish congregation in South Africa. Temple Israel (Cape Town Progressive Jewish Congregation) also has three temples in the city. There is also a Chabad centre in Sea Point and a Chabad on Campus at the University of Cape Town, catering to Jewish students.\nOther religious sites in the city include Hindu and Buddhist temples and centres.\nCrime.\nIn recent years, Cape Town has experienced a resurgence in violent crime, particularly driven by gang violence in areas like the Cape Flats. This increase in violence is attributed to various factors including economic inequality (which can be linked to the legacy of apartheid's spatial and social divisions), unemployment, alcohol abuse, the prevalence of illegal firearms, a lack of rehabilitation and support services for offenders leading to recidivism, and a lack of community safety organizations.\nCrime in Cape Town is a serious problem which affects the quality of life and safety of its residents and visitors. Between 2022 and 2023, Cape Town recorded the highest number of murders in a single year of any city in the world at 2,998, followed by Johannesburg and Durban, an increase of 8.6% year-on-year. Household crimes including burglary also increased in the same period. Mexico's Citizen Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice ranks it among the most violent cities in the world.\nWhile the UK Foreign Office considers Cape Town safe to travel to, it notes the extremely high crime rates and highlights a particular increase on violent attacks and murders on the roads to and from Cape Town International Airport.\nAs with other major metropolitan areas in South Africa, the majority of crime in Cape Town tends to be concentrated in very specific areas, indicating the potential success of place-based crime intelligence methods. In Cape Town, a lot of the crime that occurs takes place in the neighborhoods of Philippi East, Delft, Nyanga, Mfuleni, Gugulethu, Elsies River, Bishop Lavis, Kleinvlei, and Mitchell's Plain, which are best avoided (even during transit) by tourists and locals alike.\nIn early 2025, the City of Cape Town announced that progress had been made in combatting crime, with crime levels in certain notorious areas decreasing, according to statistics based on community reporting of incidents of crime. Daily patrol officers were complimented for their efforts, and the City said it was working closely with the Western Cape Government and the South African Police Service to adjust its law enforcement efforts according to changes in the city's crime statistics.\nDespite the crime levels, the city's economy has grown, as a result of good governance, investments in infrastructure, and an attractive business environment, as well as due to growth in the local tourism and real estate industries. Since July 2019 widespread violent crime in poorer gang dominated areas of greater Cape Town has resulted in an ongoing military presence in these neighbourhoods.\nThe minibus taxi industry has been the source of a number of violent confrontations in the city. The northern and eastern sections of the city was the scene of the 2021 Cape Town taxi conflict, a violent turf war which led to 83 deaths. The 2023 Cape Town taxi strike resulted in 5 recorded deaths.\nIn 2025, Cape Town's Mayoral Committee Member (MCM) for Safety and Security, JP Smith, said that the expanded use of digital tools to complement law enforcement efforts has become part of the city's public safety operations. These tools include a vast network of CCTV cameras and drones, which have already proven successful in assisting with both arrests and prosecution.\nEconomy.\nCape Town is South Africa's main economic center, tied with Johannesburg in terms of annual economic output, despite having a considerably smaller population than Joburg. The city is also Africa's third-largest economic hub. It serves as the regional financial and manufacturing center in the Western Cape province.\nThe city has a diverse economy that is not significantly reliant on any particular sector. While the financial sector accounts for 22% of the Western Cape's annual economic output, as of 2025, its tech sector is growing at an annual rate of 8%. The city also has a substantial Green Economy, with around R15 billion invested into the sector in 2024 alone.\nIncome levels.\nAs of June 2025, Cape Town has South Africa's highest average household income (by a significant margin), as well as the country's lowest rate of unemployment, and strongest-performing property market.\nThe average annual household income in the Western Cape is the highest in South Africa, by a significant margin. As of June 2025, the province's average household income is R407,000. This amount is 35% higher than second-place Gauteng, and 50% above the national average.\nEmployment levels.\nWhereas unemployment has increased in numerous major cities across the country in recent years, in Cape Town, employment has increased. In 2025, it was reported that the city had diverged from a national trend, and added 86,000 jobs. The Mayor of Cape Town attributed this growth to good governance and infrastructure investments, creating an attractive business environment, and an increase in tourism.\nThe Western Cape's unemployment levels are well below the national average. Formal sector jobs in the Western Cape grew by 3.1% in 2024 - 61% higher than the national average.\nEconomic output.\nIn 2019, the city's GMP of R489 billion (US$33.04 billion) represented 71.1% of the Western Cape's total GRP and 9.6% of South Africa's total GDP; the city also accounted for 11.1% of all employed people in the country and had a citywide GDP per capita of R111,364 (US$7,524).\nSince the Great Recession, the city's economic growth rate has mirrored South Africa's decline in growth; the population growth rate for the city has remained steady at around 2% a year. Around 80% of the city's economic activity is generated by the tertiary sector of the economy with the finance, retail, real-estate, and food and beverage industries being the four largest contributors to the city's economic growth rate.\nCape Town has significantly above-average economic performance amongst its South African metropolitan peers, and numerous companies have moved employees and their headquarters to the city in recent years. In 2025, according to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), Cape Town had the lowest unemployment rate out of all South African cities.\nEconomic growth.\nIn 2008, Cape Town was considered the most entrepreneurial city in South Africa, with the percentage of Capetonians pursuing business opportunities almost three times higher than the national average. Capetonians aged between 18 and 64 were 190% more likely to pursue new business, whilst in Johannesburg, the same demographic group was only 60% more likely than the national average to pursue a new business.\nWith the highest number of successful information technology companies in Africa, Cape Town is an important centre for the industry on the continent. This includes an increasing number of companies in the space industry. Cape Town is home to over 60 fintech startups.\nGrowing at an annual rate of 8.5%, the tech industry is a major part of Cape Town's economy. Cape Town is home to numerous tech company headquarters, including those of Admyt, Xneelo, Jumo, Yoco, Aerobotics, Luno, Vault22, and Rain, as well as fiber network operators Frogfoot, Octotel, and Liquid Intelligent Technologies, the latter of which operates Africa's largest independent fiber network. A number of entrepreneurial initiatives hosting tech startups, such as the Sun Exchange, are located in the city.\nThe city has the largest film industry in the Southern Hemisphere generating R5 billion (US$476.19 million) in revenue and providing an estimated 6,058 direct and 2,502 indirect jobs in 2013. Much of the industry is based out of the Cape Town Film Studios.\nAs of 2024, Cape Town's labor force consists of 1.1 million workers. The largest sector in Cape Town is the professional and business services industry, which accounts for 29.61% of the city's workforce.\nWithin this sector, the professional, scientific, and technical services industry accounts for 23.34% (about 254,600 people) of the city's employment, which is the highest of any other industry.\nThe construction industry is the second-largest by number of employees, as it accounts for 9.29% (around 101,300 people) of the city's employment. The manufacturing sector, the second largest sector, also accounts for a large part of the city's employment opportunities as it provides 18.15% of the city's employment.\nIn recent years, Cape Town, has become a global conference hub, and a highly desirable place to host delegates for meetings. The Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) in Cape Town's CBD hosts many large conferences throughout each year. The city has been increasing in popularity in this regard, and in June 2025, it was reported that Cape Town had reached 35th place globally in the International Congress and Convention Association's (ICCA) rankings of popular destinations for international association meetings.\nThe report highlighted that Cape Town hosted 58 such meetings in 2024, which comprises 60% of the total hosted across South Africa that year. Cape Town also placed among the top 10 cities worldwide for average attendance per event, with an average of 717 delegates per meeting.\nThe Western Cape's official tourism, trade, and investment promotion agency, Wesgro, stated that Cape Town and the Western Cape Convention Bureau secured 36 new conference bids in the 2024/25 financial year alone. These events are expected to generate R745 million in economic impact, and attract over 27,000 delegates through to 2028.\nCape Town has in recent years positioned itself as a notable player in the boat building industry. The city has become a regional hub for the sector, and is home to numerous boat building yards, as well as Robertson and Caine, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of luxury catamarans. Cape Town is home to a skilled boatbuilding workforce and a dedicated group of artisans in the industry.\nMajor companies.\nCape Town is home to the headquarters of many of South Africa's largest companies, across a variety of industries, many of which are located in its CBD. As of 2022 data, 8 of South Africa's 50 largest companies by annual revenue were headquartered in Cape Town.\nOne of Cape Town's major industries is retail, with the city housing the headquarters of 9 of South Africa's major retail companies, including most of its largest supermarket chains. Another major industry for the city is tech, with Cape Town being considered Africa's tech hub. The city also has a strong finance industry, and is home to 6 of South Africa's largest companies operating in the consumer finance, insurance, and investment sector. Other local industries include insurance, publishing, design, fashion, shipping, petrochemicals, architecture, advertising, real estate, and tourism.\nSome of the most notable companies headquartered in the city are food and fashion retailer Woolworths, major supermarket chains Pick n Pay, Checkers, and Shoprite, pet store retailers Absolute Pets and Petshop Science, healthcare and personal care retail chain Clicks, fashion retailers Pepkor, Ackermans, Truworths, and Foschini Group, internet service provider MWEB, Mediclinic Group, eTV, multinational mass media giant Naspers, major financial services organizations Sanlam, Old Mutual Park, Allan Gray, Coronation, airline LIFT, major real estate company Pam Golding, South Africa's largest e-commerce company, Takealot, and the country's largest fuel company, Engen Petroleum.\nMedia is another of Cape Town's major industries. The city is home to the headquarters of numerous of South Africa's largest print and digital news publications, including Daily Maverick, News24, and Media24 (which owns publications like City Press, as well as a regional office of Primedia). Furthermore, the headquarters of South Africa's largest independent and only privately owned free-to-air television station, e.tv, is located in Cape Town.\nOther notable companies include Stodels, Travelstart, Wootware, Xneelo, Yuppiechef, Belron, Ceres Fruit Juices, Coronation Fund Managers, Vida e Caff\u00e8, and Capitec Bank. The city is a manufacturing base for several multinational companies including, Johnson &amp; Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Adidas, Bokomo Foods, and Yoco. Amazon Web Services maintains one of its largest facilities in the world in Cape Town, with the city serving as the African headquarters for its parent company, Amazon.\nTourism.\nThe Western Cape is a highly important tourist region in South Africa; the tourism industry accounts for 9.8% of the GDP of the province and employs 9.6% of the province's workforce.\nIn 2024, Cape Town had its busiest tourist season ever. Over 2.4 million tourists visited the city, spending around R25 billion and supporting over 106,000 jobs (around 7% of the city's total employment). Cape Town is directly connected to 31 global destinations, with 226 international flights each week during its peak tourist season.\nCape Town is not only a popular international tourist destination in South Africa, but Africa as a whole. This is in part due to its mild climate, natural setting, costal geography, and well-developed infrastructure.\nThe city has several well-known natural features that attract tourists, most notably Table Mountain, which forms a large part of the Table Mountain National Park and is the back end of the City Bowl. Reaching the top of the mountain can be achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the Table Mountain Cableway. Cape Point is the dramatic headland at the end of the Cape Peninsula.\nMany tourists also drive along Chapman's Peak Drive, a narrow road that links Noordhoek with Hout Bay, for the views of the Atlantic Ocean and nearby mountains. It is possible to either drive or hike up Signal Hill for closer views of the CBD, City Bowl area, and Table Mountain.\nTourists also commonly visit Cape Town's beaches, which are also very popular with local residents. It is possible to visit several different beaches in the same day, each with a different setting and atmosphere.\nBoth coasts are popular, although the beaches in affluent Clifton and elsewhere on the Atlantic Coast are better developed, with restaurants and caf\u00e9s lining Beach Road, alongside the various beaches.\nThe Atlantic Seaboard, known as Cape Town's Riviera, is regarded as one of the most scenic routes in South Africa; along the slopes of the Twelve Apostles to the boulders and white sand beaches of Llandudno, with the route ending in Hout Bay, a diverse suburb with a fishing and recreational boating harbour near a small island with a breeding colony of African fur seals.\nHout Bay is also accessible by road from the Constantia Valley, over the mountains to the northeast, and via the picturesque Chapman's Peak drive, from the residential suburb of Noordhoek, situated in the False Bay area to the south-east. Boulders Beach near Simon's Town is known for its colony of African penguins.\nThe city has a rich history, and several notable cultural attractions. Within Cape Town CBD there are the Artscape and District Six Homecoming Center theaters, The Houses of Parliament, the Iziko museums and Planetarium, the South African National Gallery, the Castle of Good Hope, and The Company's Garden (South Africa's oldest park). The CBD is also home to many coffeehouses, as well as numerous restaurants that provide a variety of local cuisine options.\nThe Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront is a mixed-use development built on top of part of the docks of the Port of Cape Town, and is the city's most-visited tourist attraction. It is also one of the city's most popular shopping venues, with several hundred shops as well as the Two Oceans Aquarium.\nThe V&amp;A also hosts the Nelson Mandela Gateway, through which ferries depart for Robben Island. It is possible to take a ferry from the V&amp;A to Hout Bay, Simon's Town and the Cape fur seal colonies on Seal and Duiker Islands. Several companies offer tours of the Cape Flats, a region of mostly Coloured &amp; Black townships.\nWithin the metropolitan area, the most popular areas for visitors to stay include Camps Bay, Sea Point, the V&amp;A Waterfront, the CBD, Hout Bay, Constantia, Rondebosch, Newlands, and Somerset West. In November 2013, Cape Town was voted the best global city in \"The Daily Telegraph's\" annual Travel Awards.\nCape Town offers tourists a range of air-, land-, and sea-based adventure activities, including helicopter rides, paragliding and skydiving, snorkelling and scuba diving, boat trips, game-fishing, hiking, mountain biking, and rock climbing. Surfing is popular in the city, along both coasts, and Cape Town hosts the Red Bull Big Wave Africa surfing competition every year. The city also has some local and international recreational scuba tourism.\nThe City of Cape Town works closely with Cape Town Tourism (CTT), the body tasked with promoting tourism in the city. Being the official destination marketing agency for Cape Town, CTT has a mandate from the city to advocate for and promote tourism in the Cape Town metropolitan area, to both local and foreign markets.\nThe primary focus of Cape Town Tourism is to represent and advocate for Cape Town as an appealing tourist destination, as well as to track and report on metrics related to tourism in Cape Town (which CTT does as part of its Annual Report, published online). Cape Town Tourism receives a portion of its funding from the City of Cape Town while the remainder is made up of membership fees and own-generated funds.\nThe Tristan da Cunha government owns and operates a lodging facility in Cape Town which charges discounted rates to Tristan da Cunha residents and non-resident natives. Cape Town's transport system links it to the rest of South Africa; it serves as the gateway to other destinations within the province. The Cape Winelands and in particular the towns of Stellenbosch, Paarl and Franschhoek are popular day trips from the city for sightseeing and wine tasting.\nInequality.\nThe city of Cape Town's Gini coefficient of 0.58 is lower than South Africa's Gini coefficient of 0.7. This makes it more equal than the rest of the country, including any other major South African city, although still highly unequal by international standards.\nBetween 2001 and 2010 the city's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, improved by dropping from 0.59 in 2007 to 0.57 in 2010 only to increase to 0.58 by 2017.\nHousing.\nCape Town has a mix of detached homes of various sizes, townhouses, and apartments. Certain neighborhoods (especially older ones and those in the Southern Suburbs) tend to be dominated by larger, detached houses on separate plots of land, with parks and tree-lined streets. Newer suburbs, and those in the Northern Suburbs, feature more of a mix of housing types, including low- and high-rise buildings and townhouse developments.\nHome ownership.\nThe city has for years had the most expensive average home price in South Africa. In September 2024, the average property price in Cape Town was R2.23 million. This was an increase of 36% from the average price of R1.63 million in 2014 (a decade before), indicating consistently strong returns on investment for those in the Cape Town property market. Sellers often get their asking price, or within 5% of it.\nCape Town's property market grows at a rate far exceeding that of other major metropolitan areas in the country. For example, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) reported that between January 2010 and November 2022, Cape Town property prices increased at around double the rate of those in Johannesburg. The city has been ranked as the world's second-strongest-performing real estate market.\nThis performance improved further in more recent years. In June 2025, it was reported in South Africa's Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) that Cape Town's property values had not only increased by significantly more than the national average, but had also increased by almost 4 times as much as second-place Johannesburg's.\nTo afford the average home in Cape Town, a salary of over R80,000 per month is required, which is significantly higher than in other provinces, and around 3 times the national average salary in South Africa. The Western Cape province in general requires far higher salaries for affording to purchase the average property than in other provinces.\nProperty in the Southern Suburbs offers a peaceful lifestyle and is generally more expensive, as is property in the Atlantic Seaboard area, for its ocean views, and property in the City Bowl region, for its proximity to Cape Town's CBD and amenities. Conversely, property in the Cape Flats is cheaper on average, as the region is less desirable to live in. The same goes for property in the Northern Suburbs region, where lower costs are as a result of living further from central Cape Town, and more space to build outwards (both inland and up the west coast).\nSome suburbs in Cape Town have had exceptionally high property value growth in recent years. For example, in 2025, it was reported that Kalk Bay, an old fishing village in the False Bay area of Cape Town, had its house prices grow by around R1 million every year since 2020, due to an increase in demand for property in the Western Cape. The average price of a home in the suburb rose from R4.9 million in 2020 to R9 million at the start of 2025; an 83% increase over that 4-year period, or over 20% per year.\nLikewise, the small town of Scarborough, which forms part of the City of Cape Town and is popular with foreign home buyers, saw a 241% increase in property values over a 9-year period, with average home values rising from R2.30 million in 2016 to R7.85 million in 2025. One reason for this kind of housing price growth in Cape Town is the local municipality's investments in maintaining and upgrading neighborhoods, to create an attractive environment for residents to live.\nProperty prices in Cape Town are around double the national average of R1.41 million, according to home loan statistics. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the national average home price recorded its second consecutive decrease. Meanwhile, Cape Town property prices have continued to increase.\nCape Town's property values increase on average around 10% per year. The consistently strong property prices and growth thereof can be attributed to numerous factors, including good service delivery by local government, a strong local economy, the coastal lifestyle that Capetonians enjoy, and semigration (individuals moving from other South African provinces into the Western Cape).\nCape Town trends among the top 20 cities worldwide for capital value growth, further increasing the attractiveness of owning a home in the city.\nCape Town housing is in short supply due to a number of issues, including NIMBYISM, delays in approvals for social housing, a lack of space to build outwards, and an increase in properties listed as short-term Airbnb rentals.\nIn early 2025, 14% of homes listed for sale were new to the market. The most common size of properties for sale was 2-bedroom, followed by 3-bedroom properties.\nThe city is home to some of South Africa's most expensive neighborhoods, including Constantia and Bishopscourt in the Southern Suburbs; Tamboerskloof and Higgovale in the City Bowl; and Fresnaye, Camps Bay, Clifton, Llandudno, and Bantry Bay in the Atlantic Seaboard. Affluent areas are popular with international buyers from countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and France, with some purchasing homes around R60 million (~ \u00a32.5 million / \u20ac3 million / US$3.3 million). 9 out of South Africa's 10 most expensive suburbs are in Cape Town.\nIn 2021, Cape Town's residential property market was valued at R1.22 trillion, the highest out of all major South African metropolitan areas. The city's property market constituted 72% of the entire Western Cape's residential property market value, and 21% of the national property market value. The city had significantly more homes valued in the luxury market segment (at 43% of the total) than in any other major South African metro area. In the same year, there were around 800,000 residential properties located in Cape Town. 76% of those were detached homes, 15% were apartments, and 9% were semi-detached homes.\nAs of April 2025, Cape Town had a home ownership rate of 6.6% among those aged 18 to 35; 22.7% among those aged 36 to 49; 35.7% for those aged 50 to 64; and 35% for those aged 65 or older. In the same month, 25.8% of new home buyers in Cape Town were aged 18 to 35.\nRentals.\nIn 2025, the average rent price in Cape Town for a 2-bedroom apartment was approximately R12,000 per month. However, this value varies significantly between suburbs. For a property of the same size, some neighborhoods offer rent as low as R7,000 per month, while in other, more desirable areas, this may be as high as R30,000 per month. The city has excellent gross rental yields, with some properties generating as much as a 10.5% return on investment for owners.\nRental prices for apartments in affluent areas can often exceed the city's average by multiples. For example, in 2024, three areas in the Atlantic Seaboard \u2013 Camps Bay, Clifton, and Bantry Bay \u2013 averaged rental prices of R40,000 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, and R120,000 per month for a 3-bedroom apartment. In Cape Town, popular rental website Property24 lists almost 100 rentals per month at prices over R100,000 per month, and some rentals cost as much as R300,000 per month.\nAverage rent prices in Cape Town increased by 5.2% in 2025, in line with the national average. In 2024, the city has the lowest rental vacancy rate out of all major South African metropolitan areas.\nIn 2021, approximately 18% of Cape Town residents rented.\nWith nearly 5,000 students from over 100 countries studying at the University of Cape Town (UCT), 18% of the student body is international, which increases demand for rental properties in Cape Town. Student housing \u2013 accommodation provided by the University of Cape Town \u2013 has a shortfall, which is made up by the private rental market. In 2023, there were 28,000 registered UCT students, with 8,400 of them securing UCT residence places.\nAs of 2025, rental prices in the Western Cape were the highest in South Africa, and 23% above the national average. It has been the most expensive province in South Africa for renting since 2016. The Western Cape's reputation as South Africa's best-run province, with efficient governance and high-quality, well-maintained infrastructure, has made it an attractive destination for tenants.\nThe average rent price in the Western Cape in the fourth quarter of 2024 was R11,141. This was the first time the figure had gone beyond the R11,000 mark. The Western Cape also has the lowest number of tenants in arrears (those who are behind on rental payments) out of all South African provinces. The Western Cape had a record-low vacancy rate of 1.07% in the third quarter of 2024.\nInfrastructure and services.\nThe City of Cape Town has a strong focus and high level of spending on infrastructure development and maintenance. The City spent a total of R9.5 billion on infrastructure development during the 2024 to 2025 financial year. For the 2025 to 2026 financial year, the city's budget was R12.6 billion. In the same year, the City apportioned R120 billion for its 10-year infrastructure portfolio. Cape Town has a larger infrastructure budget than the combined budgets of the 3 metropolitan areas in the province of Gauteng.\nMost goods are handled through the Port of Cape Town or Cape Town International Airport. Most major shipbuilding companies have offices in Cape Town. The province is also a centre of energy development for the country, with the existing Koeberg nuclear power station providing energy for the Western Cape's needs.\nCape Town has five major commercial nodes, with the city's CBD containing around 40% of its office space. Century City, the Bellville/Tygervalley strip, Westlake, and Claremont commercial nodes are well-established and contain many offices and corporate headquarters, for both local and international companies.\nCape Town's property investment and construction markets consistently perform well above its metropolitan peers in South Africa.\nIn September 2025, the City implemented new planning rules for property development that reduce approval times. Through its Municipal Planning Amendment by-law, costs for developers, and by extension buyers, are reduced. Furthermore, opportunities opened up for small-scale developers to build up to 12 affordable rental units on certain residential plots, without the need to go through a rezoning process, thereby speeding up the building of affordable housing in Cape Town. The City stated that it was also investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to process future development applications.\nTelecommunications.\nCape Town has a well-established telecoms infrastructure network, which includes:\nHealth.\nThe city contains many well-equipped clinics and hospitals in both the public and private healthcare sectors.\nNumerous of South Africa's major private medical services groups operate hospitals in the city, including those below.\nEducation.\nPublic primary and secondary schools in Cape Town are run by the Western Cape Education Department. This provincial department is divided into seven districts; four of these are \"Metropole\" districts \u2013 Metropole Central, North, South, and East \u2013 which cover various areas of the metropolis. There are also many private schools, both religious and secular. Cape Town has a well-developed higher system of public universities.\nCape Town is served by three public universities: the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). Stellenbosch University, while not based in the metropolitan area itself, has its main campus and administrative section 50 kilometers from Cape Town, and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park, north-west of the city in the town of Bellville.\nBoth the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in South Africa. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector.\nUCT is an English language tuition institution. It has over 21,000 students and has an MBA program that was ranked 51st by the Financial Times in 2006.\nIt is also the top-ranked university in Africa, being the only African university to make the world's Top 200 university list at number 146. UCT has its main campus on the mountainside in Rondebosch, a predominantly residential suburb in the Southern Suburbs region of Cape Town. The university also operates satellite campuses in Observatory and Cape Town CBD.\nSince the African National Congress has become the country's ruling party, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has evidently benefitted UWC.\nThe Cape Peninsula University of Technology was formed on 1 January 2005, when two separate institutions \u2013 Cape Technikon and Peninsula Technikon \u2013 were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English, although one may take courses in any of South Africa's official languages. The institution generally awards the National Diploma.\nStudents from the universities and high schools are involved in the South African SEDS, Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. This is the South African SEDS, and there are many SEDS branches in other countries, preparing enthusiastic students and young professionals for the growing Space industry.\nAs well as the universities, there are also several colleges in and around Cape Town. Including the College of Cape Town, False Bay College and Northlink College. Many students use NSFAS funding to help pay for tertiary education at these TVET colleges. Cape Town has also become a popular study abroad destination for many international college students. Many study abroad providers offer semester, summer, short-term, and internship programs in partnership with Cape Town universities as a chance for international students to gain intercultural understanding.\nSafety and security.\nCape Town has multiple law enforcement agencies working together to ensure the laws of South Africa, as well as the provincial and municipal bylaws, are upheld throughout the city. Different agencies have different jurisdictions, granted to them by various levels of government. In recent years, the City of Cape Town and Western Cape province have been pushing to gain more independence from the South African Police Service, and to instead have full control of its policing.\nIn recent years, the city has taken a focused, and exceptionally tough approach towards combatting crime, with positive impacts. The Western Cape's Department of Police Oversight and Community Safety had an annual budget in 2024 of around R800 million, a large portion of which goes to Cape Town. Likewise, the City of Cape Town's Safety and Security Directorate has a healthy annual budget, which totaled around half a billion rand for the 2024 fiscal year.\nCape Town's law enforcement is overseen by the city's Mayco Member for Safety and Security, the Western Cape Community Safety and Police Oversight MEC, and the Western Cape Police Commissioner.\nThe agencies working to ensure safety and security in the City of Cape Town are:\nThe Cape Town Metropolitan Police Department (Metro Police).\nThe Metro Police are responsible for crime prevention, as well as the enforcement of municipal bylaws and traffic laws, conducting autonomous drug- and alcohol-related operations, executing warrants in support of the South African Police Service, and conducting visible policing in specific areas. Its special units include:\nIn mid-2025, Cape Town rolled out its Neighborhood Safety Officer (NSO) program. Part of the Metro Police, NSOs are officers dedicated to patrolling specific neighborhoods across the city. On top of other kinds of law enforcement, the program positions 5 dedicated NSOs per City of Cape Town municipal ward.\nThe Metro Police make use of vehicles including the Toyota Corolla for general law enforcement, the Volkwagen Golf GTI for the Flying Squad, and the Toyota Fortuner for the Highway Patrol.\nTraffic Service.\nThe city's Traffic Service has dedicated officers for improving road safety by providing effective driving license services and traffic enforcement. The Service employs specially trained peace officers.\nWhile Metro Police can and do also provide traffic-related enforcement, the Traffic Service focuses entirely on such. Cape Town's Traffic Service enforces traffic laws, ensures roadworthy compliance of all motor vehicles, and provides driving license services. Matters it deals with include drunk driving offenses, vehicle impounds, animal impounds, displaced people, graffiti enforcement, informal trading, liquor enforcement, metal theft, rail enforcement, and neighborhood safety.\nTraffic Services began using dashboard-mounted cameras (dashcams) in 2023, for added security. Cape Town's Traffic Services operates a specialized Highway Patrol unit, with its own fleet of vehicles that are geared towards maintaining safety on the highways passing through the city.\nLaw Enforcement Advancement Plan (LEAP).\nLEAP officers are specifically deployed in high-crime areas. They undergo separate training, and exist as an entirely separate police force to Metro Police. However, they work closely with Metro Police, as well as SAPS.\nLEAP officers deal with matters including the confiscation of illegal firearms, violence prevention, drug and liquor confiscations, and anti-gang activities.\nThe City of Cape Town partnered with the Western Cape Government to launch LEAP in 2020, as part of the latter's Western Cape Safety Plan (WCSP), which was launched in September 2019.\nThe South African Police Service (SAPS).\nSAPS is the national policing authority in South Africa. As such, they have a presence in Cape Town, as with all other major metropolitan areas. Their jurisdiction covers the investigation of crimes (which may be handed over to them by the Metro Police). SAPS employs detectives, criminologists, forensic pathologists, and other related experts, as is governed by the Department of Police in the national government.\nSAPS, along with Metro Police members, are held accountable by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, which investigates wrongdoing within the police service across South Africa.\nIn the City of Cape Town, SAPS makes use of vehicles including the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Fortuner, and Nissan Navara.\nIn early 2025, the City of Cape Town announced its intention to merge numerous police forces info a single law enforcement agency.\nCape Town Central City Improvement District (CCID).\nRatepayers in the Cape Town CBD fund and run the CCID, to ensure that Cape Town's CBD remains safe, clean, and functional for all residents, visitors, and tourists, as well as a viable investment region with a growing economy. Founded in November 2002, the CCID is managed by the Office of the CEO, and has Departments including Safety and Security, Urban Management, Social Development, and Communication.\nThe CCID conducts visible (permanent) security operations throughout the city's CBD, managing over 300 Public Safety Officers (PSOs) who are stationed in various city streets around the CBD. The CCID also works closely with the Community Police Forum and various neighborhood watch groups, to maintain security in the areas surrounding the CBD.\nCCID security personnel wear recognizable, bright green apparel and body cameras, are sometimes stationed at kiosks, and are supported by lock-up response units in vehicles, as well as the main CCID control center. The CCID has built a reputation for becoming the first responders for many incidents in the city, with a response time averaging just a few minutes.\nThe CCID also employs 12 dedicated Law Enforcement officers to assist with arrests. It is able to obtain access to the City of Cape Town's Strategic Surveillance Unit (SSU) CCTV cameras, to assist with crime prevention efforts.\nThe group has seen great success since it launched in 2002, with crime in Cape Town having reduced by 90% since inception as a result of CCID's efforts, coupled with those of other security agencies.\nLaw Enforcement Auxiliary Service (LEAS).\nCape Town's Law Enforcement Auxiliary Service (LEAS) has been operating since 2013, as part of the city's overall public safety program. LEAS comprises around 300 individuals, who volunteer for a minimum of 16 hours per month. LEAS volunteers operate under the supervision of permanent law enforcement officers. Uniformed LEAS officers assist with duties including patrolling (visible policing), enforcing municipal bylaws, and directing traffic. Non-uniformed officers assist with administrative tasks relating to law enforcement.\nLEAS officers undergo thorough vetting, are divided up between the 4 geographical areas within the metro, and are supported by an Auxiliary Animal Control Unit, Marine Unit, and Rural Safety Unit.\nOther security measures.\nThe City of Cape Town's Strategic Surveillance Unit (SSU), uses a system of around 2,000 closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras throughout the metropolitan area, monitoring suburbs for any suspicious activity, and using CCTV footage in the prosecution of crimes. The CCTV network is used by, among other agencies, Metro Police, LEAP, and SAPS (including for investigations). Control room staff for the CCTV network are able to rapidly deploy response teams, ranging from police to emergency services, based on the events occurring. The cameras are therefore useful not only for crime prevention, but also general public safety.\nCCTV camera budgeting falls under the allocations of the Safety and Security Directorate, which also deploys communications equipment for various Cape Town neighborhood watch organizations. The city's CCTV Cameras are also used for license plate recognition, by means of Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) software. This is used by units including the city's Highway Patrol. In 2019, the City spent around R20 million on upgrading this system and purchasing new security vehicles.\nSince 2024, Cape Town has also made use of its Eye in the Sky (Eye) Information, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance initiative \u2013 an advanced, drone-based aerial technology system designed to provide real-time monitoring of activities on the ground. Forming part of a broader push to integrate surveillance technologies into public safety and urban governance, Eye's unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been specially designed for fighting crime, and are considerably advanced as a result.\nThe drones are equipped with infrared cameras, and can detect body heat in cold water, trace residual heat from discharged firearms, and capture the thermal signatures of high-speed vehicles. Furthermore, the drones can fly at very high altitudes, operate for long periods of time, and function in adverse weather conditions.\nThe City uses similar drones for environmental issues, such as mountain fires and illegal marine poaching. Cape Town's Eye drones deliver high-resolution, real-time intelligence to the city's security agencies and emergency response teams, forming an integral part of the city's overall safety and security operations.\nOther forms of technology added recently to the city's safety and security arsenal include dashboard-mounted Automated Number Plate Recognition cameras, bodycams for police officers, gunshot detection systems for remote alerts, and handheld digital devices which are linked to the city's Emergency Policing Incident Control (EPIC) system, for fast-tracked incident logging, issuing of fines, and uploading of photographic evidence. Cape Town continues to modernize its policing systems, and in recent years, has spent over R600 million on technological advancements in the security space.\nMany Cape Town residents have access to additional security in the form of private security subscriptions, from the likes of large companies (with national reach), such as Fidelity ADT. These companies provide armed response teams for residential crime reduction, with private security personnel and vehicles also being stationed around Cape Town neighborhoods for visible, localized security. ADT also partners with major South African fiber network operator (FNO) Vumatel, to monitor areas via CCTV, and some suburbs' residents have arranged for cameras to be installed around their houses for 24/7 surveillance, to increase local security.\nThe city is part of the Public Emergency Call Center (107) network, for crime reporting and response.\nCape Town has been a pioneer with policing and security innovations in South Africa. The City runs the country's only police reservist service that is managed by a local government, in the form of the Disaster Volunteers, and the Law Enforcement Auxiliary Service. It was also first to launch specialized policing units including the Gang and Drug Task Team, and the Metal Theft Unit.\nThe city is also the only metropolitan area in South Africa to use gunfire detection systems in high-risk areas, and to effectively implement computer-aided dispatch and integrated spatially enabled resource management through its award-winning EPIC system. Furthermore, Cape Town employs the largest CCTV network out of all South African cities.\nEnergy supply.\nAs with many other forms of infrastructure, Cape Town stands out amongst South Africa's metropolitan areas for having a more developed, stable energy supply. The city is home to the country's only nuclear power station - Koeberg \u2013 as well as numerous other forms of power generating plants. A second nuclear station, situated in Duynefontein (slightly south-east of Koeberg) is planned. The new plant received Environmental Authorization in 2025, and awaits further statutory approvals by the national government.\nFurthermore, Cape Town uses a system of pumped hydro electricity storage (at Steenbras) to supplement its own power generation and avoid up to 2 stages of load shedding (power outages), when the rest of the national grid goes down due to insufficient energy to meet demand. This results in not only residential homes having more sustained power feeds, but also allows commercial and industrial operations to continue when other major areas in the country are without power, boosting Cape Town's economic output.\nIn January 2024, it was reported that the City of Cape Town intended to leave national energy operator Eskom behind, and become completely energy self-sustaining. Through adding 650MW of independent power to the city's grid, Cape Town aims to protect itself against the first 4 stages of Eskom load-shedding by 2026, with the goal of eventually becoming entirely self-sufficient, meeting its own electricity demand. The closing date for tender submissions for this project was 8 April 2024.\nThe City aims to procure power from existing generators, and will follow a two-pronged structure, allowing bidders to supplement dispatchable or reserve power with an optional self-dispatchable component \u2013 the latter being at a lower cost than the prevailing Eskom Megaflex Tariff.\nCape Town was able to go ahead with this plan after successful advocacy to the national government for the integration of independent power producers (IPPs) into the national grid. The City of Cape Town took the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to court, after Nersa said it could not allow for independent power production unless the Ministry made changes.\nCape Town's progress with a holistic energy plan, detached from Eskom, was achieved following the gazetting of amendments to the electricity regulations for new electricity generation capacity in 2020, by then-Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe.\nThe new regulations opened the way for municipalities in good financial standing to develop their own power generation projects. President Ramaphosa announced the changes in a speech to Parliament in the same year, which marked the first time municipalities were allowed to buy energy from sources other than state-owned Eskom's monopolistic system.\nRecent and in-progress power diversification methods include:\nThe City of Cape Town announced a \"Cash for Power\" program in 2024, as part of its overall Energy Strategy. The program allows for Cape Town households to earn money for selling excess power they generate via solar panels back to the city's grid \u2013 a first for South Africa. The City opened applications for residential households to feed power into the grid by means of grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and bi-directional meters.\nDuring the announcement speech, Cape Town's Mayor also criticized the national government and Eskom for not fixing the load shedding problems in South Africa, and said that Cape Town would not wait for matters with the national grid to be fixed, with the City instead making its own power generation plans.\nCape Town has South Africa's most advanced plans to buy power on the open market. In February 2025, the city announced that its Cash for Power program had 1,842 active participants, and had paid out over R55 million to its residents and businesses as part of the program, via credits applied to their municipal energy bills. 1,090 small-scale generators (sellers) were residential customers, and 752 were commercial or industrial. The city also stated that it was on track to double the payouts in the program's second year of operation.\nThe City further stated that it had launched an online system for registering solar PV systems for the program, and announced unveiled a cheaper, bi-directional meter to feed power back into the grid. Customers can offset their electricity bills without registering for the Cash for Power program. However, registering allows them to go into a credit status, with the City paying them back for any excess power generation.\nIn 2025, the conclusion of a year-long electricity wheeling pilot project was announced. 562,800 kWh of renewable electricity was successfully wheeled during the pilot. Enpower Trading, Etana Energy, and Equites Fund Property were the traders for the process. Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis announced that the city would enter the next phase of the project, whereby it would promote the scaling up of power trading across Cape Town's electricity grid, based on bilateral and multilateral trading agreements.\nThe Mayor described the milestone as an exciting leap forward, to diversify Cape Town's electricity supplier base beyond Eskom, and towards a future of decentralized electricity trading in South Africa.\nIn June 2025, the City of Cape Town's Atlantis solar PV plant had finished the installation of around 2,400 solar panels out of a planned 12,850 panels, as part of a R200 million renewable-energy project. City of Cape Town Energy MEC Xanthea Limberg stated that the Atlantis site would operate as a hybrid plant, alongside the city's first utility-scale battery storage operation, totaling 8 MW. There are plans for a 60 MW solar plant to be built at Paardevlei, which is expected to provide sufficient protection from one stage of Eskom load shedding.\nCape Town has a goal of net-zero carbon municipal buildings by 2030, as well as a goal for alternative energy to meet 35% of the city's total demand by 2030.\nThe city's changes to its power infrastructure represent major changes in South Africa's overall electricity network, including a shift towards green energy, the integration of wheeling processes, a move towards energy diversification as a reaction to rising Eskom tariffs, and shorter-term, flexible contracts in a merchant market providing businesses with easier methods to source stable power.\nWater supply.\nThe Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) is a complex water supply system in the Western Cape region of South Africa, comprising an inter-linked system of six main dams, pipelines, tunnels and distribution networks, and a number of minor dams, some owned and operated by the Department of Water and Sanitation and some by the City of Cape Town.\nWater crisis of 2017 to 2018.\nThe Cape Town water crisis of 2017 to 2018 was a period of severe water shortage in the Western Cape region, most notably affecting the City of Cape Town. While dam water levels had been declining since 2015, the Cape Town water crisis peaked during mid-2017 to mid-2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30 percent of total dam capacity.\nIn late 2017, there were first mentions of plans for \"Day Zero\", a shorthand reference for the day when the water level of the major dams supplying the city could fall below 13.5 percent. \"Day Zero\" would mark the start of Level 7 water restrictions, when municipal water supplies would be largely switched off and it was envisioned that residents could have to queue for their daily ration of water. If this had occurred, it would have made the City of Cape Town the first major city in the world to run out of water.\nThe city of Cape Town implemented significant water restrictions in a bid to curb water usage, and succeeded in reducing its daily water usage by more than half to around 500 million litres (130,000,000 US gal) per day in March 2018. The fall in water usage led the city to postpone its estimate for \"Day Zero\", and strong rains starting in June 2018 led to dam levels recovering.\nIn September 2018, with dam levels close to 70 percent, the city began easing water restrictions, indicating that the worst of the water crisis was over. Good rains in 2020 effectively broke the drought and resulting water shortage when dam levels reached 95 percent. Concerns have been raised, however, that unsustainble demand and limited water supply could result in future drought events.\nWater infrastructure developments.\nThe City of Cape Town has mapped out a New Water Program, and Water Strategy, which plan to add 300 million litres of water per day to the city's supply, through measures including desalination, tapping into groundwater, and clearing invasive species.\nIn mid-2024, the Cape Town municipality stated that it was embarking on an infrastructure stability program, which involves refurbishing infrastructure and building new capacity, with funds for the program already having been added to the city's budget.\nThe City of Cape Town announced in 2024 that it planned to build a desalination plant, to further strengthen Cape Town's water supply. A feasibility study was planned to be completed in 2025. The facility is expected to produce between 50 million and 70 million litres of water a day, with a targeted starting date of 2030.\nThe plant will be located on undeveloped land, at the intersection of the R27 and N1, in the vicinity of the Port of Cape Town. The city is undertaking an environmental impact assessment process for the project.\nCity of Cape Town Water and Sanitation MMC Zahid Badroodien stated that the proposed Paarden Island desalination plant would feature a 22,000 square meter sea water, reverse-osmosis operation, for use by Cape Town households. The estimated capital cost of the plant was roughly R5 billion, excluding VAT, and will be funded through the city's water tariff.\nFuture developments.\nAs part of Cape Town's Vision 2050 project, the City aims to significantly upgrade its infrastructure. The 25-year project, unveiled by the City in mid-2025, was opened for public comment for a period of around 2 months. At the time, Cape Town's Mayor stated that the project's overarching goal was for Cape Town to remain a, \"future-fit city of opportunities for all\". 75% of the project's goals will directly benefit lower-income households.\nSome of Vision 2050's aims include:\nTransport.\nAir.\nCape Town International Airport serves both domestic and international flights. It is the second-largest airport in South Africa and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Cape region. Cape Town has regularly scheduled services to Southern Africa, East Africa, Mauritius, Middle East, Far East, Europe, Brazil and the United States as well as eleven domestic destinations.\nAs tourism numbers increased in the lead-up to the tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Cape Town International Airport opened a brand new central terminal building that was developed to handle an expected increase in air traffic.\nOther renovations include several large new parking garages, a revamped domestic departure terminal, a new Bus Rapid Transit system station and a new double-decker road system. The airport's cargo facilities are also being expanded and several large empty plots are being developed into office space and hotels.\nCape Town is one of five internationally recognised Antarctic gateway cities with transportation connections. Since 2021, commercial flights have operated from Cape Town to Wolf's Fang Runway, Antarctica. The Cape Town International Airport was among the winners of the World Travel Awards for being Africa's leading airport. Cape Town International Airport is located 18km from the Central Business District.\nSea.\nCape Town has a long tradition as a port city, and its role as a re-provisioning stop at the midpoint of the Cape Route gained it the nicknames \"Tavern of the Seas\" and \"Tavern of the Indian Ocean\". The Port of Cape Town, the city's main port, is in Table Bay directly to the north of the CBD.\nThe port is a hub for ships in the southern Atlantic: it is located along one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world, and acts as a stopover point for goods en route to or from Latin America and Asia. It is also an entry point into the South African market. It is the second-busiest container port in South Africa after Durban. In 2004, it handled 3,161 ships and 9.2million tonnes of cargo.\nSimon's Town Harbour on the False Bay coast of the Cape Peninsula is the main operational base of the South African Navy.\nUntil the 1970s the city was served by the Union Castle Line with service to the United Kingdom and St Helena. The RMS \"St Helena\" provided passenger and cargo service between Cape Town and St Helena until the opening of St Helena Airport.\nThe cargo vessel M/V \"Helena\", under AW Shipping Management, takes a limited number of passengers, between Cape Town and St Helena and Ascension Island on its voyages. Multiple vessels also take passengers to and from Tristan da Cunha, inaccessible by aircraft, to and from Cape Town. In addition, NSB Niederelbe Schiffahrtsgesellschaft takes passengers on its cargo service to the Canary Islands and Hamburg, Germany.\nRail.\nThe Shosholoza Meyl is the passenger rail operations of Spoornet and operates one long-distance passenger rail service from Cape Town as of 2024: a weekly service to and from Johannesburg via Kimberley. These trains terminate at Cape Town railway station and make a stop at Bellville. Cape Town also terminates 2 luxury tourist train routes as of 2024 operated by the Ceres Rail Company, traveling from the Waterfront to Simon's Town and Grabouw respectively.\nMetrorail operates a commuter rail service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.\nRoad.\nCape Town is the origin of three national routes (\"N\" routes), namely the N1, N2, and N7.\nThe N1 begins at the foreshore area near the Cape Town city centre and runs east-north-east as a freeway through the towns of Goodwood, Parow, Bellville, Brackenfell and Kraaifontein before continuing towards Paarl. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, and Pretoria. An older at-grade road, the R101, runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville to Worcester.\nThe N2 begins at the foreshore area near the Cape Town city centre and runs east-south-east through Mowbray, Khayelitsha, Macassar and Somerset West before leaving the municipality as the Sir Lowry's Pass, connecting with coastal cities to the east, including Mossel Bay, George, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. An older at-grade road, the R102, runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south-east at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the towns of Kuilsrivier and Eersterivier.\nThe N7 originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Acacia Park and Edgemead. It heads northwards, initially as a highway, but becomes an at-grade road from the intersection with the M12 onwards. It follows the Atlantic coast northwards towards Malmesbury, Clanwilliam, Vredendal, Springbok and the border with Namibia.\nThere are also a number of provincial routes linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The R27 originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of Milnerton, Table View and Bloubergstrand and links the city to the West Coast, ending at the town of Velddrif.\nThe R44 enters the east of the metro from the north, from Stellenbosch. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to Strand and Gordon's Bay. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of Betty's Bay and Kleinmond.\nThere are also a number of regional routes (\"R\" routes) in the area. The R300 is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near Mitchells Plain and the Cape Town International Airport. The R302 runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through Durbanville before leaving the metro to reach Malmesbury.\nThe R304 enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running north-north-west before veering west to cross the N7 at Philadelphia to end at Atlantis at a junction with the R307. This R307 starts north of Koeberg from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to Darling. The R310 originates from Muizenberg and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\nCape Town, like most South African cities, uses Metropolitan or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. The M3 splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the CBD with Muizenberg. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The M5 splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road. Cape Town has the worst traffic congestion in South Africa as of 2015.\nLicensing.\nIn terms of driver's licensing, Cape Town, and the Western Cape province, are significantly more advanced than the rest of South Africa. In May 2025, the Western Cape launched a digital learner's license testing system, the goal of which was to replace the traditional pen and paper test, reduce corruption, and deliver faster and more accurate results.\nIn September 2025, Cape Town launched its drive through driver's license renewal system, with a facility in Brackenfell. The system allows for rapid renewal (in under 5 minutes), without driver's leaving their cars. Renewals can be sped up further if driver's have received an SMS renewal confirmation, and show it at the drive through. The first facility is cashless, and operates Monday through Saturday.\nBuses.\nGolden Arrow Bus Services operates scheduled bus services in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Several companies run long-distance bus services from Cape Town to the other cities in South Africa.\nMyCiTi.\nCape Town has a public transport system in about 10% of the city, running north to south along the west coastline of the city, comprising Phase 1 of the IRT system. This is known as the MyCiTi service.\nMyCiTi Phase 1 includes services linking the Airport to Cape Town CBD, as well as the following areas: Blouberg / Table View, Dunoon, Atlantis and Melkbosstrand, Milnerton, Paarden Eiland, Century City, Salt River and Walmer Estate, and all suburbs of the City Bowl and Atlantic Seaboard all the way to Llandudno and Hout Bay.\nThe MyCiTi N2 Express service consists of four routes each linking the CBD and Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain on the Cape Flats.\nThe service use high floor articulated and standard size buses in dedicated busways, low floor articulated and standard size buses on the N2 Express service, and smaller Optare buses in suburban and inner city areas. It offers universal access through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the EMV compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from three to twenty minutes in peak times to an hour in off-peak times.\nTaxis.\nCape Town has various kinds of taxis available, including those obtained through ride-hailing (app-based) services such as Bolt and Uber, as well as traditional metered taxies.\nThe Western Cape Provincial Regulatory Entity (PRE) issues ride-hailing licenses for Cape Town, which have expiry dates and need to be renewed.

Metered taxis can be found at transport hubs as well as other tourist establishments, while minibus taxis can be found at taxi ranks, and, commonly, travelling along main streets. Minibus taxis can be hailed from the road.\nCape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in CBD and Cape Town International Airport areas.

The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.\nMinibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles. Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy. These taxis make frequent unscheduled stops to pick up passengers, which can cause accidents. With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance. Minibuses are generally owned and operated in fleets.\nCulture.\nCape Town is noted for its architectural heritage, with the highest density of Cape Dutch style buildings in the world.

The event usually takes place in mid-December, and is hosted at the Cape Town Stadium in Green Point.\nThere are several golf courses in Cape Town. The Clovelly Country Club and Metropolitan Golf Club have 18 holes.\nWater-based activities.\nThe coastline of Cape Town is relatively long, and the varied exposure to weather conditions makes it fairly common for water conditions to be conducive to recreational scuba diving at some part of the city's coast. There is considerable variation in the underwater environment and regional ecology as there are dive sites on reefs and wrecks on both sides of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay, split between two coastal marine ecoregions by the Cape Peninsula, and also variable by depth zone.\nFalse Bay is open to the south, and the prevailing open ocean swell arrives from the southwest, so the exposure varies considerably around the coastline. The inshore bathymetry near Cape Point is shallow enough for a moderate amount of refraction of long period swell, but deep enough to have less effect on short period swell, and acts as a filter to pass mainly the longer swell components to the Western shores, although they are significantly attenuated.\nThe eastern shores get more of the open ocean spectrum, and this results in very different swell conditions between the two sides at any given time. The fetch is generally too short for southeasterly winds to produce good surf. There are more than 20 named breaks in False Bay.\nThe north-wester can have a long fetch and can produce large waves, but they may also be associated with local wind and be very poorly sorted. The Atlantic coast is exposed to the full power of the South-westerly swell produced by the westerly winds of the southern ocean, often a long way away, so the swell has time to separate into similar wavelengths, and there are some world class big wave breaks among the named breaks of the Atlantic shore.\nIn the 1950s the city was part of four editions of the famous Algiers-Cape Town Rally, during the pioneer years of trans-Africa rallying and motor exploration. The closing of the road to the newly founded Zaire caused the city to be dropped from the traject.\nCape Town is also home to Zeekoevlei, a fresh water lake near the False Bay coast.
