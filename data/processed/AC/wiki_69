It contains nearly one-third of the United Kingdom's land area, consisting of the northern part of the island of [[Great Britain]] and more than 790 adjacent [[Islands of Scotland|islands]], principally in the archipelagos of the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]. In 2022, the country's population was about 5.4 million. Its capital city is [[Edinburgh]], whilst [[Glasgow]] is the largest city and the most populous of the [[cities of Scotland]]. To the south-east, Scotland has its [[Anglo-Scottish border|only land border]], which is long and shared with [[England]]; the country is surrounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the north and west, the [[North Sea]] to the north-east and east, and the [[Irish Sea]] to the south. The legislature, the [[Scottish Parliament]], elects 129 [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|members]] to represent 73 [[List of Scottish Parliament constituencies and electoral regions (2011\u20132026)|constituencies]] across the country. The [[Scottish Government]] is the [[Executive (government)|executive arm]] of the devolved government, headed by the [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister]], who chairs the [[Scottish Cabinet|cabinet]] and is responsible for government policy and [[International relations of Scotland|international engagement]]. \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] emerged as an independent [[sovereign state]] in the 9th century. In 1603, [[James VI]] succeeded to the thrones of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], forming a [[personal union]] of the [[Union of the Crowns|three kingdoms]]. On 1 May 1707, Scotland and England combined to create the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], with the [[Parliament of Scotland]] subsumed into the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. In 1999, a [[Scottish Parliament]] was re-established, and has [[Devolution|devolved]] authority over many areas of [[domestic policy]]. The country has its own distinct [[Scots law|legal system]], [[Education in Scotland|education system]] and [[History of Christianity in Scotland|religious history]], which have all contributed to the continuation of [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish culture]] and [[Scottish national identity|national identity]]. [[Scottish English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] are the most widely spoken [[Languages of Scotland|languages in the country]], existing on a [[dialect continuum]] with each other. [[Scottish Gaelic]] speakers can be found all over Scotland, but the language is largely spoken natively by communities within the [[Hebrides]]; Gaelic speakers now constitute less than 2% of the total population, although state-sponsored [[Revitalisation of Scottish Gaelic|revitalisation]] attempts have led to a growing community of [[second language]] speakers.\nThe mainland of Scotland is broadly divided into three regions: the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], a mountainous region in the north and north-west; the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], a flatter plain across the centre of the country; and the [[Southern Uplands]], a hilly region along the southern border. The Highlands are the most mountainous region of the British Isles and contain its highest peak, [[Ben Nevis]], at . The region also contains many lakes, called [[loch]]s; the term is also applied to the many saltwater inlets along the country's deeply indented western coastline. The geography of the many islands is varied. Some, such as [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and [[Isle of Skye|Skye]], are noted for their mountainous terrain, while the likes of [[Tiree]] and [[Coll]] are much flatter.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\n\"Scotland\" comes from , the Latin name for the [[Gaels]]. [[Philip Freeman]] has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an [[Indo-European root]], *\"skot\", citing the parallel in Greek (), meaning 'darkness, gloom'. The [[Late Latin]] word (\"land of the Gaels\") was initially used to refer to Ireland, and likewise in early [[Old English language|Old English]] was used for Ireland. By the 11th century at the latest, \"Scotia\" was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the [[River Forth]], alongside \"Albania\" or \"Albany\", both derived from the Gaelic . The use of the words \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]].\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe earliest known evidence of human presence in Scotland is [[Hamburgian culture]] stone tools produced by late [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter gatherers]] who arrived in Scotland during the [[B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d Interstadial]] warm period at the end of the [[last ice age]], around 14,500 to 14,000 years ago, shortly following the retreat of the ice sheet that had previously covered Scotland. [[Early European Farmers|Neolithic farmers]] arrived in Scotland around 6000 years ago. The well-preserved village of [[Skara Brae]] on the mainland of [[Orkney]] dates from this period. Neolithic habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the [[Callanish Stones]] on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] and the [[Maes Howe]] on [[Orkney]], which were built in the third millennium BC.\nEarly history.\n[[File:Skara Brae - geograph.org.uk - 3912232.jpg|thumb|right|[[Skara Brae]], Europe's most complete [[Neolithic]] village, occupied from roughly 3180 BC \u2013 2500 BC]]\nThe first written reference to Scotland was in 320 BC by Greek sailor [[Pytheas]], who called the northern tip of Britain \"Orcas\", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.\nMost of modern Scotland was not [[Roman conquest of Britain|incorporated]] into the [[Roman Empire]], and Roman control over parts of the area fluctuated over a rather short period. The first Roman incursion into Scotland was in 79 AD, when [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] invaded Scotland; he defeated a Caledonian army at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]] in 83 AD. After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the [[Gask Ridge]] close to the [[Highland Boundary Fault|Highland line]], but by three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the [[Southern Uplands]]. Remains of Roman forts established in the 1st century have been found as far north as the [[Moray Firth]]. By the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] (r.\u200998\u00a0\u2013\u00a0117), Roman control had lapsed to Britain south of a line between the [[River Tyne]] and the [[Solway Firth]]. Along this line, Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] (r.\u2009117\u00a0\u2013\u00a0138) erected [[Hadrian's Wall]] in northern England and the \"[[Limes Britannicus]]\" became the northern border of the Roman Empire. The Roman influence on the southern part of the country was considerable, and they introduced [[Christianity]] to Scotland.\nThe [[Antonine Wall]] was built from 142 at the order of Hadrian's successor [[Antoninus Pius]] (r.\u2009138\u00a0\u2013\u00a0161), defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island, north of a line between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]]. The [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208\u2013210]] was undertaken by emperors of the imperial [[Severan dynasty]] in response to the breaking of a treaty by the Caledonians in 197, but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by Roman forces becoming bogged down in punishing [[guerrilla warfare]] and the death of the senior emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (r.\u2009193\u00a0\u2013\u00a0211) at [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) after he was taken ill while on campaign. Although forts erected by the [[Roman army]] in the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the [[glens]] in the Highlands, the Caledonians were again in revolt in 210\u2013211 and these were overrun.\n[[File:Callanish at sunset - geograph.org.uk - 820680.jpg|thumb|left|[[Callanish Stones]], erected in the late [[Neolithic]] era]]\nTo the Roman historians [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]], the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the area north of the [[River Forth]] was called [[Caledonia]]. According to Cassius Dio, the inhabitants of Caledonia were the [[Caledonians]] and the [[Maeatae]]. Other ancient authors used the adjective \"Caledonian\" to mean anywhere in northern or inland Britain, often mentioning the region's people and animals, its cold climate, its pearls, and a noteworthy region of wooded hills () which the 2nd century AD Roman philosopher [[Ptolemy]], in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|\"Geography\"]], described as being south-west of the [[Beauly Firth]]. The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of [[Dunkeld]], [[Rohallion]], and [[Schiehallion]].\nThe [[Great Conspiracy]] constituted a seemingly coordinated invasion against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, which included the participation of the Gaelic [[Scoti]] and the Caledonians, who were then known as [[Picts]] by the Romans. This was defeated by the [[Comes Theodosius|\"comes\" Theodosius]]; but Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] and the immigration of the [[Saxons]] to southeastern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.\nKingdom of Scotland.\nBeginning in the sixth century, the area that is now Scotland was divided into four areas: [[Pictland]], a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland; the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of Northumbria]], which had conquered southeastern Scotland; Northern Brittonic territory likely centred on [[Alt Clut]] (Dumbarton Rock) and the Clyde valley; and [[D\u00e1l Riata]], which included territory in western Scotland and northern Ireland, and spread Gaelic language and culture into Scotland. These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth, although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in [[subsistence agriculture]]. The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.\nGaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of [[Celtic Church|Gaelic-speaking clerics]] working as missionaries. Operating in the sixth century on the island of [[Iona]], [[Saint Columba]] was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries. The [[Vikings]] began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest [[Norse Scotland|Norse]] settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast. [[Old Norse]] entirely displaced [[Pictish language|Pictish]] in the [[Northern Isles]].\nIn the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named [[Kenneth I]] (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture. The kingdom of Cin\u00e1ed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the Pictish language went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic. From a base in eastern Scotland north of the [[River Forth]] and south of the [[River Spey]], the kingdom expanded first southwards, into the former Northumbrian lands, and northwards into [[Province of Moray|Moray]]. Around the turn of the millennium, there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established.\n[[File:Great Window, Parliament Hall, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|left|[[James V of Scotland]] at the [[Court of Session]] in 1532, at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh]], the [[Parliament of Scotland]] until 1707]]\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, much of Scotland was under the control of a single ruler. Initially, Gaelic culture predominated, but immigrants from France, England and Flanders steadily created a more diverse society, with the Gaelic language starting to be replaced by Scots; and a modern nation-state emerged from this. At the end of this period, war against England started the growth of a [[Scottish national consciousness]].ch 1 [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124\u20131153) and his successors centralised royal power and united mainland Scotland, capturing regions such as Moray, [[Galloway]], and [[Caithness]], although he could not extend his power over the [[Hebrides]], which had been ruled by various [[Scottish clans]] following the death of [[Somerled]] in 1164. In 1266, Scotland fought the short but consequential [[Scottish-Norwegian War]] which saw the reclamation of the [[Hebrides]] after the strong defeat of King [[Haakon IV]] and his forces at the [[Battle of Largs]]. Up until that point, the Hebrides had been under Norwegian Viking control for roughly 400 years and had developed a distinctive [[Norse\u2013Gaelic]] culture that saw many [[Old Norse]] loanwords enter the [[Scottish Gaelic]] spoken by islanders, and through successive generations the Norse would become almost completely assimilated into [[Gaelic culture]] and the [[Scottish clan]] system. After the conflict, Scotland had to affirm Norwegian sovereignty of the [[Northern Isles]], but they were later integrated into Scotland in the 15th century. Scandinavian culture in the form of the [[Norn language]] survived for a lot longer than in the Hebrides, and would strongly influence the local [[Scots language|Scots]] dialect on [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]]. Later, a system of [[feudalism]] was consolidated, with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king. The relationship with [[Kingdom of England|England]] was complex during this period: Scottish kings tried several times, sometimes with success, to exploit English political turmoil, followed by the longest period of peace between Scotland and England in the mediaeval period: from 1217\u20131296.45-46\nWars of Scottish Independence.\n[[File:Wallace Monument , Stirling, Scotland, in Autumn.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The [[Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]], commemorates Sir [[William Wallace]], a Scottish independence leader]] \nThe death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in March 1286 broke the succession line of Scotland's kings. [[Edward I of England]] arbitrated between various claimants for the Scottish crown. In return for surrendering Scotland's nominal independence, [[John Balliol]] was pronounced king in 1292. In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the [[Auld Alliance]]. War ensued, and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. [[Andrew Moray]] and [[William Wallace]] initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], until [[Robert the Bruce]] was crowned king of Scotland in 1306. Victory at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], won the support of [[Pope John XXII]], leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.\nA civil war between the [[Bruce dynasty]] and their long-term rivals of the [[House of Comyn]] and [[House of Balliol]] lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce faction was successful, [[David II of Scotland|David II]]'s lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]], the [[Lord High Steward of Scotland]], to come to the throne and establish the [[House of Stewart]]. The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the [[Middle Ages]]. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], despite the effects of the [[Black Death]] in 1349 and increasing division between [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]. Multiple truces reduced warfare on the southern border.\nUnion of the Crowns.\n[[File:Adam de Colone (c.1572-1651) - James VI and I (1566\u20131625), King of Scotland (1567\u20131625), King of England and Ireland (1603\u20131625) - PG 2172 - National Galleries of Scotland.jpg|thumb|right|[[James VI and I|James VI]], [[King of Scotland]], succeeded to the English and Irish thrones in 1603.]]\nThe [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] was signed in 1502 by [[James IV of Scotland]] and [[Henry VII of England]]. James married Henry's daughter, [[Margaret Tudor]]. James invaded England in support of France under the terms of the [[Auld Alliance]] and became the last monarch in [[Great Britain]] to die in battle, at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] in 1513. The war with England during the minority years of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] between 1543 and 1551 is known as the [[Rough Wooing]]. In 1560, the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]] brought an end to the [[Siege of Leith]] and recognized the Protestant [[Elizabeth I]] as Queen of England. The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Parliament of Scotland]] met and immediately adopted the [[Scots Confession]], which signalled the [[Scottish Reformation]]'s sharp break from papal authority and Roman Catholic teaching. The Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate in 1567]].\nIn 1603, [[James VI and I|James VI, King of Scots]] inherited the thrones of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and moved to London. This was a [[personal union]] as despite having the same monarch the kingdoms retained their separate parliaments, laws and other institutions. The first [[Union Jack]] was designed at James's behest, to be flown in addition to the [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] on Scots vessels at sea. James VI and I intended to create a single kingdom of Great Britain, but was thwarted in his attempt to do so by the [[Parliament of England]], which supported the wrecking proposal that a full legal union be sought instead, a proposal to which the Scots Parliament would not assent, causing the king to withdraw the plan.\nExcept for a short period under [[the Protectorate]], Scotland remained a separate state in the 17th century, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the [[Covenanters]] over the form of [[Presbyterian church governance|church government]]. The military was strengthened, allowing the imposition of royal authority on the western Highland clans. The 1609 [[Statutes of Iona]] compelled the cultural integration of Hebridean clan leaders. In 1641 and again in 1643, the Parliament of Scotland unsuccessfully sought a union with England which was \"federative\" and not \"incorporating\", in which Scotland would retain a separate parliament. The issue of union split the parliament in 1648.\nAfter the execution of the Scottish king at [[Whitehall]] in 1649, amid the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|its events in Scotland]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], the victorious [[Lord Protector]], imposed the British Isles' first written constitution \u2013 the [[Instrument of Government]] \u2013 on Scotland in 1652 as part of the republican [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland]]. The Protectorate Parliament was the first Westminster parliament to include representatives nominally from Scotland. The monarchy of the [[House of Stuart]] was resumed with the [[Restoration in Scotland]] in 1660. The Parliament of Scotland sought a commercial union with England in 1664; the proposal was rejected in 1668. In 1670 the Parliament of England rejected a proposed political union with Scotland. English proposals along the same lines were abandoned in 1674 and in 1685. The Scots Parliament rejected proposals for a political union with England in 1689. [[Jacobitism]], the political support for the exiled Catholic Stuart dynasty, remained a threat to the security of the British state under the Protestant [[House of Orange]] and the succeeding [[House of Hanover]] until the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland]] attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the [[Darien scheme]].\nTreaty of Union.\n[[File:Treaty of Union.jpg|thumb|Scottish Exemplification (official copy) of the Treaty of Union of 1707]]\nAfter another proposal from the English House of Lords was rejected in 1695, and a further Lords motion was voted down in the House of Commons in 1700, the Parliament of Scotland again rejected union in 1702. The failure of the Darien Scheme bankrupted the landowners who had invested, though not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England. On 22 July 1706, the [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scots Parliament]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. The following year, twin [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] were passed by both parliaments to create the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] with effect from 1 May 1707 with popular opposition and anti-union riots in [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], and elsewhere. The union also created the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which succeeded both the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]], which rejected proposals from the [[Parliament of Ireland]] that the third kingdom be incorporated in the union.\n[[File:JamesFirstEarlOfSeafield.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[James Ogilvy, 4th Earl of Findlater|James Ogilvy]], former [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Lord Chancellor]] (1702\u20131708), initially supported union but by 1713 advocated for its reversal]]\n[[Andrew Fletcher (patriot)|Andrew Fletcher]], a prominent Scottish patriot, argued that the ratification of the treaty would see Scotland \"more like a conquered province\", and by 1713, the former [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], [[James Ogilvy, 4th Earl of Findlater]], who was a prominent supporter for the Treaty of Union between Scotland and England had changed his position on the treaty, and unsuccessfully advocated for the treaty to be reversed. The deposed [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Stuart]] claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly among non-[[Presbyterian]]s, including Roman Catholics and [[Episcopalian Protestants]]. Two major Jacobite risings launched in [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] failed to remove the [[House of Hanover]] from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the [[Battle of Culloden]], Great Britain's last [[pitched battle]]. \nThe passing of the Treaty of Union did not bring about immediate economic prosperity to Scotland as was widely speculated by the [[pamphleteer]] as a result of the little consideration given to prospects of the Scottish economy. Campaigners for the union between Scotland and England believed that there would be economic advantages to Scotland as a result of the failed [[Darien scheme]] which left the Kingdom of Scotland bankrupt. Eventually however, with trade tariffs with England abolished, trade blossomed, especially with [[Colonial America]]. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow [[Tobacco Lords]] were the fastest ships on the route to [[Virginia]]. Until the [[American War of Independence]] in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade. The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew, amplifying centuries of division. \nIn the Highlands, clan chiefs gradually started to think of themselves more as commercial landlords than leaders of their people. These social and economic changes included the first phase of the [[Highland Clearances]] and, ultimately, the demise of clanship.\nIndustrial age and the Scottish Enlightenment.\n[[File:Sir Henry Raeburn - Portrait of Sir Walter Scott.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Scott]], whose [[Waverley Novels]] helped define Scottish identity in the 19th century]]\nThe [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] turned Scotland into an intellectual, commercial and industrial powerhouse \u2014 so much so [[Voltaire]] said \"We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation.\" With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent [[British Empire]]. Historian Neil Davidson notes \"after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland.\" Davidson also states \"far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland \u2013 or more precisely, the Lowlands \u2013 lay at its core.\"\nThe [[Scottish Reform Act 1832]] increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From the mid-century, there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] was revived. Towards the end of the century prime ministers of Scottish descent included [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], and [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|the Earl of Rosebery]]. In the late 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by [[Keir Hardie]]'s success in the [[Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888]], leading to the foundation of the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888)|Scottish Labour Party]], which was absorbed into the [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader. Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as \"the [[Second City of the Empire]]\" after London. After 1860, the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.\nWhile the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and the engineers and inventors [[James Watt]] and [[William Murdoch]], whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain. In literature, the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was [[Walter Scott]]. His first prose work, \"[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]\" in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity. In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[George MacDonald]]. Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The [[Glasgow School]], which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the [[Celtic Revival]] the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and [[Japonism]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Proponents included architect and artist [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].\nWorld wars and Scotland Act 1998.\n[[File:Bagpiper Battle of Bazentin Ridge 14-07-1916 IWM Q 4012.jpg|thumb|right|A piper of the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] leads the [[26th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|26th Brigade]] back from the trenches during the [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge]], July 1916]]\nScotland played a major role in the [[History of the United Kingdom during the First World War|British effort]] in the [[First World War]]. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money. With a population of 4.8\u00a0million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] was Britain's commander on the Western Front. The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called \"[[Red Clydeside]]\" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] stronghold, the industrial districts switched to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] by 1922, with a base among the [[Irish Catholic]] working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. The \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party with little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.\nDuring the Second World War, Scotland was targeted by [[Nazi Germany]] largely due to its factories, shipyards, and coal mines. Cities such as [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country. Perhaps the most significant air raid in Scotland was the [[Clydebank Blitz]] of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area. 528 people were killed and 4,000 homes destroyed. Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when [[Rudolf Hess]] flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]]. Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, [[Karlheinz Pintsch]], a letter addressed to [[Adolf Hitler]] that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May. [[Albert Speer]] later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal. Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British.\n[[File:Opening of the Scottish Parliament, 1999.jpg|thumb|left|Reconvening of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in July 1999 with [[Donald Dewar]], [[first minister of Scotland|first minister]] (left) and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (centre)]] \nAfter 1945, Scotland's economic situation worsened due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance. Economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry, [[electronics manufacturing]], (see [[Silicon Glen]]), and the [[North Sea oil]] and gas industry. The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher's government of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (widely known as the Poll Tax) one year before the rest of Great Britain, contributed to a growing movement for Scottish control over domestic affairs. On 21 December 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] exploded mid\u2013air over the town of [[Lockerbie]], killing all on board as well as eleven Lockerbie residents. It remains the deadliest [[Terrorism in the United Kingdom|terrorist attack in the United Kingdom]].\nFollowing a [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum on devolution proposals in 1997]], the [[Scotland Act 1998]] was passed by the British Parliament, which established a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Scottish Government]] with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland. The Scottish Parliament was reconvened in [[Edinburgh]] on 4 July 1999. The first to hold the office of [[first minister of Scotland]] was [[Donald Dewar]], who served until his sudden death in 2000.\n21st century.\n[[File:Signing of the Edinburgh Agreement, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The signing of the [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)|Edinburgh Agreement]] permitted a [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on independence]] to be held in 2014]] \nThe [[Scottish Parliament Building]] at Holyrood opened in October 2004 after lengthy construction delays and running over budget. The Scottish Parliament's form of [[proportional representation]] (the [[additional member system]]) resulted in no one party having an overall majority for the first three Scottish parliament elections.\nThe pro-[[Scottish independence|independence]] [[Scottish National Party]] led by [[Alex Salmond]] achieved an overall majority in the [[Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]], winning 69 of the 129 seats available. The success of the SNP in achieving a majority in the Scottish Parliament paved the way for the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence]]. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence. More powers, particularly concerning taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the [[Smith Commission]].\nSince the 2014 referendum, events such as the UK leaving the European Union, despite a majority of voters in Scotland voting to remain a member, have led to calls for a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second independence referendum]]. In 2022, the [[Lord Advocate]] [[Dorothy Bain]] argued the case for the Scottish Government to hold another referendum on the issue, with the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] later ruling against the argument. Following the Supreme Court decision, the Scottish Government stated that it wished to make amendments to the [[Scotland Act 1998]] that would allow a referendum to be held.\nGeography and natural history.\n[[File:Corpach Basin - geograph.org.uk - 5757851.jpg|thumb|right|At 4,413 feet (1,345 m), [[Ben Nevis]] is the highest peak in Scotland and the [[British Isles]]]]\nThe mainland of Scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of Great Britain, which lies off the northwest coast of [[Continental Europe]]. The total area is with a land area of , comparable to the size of the [[Czech Republic]]. Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for between the basin of the [[River Tweed]] on the east coast and the [[Solway Firth]] in the west. The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the [[North Sea]] is to the east. The island of Ireland lies only from the south-western peninsula of [[Kintyre]]; Norway is to the northeast and the [[Faroe Islands]], to the north.\nThe territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237 [[Treaty of York]] between Scotland and the Kingdom of England and the 1266 [[Treaty of Perth]] between Scotland and Norway. Important exceptions include the [[Isle of Man]], which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a [[crown dependency]] outside of the United Kingdom; the island groups [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], which were acquired from Norway in 1472; and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] (after changing ownership several times) was ceded to England in 1482.\nThe geographical [[centre of Scotland]] lies a few miles from the village of [[Newtonmore]] in [[Badenoch]]. Rising to above sea level, Scotland's highest point is the summit of [[Ben Nevis]], in [[Lochaber]], while Scotland's longest river, the [[River Tay]], flows for a distance of .\nGeology and geomorphology.\n[[File:Arthur's Seat seen from the Pentlands - geograph.org.uk - 7138235.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arthur's Seat]], Edinburgh]] [[File:Loch Lomond 2013.JPG|thumb|right|[[Loch Lomond]], a freshwater [[loch]], often considered the boundary between the lowlands and Highlands]]\nThe whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]] and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands, the Central Lowlands, and the Southern Uplands.\nThe [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and the [[Cuillin]]. In north-eastern mainland Scotland [[weathering]] of rock that occurred before the [[Last Glacial Period|Last Ice Age]] has shaped much of the landscape.\nA significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low-lying dune pasture land.\nThe [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron-bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.\nThe [[Southern Uplands]] is a range of hills almost long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]]. The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 400 to 500\u00a0million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]] with an elevation of . The Southern Uplands is home to Scotland's highest village, [[Wanlockhead]] ( above sea level).\nClimate.\n[[File:Traigh Bail, Tiree - geograph.org.uk - 7983.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tiree]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] is one of the sunniest locations in Scotland.]]\nThe climate of most of Scotland is [[temperate]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as [[Labrador]], southern [[Scandinavia]], the [[Moscow region]] in [[Russia]], and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] on the opposite side of [[Eurasia]]. Temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the temperature of recorded at [[Braemar]] in the [[Grampian Mountains]], on 11 February 1895, the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK. The same temperature was also recorded in Braemar on 10 January 1982 and at [[Altnaharra]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], on 30 December 1995. Winter maxima average in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging . The highest temperature recorded was at [[RAF Charterhall|Charterhall]], [[Scottish Borders]] on 19 July 2022.\nThe west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic [[ocean currents]] and the colder surface temperatures of the [[North Sea]]. [[Tiree]], in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding . In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average of 59 snow days per year, while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per year.\nFlora and fauna.\n[[File:White-tailed eagle in flight at Falkenhof Schloss Rosenburg.jpg|thumb|right|[[White-tailed sea eagle]]]]\nScotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as [[Northern gannet|gannets]]. The [[golden eagle]] is something of a national icon.\nOn the high mountain tops, species including [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], [[mountain hare]] and [[stoat]] can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native [[Scots pine]] forest exist and within these areas the [[Scottish crossbill]], the UK's only [[endemism|endemic]] bird species and [[vertebrate]], can be found alongside [[western capercaillie|capercaillie]], [[Scottish wildcat]], [[red squirrel]] and [[pine marten]]. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the [[white-tailed eagle]] in 1975, the [[red kite]] in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the [[European beaver|beaver]] and [[wild boar]], which are both now relatively widespread. Today, much of the remaining native [[Caledonian Forest]] lies within the [[Cairngorms National Park]] and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in [[Argyll]], these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history. Scotland now ranks in the lowest 15% of countries in the Biodiversity Intactness Index.\nThe flora of the country is varied incorporating both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] woodland as well as [[moorland]] and [[tundra]] species. Large-scale commercial tree planting and management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and [[Field sports|field sport]] activities like [[deer stalking]] and [[driven grouse shooting]] impacts the distribution of [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] plants and animals. The UK's tallest tree is a [[Abies grandis|grand fir]] planted beside [[Loch Fyne]], Argyll in the 1870s, and the [[Fortingall Yew]] may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe. Although the number of native [[vascular plant]]s is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial [[bryophyte]] flora is of global importance.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\n[[File:Scotland population cartogram.svg|thumb|right|Scotland population [[cartogram]]. The size of councils is in proportion to their population.]]\nDuring the 1820s, many Scots migrated from Scotland to countries such as [[Australia]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], principally from the Highlands which remained poor in comparison to elsewhere in Scotland. The Highlands was the only part of mainland Britain with a recurrent famine. A small range of products were exported from the region, which had negligible industrial production and a continued population growth that tested the subsistence agriculture. These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing [[Highland Clearances]], in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the [[Highland Potato Famine]] and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.\nThe population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even with the development of industry, there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841\u20131931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. Caused by the advent of [[refrigeration]] and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.\nScotland is the [[Population density|most sparsely populated]] [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country]] of the United Kingdom. In August 2012, the Scottish population reached an all-time high of 5.25\u00a0million people. The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland. The [[2021 United Kingdom census#2022 Census for Scotland|most recent census in Scotland]] was conducted by the Scottish Government and the [[National Records of Scotland]] in March 2022. The population of Scotland at the 2022 Census was 5,436,600, the highest ever, beating the previous record of 5,295,400 at the 2011 Census. It was 5,062,011 at the 2001 Census. An ONS estimate for 2024 was 5,546,900. In the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's population stated their [[national identity]] as '[[Scottish people|Scottish]] only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose 'other identity only'. In 2011, 4.2% of Scotland's population identified as [[White Polish]], [[White Irish]], [[White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller]] or [[White Other]]. Additionally, the number of people belonging to Asian, African, Caribbean or Black, Mixed, or Other ethnic groups doubled, reaching 4%.\nThroughout its history, Scotland has long had a tradition of migration from Scotland and immigration into Scotland. In 2021, the Scottish Government released figures showing that an estimated 41,000 people had immigrated from other international countries into Scotland, while an average of 22,100 people had migrated from Scotland. Scottish Government data from 2002 shows that by 2021, there had been a sharp increase in immigration to Scotland, with 2002 estimates standing at 27,800 immigrants. While immigration had increased from 2002, migration from Scotland had dropped, with 2002 estimates standing at 26,200 people migrating from Scotland.\nUrbanisation.\nAlthough [[Edinburgh]] is the capital of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The [[Greater Glasgow]] conurbation, with a population of almost 1.2\u00a0million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population. The [[Central Belt]] is where most of the main towns and cities of Scotland are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen. The [[Scottish Lowlands]] host 80% of the total population, where the [[Central Belt]] accounts for 3.5\u00a0million people.\nIn general, only the more accessible and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands is essentially rural and dominated by agriculture and forestry. Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh, [[New towns in the United Kingdom#Scotland|five new towns]] were designated between 1947 and 1966. They are [[East Kilbride]], [[Glenrothes]], [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]].\nThe largest council area by population is [[Glasgow City Council|Glasgow City]], with [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] being the largest in terms of geographical area.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguages.\n[[File:Welcome to Scotland sign on the A1 - geograph.org.uk - 4057371.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Anglo-Scottish border]], welcoming travellers in both English and [[Scottish Gaelic]]]]\nScotland has three [[indigenous language]]s: English, [[Scots language|Scots]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. Scottish Standard English, a variety of English as spoken in Scotland, is at one end of a bipolar [[linguistic continuum]], with broad [[Scots language|Scots]] at the other. Scottish Standard English may have been influenced to varying degrees by Scots. [[Highland English]] is spoken in that region, while Gaelic is mostly spoken in the [[Western Isles]], where it continues to be used by a large proportion of residents.\nOverall, the use of Scotland's indigenous languages other than English has declined since the 19th century. The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had \"no skills in Scots\". The use of Gaelic is confined to 1% of the population. The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008. Across the whole of Scotland, the 2011 census showed that 25,000 people (0.49% of the population) used Gaelic at home. The most common language spoken at home in Scotland after English and Scots is Polish, with about 1.1% of the population, or 54,000 people.\nImmigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee small South Asian communities. In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group. The 2004 [[enlargement of the European Union]] spurred an increase in migration from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000 [[Polish people|Poles]] lived there.\nThere are many more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total population of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2\u00a0million Americans self-reported some degree of [[Scottish American|Scottish]] descent. [[Ulster]]'s Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent, and it is estimated that there are more than 27\u00a0million descendants of the [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] migration now living in the US. In Canada, the [[Scottish-Canadian]] community accounts for 4.7\u00a0million people. About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.\nReligion.\n[[File:St.Giles Cathedral - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[High Kirk of Edinburgh]]]]\nAs per the 2022 Census, a majority of Scots (51.12%) reported not following any religion. The most practiced religion is Christianity (38.79%), mostly the [[Church of Scotland]] (20.36%) and [[Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholicism]] (13.3%). In almost every council area, the most common response to the census question was \"No religion,\" except in [[Outer Hebrides|Na h-Eileanan Siar]] and [[Inverclyde]], where the Church of Scotland (35.3%) and Catholicism (33.4%) were the most common responses, respectively.\nForms of [[History of Christianity in Scotland|Christianity]] have dominated religious life in what is now Scotland for more than 1,400 years.\nSince the [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560, the [[national church]] (the [[Church of Scotland]], also known as [[Kirk|The Kirk]]) has been [[Protestant]] in orientation and [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] in theology. Since 1689 it has had a [[Presbyterian]] system of church government independent from the state. Its membership dropped just below 300,000 in 2020 (5% of the total population) The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with every community in Scotland having a local congregation.\nScotland also has a significant [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholic]] population with 13.3% professing that faith, particularly in Greater Glasgow and the north-west. After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like [[Uist]] and [[Barra]], and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland. Other Christian denominations in Scotland include the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], and various other Presbyterian offshoots. Scotland's third largest church is the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]].\nOther minority faiths include [[Islam in Scotland|Islam]] (2.2%), [[Hinduism in Scotland|Hinduism]] (0.55%), Sikhism and Buddhism. The [[Samy\u00e9 Ling]] monastery near [[Eskdalemuir]], which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is the oldest [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery in Western Europe.\nEducation.\n[[File:+ 908 wurde St Andrews bereits Bischohfssitz. 13 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Founded in 1413, the [[University of St. Andrews]] is the oldest in Scotland and one of the oldest worldwide]]\nThe [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]] has always had a characteristic emphasis on a [[Liberal education|broad education]]. In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]], which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \"perfyct Latyne\", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite. In the Reformation, the 1560 \"[[First Book of Discipline]]\" set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible. In 1616 an [[School Establishment Act 1616|act in Privy council]] commanded every parish to establish a school. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas. Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1872]].\nEducation in Scotland is the responsibility of the [[Scottish Government]] and is overseen by its executive agency [[Education Scotland]]. The \"[[Curriculum for Excellence]]\", Scotland's national school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for children and young people from age 3 to 18. All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1\u2013P7); children in Scotland study National Qualifications of the [[Curriculum for Excellence]] between the ages of 14 and 18. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study further qualifications. A small number of students at certain [[List of private schools in Scotland|private schools]] may follow the [[Education in England|English system]] and study towards [[GCSE]]s and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|AS-Levels]] instead.\nThere are fifteen [[Scottish universities]], some of which are among the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest in the world]]. The four universities founded before the end of the 16th century \u2013 the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[University of Glasgow]], the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] \u2013 are collectively known as the [[ancient universities of Scotland]], all of which rank among the 200 best universities in the world in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|THE rankings]], with Edinburgh placing in the top 50. Scotland had more universities per capita in [[QS World University Rankings|QS' World University Rankings']] top 100 in 2012 than any other nation. The country produces 1% of the world's [[Academic publishing|published research]] with less than 0.1% of the world's population, and higher education institutions account for 9% of Scotland's service sector exports. Scotland's University Courts are the only bodies in Scotland authorised to award degrees.\nHealth.\n[[File:View along the access road towards the new Southern General Hospital (geograph 4542089).jpg|thumb|right|[[NHS Scotland]]'s [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital]], Glasgow. It is the largest hospital campus in Europe.]]\nHealth care in Scotland is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947]] (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. Prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state-funded health care, provided by the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]]. Healthcare policy and funding is the responsibility of the Scottish Government's [[Scottish Government Health Directorates|Health Directorates]]. In 2014, the NHS in Scotland had around 140,000 staff.\nThe [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) in Scotland is below the replacement rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011). The majority of births are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012).\nLife expectancy for those born in Scotland between 2012 and 2014 is 77.1 years for males and 81.1 years for females. This is the lowest of any of the four countries of the UK. The number of hospital admissions in Scotland for diseases such as cancer was 2,528 in 2002. Over the next ten years, by 2012, this had increased to 2,669. Hospital admissions for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) were lower, with 727 admissions in 2002, and decreasing to 489 in 2012.\nGovernment and politics.\nScotland is part of the United Kingdom, a [[constitutional monarchy]] whose current sovereign is [[Charles III]]. The monarchy uses a variety of styles, titles and other symbols specific to Scotland, most of which originated in the pre\u2013union [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. These include the [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#In Scotland|royal coat of arms]], and the title [[Duke of Rothesay]], which is traditionally given to the heir apparent. There are also distinct Scottish [[Great Officers of State (United Kingdom)#Scotland|Officers of State]] and Officers of the Crown, and the [[Order of the Thistle]], a [[Order of chivalry|chivalric order]], is specific to the country.\nThe [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament of Scotland]] are the country's primary legislative bodies. The UK Parliament is [[Parliamentary sovereignty|sovereign]] and therefore has supremacy over the Scottish Parliament, but generally restricts itself to legislating over reserved matters: primarily some taxes, some aspects of social security, defence, international relations, and broadcasting. There is a [[Legislative consent motion|convention]] the UK Parliament will not legislate over devolved matters without the Scottish Parliament's consent. Scotland is represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[lower chamber]] of the UK Parliament, by 57 [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (out of a total of 650). They are elected to single-member [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|constituencies]] under the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system of voting. The [[Scotland Office]] represents the British government in Scotland and represents Scottish interests within the government. The Scotland Office is led by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland|secretary of state for Scotland]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]]. The Labour MP [[Ian Murray (Scottish politician)|Ian Murray]] has held the position since July 2024.\n[[File:Scottish Parliament - 49188771378.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in Edinburgh is the seat of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and its [[Committees of the Scottish Parliament|committees]]]]\nThe Scottish Parliament is a [[unicameral]] legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a [[first-past-the-post]] system, and the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the [[additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|additional member system]]. MSPs normally serve for a five-year period. The Scottish Parliament has the most extensive [[Devolved, reserved and excepted matters|devolved powers]] amongst the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved parliaments]] in the United Kingdom, and considered one of the most powerful devolved parliaments internationally. The largest party since the [[2021 Scottish Parliament election]], has been the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), which won 64 of the 129 seats. The [[Scottish Conservatives]], [[Scottish Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens]] also have representation in the current Parliament. The [[next Scottish Parliament election]] is due to be held on 7 May 2026.\nThe [[Scottish Government]], which has been described as one of the most powerful devolved governments globally, is led by the [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister]], who is nominated by MSPs and is typically the leader of the largest party in the Parliament. Other ministers are appointed by the first minister and serve at their discretion. As the head of the Scottish Government, the first minister is responsible for the comprehensive development, implementation and presentation of government policy, and is responsible for promoting the interests of the country at home and internationally. [[John Swinney]], leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has served as the first minister since 8 May 2024.\nDiplomacy and relations.\n[[File:President Donald Trump meets with Scottish First Minister John Swinney and U.K. Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson (54778210513).jpg|thumb|right|First Minister Swinney meets with U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]], September 2025]][[File:Bilateral meeting with Icelandic Prime Minister (32798372587).jpg|thumb|right|First Minister Sturgeon holds a bilateral meeting with Icelandic [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Prime Minister]] [[Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir]], April 2019]]\nAs leader of the Scottish Government, the first minister is a member of the [[Prime Minister and Heads of Devolved Governments Council]] and the [[Council of the Nations and Regions]], the bodies which facilitate intergovernmental relations within the United Kingdom. Foreign policy is a reserved matter and primarily the responsibility of the [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|Foreign Office]], a department of the UK Government. Nevertheless, the Scottish Government may promote Scottish interests abroad and encourage foreign investment in Scotland. The first minister and the [[constitution secretary]] have portfolios which include foreign affairs. Scotland's [[International relations of Scotland|international network]] consists of two Scotland Houses, one in [[Brussels]] and the other in [[London]], seven Scottish Government international offices, and over thirty Scottish Development International offices in other countries globally. Both Scotland Houses are independent Scottish Government establishments, whilst the seven Scottish Government international offices are based in [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom|British embassies]] or British High Commission offices. The Scottish Government has a network of offices in Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin, London, Ottawa, Paris, and Washington, D.C., which promote Scottish interests in their respective areas. Additionally, the country has a number of [[List of consular missions in Scotland|foreign diplomatic missions]], most of which are located in the capital city, Edinburgh.\nThe nation has historic ties to France as a result of the '[[Auld Alliance]]', a treaty signed between the Kingdom of Scotland and [[Kingdom of France]] in 1295 to discourage an English invasion of either country. The alliance effectively ended in the sixteenth century, but the two countries continue to have a close relationship, with a Statement of Intent being signed in 2013 between the Scottish Government and the [[Government of France]]. In 2004 the [[Scotland Malawi Partnership]] was established, which co-ordinates Scottish activities to strengthen existing links with [[Malawi]], and in 2021, the Scottish Government and [[Government of Ireland]] signed the Ireland-Scotland Bilateral Review, committing both governments to increased levels of co-operation on areas such as diplomacy, economy and business. Scotland also has [[Scandinavian Scotland|historical and cultural]] ties with the [[Scandinavian countries]]. Scottish Government policy advocates for stronger political relations with the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and [[Baltic states|Baltic]] countries, which has resulted in some Nordic-inspired policies being adopted such as baby boxes. Representatives from the Scottish Parliament attended the [[Nordic Council]] for the first time in 2022.\nScotland is a member of the [[British\u2013Irish Council]], the [[REGLEG|Conference of European Regions with Legislative Power]] (REGLEG), the [[British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Council of European Municipalities and Regions]], the [[Inter-Parliamentary Forum]], the [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]], the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] and the [[EU\u2013UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly|Parliamentary Partnership Assembly with the European Union]]. Scotland held the Presidency of Conference of European Regions with Legislative Power from November 2003 until November 2004 during the [[premiership of Jack McConnell]].\nDevolution and independence.\n[[File:Donald Dewar Statue, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Donald Dewar]], the inaugural [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister]] and was referred to as the \"[[Father of the Nation]]\"]] \n[[Devolution]]\u2014the granting of central government powers to a regional government\u2013 gained increasing popularity as a policy in the United Kingdom the late twentieth century; it was described by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], then [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], as the \"settled will of the Scottish people\". The Scottish Parliament and [[Scottish Government]] were subsequently established under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]; the Act followed a successful [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum in 1997]] which found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to [[Scottish variable rate|vary income tax]]. The Act enabled the new institutions to legislate in all areas not explicitly reserved by the UK Parliament.\nTwo more pieces of legislation, the Scotland Acts of [[Scotland Act 2012|2012]] and [[Scotland Act 2016|2016]], gave the Scottish Parliament further powers to legislate on taxation and social security; the 2016 Act also gave the Scottish Government powers to manage the affairs of the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown Estate in Scotland]]. Conversely, the [[United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020]] constrains the Scottish Parliament's autonomy to regulate goods and services, and the academic view is that this undermines devolution.\nThe [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament elections]] led to the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), which supports [[Scottish independence]], forming a [[minority government]]. The new government established a \"[[National Conversation]]\" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, [[federation|federalism]], or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. The three main unionist opposition parties\u2013[[Scottish Labour]], the [[Scottish Conservatives]], and the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]]\u2013created a separate [[Calman Commission|commission]] to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies while not considering independence. In August 2009 the SNP proposed a bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010, but was defeated by opposition from all other major parties.\n[[File:Visit of Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of the Scottish Government, to the EC.jpg|thumb|right|First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] with [[Michel Barnier]] in [[Brussels]], to discuss Scottish affairs following [[Brexit]], 2019]] \nThe [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]] resulted in an SNP overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, and on 18 September 2014 a [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]] was held. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the British Parliament\u2013the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]\u2013pledged to extend the powers of the Scottish Parliament. An all-party [[Smith Commission|commission]] chaired by [[Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin]] was formed, which led to the Scotland Act 2016.\nFollowing the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]], the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] was held on 23 June 2016 on Britain's membership of the [[European Union]]. A majority in the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU, while a majority within Scotland voted to remain a member. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced the following day that as a result a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|new independence referendum]] was \"highly likely\". On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union. Because constitutional affairs are reserved matters under the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament would again have to be granted temporary additional powers under Section 30 to hold a legally binding vote.\nLocal government.\n[[File:SouthLanarkshireCouncilHQ.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lanark County Buildings]] in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], seat of [[South Lanarkshire Council]]]] \nFor [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] purposes Scotland is subdivided into 32 single-tier council areas. The areas were established in 1996, and their councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Decisions are made by councillors, who are elected at [[Elections in Scotland|local elections]] every five years. The leader of the council is typically a councillor from the party with the most seats; councils also have a civic head, typically called the [[Provost (civil)|provost]] or [[lord provost]], who represents the council on ceremonial occasions and chairs council meetings. [[Community council|Community Councils]] are informal organisations that represent smaller subdivisions within each council area.\n[[Police Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Fire and Rescue Service]] cover the entire country. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.\nThere are [[Cities of Scotland|eight cities in Scotland]]: [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Dunfermline]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Inverness]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and [[Stirling]]. [[City status in the United Kingdom]] is conferred by the monarch through [[letters patent]].\nMilitary.\n[[File:Eurofighter Typhoon, ZK312 (19451923880).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon FGR4]] in [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|No. 6 Squadron]] markings at [[RAF Lossiemouth]]]]\nAs one of the countries of the United Kingdom, the [[British Armed Forces]] are the armed forces of Scotland. Of the money spent on UK defence, about \u00a33.3\u00a0billion can be attributed to Scotland as of 2018/2019. Scotland had a long military tradition predating the [[Treaty of Union]] with England. Following the Treaty of Union in 1707, the [[Scots Army]] and [[Royal Scots Navy]] merged with their English counterparts to form the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[British Army]], which together form part of the [[British Armed Forces]]. The [[Atholl Highlanders]], Europe's only remaining legal [[private army]], did not join the Scots Army or Royal Scots Navy in merging with English armed forces, remaining a private army not under the command of the British Armed Forces.\nNumerous [[Scottish regiment]]s have at various times existed in the British Army. Distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the [[Scots Guards]], the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] and the [[154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC]], an [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] regiment of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. In 2006, as a result of the \"[[Delivering Security in a Changing World]]\" [[white paper]], the Scottish infantry regiments in the [[Scottish Division]] were amalgamated to form the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]. As a result of the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition]]'s [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]], the Scottish regiments of the line in the [[British Army]] [[Infantry of the British Army|infantry]], having previously formed the Scottish Division, were reorganised into the [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] in 2017. Before the formation of the Scottish Division, the Scottish infantry was organised into a [[Lowland Brigade (United Kingdom)|Lowland Brigade]] and [[Highland Brigade (United Kingdom)|Highland Brigade]].\nBecause of their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments. Between 1960 and 1991, the [[Holy Loch]] was a base for the US fleet of [[Polaris ballistic missile|Polaris]]-equipped [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Today, [[HMNB Clyde|His Majesty's Naval Base Clyde]], north-west of Glasgow, is the base for the four [[Trident (missile)|Trident]]-armed [[ballistic missile submarine]]s that comprise the Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]].[[File:Challenger2-Bergen-Hohne-Training-Area-2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Challenger 2]] [[main battle tank]] of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]]]]\nScotland's [[Scapa Flow]] was the main base for the [[Royal Navy]] in the 20th century. As the [[Cold War]] intensified in 1961, the United States deployed [[Polaris ballistic missile]]s, and submarines, in the [[Firth of Clyde]]'s [[Holy Loch]]. Public protests from [[CND]] campaigners proved futile. The Royal Navy successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened with four Polaris submarines at the expanded [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane Naval Base]] on the [[Gare Loch]]. The first patrol of a [[Trident missile|Trident]]-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War.\nA single front-line [[Royal Air Force]] base is located in Scotland. [[RAF Lossiemouth]], located in [[Moray]], is the most northerly [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] base in the United Kingdom and is home to four [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] combat aircraft squadrons, three [[Poseidon MRA1]] squadrons, and a full\u2013time, permanently based RAF Regiment squadron. An additional four RAF Reserve Squadrons are based in Scotland \u2013 612 Squadron, 2622 (Highland) Squadron and 602 Squadron in Glasgow, and 603 Squadron in Edinburgh.\nLaw and order.\n[[File:Parliament Square, Edinburgh facing east.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] in Edinburgh, the former [[Parliament of Scotland]], now houses the [[College of Justice|Supreme Courts of Scotland]]]]\nScots law has a basis derived from [[Roman law]], combining features of both uncodified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], dating back to the , and [[common law]] with [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages|medieval sources]]. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales. Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably [[Udal law]] in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common [[Celtic law|Celtic]] or [[Brehon laws]] survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.\nScots law provides for three types of [[Courts of Scotland|courts]] responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and [[Law of Arms|heraldic]]. The supreme civil court is the [[Court of Session]], although civil [[appeal (law)|appeals]] can be taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (or before 1 October 2009, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]). The [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union [[Parliament of Scotland]] with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the [[Lawnmarket]]. The [[sheriff court]] is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country. [[District Courts of Scotland|District courts]] were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by [[Justice of the Peace Court]]s from 2008 to 2010.\nFor three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for devolved matters. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: \"guilty\", \"not guilty\" and \"[[not proven]]\". Both \"not guilty\" and \"not proven\" result in an [[acquittal]], typically with no possibility of retrial per the rule of [[double jeopardy]]. A retrial can hear new evidence at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to [[Perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]]. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.\n[[File:Court of Session (53707036026).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Court of Session]] is the highest national court for [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]]]]\nThe [[Lord Advocate]] is the chief legal officer of the [[Scottish Government]] and [[the Crown]] in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is the head of the systems in Scotland for the investigation and prosecution of crime, the investigation of deaths as well as serving as the principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government and representing the government in legal proceedings. They are the chief [[public prosecutor]] for Scotland and all [[prosecution]]s on indictment are conducted by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] in the Lord Advocate's name on behalf of the Monarch. The officeholder is one of the [[Great Officers of State (United Kingdom)#Scotland|Great Officers of State]] of Scotland. The current Lord Advocate, [[Dorothy Bain]], was nominated by first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and was appointed in June 2021. The Lord Advocate is supported by the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]].\nSince 2013, Scotland has had a unified police force known as [[Police Scotland]]. The [[Scottish Prison Service]] (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland, which collectively house over 8,500 prisoners. The [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Home Affairs]] is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.\nEconomy.\n[[File:Skyline of Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh]], the 13th-largest financial centre in the world and 4th largest in Europe in 2020]]\nScotland has a Western-style [[Open economy|open]] [[mixed economy]], considered one of the leading [[Financial centre|financial centres]] in Europe, and is the largest financial centre in the United Kingdom outside of London. Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with large finance firms based there including [[Lloyds Banking Group]], the [[Bank of Scotland]], the Government-owned [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and [[Standard Life]]. Edinburgh was ranked 15th in the [[Global Financial Centres Index|list of world financial centres]] in 2007, and in 2024, was ranked 33rd internationally and 10th across Europe. Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, also ranks as a significant financial centre in the country, ranked 42nd internationally in 2024 and is widely regarded as an established economic player with particular strengths in domestic expertise. Scotland is ranked within the top 10 of the largest European regions for foreign direct investment, and is rated as one \"of the most promising investment destinations in Europe\".\n[[File:Distillery-gates.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scotch whisky]] production at [[Bruichladdich distillery]]]]\nIn 2024, Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP), including offshore oil and gas, was estimated at \u00a3223.4\u00a0billion. In 2021, Scottish exports in goods and services (excluding intra-UK trade) were estimated to be \u00a350.1 billion. Scotland's primary goods exports are mineral fuels, machinery and transport, and beverages and tobacco. The country's largest export markets in goods are the [[Netherlands]] (\u00a36.9 billion), the [[United States]] (\u00a34.0 billion), the [[Republic of Ireland]] (\u00a32.8 billion), [[Germany]] (\u00a32.8 billion), [[France]] (\u00a32.3 billion) and [[China]] (\u00a30.8 billion). Its largest international export market is the [[European Union]]. [[Scotch whisky]] is one of Scotland's more known goods of economic activity. In 2024, whisky exports from Scotland contributed \u00a35.4 billion in revenue towards the economy, accounting for 74% of all Scottish food and drink exports internationally in 2023. The Scotch whisky industry supports over 41,000 jobs in the sector across Scotland. Tourism is regarded as a major component within the Scottish economy, supporting over 245,000 related jobs across the sector and contributing \u00a310.8 billion in revenue in 2023, 6% of the overall Scottish economy. The most visited tourist attractions in the country include [[Edinburgh Castle]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Battle of Culloden|Battle of Culloden Visitor Centre]], [[Edinburgh Zoo]], [[Stirling Castle]] and [[Urquhart Castle]]. A considerable number of [[List of companies of Scotland|Scottish companies]] have established international reputations and trade worldwide in a variety of sectors, including [[Rockstar North]] (gaming), [[Pringle of Scotland]] and [[Lyle &amp; Scott]] (fashion and textiles), [[A.G. Barr]] (soft drinks manufacturing), [[Alexander Dennis]] (bus manufacturing), [[Stagecoach Group]] (transportation), [[Tunnock's]] (confectionery) and [[Johnnie Walker]] (whisky). \n[[File:North Sea oil rig.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oil industry in Scotland|Oil extraction in Scottish waters]] in the [[North Sea]]]]\nScotland was one of the industrial powerhouses of Europe from the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] onwards, being a world leader in manufacturing. This left a legacy in the diversity of goods and services which Scotland produces, from textiles, [[whisky]] and [[shortbread]] to jet engines, buses, computer software, [[investment management]] and other related financial services. In common with most other advanced industrialised economies, Scotland has seen a decline in the importance of both manufacturing industries and primary-based extractive industries. This has been combined with a rise in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service]] sector of the economy, which has grown to be the largest sector in Scotland. Historically, the Scottish economy was dominated by [[heavy industry]] underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and [[steel making|steel industries]]. Petroleum-related industries associated with the extraction of [[North Sea oil]] have also been important employers since the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service]]-oriented economy. As a result, the countries primary economic sectors include [[Agriculture in Scotland|agriculture]], [[Forestry in Scotland|forestry]], [[Fishing in Scotland|fisheries]], manufacturing and construction, [[Oil industry in Scotland|oil and gas extraction]], science, technology, financial services, [[Cuisine of Scotland|food and drink]] and [[Tourism in Scotland|tourism]], with the [[Space industry of Scotland|space industry]], [[Energy in Scotland|renewable energy]] and [[Financial technology|financial technologies]] sectors being considered as developing industries across the country. Scotland's fisheries sector and associated zone is the fourth largest amongst European nations. \nThe [[Scottish National Investment Bank]] was established in 2020 by the Scottish Government, which uses public money to fund commercial projects across Scotland in the hope that this seed capital will encourage further private investment, to help develop a fairer, more sustainable economy. \u00a32\u00a0billion of taxpayers' money was earmarked for the bank.\nIncome and poverty.\n[[File:Museum on the mound, Edinburgh (41404375864).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bank of Scotland]] is one of the oldest banks in the world, and the first bank in Europe to successfully prints it own [[banknotes]]]]\nThe average weekly income for workplace-based employees in Scotland is \u00a3573, and \u00a3576 for home-based employees. Scotland has the third highest median gross salary in the United Kingdom at \u00a326,007, which is higher than the overall UK average annual salary of \u00a325,971. With an average of \u00a314.28, Scotland has the third highest median hourly rate (excluding overtime working hours) of the countries of the United Kingdom, and like the annual salary, this is higher than the average UK figure as a whole. The highest paid industries in Scotland tend of be in the [[utility]] [[electricity]], [[gas]] and [[air conditioning]] sectors, while industries like [[tourism]], accommodation and food and drink tend to be the lowest paid. The top [[local authority]] for pay, based on place of residence, is [[East Renfrewshire]] (\u00a320.87 per hour).\nThe top local authority for pay based on place of work is [[East Ayrshire]] (\u00a316.92 per hour). Scotland's cities commonly have the largest salaries in Scotland based on place of work. 2021/2022 data indicate that there were 2.6 million [[dwelling]]s across Scotland, with 318,369 [[local authority]] dwellings. A typical price for a house in Scotland was \u00a3195,000 in August 2022.\nBetween 2016 and 2020, the Scottish Government estimated that 10% of people in Scotland were in persistent poverty following housing costs, with similar rates of persistent poverty for children (10%), working-age adults (10%) and pensioners (11%). Persistent child poverty rates had seen a relatively sharp drop; however, the accuracy of this was deemed to be questionable due to various factors such as households re-entering the longitudinal sample allowing data gaps to be filled. The Scottish Government introduced the Scottish Child Payment in 2021 for low-income families with children under six years of age in an attempt to reduce child poverty rates, with families receiving a payment of roughly \u00a31,040 per year. As of October 2023, 10% of the Scottish population were estimated to be living in poverty.\nCurrency.\n[[File:RoyBankScotland100.jpg|thumb|Example of a [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] banknote]]\nAlthough the [[Bank of England]] is the [[central bank]] for the UK, three Scottish [[Clearing bank (United Kingdom)|clearing banks]] issue [[Pound sterling|Sterling]] [[banknote]]s: the [[Bank of Scotland]], the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and the [[Clydesdale Bank]]. The Bank of Scotland was the first bank in Europe to successfully print its own paper currency, with the new banknotes entering circulation in 1696, making the Bank of Scotland the longest continuous issuer of banknotes in the world. The issuing of banknotes by [[retail bank]]s in Scotland is subject to the [[Banking Act 2009]], which repealed all earlier legislation under which banknote issuance was regulated, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Banknote Regulations 2009.\nThe value of the Scottish banknotes in circulation in 2013 was \u00a33.8\u00a0billion, underwritten by the Bank of England using funds deposited by each clearing bank, under the [[Banking Act 2009]], to cover the total value of such notes in circulation.\nInfrastructure and transportation.\n[[File:Airport and plane Barra airstrip - geograph.org.uk - 852094.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barra Airport]], the only airport in the world to use a [[Tide|tidal]] [[beach]] as the runway]]\nScotland has [[List of airports in the United Kingdom and the British Crown Dependencies#Scotland|five international airports]] operating scheduled services to Europe, North America and Asia, as well as domestic services to England, Northern Ireland and Wales and within Scotland. [[Highlands and Islands Airports]] operates eleven airports across the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and the [[Western Isles]], which are primarily used for short distance, public service operations, although Inverness Airport has a number of scheduled flights to destinations across the UK and mainland Europe. Edinburgh Airport is currently Scotland's busiest airport, handling over 13 million passengers in 2017. It is also the UK's 6th busiest airport. The airline [[Loganair]] has its headquarters at Glasgow Airport and markets itself as \"Scotland's Airline\".\n[[Network Rail]] owns and operates the fixed infrastructure assets of the railway system in Scotland, while the Scottish Government retains overall responsibility for rail strategy and funding in Scotland. Scotland's rail network has 359 railway stations and around of track. In 2022\u201323 there were 64 million passenger journeys on [[ScotRail]] rail services. On 1 January 2006, [[Transport Scotland]] was established, which would oversee the regulation of railways in Scotland and administer major rail projects.\nSince April 2022, Transport Scotland has taken ScotRail back into public ownership via its [[operator of last resort]], [[Scottish Rail Holdings]]. It did the same with the Caledonian Sleeper service in June 2023.\n[[File:Forth bridge evening long exposure.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Forth Bridge]], a well-known structure in Scottish rail and a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]\nThe [[Glasgow Subway]] is the only [[Rapid transit|underground system]] in Scotland. It opened on 14 December 1896, making it the third-oldest underground network in the world after the [[Budapest Metro]] and the [[London Underground]]. It is owned and operated by [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]].\nThe Scottish motorways and major [[trunk roads]] are managed by Transport Scotland. The remainder of the road network is managed by the [[Scottish local authorities]] in each of their areas.\nRegular ferry services operate between the Scottish mainland and outlying islands. Ferries serving both the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]] are principally operated by the [[state-owned enterprise]] [[Caledonian MacBrayne]]. Services to the [[Northern Isles]] are operated by [[Serco]]. Other routes, such as southwest Scotland to Northern Ireland, are served by multiple companies. [[DFDS Seaways]] operated a freight-only [[Rosyth \u2013 Zeebrugge ferry service]], until a fire damaged the vessel DFDS were using. A passenger service was also operated between 2002 and 2010.\nScience, technology and energy.\nScotland's primary sources of energy are provided through renewable energy (61.8%), nuclear (25.7%) and fossil fuel generation (10.9%). [[Whitelee Wind Farm]] is the largest onshore [[wind farm]] in the United Kingdom, and was Europe's largest onshore wind farm for some time. [[Tidal power]] is an emerging source of energy in Scotland. The [[MeyGen]] tidal stream energy plant in the north of the country is claimed to be the largest tidal stream energy project in the world. In Scotland, 98.6% of all electricity used was from renewable sources. This is minus net exports. Between October 2021 and September 2022 63.1% of all electricity generated in Scotland was from renewable sources, 83.6% was classed as low carbon and 14.5% was from fossil fuels. The Scottish Government has a target to have the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland's heat, transport and electricity consumption to be supplied from renewable sources by 2030. They have stated that, in 2022, the equivalent of 113% of the country's overall electrical consumption was produced by renewable energy, making it the highest recorded figure of renewable energy generated to date.\n[[List of Scottish inventions and discoveries|Scotland's inventions and discoveries]] are said to have revolutionised human technology and have played a major role in the creation of the modern world. Such inventions \u2013 the [[television]], the [[telephone]], [[refrigerators]], the [[MRI scanner]], [[flushing toilet]]s and the [[steam engine]] \u2013 are said to have been possible by Scotland's universities and parish schools, together with the commitment Scots had to education during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. [[Alexander Fleming]] is responsible for the discovery of the world's first broadly effective [[antibiotic]] substance, which he named [[penicillin]], earning him a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1945. Modern Scottish inventions \u2013 the [[Falkirk Wheel]] and the [[Glasgow Tower]] \u2013 hold world records for being the only rotating [[boat lift]] and the tallest fully rotating freestanding structure in the world respectively.\nScotland's [[Space industry of Scotland|space industry]] is a world leader in sustainable space technology, and, according to the [[UK Space Agency]], there are 173 space companies currently operating in Scotland as of May 2021. These include spacecraft manufacturers, launch providers, downstream data analyzers, and research organisations. The space industry in Scotland is projected to generate \u00a32billion in income for Scotland's space cluster by 2030. Scottish space industry jobs represent almost one in five of all UK space industry employment. In addition to its space industry, Scotland is home to two planned [[spaceports]] \u2013 [[Sutherland spaceport]] and [[SaxaVord Spaceport]] \u2013 with launch vehicles such as the [[Orbex#Prime|Orbex Prime]] from Scottish\u2013based [[aerospace company]] [[Orbex]] expected to be launched from Sutherland.\nCulture and society.\nWorld Heritage Sites.\nScotland has seven [[List of World Heritage Sites in Scotland|World Heritage Sites]] \u2013 [[St Kilda, Scotland|St. Kilda]], [[Edinburgh Old Town]] and [[Edinburgh New Town|New Town]], The [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]], [[New Lanark]], The [[Antonine Wall]], The [[Forth Bridge]] and The [[Flow Country]]. [[Zenith of Iron Age Shetland]] is currently a candidate for World Heritage Site status from [[UNESCO]]. [[Historic Environment Scotland]] is responsible for 'cultural' sites as part of their wider responsibility towards the historic environment. The [[Environment Directorate]] is responsible for natural sites.\nScottish music.\n[[File:Edinburgh Scottish bagpiper (49552292312).jpg|thumb|right|The [[bagpipes]] are an instrument largely associated with Scotland, and an early example of popular Scottish music]]\n[[Scottish music]] is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], a woodwind reed instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. The popularity of [[pipe band]]s\u2014primarily featuring bagpipes, various types of snares and drums, and showcasing Scottish traditional dress and music\u2014has spread throughout the world. Bagpipes are featured in holiday celebrations, parades, funerals, weddings, and other events internationally. Many military regiments have a pipe band of their own. In addition to the Great Highland pipes, several smaller, somewhat quieter [[bellows]]-blown varieties of bagpipe are played in Scotland, including the [[Scottish smallpipes|smallpipes]] and the [[Border pipes]].\n[[Music of Scotland#Pop, rock and fusion|Scottish popular music]] has gained an international following, with artists such as [[Lewis Capaldi]], [[Amy Macdonald]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Nina Nesbitt]], [[Chvrches]], [[Gerry Cinnamon]] and [[Paolo Nutini]] gaining international success. DJ [[Calvin Harris]] was one of the [[List of most-streamed artists on Spotify|most streamed artists on Spotify]] in 2023, whilst [[Susan Boyle]]'s [[I Dreamed a Dream (album)|debut album]] was [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century]], and was the best-selling album internationally in 2009. [[Runrig]] popularised [[Celtic rock]] and frequently performed in [[Scottish Gaelic]], with their 1995 single \"[[An Ubhal as \u00c0irde (The Highest Apple)|An Ubhal as \u00c0irde]]\" the first song in the language to reach the UK Top 20. Musical talent in Scotland is recognised via the [[Scottish Music Awards]], [[Scottish Album of the Year Award]], the [[Scots Trad Music Awards]] and the [[BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician]] award.\nLiterature and media.\n[[File:PG 1063Burns Naysmithcrop.jpg|thumb|right|190px|World renowned poet [[Robert Burns]] is considered the national poet, best known for works such as \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" and writing in the Scots language]]\nScotland has a literary heritage dating back to the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh literature]]. Later medieval literature included works in Latin, Gaelic, Old English and French. The first surviving major text in [[Early Scots]] is the 14th-century poet [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]]'s epic \"[[The Brus|Brus]]\", focusing on the life of Robert I, and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works. In the 16th century, the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry, but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as a literary language. Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including [[James Macpherson]], whose [[Ossian|Ossian Cycle]] made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment. It was also a major influence on [[Robert Burns]], whom many consider the national poet, and [[Walter Scott]], whose [[Waverley Novels]] did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century. Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[George MacDonald]].\nIn the 20th century the [[Scottish Renaissance]] saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature. Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], who would be appointed the first Makar by the Scottish Government in 2004. [[Sorley MacLean]] was described by the [[Scottish Poetry Library]] as \"one of the major Scottish poets of the modern era\" because of his \"mastery of his chosen medium and his engagement with the European poetic tradition and European politics\". Nobel Prize Laureate [[Seamus Heaney]] credited MacLean with saving [[Scottish Gaelic literature|Scottish Gaelic poetry]]. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including [[Irvine Welsh]]. Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included [[Carol Ann Duffy]], who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named the monarch's [[Poet Laureate]]. Scotland's national poet is known as the [[Makar]] and is appointed by the first minister to promote literacy, writing and poetry across the country, as well as to produce work for national events and produce annual reports to the government. The incumbent Makar is [[P\u00e0draig MacAoidh]], the first Scottish Gaelic writer to hold the position.\nNational newspapers such as the [[Daily Record (Scotland)|\"Daily Record\"]], [[The Herald (Glasgow)|\"The Herald\"]], \"[[The Scotsman]]\" and \"[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]\" are all produced in Scotland. Important regional dailies include the [[Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News]] in Edinburgh, \"[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]\" in Dundee in the east, and \"[[The Press and Journal]]\" serving Aberdeen and the north. Scotland is represented at the [[Celtic Media Festival]], which showcases film and television from the Celtic countries. Scottish entrants have won many awards since the festival began in 1980. Scotland's national broadcaster is [[BBC Scotland]], a division of the [[BBC]], which runs three national [[Scottish television stations|television stations]], [[BBC One Scotland]], [[BBC Scotland (TV channel)|BBC Scotland]] and the Gaelic-language [[BBC Alba]], and the national radio stations, \"[[BBC Radio Scotland]]\" and \"[[BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal]]\". The main Scottish commercial television station is [[STV (TV network)|STV]] which broadcasts on two of the three [[ITV (network)|ITV]] regions of Scotland. Scotland's [[Cinema of Scotland|film industry]] is supported by [[Creative Scotland|Screen Scotland]], the [[Non-departmental public body|executive non-departmental public body]] of the Scottish Government which provides funding and support for film production in the country.\nCeltic connections.\nAs one of the [[Celtic nations]], Scotland and Scottish culture are represented at inter-Celtic events at home and over the world. Scotland hosts several music festivals including [[Celtic Connections]] (Glasgow), and the [[Hebridean Celtic Festival]] (Stornoway). Festivals celebrating Celtic culture, such as [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient]] ([[Brittany]]), the [[Pan Celtic Festival]] (Ireland), and the National Celtic Festival ([[Portarlington, Victoria|Portarlington]], Australia), feature elements of Scottish culture such as language, music and dance.\nNational identity.\nThe image of [[Saint Andrew|St. Andrew]], martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] during the reign of [[William the Lion|William I]]. Following the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the [[Guardians of Scotland]] who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent [[interregnum]]. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the [[saltire]], has its origins in the late 14th century; the [[Parliament of Scotland]] decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the [[Union Flag]]. \nThere are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the [[thistle]], the nation's [[national emblem|floral emblem]] (celebrated in the song, [[The Thistle o' Scotland]]), the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern [[tartan]] that often signifies a particular [[Scottish clan]] and the royal [[Royal Standard of Scotland|Lion Rampant]] flag. Highlanders can thank [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose]], for the repeal in 1782 of the [[Dress Act 1746]], which prohibiting the wearing of tartans.\nScotland has its own [[regalia]] known as the [[Honours of Scotland]] (informally the [[Scottish Crown Jewels]]) which consists of the [[Crown of Scotland]], a Sceptre and [[Scottish Sword of State]]. The Scottish crown was worn by [[Scottish monarchs]] during their coronation, and today is kept in the Crown Room at [[Edinburgh Castle]]. The Crown of Scotland is present at each state opening of the Scottish Parliament. Collectively, the Honours of Scotland are the oldest regalia in the [[British Isles]], dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n[[File:The Queen at the Scottish Parliament - crop.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The [[Crown of Scotland]]]] \nAlthough there is no official [[national anthem of Scotland]], \"[[Flower of Scotland]]\" is played on special occasions and sporting events such as football and rugby matches involving the Scotland national teams and since 2010 is also played at the Commonwealth Games after it was voted the overwhelming favourite by participating Scottish athletes. Other currently less popular candidates for the National Anthem of Scotland include \"[[Scotland the Brave]]\", \"[[Highland Cathedral]]\", \"[[Scots Wha Hae]]\" and \"[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]\".\n[[St Andrew's Day]], 30 November, is the [[national day]], although [[Burns' Night]] tends to be more widely observed, particularly outside Scotland. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the [[St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007]], designating the day an official [[bank holiday]]. [[Tartan Day]] is a recent innovation from Canada.\nThe national animal of Scotland is the [[unicorn]], which has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century. The [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] regulates [[Scottish heraldry]] and the Public Register of All Armorial Bearings in Scotland.\nCuisine.\n[[File:Haggis neeps and tatties.jpg|thumb|[[Haggis]], [[Rutabaga|neeps]] and [[Potato|tatties]]]]\nScottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine]] as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of [[Game (food)|game]], dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of [[spice]]s from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive.\n[[Irn-Bru]] is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as \"Scotland's other national drink\" (after whisky). During the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[early modern era]], [[French cuisine]] played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the \"[[Auld Alliance]]\", especially during the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.\nSports.\n[[File:Brazil v Scotland 25 (5575226993).jpg|thumb|right|Scotland's [[Scotland national football team|national football team]]'s fans are commonly known as \"The Tartan Army\"]]\nScotland hosts its own national sporting competitions and has independent representation at several international sporting events, including the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[UEFA Nations League]], the [[UEFA European Championship]], the [[Rugby World Cup]], the [[Rugby League World Cup]], the [[Cricket World Cup]], the [[Netball World Cup]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. Scotland has its own national governing bodies, such as the [[Scottish Football Association]] (the second oldest national football association in the world) and the [[Scottish Rugby Union]]. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries, with the earliest reference dating back to 1424.\nThe world's first official international association football match, between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] was held in Glasgow on 30 November 1872, and resulted in a 0\u20130 draw. The [[Scottish Cup]] was first contested in 1873, and is the oldest trophy in association football. The [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) is the main [[sport governing body|governing body]] for Scottish association football, and a founding member of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) which governs the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. Scotland is one of only four countries to have a permanent representative on the IFAB; the other four representatives being appointed for set periods by [[FIFA]]. The SFA has responsibility for the [[Scotland national football team]] and the [[Scotland women's national football team|Scotland women's team]].\n[[File:Old 18th tee lr.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Course at St Andrews]], the oldest [[golf]] course in the world]]\nWith the modern game of [[golf]] originating in 15th-century Scotland, the country is promoted as the [[Golf in Scotland|home of golf]]. To many golfers the [[Old Course at St Andrews|Old Course]] in the Fife town of [[St Andrews]], an ancient [[links (golf)|links]] course dating to before 1552, is considered a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is [[The Open Championship]], which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with [[Men's major golf championships#Major championship winners|Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors]]. There are many other famous [[Golf in Scotland|golf courses in Scotland]], including [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]], [[Gleneagles (Scotland)|Gleneagles]], [[Muirfield]], and [[Royal Troon]].\nThe Scottish Rugby Union is the second oldest rugby union in the world. [[Murrayfield Stadium]] in Edinburgh is the national stadium of the [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scottish national rugby team]]. The Scotland rugby team played [[1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match|their first official]] [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]], winning 1\u20130 against England at [[Raeburn Place]] in 1871. Scotland has competed in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last Five Nations in [[1999 Five Nations Championship|1999]]\u2014and sharing it another 8 times. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all nine competitions, the most recent being in the [[2023 Rugby World Cup]]. Scotland competes with the England rugby team annually for the [[Calcutta Cup]]. Each year, this fixture is played out as part of the Six Nations, with Scotland having last won in 2024.\n[[File:Murrayfield Autumn 2017.jpg|thumb|right|[[Murrayfield Stadium]], the national stadium of the [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scottish national rugby team]]]]\nOther distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the [[Highland games]], [[curling]] and [[shinty]].

{"id": "26995", "revid": "35126782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26995", "title": "Shire", "text": "Traditional British term for county\nShire () is a traditional term for an administrative division of land in Great Britain and some other English-speaking countries. It is generally synonymous with county (such as Cheshire and Worcestershire). British counties are among the oldest extant national divisions in the world.\nIt was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the 10th century. Today, 23 counties bear the \"-shire\" suffix in England, 23 in Scotland, and 10 in Wales. \nIn some rural parts of Australia, a shire is a local government area; however, in Australia, it is not synonymous with a \"county\", which is a lands administrative division.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"shire\" derives from the Old English , from the Proto-Germanic (), denoting an 'official charge' a 'district under a governor', and a 'care'. In the UK, \"shire\" became synonymous with \"county\", an administrative term introduced to England through the Norman Conquest in the later part of the eleventh century. In contemporary British usage, the word \"counties\" also refers to shires, mainly in places such as Shire Hall.\nIn regions with rhotic pronunciation, such as Scotland, the word \"shire\" is pronounced ; in areas of non-rhotic pronunciation, the final \"R\" is silent, unless the next word begins in a vowel sound. In England and Wales, when \"shire\" is a place-name suffix, the vowel is unstressed and usually shortened (monophthongized); the pronunciations include and , with the final \"R\" pronunciation depending on rhoticity. The vowel is normally reduced to a single schwa, as in \"Leicestershire\" or and \"Berkshire\" or .\nOrigins.\nThe system was first used in the kingdom of Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the 10th century, along with the West Saxon kingdom's political domination. In Domesday (1086) the city of York was divided into shires. The first shires of Scotland were created in English-settled areas such as Lothian and the Borders, in the 9th century. King David I more consistently created shires and appointed sheriffs across lowland \"shores\" of Scotland.\nThe shire in early days was governed by an \"ealdorman\" and in the later Anglo-Saxon period by a royal official known as a \"shire reeve\" or sheriff. The shires were divided into hundreds or wapentakes, although other less common sub-divisions existed. An alternative name for a shire was a \"sheriffdom\" until sheriff court reforms separated the two concepts. The phrase \"shire county\" applies, unofficially, to non-metropolitan counties in England, specifically those that are not local unitary authority areas. In Scotland the word \"county\" was not adopted for the shires. Although \"county\" appears in some texts, \"shire\" was the normal name until counties for statutory purposes were created in the 19th century. In Ireland \"shire\" was not used for the counties.\nIn most cases, the \"shire town\" is the seat of the shire's government, or was historically. Sometimes the nomenclature exists even where \"county\" is used in place of \"shire\" as in, for instance, Kentville in Nova Scotia.\nShires in the United Kingdom.\n\"Shire\" also refers, in a narrower sense, to ancient counties with names that ended in \"shire\". These counties are typically (though not always) named after their county town. The suffix \"-shire\" is attached to most of the names of English, Scottish and Welsh counties. It tends not to be found in the names of shires that were pre-existing divisions. Essex, Kent, and Sussex, for example, have never borne a \"-shire\", as each represents a former Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Similarly Cornwall was a British kingdom before it became an English county. The term \"shire\" is not used in the names of the six traditional counties of Northern Ireland.\nShire names in England.\nCounties in England bearing the \"-shire\" suffix are:\nThese counties, on their historical boundaries, cover a little more than half the area of England. The counties that do not use \"-shire\" are mainly in three areas, in the south-east, south-west and far north of England. Several of these counties no longer exist as administrative units, or have had their administrative boundaries reduced by local government reforms. Several of the successor authorities retain the \"-shire\" county names, such as North Yorkshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire.\nThe county of Devon was historically known as Devonshire, although this is no longer the official name. Indeed, it was retained by the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment until amalgamation in 2007. Similarly, Dorset, Rutland and Somerset were formerly known as Dorsetshire, Rutlandshire and Somersetshire, but these terms are no longer official, and are rarely used outside the local populations.\nHexhamshire was a county in the north-east of England from the early 12th century until 1572, when it was incorporated into Northumberland.\nShire names in Scotland.\nScotland was barely affected by the Norman conquest of England, and the word \"shire\" prevailed over \"county\" until the 19th century. Earliest sources have the same usage of the \"-shire\" suffix as in England (although in Scots this was most often ). Later, \"Shire\" appears as a separate word.\n\"Shire\" names in Scotland are:\nIn Scotland four shires have alternative names with the \"-shire\" suffix: Angus (Forfarshire), East Lothian (Haddingtonshire), Midlothian (Edinburghshire) and West Lothian (Linlithgowshire).\nSutherland is occasionally still referred to as Sutherlandshire. Similarly, Argyllshire, Buteshire, Caithness-shire and Fifeshire are sometimes found. Also, Morayshire was previously called Elginshire. There is debate about whether Argyllshire was ever really used.\nShire names in Wales.\nShires in Wales bearing the \"-shire\" suffix ( preceding the name in Welsh) are:\nThe counties of Merioneth and Glamorgan are occasionally referred to with the \"shire\" suffix. The only traditional Welsh county that never takes \"shire\" in English is Anglesey; in Welsh it is called .\nNon-county \"shires\".\nEngland.\nHistorically, the suffix \"-shire\" could be a generalised term referring to a district. It did not acquire the strong association with county until later. Other than these, the term was used for several other districts. Bedlingtonshire, Craikshire, Norhamshire and Islandshire were exclaves of County Durham, and were incorporated into Northumberland or Yorkshire in 1844. The suffix was also used for many hundreds, wapentakes and liberties such as:\nAlso carrying the \"shire\" suffix were counties corporate such as Hullshire, and other districts such as Applebyshire, Bamburghshire, Carlisleshire, Coldinghamshire, Cravenshire, Hallamshire, Mashamshire and Yetholmshire.\nRichmondshire was, from 1974 to 2023, the name of a local government district of North Yorkshire.\nScotland.\nNon-county shires were very common in Scotland. Kinross-shire and Clackmannanshire are arguably survivals from such districts. Non-county \"shires\" in Scotland include Coldinghamshire and Yetholmshire.\n\"The Shires\".\nColloquially, the term \"the Shires\" has become used to refer to those counties, particularly of the southern Midlands, which are still largely rural and which are stereotypically thought of as places where a more bucolic lifestyle is possible.\nShires in the United States.\nNew York and New England.\nBefore the Province of New York was granted county subdivisions and a greater royal presence in 1683, the early ducal colony consisted of York Shire, as well as Albany and Ulster, after the three titles held by Prince James: Duke of York, Duke of Albany, Earl of Ulster.\nThe word also survives in the name of the state of New Hampshire, whose co-founder, John Mason, named his Province of New Hampshire after the English county of Hampshire.\nVermont has 14 counties, whose county seats are called shire towns. Bennington County is unique in having two shire towns, Bennington (\"The Southshire\") and Manchester (\"The Northshire\")\nVirginia.\nIn 1634, eight \"shires\" were created in the Virginia Colony by order of Charles I, King of England. They were renamed as counties only a few years later. They were:\nToday, the concept of a \"Shire\" still exists in Virginia code. It is defined as a semi-autonomous subdivision of a consolidated City-County. Currently no Shires exist in the commonwealth and the administrative provision is largely unknown.\nShires in Australia.\n\"Shire\" is the most common word in Australia for rural local government areas (LGAs). New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia, use the term \"shire\" for this unit; the territories of the Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are also shires. In contrast, South Australia uses district and region for its rural LGA units, while Tasmania uses municipality. Shires are generally functionally indistinguishable from towns, boroughs, municipalities, or cities.\nThree LGAs in outer metropolitan Sydney and four in outer metropolitan Melbourne have populations exceeding that of towns or municipalities, but retain significant bushlands and/or semi-rural areas, and most have continued to use \"shire\" in their titles whilst others have dropped it from theirs. These \"city-shires\" are:\nMelbourne:\nSydney:\nIn fiction.\nThe Shire, homeland of the hobbits in J. R. R. Tolkien's works, where both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" begin and end, got its name from the English administrative land division.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Instead, philosophers engaged in the philosophical study of nature called natural philosophy. Though Thales (c.\u2009624\u2013545 BC) was arguably the first scientist for describing how cosmic events may be seen as natural, not necessarily caused by gods, it was not until the 19th century that the term \"scientist\" came into regular use: it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833 to describe Mary Somerville.\nHistory.\nThe roles of \"scientists\", and their predecessors before the emergence of modern scientific disciplines, have evolved considerably over time. Scientists of different eras (and before them, natural philosophers, mathematicians, natural historians, natural theologians, engineers, and others who contributed to the development of science) have had widely different places in society, and the social norms, ethical values, and epistemic virtues associated with scientists\u2014and expected of them\u2014have changed over time as well. Accordingly, many different historical figures can be identified as early scientists, depending on which characteristics of modern science are taken to be essential.\nSome historians point to the Scientific Revolution that began in 16th century as the period when science in a recognizably modern form developed. It was not until the 19th century that sufficient socioeconomic changes had occurred for scientists to emerge as a major profession.\nClassical antiquity.\nKnowledge about nature in classical antiquity was pursued by many kinds of scholars. Greek contributions to science\u2014including works of geometry and mathematical astronomy, early accounts of biological processes and catalogs of plants and animals, and theories of knowledge and learning\u2014were produced by philosophers and physicians, as well as practitioners of various trades. These roles, and their associations with scientific knowledge, spread with the Roman Empire and, with the spread of Christianity, became closely linked to religious institutions in most European countries. Astrology and astronomy became an important area of knowledge, and the role of astronomer/astrologer developed with the support of political and religious patronage. By the time of the medieval university system, knowledge was divided into the \"trivium\"\u2014philosophy, including natural philosophy\u2014and the \"quadrivium\"\u2014mathematics, including astronomy. Hence, the medieval analogs of scientists were often either philosophers or mathematicians. Knowledge of plants and animals was broadly the province of physicians.\nMiddle Ages.\nScience in medieval Islam generated some new modes of developing natural knowledge, although still within the bounds of existing social roles such as philosopher and mathematician. Many proto-scientists from the Islamic Golden Age are considered polymaths, in part because of the lack of anything corresponding to modern scientific disciplines. Many of these early polymaths were also religious priests and theologians: for example, Alhazen and al-Biruni were mutakallimiin; the physician Avicenna was a hafiz; the physician Ibn al-Nafis was a hafiz, muhaddith and ulema; the botanist Otto Brunfels was a theologian and historian of Protestantism; the astronomer and physician Nicolaus Copernicus was a priest. During the Italian Renaissance scientists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Galileo Galilei and Gerolamo Cardano have been considered the most recognizable polymaths.\nRenaissance.\nDuring the Renaissance, Italians made substantial contributions in science. Leonardo da Vinci made significant discoveries in paleontology and anatomy. The Father of modern Science,\nGalileo Galilei, made key improvements on the thermometer and telescope which allowed him to observe and clearly describe the Solar System. Descartes was not only a pioneer of analytic geometry but formulated a theory of mechanics and advanced ideas about the origins of animal movement and perception. Vision interested the physicists Young and Helmholtz, who also studied optics, hearing and music. Newton extended Descartes's mathematics by inventing calculus (at the same time as Leibniz). He provided a comprehensive formulation of classical mechanics and investigated light and optics. Fourier founded a new branch of mathematics \u2014 infinite, periodic series \u2014 studied heat flow and infrared radiation, and discovered the greenhouse effect. Girolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal Pierre de Fermat, Von Neumann, Turing, Khinchin, Markov and Wiener, all mathematicians, made major contributions to science and probability theory, including the ideas behind computers, and some of the foundations of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Many mathematically inclined scientists, including Galileo, were also musicians.\nThere are many compelling stories in medicine and biology, such as the development of ideas about the circulation of blood from Galen to Harvey. Some scholars and historians attributes Christianity to having contributed to the rise of the Scientific Revolution.\nAge of Enlightenment.\nDuring the age of Enlightenment, Luigi Galvani, the pioneer of bioelectromagnetics, discovered animal electricity. He discovered that a charge applied to the spinal cord of a frog could generate muscular spasms throughout its body. Charges could make frog legs jump even if the legs were no longer attached to a frog. While cutting a frog leg, Galvani's steel scalpel touched a brass hook that was holding the leg in place. The leg twitched. Further experiments confirmed this effect, and Galvani was convinced that he was seeing the effects of what he called animal electricity, the life force within the muscles of the frog. At the University of Pavia, Galvani's colleague Alessandro Volta was able to reproduce the results, but was sceptical of Galvani's explanation.\nLazzaro Spallanzani is one of the most influential figures in experimental physiology and the natural sciences. His investigations have exerted a lasting influence on the medical sciences. He made important contributions to the experimental study of bodily functions and animal reproduction.\nFrancesco Redi discovered that microorganisms can cause disease.\n19th century.\nUntil the late 19th or early 20th century, scientists were still referred to as \"natural philosophers\" or \"men of science\".\nEnglish philosopher and historian of science William Whewell coined the term \"scientist\" in 1833, and it first appeared in print in Whewell's anonymous 1834 review of Mary Somerville's \"On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences\" published in the \"Quarterly Review\". Whewell wrote of \"an increasing proclivity of separation and dismemberment\" in the sciences; while highly specific terms proliferated\u2014chemist, mathematician, naturalist\u2014the broad term \"philosopher\" was no longer satisfactory to group together those who pursued science, without the caveats of \"natural\" or \"experimental\" philosopher. Whewell compared these increasing divisions with Somerville's aim of \"[rendering] a most important service to science\" \"by showing how detached branches have, in the history of science, united by the discovery of general principles.\" Whewell reported in his review that members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science had been complaining at recent meetings about the lack of a good term for \"students of the knowledge of the material world collectively.\" Alluding to himself, he noted that \"some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with \"artist\", they might form [the word] \"scientist\", and added that there could be no scruple in making free with this term since we already have such words as \"economist\", and \"atheist\"\u2014but this was not generally palatable\".\nWhewell proposed the word again more seriously (and not anonymously) in his 1840 \"The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The terminations \"ize\" (rather than \"ise\"), \"ism\", and \"ist\", are applied to words of all origins: thus we have to \"pulverize\", to \"colonize\", \"Witticism\", \"Heathenism\", \"Journalist\", \"Tobacconist\". Hence we may make such words when they are wanted. As we cannot use \"physician\" for a cultivator of physics, I have called him a \"Physicist\". We need very much a name to describe a cultivator of science in general. I should incline to call him a \"Scientist\". Thus we might say, that as an Artist is a Musician, Painter, or Poet, a Scientist is a Mathematician, Physicist, or Naturalist.\nHe also proposed the term \"physicist\" at the same time, as a counterpart to the French word \"physicien\". Neither term gained wide acceptance until decades later; \"scientist\" became a common term in the late 19th century in the United States and around the turn of the 20th century in Great Britain. By the twentieth century, the modern notion of science as a special brand of information about the world, practiced by a distinct group and pursued through a unique method, was essentially in place.\n20th century.\nMarie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first person to win it twice. Her efforts led to the development of nuclear energy and Radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In 1922, she was appointed a member of the International Commission on Intellectual Co-operation by the Council of the League of Nations. She campaigned for scientist's right to patent their discoveries and inventions. She also campaigned for free access to international scientific literature and for internationally recognized scientific symbols.\nProfession.\nAs a profession, the scientist of today is widely recognized. However, there is no formal process to determine who is a scientist and who is not a scientist. Anyone can be a scientist in some sense. Some professions have legal requirements for their practice (e.g. licensure) and some scientists are independent scientists meaning that they practice science on their own, but to practice science there are no known licensure requirements.\nEducation.\nIn modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting (e.g., universities and research institutes), mostly at the level of graduate schools. Upon completion, they would normally attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Although graduate education for scientists varies among institutions and countries, some common training requirements include specializing in an area of interest, publishing research findings in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presenting them at scientific conferences, giving lectures or teaching, and defending a thesis (or dissertation) during an oral examination. To aid them in this endeavor, graduate students often work under the guidance of a mentor, usually a senior scientist, which may continue after the completion of their doctorates whereby they work as postdoctoral researchers.\nCareer.\nAfter the completion of their training, many scientists pursue careers in a variety of work settings and conditions. In 2017, the British scientific journal \"Nature\" published the results of a large-scale survey of more than 5,700 doctoral students worldwide, asking them which sectors of the economy they would like to work in. A little over half of the respondents wanted to pursue a career in academia, with smaller proportions hoping to work in industry, government, and nonprofit environments.\nOther motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award, is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, and chemistry.\nSome scientists have a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, the nations, the world, nature, or industries (academic scientist and industrial scientist). Scientists tend to be less motivated by direct financial reward for their work than other careers. As a result, scientific researchers often accept lower average salaries when compared with many other professions which require a similar amount of training and qualification.\nResearch interests.\nScientists include experimentalists who mainly perform experiments to test hypotheses, and theoreticians who mainly develop models to explain existing data and predict new results. There is a continuum between the two activities and the division between them is not clear-cut, with many scientists performing both tasks.\nThose considering science as a career often look to the frontiers. These include cosmology and biology, especially molecular biology and the human genome project. Other areas of active research include the exploration of matter at the scale of elementary particles as described by high-energy physics, and materials science, which seeks to discover and design new materials. Others choose to study brain function and neurotransmitters, which is considered by many to be the \"final frontier\". There are many important discoveries to make regarding the nature of the mind and human thought, much of which still remains unknown.\nDemography.\nBy country.\nThe number of scientists is vastly different from country to country. For instance, there are only four full-time scientists per 10,000 workers in India, while this number is 79 for the United Kingdom, and 85 for the United States.\nUnited States.\nAccording to the National Science Foundation, 4.7\u00a0million people with science degrees worked in the United States in 2015, across all disciplines and employment sectors. The figure included twice as many men as women. Of that total, 17% worked in academia, that is, at universities and undergraduate institutions, and men held 53% of those positions. 5% of scientists worked for the federal government, and about 3.5% were self-employed. Of the latter two groups, two-thirds were men. 59% of scientists in the United States were employed in industry or business, and another 6% worked in non-profit positions.\nBy gender.\nScientist and engineering statistics are usually intertwined, but they indicate that women enter the field far less than men, though this gap is narrowing. The number of science and engineering doctorates awarded to women rose from a mere 7 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 1985 and in engineering alone the numbers of bachelor's degrees awarded to women rose from only 385 in 1975 to more than 11000 in 1985. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"smog\" was coined in the early 20th century, and is a portmanteau of the words \"smoke\" and \"fog\" to refer to smoky fog due to its opacity, and odour. The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid-20th century, where it was commonly known as a London particular or London fog. This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxide, ozone, smoke and other particulates. Man-made smog is derived from coal combustion emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions.\nSmog is often categorized as being either summer smog or winter smog. Summer smog is primarily associated with the photochemical formation of ozone. During the summer season when the temperatures are warmer and there is more sunlight present, photochemical smog is the dominant type of smog formation. During the winter months when the temperatures are colder, and atmospheric inversions are common, there is an increase in coal and other fossil fuel usage to heat homes and buildings. These combustion emissions, together with the lack of pollutant dispersion under inversions, characterize winter smog formation. Smog formation in general relies on both primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are emitted directly from a source, such as emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal combustion. Secondary pollutants, such as ozone, are formed when primary pollutants undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\nPhotochemical smog, as found for example in Los Angeles, is a type of air pollution derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes. These pollutants react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. In certain other cities, such as Delhi, smog severity is often aggravated by stubble burning in neighboring agricultural areas since the 1980s. The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Lahore, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are often increased by an inversion that traps pollution close to the ground. The developing smog is toxic to humans and can cause severe sickness, a shortened life span, or immature death.\nEtymology.\nCoinage of the term \"smog\" has been attributed to Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper, \"Fog and Smoke\" for a meeting of the Public Health Congress. The 26 July 1905 edition of the London newspaper \"Daily Graphic\" quoted Des Voeux, \"He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as 'smog'.\" The following day the newspaper stated that \"Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog.\"\nHowever, the term appeared twenty-five years earlier than Voeux's paper, in the Santa Cruz &amp; Monterey Illustrated Handbook published in 1880 and also appears in print in a column quoting from the book in the 3 July 1880, Santa Cruz Weekly Sentinel. On 17 December 1881, in the publication \"Sporting Times,\" the author claims to have invented the word: \"The 'Smog'\u00a0\u2013 a word I have invented, combined of smoke and fog, to designate the London atmosphere...\"\nAnthropogenic causes.\nCoal.\nCoal fire can emit significant clouds of smoke that contribute to the formation of winter smog. Coal fires can be used to heat individual buildings or to provide energy in a power-producing plant. Air pollution from this source has been reported in England since the Middle Ages. London, in particular, was notorious up through the mid-20th century for its coal-caused smogs, which were nicknamed \"pea-soupers\". Air pollution of this type is still a problem in areas that generate significant smoke from burning coal. The emissions from coal combustion are one of the main causes of air pollution in China. Especially during autumn and winter when coal-fired heating ramps up, the amount of produced smoke at times forces some Chinese cities to close down roads, schools or airports. One prominent example for this was China's Northeastern city of Harbin in 2013.\nTransportation emissions.\nTraffic emissions \u2013 such as from trucks, buses, and automobiles \u2013 also contribute to the formation of smog. Airborne by-products from vehicle exhaust systems and air conditioning cause air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities.\nThe major culprits from transportation sources are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and volatile organic compounds including hydrocarbons (hydrocarbons are the main component of petroleum fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel). Transportation emissions also include sulfur dioxides and particulate matter but in much smaller quantities than the pollutants mentioned previously. The nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds can undergo a series of chemical reactions with sunlight, heat, ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form the noxious vapors, ground level ozone, and particles that comprise smog.\nPhotochemical smog.\nPhotochemical smog, often referred to as \"summer smog\", is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles and ground-level ozone. Photochemical smog depends on primary pollutants as well as the formation of secondary pollutants. These primary pollutants include nitrogen oxides, particularly nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds. The relevant secondary pollutants include peroxylacyl nitrates (PAN), tropospheric ozone, and aldehydes. An important secondary pollutant for photochemical smog is ozone, which is formed when hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) combine in the presence of sunlight; nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is formed as nitric oxide (NO) combines with oxygen (O2) in the air. In addition, when SO2 and NOx are emitted they eventually are oxidized in the troposphere to nitric acid and sulfuric acid, which, when mixed with water, form the main components of acid rain. All of these harsh chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.\nThe composition and chemical reactions involved in photochemical smog were not understood until the 1950s. In 1948, flavor chemist Arie Haagen-Smit adapted some of his equipment to collect chemicals from polluted air, and identified ozone as a component of Los Angeles smog. Haagen-Smit went on to discover that nitrogen oxides from automotive exhausts and gaseous hydrocarbons from cars and oil refineries, exposed to sunlight, were key ingredients in the formation of ozone and photochemical smog. Haagen-Smit worked with Arnold Beckman, who developed various equipment for detecting smog, ranging from an \"Apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere\" patented on 7 October 1952, to \"air quality monitoring vans\" for use by government and industry.\nFormation and reactions.\nDuring the morning rush hour, a high concentration of nitric oxide and hydrocarbons are emitted to the atmosphere, mostly via on-road traffic but also from industrial sources. Some hydrocarbons are rapidly oxidized by OH\u00b7 and form peroxy radicals, which convert nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO) further react with ozone (O3) in a series of chemical reactions:\nThis series of equations is referred to as the photostationary state (PSS). However, because of the presence of Reaction 2 and 3, NOx and ozone are not in a perfectly steady state. By replacing Reaction 6 with Reaction 2 and Reaction 3, the O3 molecule is no longer destroyed. Therefore, the concentration of ozone keeps increasing throughout the day. This mechanism can escalate the formation of ozone in smog. Other reactions such as the photooxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO), a common secondary pollutant, can also contribute to the increased concentration of ozone and NO2. Photochemical smog is more prevalent during summer days since incident solar radiation fluxes are high, which favors the formation of ozone (reactions 4 and 5). The presence of a temperature inversion layer is another important factor. That is because it prevents the vertical convective mixing of the air and thus allows the pollutants, including ozone, to accumulate near the ground level, which again favors the formation of photochemical smog.\nThere are certain reactions that can limit the formation of O3 in smog. The main limiting reaction in polluted areas is:\nThis reaction removes NO2 which limits the amount of O3 that can be produced from its photolysis (reaction 4). HNO3, nitric acid, is a sticky compound that can easily be removed onto surfaces (dry deposition) or dissolved in water and be rained out (wet deposition). Both ways are common in the atmosphere and can efficiently remove radicals and nitrogen dioxide.\nNatural causes.\nVolcanoes.\nAn erupting volcano can emit high levels of sulfur dioxide along with a large quantity of particulate matter; two key components to the creation of smog. However, the smog created as a result of a volcanic eruption is often known as vog to distinguish it as a natural occurrence. The chemical reactions that form smog following a volcanic eruption are different than the reactions that form photochemical smog. The term smog encompasses the effect when a large number of gas-phase molecules and particulate matter are emitted to the atmosphere, creating a visible haze. The event causing a large number of emissions can vary but still result in the formation of smog.\nPlants.\nPlants are a natural source of hydrocarbons that can undergo reactions in the atmosphere and produce smog. Globally both plants and soil contribute a substantial amount to the production of hydrocarbons, mainly by producing isoprene and terpenes. Hydrocarbons released by plants can often be more reactive than man-made hydrocarbons. For example when plants release isoprene, the isoprene reacts very quickly in the atmosphere with hydroxyl radicals. These reactions produce hydroperoxides which increase ozone formation.\nHealth effects.\nSmog is a serious problem in many cities and continues to harm human health. Ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs' working capacity, cause shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body's ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness. Hospital admissions and respiratory deaths often increase during periods when ozone levels are high.\nThere is a lack of knowledge on the long-term effects of air pollution exposure and the origin of asthma. An experiment was carried out using intense air pollution similar to that of the 1952 Great Smog of London. The results from this experiment concluded that there is a link between early-life pollution exposure that leads to the development of asthma, proposing the ongoing effect of the Great Smog.\nModern studies continue to find links between mortality and the presence of smog. One study, published in Nature magazine, found that smog episodes in the city of Jinan, a large city in eastern China, during 2011\u201315, were associated with a 5.87% (95% CI 0.16\u201311.58%) increase in the rate of overall mortality. This study highlights the effect of exposure to air pollution on the rate of mortality in China. A similar study in Xi'an found an association between ambient air pollution and increased mortality associated with respiratory diseases.\nLevels of unhealthy exposure.\nThe U.S. EPA has developed an air quality index to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. 8 hour average ozone concentrations of 85 to 104 ppbv are described as \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\", 105 ppbv to 124 ppbv as \"unhealthy\" and 125 ppb to 404 ppb as \"very unhealthy\". The \"very unhealthy\" range for some other pollutants are: 355 \u03bcg m\u22123 \u2013 424 \u03bcg m\u22123 for PM10; 15.5 ppm \u2013 30.4ppm for CO and 0.65 ppm \u2013 1.24 ppm for NO2.\nPremature deaths due to cancer and respiratory disease.\nIn 2016, the Ontario Medical Association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in the province each year.\nA 20-year American Cancer Society study found that cumulative exposure also increases the likelihood of premature death from respiratory disease, implying the 8-hour standard may be insufficient.\nAlzheimer risk.\nTiny magnetic particles from air pollution have for the first time been discovered to be lodged in human brains\u2013 and researchers think they could be a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease.\nResearchers at Lancaster University found abundant magnetite nanoparticles in the brain tissue from 37 individuals aged three to 92-years-old who lived in Mexico City and Manchester. This strongly magnetic mineral is toxic and has been implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) in the human brain, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease.\nRisk of certain birth defects.\nA study examining 806 women who had babies with birth defects between 1997 and 2006, and 849 women who had healthy babies, found that smog in the San Joaquin Valley area of California was linked to two types of neural tube defects: spina bifida (a condition involving, among other manifestations, certain malformations of the spinal column), and anencephaly (the underdevelopment or absence of part or all of the brain, which if not fatal usually results in profound impairment). An emerging cohort study in China linked early-life smog exposure to an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, in particular oxidative stress.\nLow birth weight.\nAccording to a study published in The Lancet, even a very small (5\u00a0\u03bcg) change in PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increase (18%) in risk of a low birth weight at delivery, and this relationship held even below the current accepted safe levels.\nOther negative effects.\nAlthough severe health effects caused by smog are the chief issue, intense air pollution caused by haze from air pollution, dust storm particles, and bush fire smoke, cause a reduction in irradiance that hurts both solar photovoltaic production as well as agricultural yield.\nAreas affected.\nSmog can form in almost any climate where industries or cities release large amounts of air pollution, such as smoke or gases. However, it is worse during periods of warmer, sunnier weather when the upper air is warm enough to inhibit vertical circulation. It is especially prevalent in geologic basins encircled by hills or mountains. It often stays for an extended period of time over densely populated cities or urban areas and can build up to dangerous levels.\nAsia.\nIndia.\nFor the past few years, cities in northern India have been covered in a thick layer of winter smog. The situation has turned quite drastic in the national capital, Delhi. This smog is caused by the collection of particulate matter (a very fine type of dust and toxic gases) in the air due to stagnant movement of air during winters. Moreover, during the post-monsoon to winter transition, air quality in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) worsens significantly due to shifts in weather patterns, such as changes in wind, temperature, and boundary layer mixing. The impact of emissions from both biomass burning and urban activities has intensified, leading to a rise in aerosols mainly particulate matters. The nearby Himalayan region is also affected, where mountainous topography trap air pollutants and increase the air quality issues specifically in northern India.\nDelhi is the most polluted city in the world and according to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year. During 2013\u201314, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Rising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women. The dense smog in Delhi during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year. According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.\nEnvironmentalists have criticized the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues. Most of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it. Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution \u2013 Delhi has the third highest quantity of trees among Indian cities and the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. In 1996, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on CNG and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its \"bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives\". The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.\nHowever, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, rise in market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership. According to CUE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFER), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi. The state government of adjoining Uttar Pradesh is considering imposing a ban on crop burning to reduce pollution in Delhi NCR and an environmental panel has appealed to India's Supreme Court to impose a 30% cess on diesel cars.\nChina.\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of Beijing's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35\u201360% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\", partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\nIran.\nIn December 2005, schools and public offices were forced to close in Tehran and 1,600 people were taken to hospital, in a severe smog blamed largely on unfiltered car exhaust.\nMongolia.\nIn the late 1990s, massive immigration to Ulaanbaatar from the countryside began. An estimated 150,000 households, mainly living in traditional Mongolian gers on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, burn wood and coal (some poor families burn even car tires and trash) to heat themselves during the harsh winter, which lasts from October to April, since these outskirts are not connected to the city's central heating system. A temporary solution to decrease smog was proposed in the form of stoves with improved efficiency, although with no visible results.\nCoal-fired ger stoves release high levels of ash and other particulate matter (PM). When inhaled, these particles can settle in the lungs and respiratory tract and cause health problems. At two to 10 times above Mongolian and international air quality standards, Ulaanbaatar's PM rates are among the worst in the world, according to a December 2009 World Bank report. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that health costs related to this air pollution account for as much as 4 percent of Mongolia's GDP.\nSoutheast Asia.\nSmog is a regular problem in Southeast Asia caused by land and forest fires in Indonesia, especially Sumatra and Kalimantan, although the term haze is preferred in describing the problem. Farmers and plantation owners are usually responsible for the fires, which they use to clear tracts of land for further plantings. Those fires mainly affect Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and occasionally Guam and Saipan. The economic losses of the fires in 1997 have been estimated at more than US$9 billion. This includes damages in agriculture production, destruction of forest lands, health, transportation, tourism, and other economic endeavours. Not included are social, environmental, and psychological problems and long-term health effects. The second-latest bout of haze to occur in Malaysia, Singapore and the Malacca Straits is in October 2006, and was caused by smoke from fires in Indonesia being blown across the Straits of Malacca by south-westerly winds. A similar haze has occurred in June 2013, with the PSI setting a new record in Singapore on 21 June at 12pm with a reading of 401, which is in the \"Hazardous\" range.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) reacted. In 2002, the Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution was signed between all ASEAN nations. ASEAN formed a Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) and established a co-ordination and support unit (CSU). RHAP, with the help of Canada, established a monitoring and warning system for forest/vegetation fires and implemented a Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). The Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) has issued a daily rating of fire danger since September 2003. Indonesia has been ineffective at enforcing legal policies on errant farmers.\nPakistan.\nSince the start of the winter season, heavy smog loaded with pollutants covered major parts of Punjab, especially the city of Lahore, causing breathing problems and disrupting normal traffic. A recent study from 2022 shows that the primary cause of pollution in Lahore is from traffic-related PM (both exhausts and non exhaust sources). Air quality in the Punjab, Pakistan deteriorates markedly during the post-monsoon to winter transition, driven by shifts in weather patterns like alterations in wind, temperature, and boundary layer mixing. In post-moonsoon, anthropogenic emissions from sources like vehicle exhaust, industrial activities, and crop burning impact air quality across Punjab, Pakistan, affecting the region by 90\u2013100%.\nDoctors advised residents to stay indoors and wear facemasks outside.\nUnited Kingdom.\nLondon.\nIn 1306, concerns over air pollution were sufficient for Edward I to (briefly) ban coal fires in London. In 1661, John Evelyn's \"Fumifugium\" suggested burning fragrant wood instead of mineral coal, which he believed would reduce coughing. The \"\" the same year describes how the smoke \"does our lungs and spirits choke, Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron.\"\nSevere episodes of smog continued in the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly in the winter, and were nicknamed \"pea-soupers,\" from the phrase \"as thick as pea soup\". The Great Smog of 1952 darkened the streets of London and killed approximately 4,000 people in the short time of four days (a further 8,000 died from its effects in the following weeks and months). Initially, a flu epidemic was blamed for the loss of life.\nIn 1956 the Clean Air Act started legally enforcing smokeless zones in the capital. There were areas where no soft coal was allowed to be burned in homes or in businesses, only coke, which produces no smoke. Because of the smokeless zones, reduced levels of sooty particulates eliminated the intense and persistent London smog.\nIt was after this that the great clean-up of London began. One by one, historical buildings which, during the previous two centuries had gradually completely blackened externally, had their stone facades cleaned and restored to their original appearance. Victorian buildings whose appearance changed dramatically after cleaning included the British Museum of Natural History. A more recent example was the Palace of Westminster, which was cleaned in the 1980s. A notable exception to the restoration trend was 10 Downing Street, whose bricks upon cleaning in the late 1950s proved to be naturally \"yellow\"; the smog-derived black color of the fa\u00e7ade was considered so iconic that the bricks were painted black to preserve the image.\nOther areas.\nOther areas of the United Kingdom were affected by smog, especially heavily industrialised areas.\nThe cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, in Scotland, suffered smoke-laden fogs in 1909. Des Voeux, commonly credited with creating the \"smog\" moniker, presented a paper in 1911 to the Manchester Conference of the Smoke Abatement League of Great Britain about the fogs and resulting deaths.\nOne Birmingham resident described near black-out conditions in the 1900s before the Clean Air Act, with visibility so poor that cyclists had to dismount and walk to stay on the road.\nOn 29 April 2015, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the government must take immediate action to cut air pollution, following a case brought by environmental lawyers at ClientEarth.\nLatin America.\nMexico.\nDue to its location in a highland \"bowl\", cold air sinks down onto the urban area of Mexico City, trapping industrial and vehicle pollution underneath, and turning it into the most infamously smog-plagued city of Latin America. Within one generation, the city has changed from being known for some of the cleanest air of the world into one with some of the worst pollution, with pollutants like nitrogen dioxide being double or even triple international standards.\nChile.\nSimilar to Mexico City, the air pollution of the Santiago valley in Chile, located between the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range, turn it into the most infamously smog-plagued city of South America. Other aggravates of the situation reside in its high latitude (31 degrees South) and dry weather during most of the year.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nAccording to the Canadian Science Smog Assessment published in 2012, smog is responsible for detrimental effects on human and ecosystem health, as well as socioeconomic well-being across the country. It was estimated that the province of Ontario sustains $201 million in damages annually for selected crops, and an estimated tourism revenue degradation of $7.5 million in Vancouver and $1.32 million in The Fraser Valley due to decreased visibility. Air pollution in British Columbia is of particular concern, especially in the Fraser Valley, because of a meteorological effect called inversion which decreases air dispersion and leads to smog concentration.\nUnited States.\nSmog was brought to the attention of the general U.S. public in 1933 with the publication of the book \"Stop That Smoke\", by Henry Obermeyer, a New York public utility official, in which he pointed out the effect on human life and even the destruction of of a farmer's spinach crop. Since then, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated over 300 U.S. counties to be non-attainment areas for one or more pollutants tracked as part of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. These areas are largely clustered around large metropolitan areas, with the largest contiguous non-attainment zones in California and the Northeast. Various U.S. and Canadian government agencies collaborate to produce real-time air quality maps and forecasts. To combat smog conditions, localities may declare \"smog alert\" days, such as in the Spare the Air program in the San Francisco Bay Area. By 1970, Congress enacted the Clean Air Act to regulate air pollutant emissions.\nIn the United States, smog pollution kills 24,000 Americans every year. The U.S. is among the dirtier countries in terms of smog, ranked 123 out of 195 countries measured, where 1 is cleanest and 195 is most smog polluted.\nLos Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley.\nBecause of their locations in low basins surrounded by mountains, Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley are notorious for their smog. Heavy automobile traffic, combined with the additional effects of the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles/Long Beach port complexes, frequently contribute to further air pollution.\nLos Angeles, in particular, is strongly predisposed to the accumulation of smog, because of the peculiarities of its geography and weather patterns. Los Angeles is situated in a flat basin with the ocean on one side and mountain ranges on three sides. A nearby cold ocean current depresses surface air temperatures in the area, resulting in an inversion layer: a phenomenon where air temperature increases, instead of decreasing, with altitude, suppressing thermals and restricting vertical convection. All taken together, this results in a relatively thin, enclosed layer of air above the city that cannot easily escape out of the basin and tends to accumulate pollution.\nLos Angeles was one of the best-known cities suffering from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that \"Los Angeles\" was a synonym for \"smog.\" In 1970, when the Clean Air Act was passed, Los Angeles was the most polluted basin in the country, and California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards. However, ensuing strict regulations by state and federal government agencies overseeing this problem (such as the California Air Resources Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency), including tight restrictions on allowed emissions levels for all new cars sold in California and mandatory regular emission tests of older vehicles, resulted in significant improvements in air quality. For example, air concentrations of volatile organic compounds declined by a factor of 50 between 1962 and 2012. Concentrations of air pollutants such as nitrous oxides and ozone declined by 70% to 80% over the same period of time.\nPollution index.\nThe severity of smog is often measured using automated optical instruments such as nephelometers, as haze is associated with visibility and traffic control in ports. Haze, however, can also be an indication of poor air quality, though this is often better reflected using accurate purpose-built air indexes such as the American Air Quality Index, the Malaysian API (Air Pollution Index), and the Singaporean Pollutant Standards Index.\nIn hazy conditions, it is likely that the index will report the suspended particulate level. The disclosure of the responsible pollutant is mandated in some jurisdictions.\nThe Malaysian API does not have a capped value. Hence, its most hazardous readings can go above 500. When the reading goes above 500, a state of emergency is declared in the affected area. Usually, this means that non-essential government services are suspended, and all ports in the affected area are closed. There may also be prohibitions on private sector commercial and industrial activities in the affected area excluding the food sector. So far, the state of emergency rulings due to hazardous API levels was applied to the Malaysian towns of Port Klang, Kuala Selangor, and the state of Sarawak during 1997 Southeast Asian haze and the 2005 Malaysian haze.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27001", "revid": "26757177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27001", "title": "Smoke", "text": "Mass of airborne particulates and gases\nSmoke is an aerosol (a suspension of airborne particulates and gases) emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative.\nSmoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.\nSmoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.\nChemical composition.\nThe composition of smoke depends on the nature of the burning fuel and the conditions of combustion. Fires with high availability of oxygen burn at a high temperature and with a small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, while nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Contents of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to the production of hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and antimony oxides and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).\nPyrolysis of burning material, especially incomplete combustion or smoldering without adequate oxygen supply, also results in production of a large amount of hydrocarbons, both aliphatic (methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene) and aromatic (benzene and its derivates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; e.g. benzo[a]pyrene, studied as a carcinogen, or retene), terpenes. It also results in the emission of a range of smaller oxygenated volatile organic compounds (methanol, acetic acid, hydroxy acetone, methyl acetate and ethyl formate) which are formed as combustion by products as well as less volatile oxygenated organic species such as phenolics, furans and furanones. Heterocyclic compounds may be also present. Heavier hydrocarbons may condense as tar; smoke with significant tar content is yellow to brown. Combustion of solid fuels can result in the emission of many hundreds to thousands of lower volatility organic compounds in the aerosol phase. Presence of such smoke, soot, and/or brown oily deposits during a fire indicates a possible hazardous situation, as the atmosphere may be saturated with combustible pyrolysis products with concentration above the upper flammability limit, and sudden inrush of air can cause flashover or backdraft.\nPresence of sulfur can lead to formation of gases like hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon disulfide, and thiols; especially thiols tend to get adsorbed on surfaces and produce a lingering odor even long after the fire. Partial oxidation of the released hydrocarbons yields in a wide palette of other compounds: aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acrolein, and furfural), ketones, alcohols (often aromatic, e.g. phenol, guaiacol, syringol, catechol, and cresols), carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, etc.).\nThe visible particulate matter in such smokes is most commonly composed of carbon (soot). Other particulates may be composed of drops of condensed tar, or solid particles of ash. The presence of metals in the fuel yields particles of metal oxides. Particles of inorganic salts may also be formed, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or sodium chloride. Inorganic salts present on the surface of the soot particles may make them hydrophilic. Many organic compounds, typically the aromatic hydrocarbons, may be also adsorbed on the surface of the solid particles. Metal oxides can be present when metal-containing fuels are burned, e.g. solid rocket fuels containing aluminium. Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target ignite, producing particles of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.) Magnetic remanence, recorded in the iron oxide particles, indicates the strength of Earth's magnetic field when they were cooled beyond their Curie temperature; this can be used to distinguish magnetic particles of terrestrial and meteoric origin. Fly ash is composed mainly of silica and calcium oxide. Cenospheres are present in smoke from liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Minute metal particles produced by abrasion can be present in engine smokes. Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen. The silica particles have about 10\u00a0nm size, clumped to 70\u2013100\u00a0nm aggregates and further agglomerated to chains. Radioactive particles may be present due to traces of uranium, thorium, or other radionuclides in the fuel; hot particles can be present in case of fires during nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl disaster) or nuclear war.\nSmoke particulates, like other aerosols, are categorized into three modes based on particle size:\nMost of the smoke material is primarily in coarse particles. Those undergo rapid dry precipitation, and the smoke damage in more distant areas outside of the room where the fire occurs is therefore primarily mediated by the smaller particles.\nAerosol of particles beyond visible size is an early indicator of materials in a preignition stage of a fire.\nBurning of hydrogen-rich fuel produces water vapor; this results in smoke containing droplets of water. In absence of other color sources (nitrogen oxides, particulates...), such smoke is white and cloud-like.\nSmoke emissions may contain characteristic trace elements. Vanadium is present in emissions from oil fired power plants and refineries; oil plants also emit some nickel. Coal combustion produces emissions containing aluminium, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, selenium, and uranium.\nTraces of vanadium in high-temperature combustion products form droplets of molten vanadates. These attack the passivation layers on metals and cause high temperature corrosion, which is a concern especially for internal combustion engines. Molten sulfate and lead particulates also have such effect.\nSome components of smoke are characteristic of the combustion source. Guaiacol and its derivatives are products of pyrolysis of lignin and are characteristic of wood smoke; other markers are syringol and derivates, and other methoxy phenols. Retene, a product of pyrolysis of conifer trees, is an indicator of forest fires. Levoglucosan is a pyrolysis product of cellulose. Hardwood vs softwood smokes differ in the ratio of guaiacols/syringols. Markers for vehicle exhaust include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, steranes, and specific nitroarenes (e.g. 1-nitropyrene). The ratio of hopanes and steranes to elemental carbon can be used to distinguish between emissions of gasoline and diesel engines.\nMany compounds can be associated with particulates; whether by being adsorbed on their surfaces, or by being dissolved in liquid droplets. Hydrogen chloride is well absorbed in the soot particles.\nInert particulate matter can be disturbed and entrained into the smoke. Of particular concern are particles of asbestos.\nDeposited hot particles of radioactive fallout and bioaccumulated radioisotopes can be reintroduced into the atmosphere by wildfires and forest fires; this is a concern in e.g. the Zone of alienation containing contaminants from the Chernobyl disaster.\nPolymers are a significant source of smoke. Aromatic side groups, e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation of smoke. Aromatic groups integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production of smoke. Higher degree of cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.\nVisible and invisible particles of combustion.\nThe naked eye detects particle sizes greater than 7\u00a0\u03bcm (micrometres). Visible particles emitted from a fire are referred to as smoke. Invisible particles are generally referred to as gas or fumes. This is best illustrated when toasting bread in a toaster. As the bread heats up, the products of combustion increase in size. The fumes initially produced are invisible but become visible if the toast is burnt.\nAn ionization chamber type smoke detector is technically a product of combustion detector, not a smoke detector. Ionization chamber type smoke detectors detect particles of combustion that are invisible to the naked eye. This explains why they may frequently false alarm from the fumes emitted from the red-hot heating elements of a toaster, before the presence of visible smoke, yet they may fail to activate in the early, low-heat smoldering stage of a fire.\nSmoke from a typical house fire contains hundreds of different chemicals and fumes. As a result, the damage caused by the smoke can often exceed that caused by the actual heat of the fire. In addition to the physical damage caused by the smoke of a fire \u2013 which manifests itself in the form of stains \u2013 is the often even harder to eliminate problem of a smoky odor. Just as there are contractors that specialize in rebuilding/repairing homes that have been damaged by fire and smoke, fabric restoration companies specialize in restoring fabrics that have been damaged in a fire.\nDangers.\nSmoke from oxygen-deprived fires contains a significant concentration of compounds that are flammable. A cloud of smoke, in contact with atmospheric oxygen, therefore has the potential of being ignited \u2013 either by another open flame in the area, or by its own temperature. This leads to effects like backdraft and flashover. Smoke inhalation is also a danger of smoke that can cause serious injury and death.\nMany compounds of smoke from fires are highly toxic and/or irritating. The most dangerous is carbon monoxide leading to carbon monoxide poisoning, sometimes with the additive effects of hydrogen cyanide and phosgene. Smoke inhalation can therefore quickly lead to incapacitation and loss of consciousness. Sulfur oxides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride in contact with moisture form sulfuric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid, which are corrosive to both lungs and materials. \nCigarette smoke is a major modifiable risk factor for lung disease, heart disease, and many cancers. Smoke can also be a component of ambient air pollution due to the burning of coal in power plants, forest fires or other sources, although the concentration of pollutants in ambient air is typically much less than that in cigarette smoke. One day of exposure to PM2.5 at a concentration of 880 \u03bcg/m3, such as occurs in Beijing, China, is the equivalent of smoking one or two cigarettes in terms of particulate inhalation by weight. The analysis is complicated, however, by the fact that the organic compounds present in various ambient particulates may have a higher carcinogenicity than the compounds in cigarette smoke particulates. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the combination of both sidestream and mainstream smoke emissions from a burning tobacco product. These emissions contain more than 50 carcinogenic chemicals. According to the United States Surgeon General's 2006 report on the subject, exposures to secondhand tobacco smoke can activate platelets causing increased clotting and increased risk of thrombus and potentially damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack. The chances of these effects occurring increase with increased exposure and time of exposure. The American Cancer Society lists \"heart disease, lung infections, increased asthma attacks, middle ear infections, and low birth weight\" as ramifications of smoker's emission.\n \nSmoke can obscure visibility, impeding occupant exiting from fire areas. In fact, the poor visibility due to the smoke that was in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire in Worcester, Massachusetts was the reason why the trapped rescue firefighters could not evacuate the building in time. Because of the striking similarity that each floor shared, the dense smoke caused the firefighters to become disoriented.\nCorrosion.\nSmoke can contain a wide variety of chemicals, many of them aggressive in nature. Examples are hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, produced from halogen-containing plastics and fire retardants, hydrofluoric acid released by pyrolysis of fluorocarbon fire suppression agents, sulfuric acid from burning of sulfur-containing materials, nitric acid from high-temperature fires where nitrous oxide gets formed, phosphoric acid and antimony compounds from P and Sb based fire retardants, and many others. Such corrosion is not significant for structural materials, but delicate structures, especially microelectronics, are strongly affected. Corrosion of circuit board traces, penetration of aggressive chemicals through the casings of parts, and other effects can cause an immediate or gradual deterioration of parameters or even premature (and often delayed, as the corrosion can progress over long time) failure of equipment subjected to smoke. Many smoke components are also electrically conductive; deposition of a conductive layer on the circuits can cause crosstalks and other deteriorations of the operating parameters or even cause short circuits and total failures. Electrical contacts can be affected by corrosion of surfaces, and by deposition of soot and other conductive particles or nonconductive layers on or across the contacts. Deposited particles may adversely affect the performance of optoelectronics by absorbing or scattering the light beams.\nCorrosivity of smoke produced by materials is characterized by the corrosion index (CI), defined as material loss rate (angstrom/minute) per amount of material gasified products (grams) per volume of air (m3). It is measured by exposing strips of metal to flow of combustion products in a test tunnel. Polymers containing halogen and hydrogen (polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins with halogenated additives, etc.) have the highest CI as the corrosive acids are formed directly with water produced by the combustion, polymers containing halogen only (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene) have lower CI as the formation of acid is limited to reactions with airborne humidity, and halogen-free materials (polyolefins, wood) have the lowest CI. However, some halogen-free materials can also release significant amount of corrosive products.\nSmoke damage to electronic equipment can be significantly more extensive than the fire itself. Cable fires are of special concern; low smoke zero halogen materials are preferable for cable insulation.\nWhen smoke comes into contact with the surface of any substance or structure, the chemicals contained in it are transferred to it. The corrosive properties of the chemicals cause the substance or structure to decompose at a rapid rate. Certain materials or structures absorb these chemicals, which is why clothing, unsealed surfaces, potable water, piping, wood, etc., are replaced in most cases of structural fires.\nHealth effects of wood smoke.\nWood smoke is a major source of air pollution, especially particulate pollution, pollution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&lt;ref name=\"10.5194/acp-21-17865-2021\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde.\nIn the United Kingdom domestic combustion, especially for industrial uses, is the largest single source of PM2.5 annually. In some towns and cities in New South Wales, wood smoke may be responsible for 60% of fine particle air pollution in the winter. A year-long sampling campaign in Athens, Greece found a third (31%) of PAH urban air pollution to be caused by wood-burning, roughly as much as that of diesel and oil (33%) and gasoline (29%). It also found that wood-burning is responsible for nearly half (43%) of annual PAH lung cancer-risk compared to the other sources and that wintertime PAH levels were 7 times higher than in other seasons, presumably due to an increased use of fireplaces and heaters. The largest exposure events are periods during the winter with reduced atmospheric dispersion to dilute the accumulated pollution, in particular due to the low wind speeds. Research conducted about biomass burning in 2015, estimated that 38% of European total particulate pollution emissions are composed of domestic wood burning.\nWood smoke (for example from wildfires or wood ovens) can cause lung damage, artery damage and DNA damage leading to cancer, other respiratory and lung disease and cardiovascular disease. Air pollution, particulate matter and wood smoke may also cause brain damage because of particulates breaching the cardiovascular system and into the brain, which can increase the risk of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders mental disorders, and suicidal behavior, although studies on the link between depression and some air pollutants are not consistent. At least one study has identified \"the abundant presence in the human brain of magnetite nanoparticles that match precisely the high-temperature magnetite nanospheres, formed by combustion and/or friction-derived heating, which are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter (PM).\" Air pollution has also been linked to a range of other psychosocial problems.\nMeasurement.\nAs early as the 15th century Leonardo da Vinci commented at length on the difficulty of assessing smoke, and distinguished between black smoke (carbonized particles) and white 'smoke' which is not a smoke at all but merely a suspension of harmless water particulates.\nSmoke from heating appliances is commonly measured in one of the following ways:\nIn-line capture. A smoke sample is simply sucked through a filter which is weighed before and after the test and the mass of smoke found. This is the simplest and probably the most accurate method, but can only be used where the smoke concentration is slight, as the filter can quickly become blocked.\nThe ASTM smoke pump is a simple and widely used method of in-line capture where a measured volume of smoke is pulled through a filter paper and the dark spot so formed is compared with a standard.\nFilter/dilution tunnel. A smoke sample is drawn through a tube where it is diluted with air, the resulting smoke/air mixture is then pulled through a filter and weighed. This is the internationally recognized method of measuring smoke from combustion.\nElectrostatic precipitation. The smoke is passed through an array of metal tubes which contain suspended wires. A (huge) electrical potential is applied across the tubes and wires so that the smoke particles become charged and are attracted to the sides of the tubes. This method can over-read by capturing harmless condensates, or under-read due to the insulating effect of the smoke. However, it is the necessary method for assessing volumes of smoke too great to be forced through a filter, i.e., from bituminous coal.\nRingelmann scale. A measure of smoke color. Invented by Professor Maximilian Ringelmann in Paris in 1888, it is essentially a card with squares of black, white and shades of gray which is held up and the comparative grayness of the smoke judged. Highly dependent on light conditions and the skill of the observer it allocates a grayness number from 0 (white) to 5 (black) which has only a passing relationship to the actual quantity of smoke. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the Ringelmann scale means that it has been adopted as a standard in many countries.\nOptical scattering. A light beam is passed through the smoke. A light detector is situated at an angle to the light source, typically at 90\u00b0, so that it receives only light reflected from passing particles. A measurement is made of the light received which will be higher as the concentration of smoke particles becomes higher.\nOptical obscuration. A light beam is passed through the smoke and a detector opposite measures the light. The more smoke particles are present between the two, the less light will be measured.\nCombined optical methods. There are various proprietary optical smoke measurement devices such as the 'nephelometer' or the 'aethalometer' which use several different optical methods, including more than one wavelength of light, inside a single instrument and apply an algorithm to give a good estimate of smoke. It has been claimed that these devices can differentiate types of smoke and so their probable source can be inferred, though this is disputed.\nInference from carbon monoxide. Smoke is incompletely burned fuel, carbon monoxide is incompletely burned carbon, therefore it has long been assumed that measurement of CO in flue gas (a cheap, simple and very accurate procedure) will provide a good indication of the levels of smoke. Indeed, several jurisdictions use CO measurement as the basis of smoke control. However it is far from clear how accurate the correspondence is.\nTraditional medicinal smoking.\nHistorically, people used the smoke of medicinal plants to try to cure illness. A sculpture from Persepolis shows Darius the Great (522\u2013486 BC), the king of Persia, with two censers in front of him for burning Peganum harmala and/or sandalwood Santalum album, which was believed to protect the king from evil and disease. Around the end of the 20th century more than 300 plant species in 5 continents were used in smoke form for different diseases. As a method of drug administration, smoking is a simple, inexpensive, but very effective method of extracting particles containing active agents. More importantly, generating smoke reduces the particle size to a microscopic scale thereby increasing the absorption of its active chemical principles. However, as of the early 21st century, this traditional use has been little studied by modern medicine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It comprises a chamber (the bowl) for the tobacco from which a thin hollow stem (shank) emerges, ending in a mouthpiece. Pipes can range from very simple machine-made briar models to highly prized hand-made artisanal implements made by renowned pipemakers, which are often very expensive collector's items. \nHistory.\nSome cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas smoke tobacco in ceremonial pipes, and have done so since long before the arrival of Europeans. For instance the Lakota people use a ceremonial pipe called \u010dha\u014bn\u00fa\u014bpa. Other cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas smoke tobacco socially. The tobacco plant is native to South America but spread into North America long before Europeans arrived. Tobacco was introduced to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century and spread around the world rapidly.\nAs tobacco was not introduced to the Old World until the 16th century, the older pipes outside of the Americas were usually used to smoke various other substances, including hashish, a rare and expensive substance outside areas of the Middle East, Central Asia and India, where it was then produced. \nPrinciple.\nOperating Principle.\nA pipe's fundamental function is to provide a relatively safe, manipulable volume in which to incompletely combust a smokable substance. Typically this is accomplished by connecting a refractory 'bowl' to some sort of 'stem' which extends and may also cool the smoke mixture drawn through the combusting organic mass (see below).\nParts.\nThe broad anatomy of a pipe typically comprises mainly the bowl and the stem. The \"bowl\" (1) which is the cup-like outer shell, the part hand-held while packing, holding and smoking a pipe, is also the part \"knocked\" top-down to loosen and release impacted spent tobacco. On being sucked, the general stem delivers the smoke from the bowl to the user's mouth.\nInside the bowl is an inner \"chamber\" (2) space holding tobacco pressed into it. This \"draught hole\" (3), is for air flow where air has travelled through the tobacco in the chamber, taking the smoke with it, up the \"shank\" (4). At the end of the shank, the pipe's \"mortise\" (5) and \"tenon\" (6) joint is an air-tight, simple connection of two detachable parts where the mortise is a hole met by the tenon, a tight-fitting \"tongue\" at the start of the \"stem\" (7). Known as the \"bore\" (10), the inner shaft of this second section stays uniform throughout while the outer stem tapers down to the mouthpiece or \"bit\" (8) held in the smoker's teeth, and finally ends in the \"lip\" (9), attenuated for comfort.\nMaterials.\nThe bowls of tobacco pipes are commonly made of briar wood, meerschaum, corncob, pear-wood, rose-wood or clay. Less common materials include other dense-grained woods such as cherry, olive, maple, mesquite, oak, and bog-wood. Minerals such as catlinite and soapstone have also been used. Pipe bowls are sometimes decorated by carving, and moulded clay pipes often had simple decoration in the mould.\nUnusual pipe materials include gourds (as in the famous calabash pipe) and pyrolytic graphite. Metal and glass, seldom used for tobacco pipes, are common for pipes intended for other substances, such as cannabis.\nThe stem needs a long channel of constant position and diameter running through it for a proper draw, although filter pipes have varying diameters and can be successfully smoked even without filters or adapters. Because it is molded rather than carved, clay may make up the entire pipe or just the bowl; pipes made of most other materials have stems constructed separately and detachable. Stems and bits of tobacco pipes are usually made of moldable materials like Ebonite, Lucite, Bakelite, or soft plastic. Less common are stems made of reeds, bamboo, or hollowed-out pieces of wood. Expensive pipes once had stems made of amber, though this is rare now.\nTypes.\nPipe shapes.\nCalabash.\nCalabash gourds (usually with meerschaum or porcelain bowls set inside them) have long made prized pipes, but they are labour-intensive and, today, quite expensive. Because of this expense, pipes with bodies made of wood (usually mahogany) instead of gourd, but with the same classic shape, are sold as calabashes. Both wood and gourd pipes are functionally the same (with the important exception that the dried gourd, usually being noticeably lighter, sits more comfortably in the mouth). They consist of a downward curve that ends with an upcurve where the bowl sits. Beneath the bowl is an air chamber which serves to cool, dry, and mellow the smoke. There are also briar pipes being sold as calabashes. These typically do not have an air chamber and are so named only because of their external shape.\nA calabash pipe is rather large and easy to recognize as a pipe when used on a stage in dramatic productions. Although a British newspaper cartoon of the early 1900s depicts the British actor H. A. Saintsbury as the Great Detective smoking what may be a calabash pipe, its now-stereotypical identification with Sherlock Holmes remains a mystery.\nSome commentators have erroneously associated the calabash with William Gillette, the first actor to become universally recognized as the embodiment of the detective. Gillette actually introduced the curving or bent pipe for use by Holmes, but his pipe was an ornate briar. Gillette chose a bent pipe, more easily clenched in the teeth when delivering lines.\nWhile there are promotional stills of Basil Rathbone smoking calabash pipes as Holmes for other projects, most notably his radio show, in his first two outings as Holmes produced by 20th Century-Fox as taking place in the Victorian era, Rathbone smoked an apple-bowled, black briar with a half bend, made by Dunhill, the company known for making the best pipes at that time. In the next dozen films, the series produced by Universal Studios, with Holmes and Watson updated to the 1940s, Rathbone smokes a much less expensive Peterson half bend with a billiard-shaped bowl. A calabash is introduced in \"The Spider Woman\" but Holmes does not smoke it. \nIn the original chronicles, such as \"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\", Sherlock Holmes is described as smoking a long-stemmed cherrywood, which he favored \"when in a disputatious, rather than a meditative mood.\" Holmes smokes an old briar-root pipe on occasion, for example in \"The Sign of the Four\", and an \"unsavory\" and \"disreputable\" black and oily clay pipe in several stories, notably in \"The Red-Headed League\". Dr Watson declares it to be the detective's preferred pipe: \"It was to him as a counsellor\" (\"A Case of Identity\"), the \"companion of his deepest meditations\" (\"The Valley of Fear\")..\nHolmes' association with the pipe was referenced in the 2009 film Inglorious Basterds, in which antagonist Hans Landa smokes a Calabash Meerschaum pipe in his introductory scene. \nPipes with removable bowl.\nBowls are made of varying shapes and materials to allow the smoker to try different characteristics or to dedicate particular bowls for particular tobaccos. Bowls are not interchangeable between manufacturers.\nHookahs.\nA \"hookah\", \"ghelyan\", or \"narghile\", is a Middle Eastern water pipe that cools the smoke by filtering it through a water chamber. Often ice or artificial flavorings are added to the water. Traditionally, the tobacco is mixed with a sweetener, such as honey or molasses. Fruit flavors have also become popular. Modern hookah smokers, especially in the US, smoke \"me'assel\", \"moassel\", \"molasses\" or \"shisha\", all names for the same wet mixture of tobacco, molasses/honey, glycerine, and often, flavoring. This style of tobacco is smoked in a bowl with foil or a screen (metal or glass) on top of the bowl. More traditional tobaccos are \"tombiek\" (a dry unflavored tobacco, which the user moistens in water, squeezes out the extra liquid, and places coals directly on top) or \"jarak\" (more of a paste of tobacco with fruit to flavor the smoke).\nBowl materials.\nNorth American natives along the East coast traditionally made their tobacco pipes from clay or from a type of pot-stone (\"lapis ollaris\"), or else serpentine stone. In the Upper Midwest they made use of the red pipestone or catlinite for the same, a fine-grained easily worked stone of a rich red color of the Coteau des Prairies. Today, other construction materials used for the bowl may include any of the following:\nBriar.\nThe majority of pipes sold today, whether handmade or machine-made, are fashioned from briar. Briar is a particularly well suited wood for pipe making for a number of reasons. The first and most important characteristic is its natural resistance to fire. The second is its inherent ability to absorb moisture. The burl absorbs water in nature to supply the tree in the dry times and likewise will absorb the moisture that is a byproduct of combustion. Briar is cut from the root burl of the tree heath (\"Erica arborea\"), which is native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Mediterranean region. Briar burls are cut into two types of blocks; ebauchon and plateaux. Ebauchon is taken from the heart of the burl while plateaux is taken from the outer part of the burl. While both types of blocks can produce pipes of the highest quality, most artisan pipemakers prefer to use plateaux because of their superior graining.\nClay.\nCeramic pipes, made of moulded and then fired clay, were used almost universally by Europeans between the introduction of tobacco in the 16th century, and the introduction of cheap cigarettes at the end of the nineteenth. Contrary to popular belief, the stems were not broken off for the next patron when shared in taverns, as the understanding of germs at the time would not have prompted this behavior.https://\nThe material is not very strong and the early varieties had long thin stems, so they frequently broke, but were cheap to replace. It has been claimed that this fragility was somewhat intentional as it was utilized by Colonial American tavern keepers, for example, in renting the clay pipes to patrons. It is known that communal pipes used in taverns were cleansed by being heated in an oven on special iron racks.\nIn England, clay pipes were sold in bundles of dozens or twenties, and were often free in taverns, where the tobacco was sold. They were made out of a ball clay. The manufacture of clay pipes was controlled by the Guild of Tobacco Pipemakers of Westminster, which was first incorporated in 1619 and later became a City of London Livery Company, reformed in 1954 as the Worshipful Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers and Tobacco Blenders.\nForming the pipe involved making them in moulds with the bore created by pushing an oiled wire inside the stem. The preferred material was pipeclay or \"tobacco pipe clay\", which fires to a white colour and is found in only certain locations. In North America, many clay pipes were historically made from more typical terracotta-coloured clays. According to one British writer in 1869, the French preferred old pipes and the English new, the middle class preferred long stems and the working class preferred short. Short stemmed pipes, sometimes called \"cuttys\" or \"nose warmers\" in England, were preferred by manual laborers as they could be gripped between the teeth, leaving both of the smoker's hands free.\nLater low-quality clay pipes were made by slip casting in a mould. Higher quality pipes are made in a labour-intensive hand shaping process. Traditionally, clay pipes are unglazed. Clays burn \"hot\" in comparison to other types of pipes, so they are often difficult for most pipe-smokers to use. Their proponents claim that, unlike other materials, a well-made clay pipe gives a \"pure\" smoke with no flavour addition from the pipe bowl. In addition to aficionados, reproductions of historical clay styles are used by some historical re-enactors. Clay pipes were once very popular in Ireland, where they were called\n\"dudeens\".\nBroken fragments of clay pipe can be useful as dating evidence for archaeologists. English specialists can date a pipe to around a 20-year period. In the 1950s, the American archaeologist J. C. Harrington noted that the bore of pipe stems decreased over time, so a late sixteenth or early seventeenth centuries pipe would have a stem bore diameter of around , but a late eighteenth century pipe would have a bore diameter of around . The size of bowls also increased over time as tobacco became a cheaper commodity, and later pipes tend to be more decorated.\nCorncob.\nMade from corncobs, these pipes are cheap and effective at absorbing heat and moisture. After being dried for two years, the cobs are hollowed out to form a bowl shape, then either dipped in a plaster-based mixture or varnished or lacquered on the outside. Shanks made from birch wood are then inserted into the bowls. \nThe world's oldest and largest manufacturer of corncob pipes is Missouri Meerschaum, located in Washington, Missouri, where the company has produced the pipes since 1869. General Douglas MacArthur and Mark Twain were perhaps the most famous historical smokers of corncob pipes, as well as fictional cartoon characters Popeye and Frosty the Snowman.\nCorncob pipes remain popular because they are inexpensive and require no \"break-in\" period like briar pipes, which means acquiring a layer of carbon in the pipe bowl. Owing to these factors, corncob pipes are often recommended as a \"beginner's pipe\" However, many seasoned pipe smokers enjoy the absorbing effect of the corn cob pipe, keeping tobaccos high in sugar like Virginias cool throughout the smoke. Additionally, pipesmokers who wish to sample different tobaccos and blends might keep a stock of corncobs on hand to permit them to try new flavors without \"carryover\" from an already-used pipe, sometimes called \"ghosting,\" or to prevent a potentially bad-tasting tobacco from adding its flavor to a more expensive or favored pipe.\nMeerschaum.\nMeerschaum (hydrated magnesium silicate), a mineral found in small shallow deposits mainly around the city of Eski\u015fehir in central Turkey, is prized for the properties which allow it to be carved into finely detailed decorative and figural shapes. It has been used since the 17th century and, with clay pipes, represented the most common medium for pipes before the introduction of briar as the material of choice in the 19th century. The word \"meerschaum\" means \"sea foam\" in German, alluding to its natural white color and its surprisingly low weight. Meerschaum is a very porous mineral that absorbs the tars and oils during the smoking process, and gradually changes color to a golden brown. Old, well-smoked meerschaum pipes are valued by collectors for their distinctive coloring.\nMeerschaum pipes can either be carved from a block of meerschaum, or pressed from meerschaum dust collected after carving and mixed with an adhesive. The pressed meerschaum pipes are far less absorbent, color in blotches, and lack the smoking quality of the block carved pipe.\nSynthetics.\nA variety of other materials may also be used for pipes. The Redmanol corporation manufactured pipes with translucent stems in the 1920s and a series of pipes were manufactured and distributed by the Tar Gard (later Venturi) Corporation of San Francisco from 1965 to 1975. Marketed under names such as \"the pipe\", \"The Smoke\" and \"Venturi\", they used materials such as pyrolytic graphite, phenolic resin, nylon, Bakelite and other synthetics, allowing for higher temperatures in the bowl, reduced tar, and aesthetic variations of color and style.\nAfter Venturi stopped making pipes, several companies continue to make pipes from Brylon, a composite of nylon and wood flour, as a cheaper substitute for briar.\nAccessories.\nFilters.\nUsed to absorb moisture, tar and nicotine. Made of:\nFilters can be single- or double-sided. Double-sided filter has both ends ceramic that can withstand hot smoke. Single-sided filter has ceramic end to the bowl and plastic end to the stem.\nUse.\nSmoking a pipe involves more equipment and technique than smoking cigarettes or cigars. In addition to the pipe and a source of ignition like matches or a pipe lighter, pipe smokers typically use a pipe tool for packing, adjusting, and emptying tobacco from the bowl, along with a regular supply of pipe cleaners to maintain the pipe. In 18th-century North America, smokers used a \"tobacco-stopper\" to press tobacco into the pipe's bowl, with some of these stoppers made from bones, such as those extracted from the male anatomy of raccoons, reflecting the resourcefulness of the era's material culture.\nTobacco.\nTobacco for smoking in pipes are often carefully treated and blended to achieve flavour nuances not available in other tobacco products. Many of these are blends using staple ingredients of variously cured Burley and Virginia tobaccos which are enhanced by spice tobaccos, among them many Oriental or Balkan varietals, Latakia (a fire-cured spice tobacco of Syrian origin, but now made in other regions, such as, Cyprus and Lebanon), Perique (uniquely grown in St. James Parish, Louisiana) which is also an old method of fermentation, or blends of Virginia and Burley tobaccos of African, Indian, or South American origins. Traditionally, many U.S. blends are made of American Burley with sweeteners and flavorings added to create an \"aromatic\" flavor, whereas \"English\" blends are based on natural Virginia tobaccos enhanced with Oriental and other natural tobaccos. There is a growing tendency towards \"natural\" tobaccos which derive their aromas from artful blending with selected spice tobaccos only and careful, often historically-based, curing processes.\nPipe tobacco can be purchased in several forms, which vary both in flavour (leading to many blends and opportunities for smokers to blend their own tobaccos) and in the physical shape and size to which the tobacco has been reduced. Most pipe tobaccos are less mild than cigarette tobacco, substantially more moist and cut much more coarsely. Too finely cut tobacco does not allow enough air to flow through the pipe, and overly dry tobacco burns too quickly with little flavour. Pipe tobacco must be kept in an airtight container, such as a canning jar or sealed tin, to keep from drying out.\nSome pipe tobaccos are cut into long narrow ribbons. Some are pressed into flat plugs which are sliced into flakes. Others are tightly wound into long ropes, then sliced into discs. Plug tobacco is maintained in its pressed block form and sold in small blocks. The plug will be sliced into thin flakes by the smoker and then prepared in a similar fashion to flake tobacco. It is considered that plug tobacco holds its flavor better than rubbed or flake tobacco. Flake tobacco (sliced cakes or ropes) may be prepared in several ways. Generally it is rubbed out with the fingers and palms until it is loose enough to pack. It can also be crumbled or simply folded and stuffed into a pipe. Some people also prefer to dice up very coarse tobaccos before using them, making them easier to pack.\nPacking.\nIn the most common method of packing, tobacco is added to the bowl of the pipe in several batches, each one pressed down until the mixture has a uniform density that optimizes airflow (something that it is difficult to gauge without practice). This can be done with a finger or thumb, but if the tobacco needs to be repacked later, while it is burning, the tamper on a pipe tool is sometimes used. If it needs to be loosened, the reamer, or any similar long pin can be used. A traditional way of packing the pipe is to fill the bowl and then pack gently to about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 full, fill again and pack slightly more firmly to about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 full, and then pack more firmly still to the top.\nAn alternative packing technique called the Frank method involves lightly dropping tobacco in the pipe, after which a large plug is gingerly pushed into the bowl all at once.\nLighting.\nMatches, or separately lit slivers of wood are often considered preferable to lighters because of lower burning temperature. Butane lighters made specifically for pipes \nemit flame sideways or at an angle to make it easier to direct flame into the bowl. Torch-style lighters should never be used to light a pipe because their flames are too hot and can char the rim of the pipe bowl. Matches should be allowed to burn for several seconds to allow the sulfur from the tip to burn away and the match to produce a full flame. A naphtha fueled lighter should also be allowed to burn a few seconds to get rid of stray naphtha vapors that could give a foul taste to the smoke. When a flame has been produced, it is then moved in circles above the rim of the bowl while the smoker puffs to draw the flame down and light the tobacco. Packing method and humidity can affect how often a pipe must be relit.\nBurning prevention.\nWith care, a briar pipe can last a very long time without burning out. However, due to aggressive (hot) smoking or imperfections in the wood, a hole can be burned in the tobacco chamber of the pipe. There are several methods used to help prevent a wood pipe from burning out. These generally involve coating the chamber with any of a variety of substances, or by gently smoking a new pipe to build up a cake (a mixture of ash, unburned tobacco, oils, sugars, and other residue) on the walls.\nThese coatings may include honey and water; powdered sugar and water; cigar ash and water; and sour cream, buttermilk, and activated charcoal among many others.\nMany modern briar pipes are pre-treated by the manufacturer to resist burning. If smoked correctly, the cake will build up properly on its own. Another technique is to alternate a half-bowl and a full-bowl the first several times the pipe is used to build an even cake. Burley is often recommended to help a new pipe build cake.\nThe caked layer that helps prevent burning through the bottom or sides of a briar wood pipe may damage other pipes, such as meerschaum or clay. As the cake layer heats up, it expands and may cause cracks or breaks in non-briar pipes.\nSmoking.\nPipe smoke, like cigar smoke, is usually not inhaled. It is merely brought into the mouth, pumped around oral and nasal cavities to permit absorption of nicotine toward the brain through the mucous membranes, and released. It is normal to have to relight a pipe periodically. If it is smoked too slowly, this will happen more often. If it is smoked too quickly, it can produce excess moisture, causing a gurgling sound in the pipe and an uncomfortable sensation on the tongue (referred to as \"pipe tongue\", or more commonly, \"tongue bite\").\nA pipe cleaner can be used to dry out the bowl and, wetted with alcohol, the inner channel. The bowl of the pipe can also become uncomfortably hot, depending on the material and the rate of smoking. For this reason, clay pipes in particular are often held by the stem. Meerschaum pipes are held in a square of chamois leather, with gloves, or else by the stem in order to prevent uneven coloring of the material.\nCleaning.\nThe ash and the last bits of unburned tobacco, known as dottle, should be cleaned out with a suitable pipe tool. A soft or bristle pipe cleaner, which may be moistened with strong spirits, is then run through the airways of the stem and shank to remove any moisture, ash, and other residue before the pipe is allowed to dry. A pipe should be allowed to cool before removing the stem to avoid the possibility of warping it.\nA cake of ash eventually develops inside the bowl. This is generally considered desirable for controlling overall heat. However, if it becomes too thick, it may expand faster than the bowl of the pipe itself when heated, cracking the bowl. Before reaching this point, it needs to be scraped down with a reamer. It is generally recommended to keep the cake at approximately the thickness of a U.S. dime (about 1/20 of an inch or 1.5\u00a0mm), though sometimes the cake is removed entirely as part of efforts to eliminate flavors or aromas.\nCake is considered undesirable in meerschaum pipes because it can easily crack the bowl or interfere with the mineral's natural porosity. Meerschaum also softens when heated so it is recommended to allow meerschaum pipes to cool before cleaning as people have been known to push pipe cleaners through the walls of heated pipes.\nRegardless whether a pipe is cleaned after every smoke, over time there is a buildup of cake in the bowl and tars in the internals of a smoking pipe. The cake can be controlled by gentle reaming, but a buildup of tars in the shank and airway of a pipe is more difficult to deal with. This may require the services of a professional pipe restorer to properly clean and sanitize the pipe.\nSweetening.\nWhen tobacco is burned, oils from adjoining not yet ignited particles vaporize and condense into the existing cake on the walls of the bowl and shank. Over time, these oils can oxidize and turn rancid, causing the pipe to give a sour or bitter smoke. A purported countermeasure involves filling the bowl with kosher salt and carefully wetting it with strong spirits. It is important to not use iodized salt, as the iodine and other additives may impart an unpleasant flavor. Regularly wiping out the bowl with spirits such as vodka or rum is helpful in preventing souring. Commercial pipe-sweetening products are also available.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese. The term is generic; it does not imply that the cheese is actually made in Switzerland. Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks or rounds of the cheese are riddled with holes known as \"eyes\". Cheese without eyes is known as \"blind\". \n\"Swiss cheese\" is now produced in many countries, including the United States, Finland, Estonia, and Ireland. It is sometimes made with pasteurized or part-skim milk, unlike the original from Switzerland made with raw milk. The United States Department of Agriculture uses the terms Swiss cheese and Emmentaler cheese interchangeably. In Australia, both terms are used, along with Swiss-style cheese, in some cases differentiating the two. The term Swiss cheese is sometimes used in India, although it is also often referred to as Emmental.\nProduction.\nThree types of bacteria are used in the production of Swiss cheese: \"Streptococcus thermophilus\", \"Lactobacillus\" (\"L. helveticus\" or \"L. delbrueckii\" subsp. \"bulgaricus\"), and \"Propionibacterium\" (\"Propionibacterium freudenreichii\" subsp. \"shermani\"). In a late stage of cheese production, the propionibacteria consume the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria and release acetate, propionic acid, and carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide slowly forms the bubbles that develop the \"eyes\". The acetate and propionic acid give Swiss its nutty and sweet flavor. A hypothesis proposed by Swiss researchers in 2015 notes that particulate matter may also play a role in the holes' development and that modern sanitation, which eliminated debris such as hay dust in the milk, played a role in reduced hole size in Swiss cheeses, or even \"blind cheese\". Historically, the holes were seen as a sign of imperfection and cheese makers originally tried to avoid them by pressing during production; the holes only became an identifier of the cheese in modern times.\nIn general, the larger the eyes in a Swiss cheese, the more pronounced its flavor because a longer fermentation period gives the bacteria more time to act. This poses a problem, because cheese with large eyes does not slice well and comes apart in mechanical slicers. As a result, U.S. industry regulators have reduced the minimum eye size with which Swiss cheese can receive the Grade A stamp.\nTypical annual production of Swiss cheese in the United States is approximately .\nVariants.\nBaby Swiss and Lacy Swiss are two varieties of American Swiss cheeses. Both have small holes and a mild flavor. Baby Swiss is made from whole milk, and Lacy Swiss is made from low fat milk. Baby Swiss was developed in the mid-1960s outside of Charm, Ohio, by the Guggisberg Cheese Company, owned by Alfred Guggisberg.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a form of visual communication used over a long distance. In general smoke signals are used to transmit news, signal danger, or to gather people to a common area.\nHistory and usage.\nIn ancient China, soldiers along the Great Wall sent smoke signals on its beacon towers to warn one another of enemy invasion. The colour of the smoke communicated the size of the invading party. By placing the beacon towers at regular intervals, and situating a soldier in each tower, messages could be transmitted over the entire 7,300 kilometres of the Wall. Smoke signals also warned the inner castles of the invasion, allowing them to coordinate a defense and garrison supporting troops.\nMisuse of the smoke signal is traditionally considered to have contributed to the fall of the Western Zhou dynasty in the 8th century BCE. King You of Zhou was said to have had a habit of fooling his warlords with false warning beacons to amuse Bao Si, his concubine.\nFrom at least the 13th century onwards, the use of smoke signals is documented in the cities, castles, towers, and villages of northern and central Italy as a means of warning of enemy approach in times of war. A single column of smoke would indicate that the enemy forces were large in number, whereas two columns signified that the threat consisted of only a small contingent. At night, the same signals were conveyed by means of fires or lanterns.\nDuring Sri Lanka's Kandyan period, soldiers stationed on the mountain peaks alerted each other of impending enemy attack (from English, Dutch or Portuguese people) by signaling from peak to peak. In this way, they could transmit a message to the King in just a few hours.&lt;ref name=\"Kandy 1681/2004\"&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;Knox, Robert (2004). \"https://\". Project Gutenberg. at Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;\nNorth American indigenous peoples also communicated via smoke signal. Each tribe had its own signaling system and understanding. A signaler started a fire on an elevation typically using damp grass, which caused a column of smoke to rise. The grass was taken off as it dried and another bundle was placed on the fire. Reputedly the location of the smoke along the incline conveyed a meaning. If it came from halfway up the hill, it signaled that all was well; but from the top of the hill, it signified danger.\nColored smoke grenades are commonly used by military forces to mark positions, especially during calls for artillery or air support.\nSmoke signals may also refer to smoke-producing devices used to send distress signals.\nExamples.\nThe Catholic Church.\nSince the 19th century the College of Cardinals has used smoke signals to indicate the taking of a vote during a papal conclave. Eligible cardinals conduct a secret ballot until a Papal candidate receives a vote of two-thirds plus one. The ballots are burned after each vote; since 1914 black smoke has indicated a failed election, and white smoke means a new pope has been elected.\nNative Americans.\nLewis and Clark's journals cite several occasions when they adopted the Native American method of setting the plains on fire to communicate the presence of their party or their desire to meet with local tribes.\nY\u00e1mana.\nY\u00e1manas of South America used fire to send messages by smoke signals, for instance if a whale drifted ashore. The large amount of meat required notification of many people so that it would not be wasted. They might also have used smoke signals on other occasions\u2014thus it is possible that Magellan saw such fires and was inspired to name the landscape Tierra del Fuego (\"Land of Fire\"); however, he may have seen the smoke or lights of natural phenomena.\nNoon Gun.\nThe Cape Town Noon Gun, specifically the smoke its firing generates, was used to set marine chronometers in Table Bay.\nAboriginal Australians.\nAboriginal Australians throughout Australia have used smoke signals for various purposes\u2014 sometimes to notify others of their presence, particularly when entering lands which were not their own. Sometimes used to describe visiting Whites, smoke signals were the fastest way to send messages. Smoke signals were sometimes used to notify of incursions by hostile tribes, or to arrange meetings between hunting parties of the same tribe. This signal could be from a fixed lookout on a ridge or from a mobile band of tribesman. \"Putting up a smoke\" often promoted nearby individuals or groups to reply with their own signals. Different colours of smoke (black, white or blue, depending on whether the material being burnt was wet grass, dry grass, reeds or other materials) were used to convert information, as was the smoke's shape (a column, ball or ring), allowing a messaging system sophisticated enough to include the names of individual tribesmen. Like other means of communication, signals could be misinterpreted. In one recorded instance, a smoke signal reply translated as \"we are coming\" was misinterpreted as joining a war party for protection of the tribe, when it was actually to indicate hunting parties coming together after a successful hunt.\nGoryeo and Joseon.\nThe beacon fire signal system (bongsu, \ubd09\uc218, \u70fd\u71e7) was formally institutionalized during the early Goryeo period in 1149 (the 3rd year of King Uijong\u2019s reign). According to historical records, it was enacted by royal decree following a memorial submitted by Jo Jin-yak (\u66fa\u664b\u82e5), the Military Commissioner of the Northwestern Region (Seobukmyeon Byeongmasa, \u897f\u5317\u9762\u5175\u99ac\u4f7f). Under this system, signals were sent using smoke during the day and fire at night. The method of bongsu involved using fire at night and smoke during the day. The signaling system followed a five-tiered structure: one torch (geo, \u70ac) was lit in times of peace; two when enemy ships were spotted at sea; three when they approached the coast; four when they engaged with Korean naval forces; and five when enemy troops landed on shore. These signals were immediately reported by local commanders(ojang, \uc624\uc7a5, \u4e94\u5c07) to regional governors. In the capital, the Ministry of War (Byeongjo, \ubcd1\uc870, \u5175\u66f9) monitored the beacons and reported the situation to the Royal Secretariat (Seungjeongwon, \uc2b9\uc815\uc6d0, \u627f\u653f\u9662), which then informed the king.\nAviation.\nModern aviation has made skywriting possible.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27006", "revid": "5957417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27006", "title": "Serendipity", "text": "Unplanned, fortunate discovery\nSerendipity is an unplanned fortunate discovery. The term was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754.\nThe concept is often associated with scientific and technological breakthroughs, where accidental discoveries led to new insights or inventions. Many significant discoveries in history were serendipitous, including penicillin, Post-it notes, Popsicles, and the microwave oven, arising from unforeseen circumstances that were then recognized and capitalized upon.\nDefinition.\nChristian Busch views serendipity as \"active luck\", where chance encounters and human action come together. A missed flight or a casual walk in the park can lead to new friendships, interests, or even career opportunities.\nWhile serendipity in popular usage is often understood as a matter of pure chance, scientific discussions emphasize the crucial role of human agency\u2014recognizing, interpreting, and acting upon unexpected opportunities. This interaction between chance and conscious action has been a key theme in areas such as creativity, leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship.\nEtymology.\nThe first noted use of \"serendipity\" was by Horace Walpole on 28 January 1754. In a letter he wrote to his friend Horace Mann, Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a painting of Bianca Cappello, which he recently received from Mann as a gift. The finding regarded the coat of arms of the Cappello family and was categorised by reference to a Persian fairy tale, \"The Three Princes of Serendip\". The princes, he told his correspondent, were \"always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of.\" The name comes from \"Serendip\", an old Persian name for Sri Lanka (Ceylon), hence \"Sarandib\" by Arab traders. It is derived from the Sanskrit \"Si\u1e43haladv\u012bpa\u1e25\" (Si\u1e43hala\u1e25, Sinhalese + dv\u012bpa\u1e25, island), meaning Isle of the Sinhalas.\nThe word has been exported into many other languages, with the general meaning of \"unexpected discovery\" or \"fortunate chance\".\nApplications.\nInventions.\n The term \"serendipity\" is often applied to inventions made by chance rather than intent. Andrew Smith, editor of \"The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink\", has speculated that most everyday products had serendipitous roots, with many early ones related to animals. The origin of cheese, for example, possibly originated in the nomad practice of storing milk in the stomach of a dead camel that was attached to the saddle of a live one, thereby mixing rennet from the stomach with the milk stored within.\nOther examples of serendipity in inventions include:\nDiscoveries.\nSerendipity contributed to entomologist Shaun Winterton discovering \"Semachrysa jade\", a new species of lacewing, which he found not in its native Malaysia, but on the photo-sharing site Flickr. Winterton's discovery was aided by Flickr's ability to present images that are personalized to a user's interests, thereby increasing the odds he would chance upon the photo. Computer scientist Jaime Teevan has argued that serendipitous discovery is promoted by such personalisation, writing that \"people don't know what to do with random new information. Instead, we want information that is at the fringe of what we already know, because that is when we have the cognitive structures to make sense of the new ideas.\"\nOnline activity.\nSerendipity is a design principle for online activity that would present viewpoints that diverge from those participants already hold. Harvard Law professor Cass Sunstein argues that such an \"architecture of serendipity\" would promote a healthier democracy. Like a great city or university, \"a well-functioning information market\" provides exposure to new ideas, people, and ways of life. \"Serendipity is crucial because it expands your horizons. You need that if you want to be free.\" The idea has potential application in the design of social media, information searches, and web browsing.\nRelated terms.\nSeveral uncommonly used terms have been derived from the concept and name of serendipity.\nWilliam Boyd coined the term zemblanity in the late twentieth century to mean somewhat the opposite of serendipity: \"making unhappy, unlucky and expected discoveries occurring by design\". The derivation is speculative, but believed to be from Nova Zembla, a barren archipelago once the site of Russian nuclear testing.\nBahramdipity is derived directly from Bahram Gur as characterized in \"The Three Princes of Serendip\". It describes the \"suppression\" of serendipitous discoveries or research results by powerful individuals.\nIn addition, Solomon &amp; Bronstein (2018) further distinguish between perceptual and realised pseudo-serendipity and nemorinity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After establishing his reputation as a portrait painter, Morse, in his middle age, contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer and the namesake of Morse code in 1837 and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.\nPersonal life.\nSamuel F.\u00a0B. Morse was born in Charlestown, now part of Boston, Massachusetts, the first child of the pastor Jedidiah Morse, who was also a geographer, and his wife Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese. His father was a great preacher of the Calvinist faith and supporter of the Federalist Party. He thought it helped preserve Puritan traditions (strict observance of Sabbath, among other things), and supported the Federalist policies of an American alliance with Britain and a strong federal government. Morse strongly believed in education within a Federalist framework, alongside the instillation of Calvinist virtues, morals, and prayers for his first son. His first ancestor in America was Anthony Morse, of Marlborough, Wiltshire, who had emigrated to America in 1635, and settled in Newbury, Massachusetts.\nAfter attending Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, Samuel Morse went on to Yale College to study religious philosophy, mathematics, and science. While at Yale, he attended lectures on electricity from Benjamin Silliman and Jeremiah Day and was a member of the Society of Brothers in Unity. He supported himself by painting. In 1810, he graduated from Yale with Phi Beta Kappa honors.\nMorse married Lucretia Pickering Walker on September 29, 1818, in Concord, New Hampshire. She died on February 7, 1825, of a heart attack shortly after the birth of their third child. He married his second wife, Sarah Elizabeth Griswold on August 10, 1848, in Utica, New York and had four children.\nPainting.\nMorse expressed some of his Calvinist beliefs in his painting, \"Landing of the Pilgrims\", through the depiction of simple clothing as well as the people's austere facial features. His image captured the psychology of the Federalists; Calvinists from England brought to North America ideas of religion and government, thus linking the two countries. This work attracted the attention of the notable artist, Washington Allston. Allston wanted Morse to accompany him to England to meet the artist Benjamin West. Allston arranged\u2014with Morse's father\u2014a three-year stay for painting study in England. The two men set sail aboard the \"Libya\" on July 15, 1811.\nIn England, Morse perfected his painting techniques under Allston's watchful eye; by the end of 1811, he gained admittance to the Royal Academy. At the academy, he was moved by the art of the Renaissance and paid close attention to the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. After observing and practicing life drawing and absorbing its anatomical demands, the young artist produced his masterpiece, the \"Dying Hercules\". (He first made a sculpture as a study for the painting.) During Morse's time in England, the British and Americans were engaged in the War of 1812, which the pro-British Federalists had consistently opposed. As the war raged on, Morse's letters to his parents became more anti-Federalist in tone. In one letter, Morse wrote:\n I assert ... that the Federalists in the Northern States have done more injury to their country by their violent opposition measures than a French alliance could. Their proceedings are copied into the English papers, read before Parliament, and circulated through their country, and what do they say of them... they call them [Federalists] cowards, a base set, say they are traitors to their country and ought to be hanged like traitors.\nAlthough Jedidiah Morse did not change Samuel's political views, he continued as an influence. Critics believe that the elder Morse's Calvinist ideas are integral to Morse's \"Judgment of Jupiter,\" another significant work completed in England. Jupiter is shown in a cloud, accompanied by his eagle, with his hand spread above the parties and he is pronouncing judgment. Marpessa, with an expression of compunction and shame, is throwing herself into the arms of her husband. Idas, who tenderly loved Marpessa, is eagerly rushing forward to receive her while Apollo stares with surprise.\nCritics have suggested that Jupiter represents God's omnipotence\u2014watching every move that is made. Some call the portrait a moral teaching by Morse on infidelity. Although Marpessa fell victim, she realized that her eternal salvation was important and desisted from her wicked ways. Apollo shows no remorse for what he did but stands with a puzzled look. Many American paintings throughout the early nineteenth century had religious themes, and Morse was an early exemplar of this. \"Judgment of Jupiter\" allowed Morse to express his support of Anti-Federalism while maintaining his strong spiritual convictions. Benjamin West sought to present the \"Jupiter\" at another Royal Academy exhibition, but Morse's time had run out. He left England on August 21, 1815, to return to the United States and begin his full-time career as a painter. The decade 1815\u20131825 marked significant growth in Morse's work, as he sought to capture the essence of America's culture and life. He painted the Federalist former President John Adams (1816). The Federalists and Anti-Federalists clashed over Dartmouth College. Morse painted portraits of Francis Brown\u2014the college's president\u2014and Judge Woodward (1817), who was involved in bringing the Dartmouth case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMorse also sought commissions among the elite of Charleston, South Carolina. Morse's 1818 painting of Mrs. Emma Quash symbolized the opulence of Charleston. The young artist was doing well for himself. Between 1819 and 1821, Morse went through great changes in his life, including a decline in commissions due to the Panic of 1819. Morse was commissioned to paint President James Monroe in 1820. He embodied Jeffersonian democracy by favoring the common man over the aristocrat. Morse had moved to New Haven. His commissions for \"The House of Representatives\" (1821) and a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette (1825) engaged his sense of democratic nationalism. \"The House of Representatives\" was designed to capitalize on the success of Fran\u00e7ois Marius Granet's \"The Capuchin Chapel in Rome,\" which toured the United States extensively throughout the 1820s, attracting audiences willing to pay the 25-cent admission fee.\nThe artist chose to paint the House of Representatives, in a similar way, with careful attention to architecture and dramatic lighting. He also wished to select a uniquely American topic that would bring glory to the young nation. His subject did just that, showing American democracy in action. He traveled to Washington D.C. to draw the architecture of the new Capitol and placed eighty individuals within the painting. He chose to portray a night scene, balancing the architecture of the Rotunda with the figures, and using lamplight to highlight the work. Pairs of people, those who stood alone, individuals bent over their desks working, were each painted simply but with faces of character. Morse chose nighttime to convey that Congress' dedication to the principles of democracy transcended day.\n\"The House of Representatives\" failed to draw a crowd when exhibited in New York City in 1823. By contrast, John Trumbull's \"Declaration of Independence\" had won popular acclaim a few years earlier. Viewers may have felt that the architecture of \"The House of Representatives\" overshadows the individuals, making it hard to appreciate the drama of what was happening. Morse was honored to paint the Marquis de Lafayette, the leading French supporter of the American Revolution. He felt compelled to paint a grand portrait of the man who helped to establish a free and independent America. He features Lafayette against a magnificent sunset. He has positioned Lafayette to the right of three pedestals: one has a bust of Benjamin Franklin, another of George Washington, and the third seems reserved for Lafayette. A peaceful woodland landscape below him symbolized American tranquility and prosperity as it approached the age of fifty. The developing friendship between Morse and Lafayette and their discussions of the Revolutionary War affected the artist after his return to New York City.\nIn 1826, he helped found the National Academy of Design in New York City. He served as the academy's president from 1826 to 1845 and again from 1861 to 1862. Forty-nine of his paintings were exhibited there. From 1830 to 1832, Morse traveled and studied in Europe to improve his painting skills, visiting Italy, Switzerland, and France. During his time in Paris, he developed a friendship with the writer James Fenimore Cooper. As a project, he painted miniature copies of 38 of the Louvre's famous paintings on a single canvas (6\u00a0ft. x 9\u00a0ft), which he entitled \"The Gallery of the Louvre.\" He completed the work upon his return to the United States.\nIn 1832, after his return to the United States, Morse was appointed professor of painting and sculpture at the University of the City of New York, now New York University. This was the first such professorship in the United States. On a subsequent visit to Paris in 1839, Morse met Louis Daguerre. He became interested in the latter's daguerreotype\u2014the first practical means of photography. Morse wrote a letter to the \"New York Observer\" describing the invention, which was published widely in the American press and provided broad awareness of the new technology. Mathew Brady, one of the earliest photographers in American history, famous for his depictions of the Civil War, initially studied under Morse and later took photographs of him.\nSome of Morse's paintings and sculptures are on display at his Locust Grove estate in Poughkeepsie, New York.\nTelegraph.\nWhile returning by ship from Europe in 1832, Morse encountered Charles Thomas Jackson of Boston, a man who was well schooled in electromagnetism. Witnessing various experiments with Jackson's electromagnet, Morse developed the concept of a single-wire telegraph. He set aside the painting he had been working on, \"The Gallery of the Louvre\". The original Morse telegraph, submitted with his patent application, is part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. In time, the Morse code that he developed would become the primary language of telegraphy in the world. It is still the standard for rhythmic transmission of data.\nMeanwhile, William Cooke and Professor Charles Wheatstone had learned of the Wilhelm Weber and Carl Gauss electromagnetic telegraph in 1833. They had reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to Morse, despite starting later. In England, Cooke became fascinated by electrical telegraphy in 1836, four years after Morse. Aided by his greater financial resources, Cooke abandoned his primary subject of anatomy and built a small electrical telegraph within three weeks. Wheatstone also was experimenting with telegraphy and (most importantly) understood that a single large battery would not carry a telegraphic signal over long distances. He theorized that numerous small batteries were far more successful and efficient in this task. (Wheatstone was building on the primary research of Joseph Henry, an American physicist.) Cooke and Wheatstone formed a partnership and patented the electrical telegraph in May 1837, and within a short time had provided the Great Western Railway with a stretch of telegraph. However, within a few years, Cooke and Wheatstone's multiple-wire signaling method would be overtaken by Morse's cheaper method.\nIn an 1848 letter to a friend, Morse describes how vigorously he fought to be called the sole inventor of the electromagnetic telegraph despite the previous inventions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have been so constantly under the necessity of watching the movements of the most unprincipled set of pirates I have ever known, that all my time has been occupied in defense, in putting evidence into something like legal shape that I am the inventor of the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph! Would you have believed it ten years ago that a question could be raised on that subject?\u2014\u200a\nRelays.\nMorse encountered the problem of getting a telegraphic signal to carry over more than a few hundred yards of wire. His breakthrough came from the insights of Leonard Gale, who taught chemistry at New York University (he was a personal friend of Joseph Henry). With Gale's help, Morse introduced extra circuits or relays at frequent intervals and was soon able to send a message through of wire. This was the great breakthrough he had been seeking. Morse and Gale were soon joined by Alfred Vail, an enthusiastic young man with excellent skills, insights, and money.\nAt the Speedwell Ironworks in Morristown, New Jersey on January 11, 1838, Morse and Vail made the first public demonstration of the electric telegraph. Although Morse and Alfred Vail had done most of the research and development in the ironworks facilities, they chose a nearby factory house as the demonstration site. Without the repeater, Morse devised a system of electromagnetic relays. This was the key innovation, as it freed the technology from being limited by distance in sending messages. The range of the telegraph was limited to , and the inventors had pulled of wires inside the factory house through an elaborate scheme. The first public transmission, with the message, \"A patient waiter is no loser\", was witnessed by a mostly local crowd.\nMorse traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1838 seeking federal sponsorship for a telegraph line but was not successful. He went to Europe, seeking both sponsorship and patents, but in London discovered that Cooke and Wheatstone had already established priority. After his return to the US, Morse finally gained financial backing by Maine congressman Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith. This funding may be the first instance of government support to a private researcher, especially funding for applied (as opposed to basic or theoretical) research.\nFederal support.\nMorse made his last trip to Washington, D.C., in December 1842, stringing \"wires between two committee rooms in the Capitol, and sent messages back and forth\" to demonstrate his telegraph system. Congress appropriated $30,000 () in 1843 for construction of an experimental telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore along the right-of-way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. An impressive demonstration occurred on May 1, 1844, when news of the Whig Party's nomination of Henry Clay for U.S. president was telegraphed from the party's convention in Baltimore to the Capitol Building in Washington.\nOn May 24, 1844, the line was officially opened as Morse sent the now-famous words, \"What hath God wrought,\" from the Supreme Court chamber in the basement of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., to the B&amp;O's Mount Clare Station in Baltimore. Annie Ellsworth chose these words from the Bible (Numbers 23:23); her father, U.S. Patent Commissioner Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, had championed Morse's invention and secured early funding for it. His telegraph could transmit thirty characters per minute.\nIn May 1845, the Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed in order to build telegraph lines from New York City toward Philadelphia, Boston, Buffalo, and the Mississippi. Telegraphic lines rapidly spread throughout the United States in the next few years, with 12,000 miles of wire laid by 1850.\nMorse at one time adopted Wheatstone and Carl August von Steinheil's idea of broadcasting an electrical telegraph signal through a body of water or down steel railroad tracks or anything conductive. He went to great lengths to win a lawsuit for the right to be called \"inventor of the telegraph\" and promoted himself as being an inventor. But Alfred Vail also played an important role in the development of the Morse code, which was based on earlier codes for the electromagnetic telegraph.\nPatent.\nMorse received a patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present Beylerbeyi Palace was built in 1861\u20131865 on the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid, who personally tested the new invention. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. The original patent went to the Breese side of the family after the death of Samuel Morse.\nIn 1856, Morse went to Copenhagen and visited the Thorvaldsens Museum, where the sculptor's grave is in the inner courtyard. He was received by King Frederick VII, who decorated him with the Order of the Dannebrog for the telegraph. Morse expressed his wish to donate his Thorvaldsen portrait from 1831 in Rome to the king. The Thorvaldsen portrait today belongs to Margrethe II of Denmark.\nThe Morse telegraphic apparatus was officially adopted as the standard for European telegraphy in 1851. Only the United Kingdom (with its extensive overseas empire) kept the needle telegraph of Cooke and Wheatstone.\nIn 1858, Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico, then a Spanish Colony. Morse's oldest daughter, Susan Walker Morse (1819\u20131885), would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker, who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of Guayama. During one of her visits, she met Edward Lind, a Danish merchant who worked in his brother-in-law's Hacienda La Henriqueta in the town of Arroyo. They later married. Lind purchased the Hacienda from his sister when she became a widow. Morse, who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son-in-law, set a two-mile telegraph line connecting his son-in-law's Hacienda to their house in Arroyo. The line was inaugurated on March 1, 1859, in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags. The first words transmitted by Samuel Morse that day in Puerto Rico were:\nPuerto Rico, beautiful jewel! When you are linked with the other jewels of the Antilles in the necklace of the world's telegraph, yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen!\nPolitical views.\nAnti-Catholic.\nMorse was a leader in the anti-Catholic and anti-immigration movement of the mid-19th century. In 1836, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York under the anti-immigrant Nativist Party's banner, receiving only 1,496\u00a0votes. When Morse visited Rome, he allegedly refused to take his hat off in the presence of the Pope.\nMorse worked to unite Protestants against Catholic institutions (including schools), wanted to forbid Catholics from holding public office, and promoted changing immigration laws to limit immigration from Catholic countries. On this topic, he wrote, \"We must first stop the leak in the ship through which muddy waters from without threaten to sink us.\"\nHe wrote numerous letters to the New York \"Observer\" (his brother Sidney was the editor at the time) urging people to fight the perceived Catholic menace. These were widely reprinted in other newspapers. Among other claims, he believed that the Austrian government and Catholic aid organizations were subsidizing Catholic immigration to the United States in order to gain control of the country.\nIn his \"Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States\", Morse wrote:\nSurely American Protestants, freemen, have discernment enough to discover beneath them the cloven foot of this subtle foreign heresy. They will see that Popery is now, what it has ever been, a system of the darkest political intrigue and despotism, cloaking itself to avoid attack under the sacred name of religion. They will be deeply impressed with the truth, that Popery is a political as well as a religious system; that in this respect it differs totally from all other sects, from all other forms of religion in the country.\nIn the same book, published in 1835 under the name of \"Brutus\", in speaking of \"the foreign Emissaries of Popery re-warded in their own country,\" said: \"Where is Bishop Kelly of Richmond, Va.? He also sojourns with us until his duties to foreign masters are performed, and then is rewarded by promotion.\" (Patrick Kelly was a native of Ireland, and the first bishop of Richmond, Virginia. When after a couple of years, differences regarding questions of jurisdiction arose between him and Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal, Archbishop of Baltimore, Kelly was offered the recently vacant See of Waterford and Lismore in his homeland.)\nPro-slavery.\nIn the 1850s, Morse became well known as a defender of slavery, considering it to be sanctioned by God. In his treatise \"An Argument on the Ethical Position of Slavery,\" he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My creed on the subject of slavery is short. Slavery \"per se\" is not sin. It is a social condition ordained from the beginning of the world for the wisest purposes, benevolent and disciplinary, by Divine Wisdom. The mere holding of slaves, therefore, is a condition having \"per se\" nothing of moral character in it, any more than the being a parent, or employer, or ruler.\nLater years.\nLitigation over telegraph patent.\nIn the United States, Morse held his telegraph patent for many years, but it was both ignored and contested. In 1853, \"The Telegraph Patent case \u2013 O'Reilly v. Morse\" came before the U.S. Supreme Court where, after very lengthy investigation, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled that Morse had been the first to combine the battery, electromagnetism, the electromagnet, and the correct battery configuration into a workable practical telegraph. However, in spite of this clear ruling, Morse still received no official recognition from the United States government.\nThe Supreme Court did not accept all of Morse's claims. The \"O'Reilly v. Morse\" case has become widely known among patent lawyers because the Supreme Court explicitly denied Morse's claim 8 for any and all use of the electromagnetic force for purposes of transmitting intelligible signals to any distance.\nThe Supreme Court sustained, however, Morse's claim to such telecommunication when effectuated by means of Morse's inventive \"repeater\" apparatus. This was an electrical circuit in which a cascade of many sets comprising a relay and a battery were connected in series, so that when each relay closed, it closed a circuit to cause the next battery to power the succeeding relay, as suggested in the accompanying figure. This caused Morse's signal to pass along the cascade without degrading into noise as its amplitude decreased with the distance traveled. (Each time the amplitude of the signal approaches the noise level, the repeater [in effect, a nonlinear amplifier] boosts the signal amplitude well above the noise level.) This use of \"repeaters\" permitted a message to be sent to great distances, which was previously not feasible.\nThe Supreme Court thus held that Morse could properly claim a patent monopoly on the system or process of transmitting signals at any distance by means of the repeater circuitry indicated above, but he could not properly claim a monopoly over any and all uses of electromagnetic force to transmit signals. The apparatus limitation in the former type of claim limited the patent monopoly to what Morse taught and gave the world. The lack of that limitation in the latter type of claim (i.e., claim 8) both gave Morse more than was commensurate with what he had contributed to society and discouraged the inventive efforts of others who might come up with different and/or better ways to send signals at a distance using the electromagnetic force.\nThe problem that Morse faced (the deterioration of the signal with distance) and how he solved it is discussed in more detail in the article \"O'Reilly v. Morse\". In summary, the solution, as the Supreme Court stated, was the repeater apparatus described in the preceding paragraphs.\nThe importance of this legal precedent in patent law cannot be overstated, as it became the foundation of the law governing the eligibility of computer program-implemented inventions (as well as inventions implementing natural laws) to be granted patents.\nForeign recognition.\nAssisted by the American ambassador in Paris, the governments of Europe were approached about their long neglect of Morse while their countries were using his invention. There was a widespread recognition that something must be done, and in 1858 Morse was awarded the sum of 400,000 French francs (equivalent to about $80,000 at the time) by the governments of France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Piedmont, Russia, Sweden, Tuscany, and the Ottoman Empire, each of which contributed a share according to the number of Morse instruments in use in each country. In 1858, he was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nTransatlantic cable.\nMorse lent his support to Cyrus West Field's ambitious plan to construct the first transoceanic telegraph line. Morse had experimented with underwater telegraph circuits since 1842. He invested $10,000 in Field's Atlantic Telegraph Company, took a seat on its board of directors, and was appointed honorary \"Electrician\". In 1856, Morse traveled to London to help Charles Tilston Bright and Edward Whitehouse test a 2,000-mile-length of spooled cable.\nAfter the first two cable-laying attempts failed, Field reorganized the project, removing Morse from direct involvement. Though the cable broke three times during the third attempt, it was successfully repaired, and the first transatlantic telegraph messages were sent in 1858. The cable failed after just three months of use. Though Field had to wait out the Civil War, the cable laid in 1866 proved more durable, and the era of reliable transatlantic telegraph service had begun.\nIn addition to the telegraph, Morse invented a marble-cutting machine that could carve three-dimensional sculptures in marble or stone. He could not patent it, however, because of an existing 1820 Thomas Blanchard design.\nLast years and death.\nSamuel Morse gave large sums to charity. He also became interested in the relationship of science and religion and provided the funds to establish a lectureship on \"the relation of the Bible to the Sciences\". Though he was rarely awarded any royalties for the later uses and implementations of his inventions, he was able to live comfortably.\nMorsemere in Ridgefield, New Jersey, takes its name from Morse, who had bought property there to build a home, but died before its completion.\nHe died of pneumonia in New York City on April 2, 1872, and was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. By the time of his death, his estate was valued at some $500,000 ($ today).\nIn his will he provided an award medal that is presented annually by New York University to one undergraduate student who shows special ability in physics.\nHonors and awards.\nMorse was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.\nDespite honors and financial awards received from foreign countries, there was no such recognition in the U.S. until he neared the end of his life when on June 10, 1871, a bronze statue of Samuel Morse was unveiled in Central Park, New York City. An engraved portrait of Morse appeared on the reverse side of the United States two-dollar bill silver certificate series of 1896. He was depicted along with Robert Fulton. An example can be seen on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's website in their \"American Currency Exhibit\":\nA blue plaque was erected to commemorate him at 141 Cleveland Street, London, where he lived from 1812 to 1815.\nIn 1848, Morse was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.\nAccording to his \"The New York Times\" obituary published on April 3, 1872, Morse received respectively the decoration of the Atiq Nishan-i-Iftikhar (English: Order of Glory) [first medal on wearer's right depicted in photo of Morse with medals], set in diamonds, from Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid of Turkey (c.1847), a \"golden snuff box containing the Prussian gold medal for scientific merit\" from the King of Prussia (1851); the \"Great Gold Medal of Arts and Sciences\" from the King of W\u00fcrttemberg (1852); and the \"Great Golden Medal of Science and Arts\" from Emperor of Austria (1855); a cross of Chevalier in the L\u00e9gion d'honneur from the Emperor of France; the \"Cross of a Knight\" of the Order of the Dannebrog from the King of Denmark (1856); the Cross of Knight Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, from the Queen of Spain, besides being elected member of innumerable scientific and art societies in this [United States] and other countries. Other awards include Order of the Tower and Sword from the kingdom of Portugal (1860), and Italy conferred on him the insignia of chevalier of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus in 1864. Morse's telegraph was recognized as an IEEE Milestone in 1988.\nIn 1975, Morse was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\nOn April 1, 2012, Google announced the release of \"Gmail Tap\", an April Fools' Day joke that allowed users to use Morse Code to send text from their mobile phones. Morse's great-great-grandnephew Reed Morse\u2014a Google engineer\u2014was instrumental in the prank, which became a real product.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\nAttribution"}

Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.\nThe word \"ship\" has meant, depending on era and context, either simply a large vessel or specifically a full-rigged ship with three or more masts, each of which is square rigged.\nThe earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BC. In 2024, ships had a global cargo capacity of 2.4 billion tons, with the three largest classes being ships carrying dry bulk (43%), oil tankers (28%) and container ships (14%).\nNomenclature.\nShips are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not \"vice versa\". A ship is likely to have a full-time crew assigned. A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the \"outside\" of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the \"inside\" because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy. American and British 19th century maritime law distinguished \"vessels\" from other watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.\nStarting around the middle of the 18th century, sailing vessels started to be categorised by their type of rig. (Previously they were described by their hull type\u00a0\u2013 for example pink, cat.) Alongside the other rig types such as schooner and brig, the term \"ship\" referred to the rig type. In this sense, a ship is a vessel with three or more masts, all of which are square-rigged. For clarity, this may be referred to as a full-rigged ship or a vessel may be described as \"ship-rigged\". Alongside this rig-specific usage, \"ship\" continued to have the more general meaning of a large sea-going vessel. Often the meaning can only be determined by the context.\nSome large vessels are traditionally called \"boats\", notably submarines. Others include Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats, which may be designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.\nIn most maritime traditions ships have individual names, and modern ships may belong to a ship class often named after its first ship.\nIn many documents the ship name is introduced with a ship prefix being an abbreviation of the ship class, for example \"MS\" (motor ship) or \"SV\" (sailing vessel), making it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual names in a text.\n\"Ship\" (along with \"nation\") is an English word that has retained a female grammatical gender in some usages, which allows it sometimes to be referred to as a \"she\" without being of female natural gender. The Imperial War Museum stated that this may have originated from \"far more ancient traditions\" which included using a female grammatical gender for ships, and that there is a tradition that \"relates to the idea of a female figure such as a mother or goddess guiding and protecting a ship and crew.\" By 2019, the \"Lloyd's Register of Shipping\" switched to referring to ships as \"it\".\nHistory.\nFor most of history, transport by ship\u00a0\u2013 provided there is a feasible route\u00a0\u2013 has generally been cheaper, safer and faster than making the same journey on land. Only the coming of railways in the middle of the 19th century and the growth of commercial aviation in the second half of the 20th century have changed this principle. This applied equally to sea crossings, coastal voyages and use of rivers and lakes.\nExamples of the consequences of this include the large grain trade in the Mediterranean during the classical period. Cities such as Rome were totally reliant on the delivery by sailing and human powered (oars) ships of the large amounts of grain needed. It has been estimated that it cost less for a sailing ship of the Roman Empire to carry grain the length of the Mediterranean than to move the same amount 15 miles by road. Rome consumed about 150,000 tons of Egyptian grain each year over the first three centuries AD.\nUntil recently, it was generally the case that ships were the most advanced representations of the technology available to the societies that produced them.1\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nAsian developments.\nThe earliest attestations of ships in maritime transport in Mesopotamia are model ships, which date back to the 4th millennium BC. In archaic texts in Uruk, Sumer, the ideogram for \"ship\" is attested, but in the inscriptions of the kings of Lagash, ships were first mentioned in connection to maritime trade and naval warfare at around 2500\u20132350 BC.\nAustronesian peoples originated in what is now Taiwan. From here, they took part in the Austronesian Expansion. Their distinctive maritime technology was integral to this movement and included catamarans and outriggers. It has been suggested that they had sails some time before 2000 BC. Their crab claw sails enabled them to sail for vast distances in open ocean. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.\nAustronesian sails were made from woven leaves, usually from pandan plants. These were complemented by paddlers, who usually positioned themselves on platforms on the outriggers in the larger boats. Austronesian ships ranged in complexity from simple dugout canoes with outriggers or lashed together to large edge-pegged plank-built boats built around a keel made from a dugout canoe. Their designs were unique, evolving from ancient rafts to the characteristic double-hulled, single-outrigger, and double-outrigger designs of Austronesian ships.\nIn the 2nd century AD, people from the Indonesian archipelago already made large ships measuring over 50 m long and standing 4\u20137 m out of the water. They could carry 600\u20131000 people and 250\u20131000 ton cargo. These ships were known as \"kunlun bo\" or \"k'unlun po\" (\u5d11\u5d19\u8236, lit. \"ship of the Kunlun people\") by the Chinese, and \"kolandiaphonta\" by the Greeks. They had 4\u20137 masts and were able to sail against the wind due to the usage of tanja sails. These ships may have reached as far as Ghana. In the 11th century, a new type of ship called djong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali. This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and treenails, unlike the \"kunlun bo\" which used vegetal fibres for lashings.\nIn China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c.\u00a0475\u2013221 BC). By the Han dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. Centre-line rudders, mounted at the stern, started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, these early Chinese ships were fluvial (riverine), and were not seaworthy. The Chinese only acquired sea-going ship technologies in the 10th-century AD Song dynasty after contact with Southeast Asian \"k'un-lun po\" trading ships, leading to the development of the junks.\nMediterranean developments.\nThe earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BC The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians: \"During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries BC, the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country.\"\nThe ancient Egyptians were perfectly at ease building sailboats. A remarkable example of their shipbuilding skills was the Khufu ship, a vessel in length entombed at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2500 BC and found intact in 1954.\nThe oldest discovered sea faring hulled boat is the Late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey, dating back to 1300 BC.\nBy 1200 BC, the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. In world maritime history, declares Richard Woodman, they are recognized as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the architects of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\"\nMedieval and early modern periods.\nAsian developments.\nDuring the 15th century, China's Ming dynasty assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the diplomatic and power projection voyages of Zheng He. Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the world's first iron-clads, \"Tekk\u014dsen\" (), literally meaning \"iron ships\", was also developed. In Japan, during the Sengoku era from the 15th century to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the atakebune. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the Joseon era, \"Geobukseon\"(\uac70\ubd81\uc120), was developed.\nThe empire of Majapahit used large ships called jong, built in northern Java, for transporting troops overseas. The jongs were transport ships which could carry 100\u20132000 tons of cargo and 50\u20131000 people, 28.99\u201388.56 meter in length. The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350.\nEuropean developments.\nUntil the late 13th or early 14th century, European shipbuilding had two separate traditions. In Northern Europe clinker construction predominated. In this, the hull planks are fastened together in an overlapping manner. This is a \"shell first\" construction technique, with the hull shape being defined by the shaping and fitting of the hull planks. The reinforcing s (or ribs) are fitted after the planks.65\u201366 Clinker construction in this era usually used planks that were cleft (split radially from the log) and could be made thinner and stronger per unit of thickness than the sawn logs, thanks to preserving the radial integrity of the grain. \nAn exception to clinker construction in the Northern European tradition is the bottom planking of the cog. Here, the hull planks are not joined to each other and are laid flush (not overlapped). They are held together by fastening to the frames but this is done after the shaping and fitting of these planks. Therefore, this is another case of a \"shell first\" construction technique.65\u201366\nThese Northern European ships were rigged with a single mast setting a square sail. They were steered by rudders hung on the .\nIn contrast, the ship-building tradition of the Mediterranean was of carvel construction\u00a0\u2013 the fitting of the hull planking to the frames of the hull. Depending on the precise detail of this method, it may be characterised as either \"frame first\" or \"frame-led\". In either variant, during construction, the hull shape is determined by the frames, not the planking. The hull planks are not fastened to each other, only to the frames.69\nThese Mediterranean ships were rigged with lateen sails on one or more masts (depending on the size of the vessel) and were steered with a side rudder. They are often referred to as \"round ships\".68-69\nCrucially, the Mediterranean and Northern European traditions merged. Cogs are known to have travelled to the Mediterranean in the 12th and 13th centuries. Some aspects of their designs were being copied by Mediterranean ship-builders early in the 14th century. Iconography shows square sails being used on the mainmast but a lateen on the mizzen, and a sternpost hung rudder replacing the side rudder. The name for this type of vessel was \"coche\" or, for a larger example, \"carrack\". Some of these new Mediterranean types travelled to Northern European waters and, in the first two decades of the 15th century, a few were captured by the English, two of which had previously been under charter to the French. The two-masted rig started to be copied immediately, but at this stage on a clinker hull. The adoption of carvel hulls had to wait until sufficient shipwrights with appropriate skills could be hired, but by late in the 1430s, there were instances of carvel ships being built in Northern Europe, and in increasing numbers over the rest of the century.69-72\nThis hybridisation of Mediterranean and Northern European ship types created the full-rigged ship, a three-masted vessel with a square-rigged foremast and mainmast and a lateen sail on the mizzen. This provided most of the ships used in the Age of Discovery, being able to carry sufficient stores for a long voyage and with a rig suited to the open ocean. Over the next four hundred years, steady evolution and development, from the starting point of the carrack, gave types such as the galleon, fluit, East Indiaman, ordinary cargo ships, warships, clippers and many more, all based on this three-masted square-rigged type.29, \"passim\"\nThe transition from clinker to carvel construction facilitated the use of artillery at sea since the internal framing of the hull could be made strong enough to accommodate the weight of guns. It was easier to fit gunports in a carvel hull. As vessels became larger and the demand for ship-building timber affected the size of trees available, clinker construction became limited by the difficulty of finding large enough logs from which to cleave planks. Nonetheless, some clinker vessels approached the size of contemporary carracks. Before the adoption of carvel construction, the increasing size of clinker-built vessels necessitated greater amounts of internal framing of their hulls for strength\u00a0\u2013 something that somewhat lessened the conceptual change to the new technique.\n19th and 20th centuries.\nParallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.\nMaritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, the French Navy began to develop a new type of vessel known as a ship of the line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers. During the 19th century the Royal Navy enforced a ban on the slave trade, acted to suppress piracy, and continued to map the world. Ships and their owners grew with the 19th century Industrial Revolution across Europe and North America, leading to increased numbers of oceangoing ships, as well as other coastal and canal based vessels.\nThrough more than half of the 19th century and into the early years of the 20th century, steam ships coexisted with sailing vessels. Initially, steam was only viable on shorter routes, typically transporting passengers who could afford higher fares, and mail. Steam went through many developmental steps that gave greater fuel efficiency, thereby increasingly making steamships commercially competitive with sail. Screw propulsion worked better than paddle wheels, but relied, among other things, on the invention of an effective stern gland for the propeller shaft. Higher boiler pressures of powering compound engines, were introduced in 1865, making long-distance steam cargo vessels commercially viable on the route from England to China\u00a0\u2013 even before the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Within a few years, steam had replaced many of the sailing ships that had served this route. Even greater fuel efficiency was obtained with triple-expansion steam engines\u00a0\u2013 but this had to wait for higher quality steel to be available to make boilers running at in SS Aberdeen (1881). By this point virtually all routes could be served competitively by steamships. Sail continued with some cargoes, where low costs were more important to the shipper than a predictable and rapid journey time.\nThe Second Industrial Revolution in particular led to new mechanical methods of propulsion, and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. These led to the development of long-distance commercial ships and Ocean liners, as well as technological changes including the Marine steam engine, screw propellers, triple expansion engines and others. Factors included the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created more specialized ships and other maritime vessels. Ship types built for entirely new functions that appeared by the 20th century included research ships, offshore support vessels (OSVs), Floating production storage and offloading (FPSOs), Pipe and cable laying ships, drill ships and Survey vessels.\nThe late 20th century saw changes to ships that included the decline of ocean liners as air travel increased. The rise of container ships from the 1960s onwards dramatically changed the nature of commercial merchant shipping, as containerization led to larger ship sizes, dedicated container routes and the decline of general cargo vessels as well as tramp steaming. The late 20th century also saw a rise in cruise ships for tourism around the world.\n21st century.\nIn 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion deadweight tons. Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. By 2019, the world's fleet included 51,684 commercial vessels with gross tonnage of more than 1,000 tons, totaling 1.96\u00a0billion tons. Such ships carried 11\u00a0billion tons of cargo in 2018, a sum that grew by 2.7% over the previous year. In terms of tonnage, 29% of ships were tankers, 43% are bulk carriers, 13% container ships and 15% were other types.\nIn 2008, there were 1,240 warships operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as patrol boats. The United States accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, Russia 1.35 million tons, the United Kingdom 504,660 tons and China 402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two world wars, the Cold War, and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The world's major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands and the United States in Iraq.\nThe size of the world's fishing fleet is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion. Fishing vessels can be found in most seaside villages in the world. As of 2004, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated 4\u00a0million fishing vessels were operating worldwide. The same study estimated that the world's 29\u00a0million fishermen caught of fish and shellfish that year.\nIn 2023, the number of ships globally grew by 3.4%. In 2024, new ships are increasingly being built with alternative fuel capability to increase sustainability and reduce carbon emissions. Alternative ship fuels include LNG, LPG, methanol, biofuel, ammonia and hydrogen among others.\nAs of 2024, wind power for ships had received renewed interest for its potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\nTypes of ships.\nBecause ships are constructed using the principles of naval architecture that require same structural components, their classification is based on their function such as that suggested by Paulet and Presles, which requires modification of the components. The categories accepted in general by naval architects are:\nSome of these are discussed in the following sections.\nInland vessels.\nFreshwater shipping may occur on lakes, rivers and canals. Ships designed for those body of waters may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the Danube, Mississippi, Rhine, Yangtze and Amazon Rivers, and the Great Lakes.\nGreat Lakes.\nLake freighters, also called lakers, are cargo vessels that ply the Great Lakes. The most well-known is , the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called \"salties\". Because of their additional beam, very large salties are never seen inland of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Because the smallest of the Soo Locks is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, \"topping off\" when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the Welland Canal that bypasses the Niagara River.\nSince the freshwater lakes are less corrosive to ships than the salt water of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50\u00a0years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20\u00a0years of age.\n, built in 1906 as \"William P Snyder\", was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, \"E.M. Ford\", built in 1898 as \"Presque Isle\", was sailing the lakes 98\u00a0years later in 1996. As of 2007 \"E.M. Ford\" was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw, Michigan.\nMerchant ship.\nMerchant ships are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing vessels, cargo ships, passenger ships, and special-purpose ships. The UNCTAD review of maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and \"other ships\", which includes \"liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo\". General cargo ships include \"multi-purpose and project vessels and roll-on/roll-off cargo\".\nModern commercial vessels are typically powered by a single propeller driven by a diesel or, less usually, gas turbine engine., but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use pump-jet engines. Most commercial vessels such as container ships, have full hull-forms (higher Block coefficients) to maximize cargo capacity. Merchant ships and fishing vessels are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass or wood on smaller vessels. Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a sea captain, with deck officers and engine officers on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard research vessels.\nFishing boats are generally small, often little more than but up to for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at . That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.\nCargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general cargo ship in break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as oil tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and gas carriers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.\nPassenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large cruise ships. This type of vessel includes ferries, which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; ocean liners, which carry passengers from one place to another; and cruise ships, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. Riverboats and inland ferries are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.\nFishing vessels are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world's fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels. Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars. More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.\nSpecial purpose vessels.\nA weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in marine weather forecasting. Surface weather observations were taken hourly, and four radiosonde releases occurred daily. It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights. Proposed as early as 1927 by the aviation community, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by the United States. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine.\nThe weather ship crews were normally at sea for three weeks at a time, returning to port for 10-day stretches. Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like other ships tended to for safety reasons. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987. Beginning in the 1970s, their role became largely superseded by weather buoys due to the ships' significant cost. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1990. The last weather ship was \"Polarfront\", known as weather station M (\"Mike\"), which was put out of operation on 1 January 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.\nNaval vessels.\nNaval ships are diverse in types of vessel. They include: surface warships, submarines, and auxiliary ships.\nModern warships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines and amphibious warfare ships. The distinctions among cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes are not codified; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies. Battleships were used during the Second World War and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of carrier-borne aircraft and guided missiles.\nMost military submarines are either attack submarines or ballistic missile submarines. Until the end of World War II the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of submarine-launched nuclear and cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster munitions to nuclear weapons.\nMost navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as minesweepers, patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, replenishment ships, and hospital ships which are designated medical treatment facilities.\nFast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability. They also usually have advanced marine electronics and communication systems, as well as weapons.\nArchitecture.\nSome components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it's a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.\nHull.\nFor a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship's hull. There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of America's Cup sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of catamarans, or three in the case of trimarans. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.\nHulls have several elements. The bow is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a ship's rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.\nHulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.\nOlder ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and composite materials are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with concrete hulls.\nPropulsion systems.\nPropulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, which was used even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and wingsails have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\nMechanical propulsion systems generally consist of a motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, an impeller or wave propulsion fins. Steam engines were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by two-stroke or four-stroke diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, and there have been attempts to use them to power commercial vessels (see NS \"Savannah\").\nIn addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with transverse thrusters for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a diesel\u2013electric powertrain in which the propeller is turned by an electric motor powered by the ship's generators.\nAs environmental sustainability becomes a paramount concern, the maritime industry is exploring cleaner propulsion technologies. Alternatives like LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), ammonia, and hydrogen are emerging as viable options. LPG is already utilized as fuel for long-distance shipping, offering a cleaner option with a lower carbon footprint. Meanwhile, hydrogen and ammonia technologies are in development stages for long-haul applications, promising even more significant reductions in emissions and a step closer to achieving carbon-neutral shipping.\nSteering systems.\nFor ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some paddles, steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a tiller, manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. Ducted propellers are sometimes used for steering.\nSome propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the outboard motor, the bow thruster, and the azimuth thruster.\nHolds, compartments, and the superstructure.\nLarger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate berthings and heads are found on sailboats over about . Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a galley, and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship's trim and modify its stability.\nSuperstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship's stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.\nEquipment.\nShipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship's era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:\nDesign considerations.\nHydrostatics.\nShips float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, so that the downwards force of gravity equals the upward force of buoyancy. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel's mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its beam (width). A vessel's stability is considered in both this hydrostatic sense as well as a hydrodynamic sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.\nHydrodynamics.\nThe advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and wave making resistance. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. Antifouling paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the bulbous bow assist in decreasing wave resistance.\nA simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude. Since the water is not able to \"get out of the way of the hull fast enough\", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.\nThis hull speed is found by the formula:\nor, in metric units:\nwhere \"L\" is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.\nWhen the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its bow wave, and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.\nFor large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of computational fluid dynamics.\nVessels are also subject to ocean surface waves and sea swell as well as effects of wind and weather. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as fin stabilizers. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.\nLifecycle.\nA ship will pass through several stages during its career. The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the shipowners, operators, designers and the shipyard. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from shipwrecks to service as a museum ship to the scrapyard.\nDesign.\nA vessel's design starts with a specification, which a naval architect uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship's propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship's design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.\nThe designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.\nAs environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be disassembled or disposed easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.\nConstruction.\nShip construction takes place in a shipyard, and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate \"Hermione\", to more than 10\u00a0years for an aircraft carrier. During World War II, the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for Liberty Ships went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.\nHull materials and vessel size play a large part in determining the method of construction. The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.\nGenerally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about , by the laying of the keel. This is done in a drydock or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.\nOnce completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. Ship launching is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a Vend\u00e9e Globe class sailboat. A trawler may cost $2.5\u00a0million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50\u00a0million. A ship's cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, general cargo ship will cost $20\u00a0million, a Panamax-sized bulk carrier around $35\u00a0million, a supertanker around $105\u00a0million and a large LNG carrier nearly $200\u00a0million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a costs around $2\u00a0billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5\u00a0billion.\nIn 2023, the majority of the world's ships (95% of global output) were built in just three countries: China, South Korea and Japan.\nRepair and conversion.\nShips undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.\nMost ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a drydock at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, sandblasting and repainting the hull, and replacing sacrificial anodes used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.\nSome vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: oil tankers are often converted into floating production storage and offloading units.\nEnd of service.\nMost ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30\u00a0years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40\u00a0years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100\u00a0years.\nAs ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be scuttled at sea or scrapped by shipbreakers. Ships can also be used as museum ships, or expended to construct breakwaters or artificial reefs.\nMany ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, grounding, or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during World War II.\nMeasuring ships.\nOne can measure ships in terms of length overall, length between perpendiculars, length of the ship at the waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), draft (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and tonnage. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.\nIn Britain until Samuel Plimsoll's Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in jail. Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some engineers to derive a fairly simple formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship's hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the \"Plimsoll mark\", \"freeboard mark\" or \"load line mark\", exists on ships' sides, and consists of a circle with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the \"ladder\" of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. These are called the \"load lines\" in the marine industry.\nShip pollution.\nShip pollution is the pollution of air and water by shipping. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world's oceans and waterways as globalization continues. It is expected that \"shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\" Because of increased traffic in ocean ports, pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects biodiversity, climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30\u00a0years.\nOil spills.\nOil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.\nBy the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry of crude oil, or . This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known \"Exxon Valdez\" incident. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000 seabirds, about 1,000 sea otters, and immense numbers of fish were killed.\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974. According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7\u00a0tons per spill. Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700\u00a0tons.\nFollowing the \"Exxon Valdez\" spill, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be double-hulled by 2015. Following the sinkings of \"Erika\" (1999) and \"Prestige\" (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of \"serious negligence\".\nBallast water.\nWhen a large vessel such as a container ship or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.\nOne of the problems with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless planktonic organism . \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\", a species of comb jelly that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Vald\u00e9s peninsula in Argentina along the Atlantic coast, has caused notable damage in the Black Sea. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the comb jelly shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. \"The anchovy catch fell from in 1984 to in 1993; sprat from in 1984 to in 1993; horse mackerel from in 1984 to zero in 1993.\" Now that the comb jellies have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem. Recently the comb jellies have been discovered in the Caspian Sea. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. \"On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137\u00a0billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.\"\nBallast and bilge discharge from ships can also spread human pathogens and other harmful diseases and toxins potentially causing health issues for humans and marine life alike. Discharges into coastal waters, along with other sources of marine pollution, have the potential to be toxic to marine plants, animals, and microorganisms, causing alterations such as changes in growth, disruption of hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression of the immune system, and disorders resulting in cancer, tumors, and genetic abnormalities or even death.\nExhaust emissions.\nExhaust emissions from ships are considered to be a significant source of air pollution. \"Seagoing vessels are responsible for an estimated 14 percent of emissions of nitrogen from fossil fuels and 16 percent of the emissions of sulfur from petroleum uses into the atmosphere.\" In Europe ships make up a large percentage of the sulfur introduced to the air, \"as much sulfur as all the cars, lorries and factories in Europe put together\". \"By 2010, up to 40% of air pollution over land could come from ships.\" Sulfur in the air creates acid rain which damages crops and buildings. When inhaled, sulfur is known to cause respiratory problems and increase the risk of a heart attack.\nShip breaking.\nShip breaking or ship demolition is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for scrap recycling, with the hulls being discarded in ship graveyards. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.\nIn addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in developed countries. Asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers' health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.\nAside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major environmental concern. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no environmental law, enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nModel ships\nLists\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShip sizes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27009", "revid": "50529511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27009", "title": "Soap opera", "text": "Radio or TV serial\nA soap opera (also called a daytime drama or soap) is a genre of a long-running radio or television serial, frequently characterized by melodrama, ensemble casts, and sentimentality. The term \"soap opera\" originated from radio dramas' original sponsorship by soap manufacturers. The term was preceded by \"horse opera\", a derogatory term for low-budget Westerns. Some authorities exclude short-running serial dramas from their definition.\nBBC Radio's \"The Archers\", first broadcast in 1950, is the world's longest-running soap opera. The longest-running television soap opera is \"Coronation Street\", which was first broadcast on ITV in 1960.\nAccording to Albert Moran, one of the defining features that make a television program a soap opera is \"that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode\". In 2012, \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas: {\nSoap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independently of each other. Episodes may feature some of the show's storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors, so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas seldom conclude all their storylines at the same time. When one story thread ends, there are several others at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, as does the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons), the tension only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.\nEvening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode and present all storylines. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.\nIn 1976, \"Time\" magazine described American daytime television as \"TV's richest market\", noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts to maximise advertising revenues. At that time, many prime time series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs. The issue's cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of \"Days of Our Lives\", a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large.\nOrigin and history of the genre.\nThe first program generally considered to be a \"soap opera\" or daytime serial by scholars of the genre is \"Painted Dreams,\" written by and starring Irna Phillips, which premiered on WGN radio Chicago, on October 20, 1930. It was regularly broadcast in a daytime time slot, where most listeners would be housewives; thus, the shows were aimed at \u2013 and consumed by \u2013 a predominantly female audience. \"Clara, Lu, 'n Em\" would become the first \"network\" radio serial of the type when it aired on the NBC Blue Network at 10:30\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931. Although it did not make the move until February 15, 1932, \"Clara, Lu 'n Em\" would become the first network serial of the type to move to a weekday daily timeslot; as such, it also became the first network daytime serial.\nPlots and storylines.\nThe main characteristics that define soap operas are \"an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations\". Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. \"Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.'\" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from \"EastEnders\" to \"Dallas\".\nIn many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the United States, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations and are frequently set in working-class environments. Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both British and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from American soap operas where such comedy is rare. British soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting \"reality\" or purport to have a \"realistic\" style. British soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, \"EastEnders\" focuses on the tough and grim life in the East End of London; \"Coronation Street\" and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of \"northern straight talking\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf we want to blend an actor back into a show, there's always a way. You can generally find a way to twist and manipulate something. You rarely see a dead body, but hey, even if you do, he or she can always come back to play the evil identical twin.\n Marlena Laird in 1992, during her time as a line producer and director for \"General Hospital\".\nRomance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In American daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story. Crimes such as kidnapping, assault (sometimes sexual), and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.\nAustralian and British soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the \"romantic quality\" of criminal and/or oligarch life.\nIn soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.\nAs in comic books \u2013 another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the United States during the 20th century \u2013 a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent. On \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral. Once Tylo reprised her character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.\nStunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off-screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict without complex movements, multiple takes, and post-production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post-production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post-production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.\nUnited States.\nDaytime serials on television.\nThe first daytime TV soap opera in the United States was \"These Are My Children\" in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by game shows, sitcom reruns and talk shows.\nIn 1988, H. Wesley Kenney, who at the time served as the executive producer of \"General Hospital\", said to \"The New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think people like stories that continue so they can relate to these people. They become like a family, and the viewer becomes emotionally involved. There seem to be two attitudes by viewers. One, that the stories are similar to what happened to them in real life, or two, thank goodness that isn't me.\u2014\u200a\nMany long-running American soap operas established particular environments for their stories. \"The Doctors\" and \"General Hospital\", in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. \"As the World Turns\" dealt heavily with Chris Hughes' law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who, tired of being \"the loyal housewife\" in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. \"Guiding Light\" dealt with Bert Bauer (Charita Bauer) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert's status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children's marital troubles were showcased. \"Search for Tomorrow\" mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner (Mary Stuart). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. \"Days of Our Lives\" initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. \"The Edge of Night\" featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. \"The Young and the Restless\" first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working-class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty, and infidelity.\nIn contrast, \"Dark Shadows\" (1966\u20131971), \"Port Charles\" (1997\u20132003) and \"Passions\" (1999\u20132008) featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins, and angels.\nThe American soap opera \"Guiding Light\" (originally titled \"The Guiding Light\" until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently began transitioning to television in June 1952; the television and radio editions of the serial continued to broadcast concurrently until the latter version ended production in 1956. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator Irna Phillips was involved in a dispute with Procter &amp; Gamble, \"Guiding Light\" was heard or seen nearly every weekday from 1937 to 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.\nOriginally, serials were broadcast as 15-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Edge of Night\", both produced by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions, debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (\"Another World\" even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time from 1979 to 1980). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2025, four of the five American serials air one-hour episodes each weekday; only \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" airs 30-minute episodes.\nSoap operas were broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time from New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theater during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as \"General Hospital\", \"Days of Our Lives\", and \"The Young and the Restless\" were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Edge of Night\" were the last to make the switch, in 1975.\n\"Port Charles\" used the practice of running 13-week \"story arcs,\" in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of \"Soap Opera Digest\", it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs, but this was rejected.\nThough American daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled or because of last-minute deferrals of scheduled episodes to the following day because of breaking news coverage. (Temporary production stoppages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic similarly resulted in CBS and ABC airing older reruns of \"The Young and the Restless\", \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" and \"General Hospital\" during the Spring and Summer of 2020 in order to ration first-run episodes and, eventually, to fill airtime after the programs ran out of new episodes to broadcast; \"Days of Our Lives\", which produces its episodes roughly eight months ahead of their initial broadcast, did not resort to airing older episodes during this time as it had a larger first-run episode backlog.) Early episodes of \"Dark Shadows\" were rerun on PBS member stations in the early 1970s after the show's cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s. After \"The Edge of Night\"'s 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show's final five years were shown late nights on USA Network from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a digital cable and satellite network dedicated to the genre, Soapnet, began re-airing soaps that aired on ABC, NBC and CBS.\nNewer broadcast networks launched since the late 1980s (such as Fox) and cable television networks have largely eschewed offering soap operas on their daytime schedules, instead running syndicated programming and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although DirecTV's The 101 Network took over existing serial \"Passions\", continuing production for one season; while TBS and CBN Cable Network respectively aired their own soap operas, \"The Catlins\" (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and \"Another Life\" (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the fourth \"major network\", carried a short-lived daytime soap \"Tribes\" in 1990. Yet, other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their ascension to major-network status in 1994 (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps from 2006 to 2007, which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV, but the experiment was largely a failure after disappointing ratings).\nDue to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, \"Dark Shadows\", which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).\n\"See List of longest-serving soap opera actors\"\nPerformers.\nSoap opera performers in the United States are typically divided into two main groups: primary characters (sometimes referred to as \"contract players\" \u2013 as their portrayers signed contracts of employment \u2013 or leading characters) and secondary characters (sometimes referred to as recurring characters). These two groups of characters make up the vast majority of the people who appear on any given soap. There are also characters who appear only for a short time as dictated by a specific storyline, and even characters who may only get a first name and no fleshed-out character history with little dialogue (these are sometimes referred to as \"under-5s\" since they receive under five lines of dialogue in each episode).\nDue to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on \"The Edge of Night\" was played by three actors.\nConversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap \"As the World Turns\" from its April 2, 1956, debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for 20 years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both \"General Hospital\" and \"Port Charles\" from 1964 until 2007 and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane in \"All My Children\" from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on \"One Life to Live\" from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012, and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.\nOther actors have played several characters on different shows. Millette Alexander, Bernard Barrow, Doris Belack, David Canary, Judith Chapman, Keith Charles, Jordan Charney, Joan Copeland, Nicolas Coster, Jacqueline Courtney, Augusta Dabney, Louis Edmonds, Don Hastings, Larry Haines, Vincent Irizarry, Lenore Kasdorf, Teri Keane, Lois Kibbee, John Loprieno, Lori March, Maeve McGuire, Robert Milli, James Mitchell, Lee Patterson, Christopher Pennock, Antony Ponzini, William Prince, Rosemary Prinz, Louise Shaffer, Mary Stuart, Richard Thomas, Diana van der Vlis, Mary K. Wells, Lesley Woods and Michael Zaslow, among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.\nEvolution of the daytime serial.\nFor several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized Midwestern towns.\nSocial issue storylines were typically verboten when soaps were starting, due to heavy network-imposed censorship at that time, but writer and producer Agnes Nixon introduced these storylines slowly but surely, first in 1962 when the matriarch of \"The Guiding Light\", Bert Bauer, developed uterine cancer (as the actress, Charita Bauer, had been diagnosed with the same illness in real life). The storyline encouraged many women to get pap smears and the CBS mailroom in New York City received a then-record amount of fan mail wishing Bauer (both Bert and Charita) well. Nixon would go on to tell many socially relevant storylines on her soaps \"One Life to Live\" and \"All My Children\" in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.\nExterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series \"The Edge of Night\" and \"Dark Shadows\". Unlike many earlier serials that were set in fictional towns, \"The Best of Everything\" and \"Ryan's Hope\" were set in a real-world location, New York City.\nThe first exotic location shoot was made by \"All My Children\", to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the \"All My Children\" shoot. Soap operas \"Another World\" and \"Guiding Light\" both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. \"Search for Tomorrow\" taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.\nDuring the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.\nOne of the most popular couples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on \"General Hospital\". Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura's wedding episode. Luke and Laura's popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.\nWith increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a left-handed boy statue, and helped a princess find her Aztec treasure in Mexico. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location \u2013 frequently in exotic locales.\nDuring the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time. With the resultant budget cuts, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane's drug addiction on \"All My Children\", the re-emergence of Viki Lord's dissociative identity disorder on \"One Life to Live\", and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on \"All My Children\". Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion and racism.\nSeveral shows during the 1990s and 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines in an attempt to boost their ratings. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera \"Dark Shadows\" was Barnabas Collins, a vampire, and \"One Life to Live\" featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past. In 1995, \"Days of our Lives\" featured a storyline in which fan favorite character Marlena Evans was possessed by the devil (which was revisited in 2021 with the devil possessing several of her relatives as well), and in 1998, \"Guiding Light\" featured a cloning storyline involving legacy character Reva Shayne.\nTraditional grammar of daytime serials.\nModern American daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by American daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, British and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in between American daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to American daytime soap operas, British and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. British and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to American evening soap operas in this regard.\nAmerican daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:\nDecline.\nStatistics and trends.\nSoap opera ratings have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. Experts believe that this is due to their failure to attract younger demographics, the tendency of modern audiences to have shorter attention spans, and the rise of reality television in the 1990s. Nevertheless, Internet streaming services do offer materials in the serial format, a legacy of soap operas. However, the availability of such on-demand platforms saw to it that soap operas would never again be the cultural phenomenon they were in the twentieth century, especially among the younger generations, not least because cliffhangers could no longer capture the imagination of the viewers the way they did in the past, when television shows were available as scheduled, not on demand.\nFrom September 2013 to February 2025, only four daytime soap operas \u2013 \"General Hospital\", \"Days of Our Lives\", \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" \u2013 were still in production, down from a total of 12 soaps broadcast during the 1990\u201391 season and a high of 19 in the 1969\u201370 season; of those, three aired between two broadcast networks and one on streaming. This period marked the first time since 1953 that there were only four soap operas on the air. \"The Young and the Restless\", the highest-rated soap opera, had fewer than 5\u00a0million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as \"Judge Judy\". Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and most have even ceased publication; \"Soap Opera Digest\", the last remaining weekly print magazine devoted to the genre, switched to a quarterly \"special issue\" publication in October 2023, although it continues to publish daily articles and episode summaries online. Soapnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 for the children's cable channel Disney Jr., and fully ceased operations the following year. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from prime time network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017; the ceremony would eventually return to broadcast television in 2020.\nSeveral of the most established soaps on American television ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, \"Guiding Light\", barely reached 2.1\u00a0million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 72-year run (including radio). \"As the World Turns\" aired its final episode on September 17, 2010, after a 54-year run. Until it ventured back into the genre in 2024, \"As the World Turns\" was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter &amp; Gamble, the soap and consumer goods company from which the genre got its name. \"As the World Turns\" and \"Guiding Light\" were also among the last of the soaps that originated from New York City. \"All My Children\", another New York\u2013based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, both it and \"One Life to Live\", each with a 40-year-plus run, were cancelled in 2011. \"All My Children\" aired its network finale in September 2011, with \"One Life to Live\" following suit in January 2012. Both \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" were briefly revived online in 2013, before being cancelled again amid creative and intellectual property issues between ABC and Prospect Park (the production company that acquired rights for both serials in a sub-licensing deal with ABC parent Disney), ending in September that same year. In 2019, production of \"Days of Our Lives\" was put on \"indefinite hiatus\" and all of the cast's contracts were terminated, raising concerns within soap publications that cancellation would ensue, though the show was later renewed through September 2021. In 2022, NBC announced that \"Days of Our Lives\" would be moved exclusively to its streaming service, Peacock, making NBC the first of the Big Three networks not to air any daytime soap operas.\nIn March 2024, CBS Studios and NAACP Ventures, in partnership with P&amp;G Studios announced that a new soap opera for CBS tentatively titled \"The Gates\", which would be the first soap opera since \"Generations\" to feature a primarily African American cast, was in development. On April 15, 2024, CBS ordered \"The Gates\" (later retitled \"Beyond the Gates\") to series; it premiered on February 24, 2025, taking the timeslot previously occupied by panel talk show \"The Talk\" (the timeslot successor of \"As the World Turns\", which would end its 15-season run on December 20, 2024), making it the first new daytime soap opera to premiere on a major broadcast network since NBC's \"Passions\" in 1999.\nCauses.\nNew generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. As viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group for which soap opera advertisers pay the most. Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the Internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was \"docu-soap\". A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994\u201395 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.\nDaytime programming alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, and court shows cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas, making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a time slot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with \"Sunset Beach\" and \"Port Charles\". Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007\u20132010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes. In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as clich\u00e9d plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.\nThe primetime serial.\nSerials produced for prime-time slots have also found success. The first prime time soap opera was \"Faraway Hill\" (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. \"Faraway Hill\" ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week's episode.\nThe first long-running prime time soap opera was \"Peyton Place\" (1964\u20131969) on ABC. It was based in part on the eponymous 1957 film (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 novel).\nThe popularity of \"Peyton Place\" prompted the CBS network to spin off popular \"As the World Turns\" character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera, \"Our Private World\" (originally titled \"The Woman Lisa\" in its planning stages). \"Our Private World\" was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa (and her portrayer Eileen Fulton) returned to \"As The World Turns\" after the series ended.\nThe structure of \"Peyton Place\", with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the prime time serials of the 1980s, when the format reached its pinnacle.\nThe successful prime time serials of the 1980s included \"Dallas\", its spin-off \"Knots Landing\", \"Dynasty\", and \"Falcon Crest\". These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, promiscuous, and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline, respectively, J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), Abby Cunningham (Donna Mills), Alexis Colby (Joan Collins), and Angela Channing (Jane Wyman). These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences \"loved to hate\".\nUnlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup, and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. \"Dallas\", its spin-off \"Knots Landing\", and \"Falcon Crest\" all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. \"Dynasty\" featured this format throughout its run.\nThe soap opera's distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity were increasingly incorporated into American prime time television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was \"Hill Street Blues\". This series, produced by Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development throughout the series. It and the later \"Cagney &amp; Lacey\" overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters. The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as \"St. Elsewhere\" and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.\nThe prime-time soap operas and drama series of the 1990s and 2000s, such as \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", \"Melrose Place\", \"Party of Five\", \"The O.C.\", and \"Dawson's Creek\", focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the prime time soap opera format with shows such as \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\", \"Ugly Betty\", \"Private Practice\", and more recently \"Revenge\", \"Nashville\", \"Scandal\", \"Mistresses\", and formerly \"Ringer\", which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including \"Heroes\" and \"Friday Night Lights\". The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox Broadcasting Company, launched a line of prime time telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in August 2007 after disappointing ratings.\nOn June 13, 2012, \"Dallas\", a continuation of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel, only losing viewership after the show's most established star, Larry Hagman, died midway through the series. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, \"Hollywood Heights\", which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other prime time soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela \"Alcanzar una estrella\", suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than 1\u00a0 million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to burn off the remaining episodes.\nIn 2015, Fox debuted \"Empire\", a prime time musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong and led by Oscar nominees Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", James Goldman's \"The Lion in Winter\" and the 1980s soap opera \"Dynasty\". Also in 2015, E! introduced \"The Royals\", a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by \"Dynasty\" (even featuring Joan Collins as the Queen's mother). In addition, ABC debuted a prime time soap opera \"Blood &amp; Oil\", following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day Williston oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015.\nTelenovelas.\nThe telenovela, a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism \"Spanish soap opera\" has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.\nSpanish-language networks, chiefly Univision and Telemundo, have found success airing telenovelas for the growing U.S. Hispanic market. Both produced and imported Latin American dramas (as well as imported Turkish dramas since the 2020s) are popular features of the networks' daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings.\nOnline serials.\nSome web series are soap operas, such as ' or '. In 2013, production company Prospect Park revived \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" for the web, retaining original creator Agnes Nixon as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions). Each show initially produced four half-hour episodes a week, but quickly cut back to two half-hour episodes each. In the midst of (though not directly related to) a lawsuit between Prospect Park and ABC, the experiment ended that same year, with both shows being canceled again.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSoap operas in the UK began on the radio and were consequently associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting \"Front Line Family\" in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II. The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, \"The Archers\", which first aired in May 1950, and has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.\nIn the UK, soap operas were one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time and often the most watched TV programmes each week. Soap operas have declined in popularity in recent years as viewers move away from broadcast TV to streaming. Most UK soap operas focus on everyday, working-class communities, influenced by the conventions of the kitchen sink drama. The most popular soap operas in the United Kingdom are \"Coronation Street\", \"EastEnders\", \"Emmerdale\", \"Hollyoaks\", and the Australian produced \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\". The first three of these were consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television. Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the British royal family. King Charles III himself made cameo appearances in two of the UK's biggest serials during his time as Prince of Wales: \"Coronation Street\" and \"EastEnders\", the latter alongside his wife Queen Camilla (then Duchess of Cornwall), in 2000 and 2022 respectively. Major events in British culture are often mentioned in the storyline, such as the Home Nations' participation at the World Cup and the death of Princess Diana. Since 1999, The British Soap Awards has been televised on ITV.\nThe 1986 Christmas Day episode of \"EastEnders\" is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15\u00a0million viewers (more than half the population at the time). The figure of 30.15\u00a0million was actually a combination of the original broadcast, which had just over 19\u00a0million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10\u00a0million viewers. The combined 30.15\u00a0million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of \"EastEnders\" the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. Overall it ranks third behind the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final (32.3\u00a0million viewers) and Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 (32.1\u00a0million viewers) which were transmitted on both BBC One and ITV.\nTelevision.\nAn early television serial was \"The Grove Family\" on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The programme was broadcast live, and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK's first twice-weekly serial was ITV's \"Emergency - Ward 10\", running from 1957 until 1967.\nIn the 1960s, \"Coronation Street\" revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera and was listed in \"Guinness World Records\". The BBC also produced several serials: \"Compact\" was about the staff of a women's magazine; \"The Newcomers\" was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; \"United!\" contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; \"199 Park Lane\" (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as \"Coronation Street\". Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.\nDuring the 1960s, \"Coronation Street\"'s main rival was \"Crossroads\", a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. \"Crossroads\" was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. \"Crossroads\" was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of \"Crossroads\" was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).\nA later rival to \"Coronation Street\" was ITV's \"Emmerdale Farm\" (later renamed \"Emmerdale\"), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural Yorkshire. Increased viewership resulted in \"Emmerdale\" being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.\n\"Pobol y Cwm\" (\"People of the Valley\") is a Welsh language serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. \"Pobol y Cwm\" was broadcast on BBC Wales television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. \"Pobol y Cwm\" was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles; it is consistently the most watched programme each week on S4C.\n1980s.\nDaytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced \"General Hospital\", which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980, Scottish Television debuted \"Take the High Road\", which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as \"The Sullivans\" (aired on ITV from 1977), \"The Young Doctors\" (from 1982), \"Sons and Daughters\" (from 1983), \"A Country Practice\" (from 1982), \"Richmond Hill\" (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, \"Neighbours\" was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and \"Home and Away\" aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.\nThe day Channel 4 began operations in 1982, it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based \"Brookside\", which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of \"Brookside\" was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale Farm\", which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in \"Brookside\" were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though \"Brookside\" was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00\u00a0p.m. and 8.30\u00a0p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00\u00a0p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.\nIn 1985, the BBC's \"EastEnders\" debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17\u00a0million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15\u00a0million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) by her husband, Queen Vic landlord Den (Leslie Grantham).\nA notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera \"Prisoner\", which ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title \"Prisoner: Cell Block H\". It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10\u00a0million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.\n1990s.\nIn 1992, the BBC made \"Eldorado\" to daily alternate with \"EastEnders\". The programme was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered \"Hollyoaks\", a soap with a youth focus which initially aired only once weekly, but became week-daily in November 2003. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera \"Family Affairs\", which was formatted as a week-daily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.\n\"Brookside\"'s premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, sibling incest, religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous 'body under the patio' storyline that ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9\u00a0million viewers.\n\"Coronation Street\" and \"Brookside\" began releasing straight-to-video features. The \"Coronation Street\" releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The \"Brookside\" releases were set in the usual locations, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given '18' certificates.\n\"Emmerdale Farm\" was renamed \"Emmerdale\" in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18\u00a0million viewers. The revamp was a success and \"Emmerdale\" grew in popularity.\nThroughout the 1990s, \"Brookside\", \"Coronation Street\", \"EastEnders\" and \"Emmerdale\" continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired weekly by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.\n2000s.\nSince 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime serial \"Doctors\" began in March 2000, preceding \"Neighbours\" on BBC One and has since become the BBC's flagship daytime series. The series was cancelled in October 2023, with the final episode screened in November 2024. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial \"High Road\" (formerly \"Take The High Road\") continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched \"River City\", which proved popular and effectively replaced \"High Road\" when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial \"Brookside\" ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving \"Hollyoaks\" as Channel 4's flagship serial. In 2023, it was announced that\u00a0\"Hollyoaks\"\u00a0had been removed from Channel 4's early evening schedule, but would remain on E4 and\u00a0Channel 4's on demand service\u00a0and would upload episodes to\u00a0YouTube.\nA new version of \"Crossroads\" featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled \"Night and Day\". This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late-night time slot, was cancelled in 2003.\n\"Family Affairs\", which was broadcast opposite the racier \"Hollyoaks\", never achieved significantly high ratings, leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, \"Family Affairs\" had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005. In 2005, former \"Hollyoaks\" producer Sean O'Connor moved to \"Family Affairs\", and planned a revamp including a new name and a younger, more glamorous cast, although these plans did not come to fruition due to the show's axing.\nIn 2008, ITV premiered \"The Royal Today\", a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama \"The Royal\" (itself a spin-off of \"Heartbeat\"), which had been running in a primetime slot since 2003. Just days later, soap opera parody programme \"Echo Beach\" premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy \"Moving Wallpaper\". Both \"Echo Beach\" and \"The Royal Today\" ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera \"Silver Street\" debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the programme led to its cancellation in 2010.\nFormat.\nBritish soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original \"Crossroads\", which began as a week-daily soap opera in the 1960s but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced.\nIn 1989, \"Coronation Street\" began airing three times a week. In 1996, it expanded to four episodes a week.\n\"Brookside\" premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990, it expanded to three episodes a week.\n\"EastEnders\" increased its number of episodes a week in 1994 and \"Emmerdale\" did so in 1997.\n\"Family Affairs\" debuted as a week-long daily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week for its entire run.\nIn 2004, \"Emmerdale\" began airing six episodes a week.\nIn a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" were moved out of their slots. \"Coronation Street\" added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30\u00a0p.m. \"Emmerdale\"'s Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with \"EastEnders\". In July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, \"Coronation Street\" moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. \"Emmerdale\" reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings. \"Coronation Street\" later returned to a Wednesday slot, to air Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 19:30 and 20:30. \"Emmerdale\" airs at 19:00 every weeknight, and 20:00 on Thursdays.\nLater, \"Coronation Street\" (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) produced five episodes a week.\nIt was announced in June 2016 that starting from late 2017, \"Coronation Street\" would air six episodes a week.\n\"Doctors\" aired five episodes a week until 2022, and four episodes from 2022 onwards, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. \"Hollyoaks\" produces five episodes a week. The imported \"Neighbours\" screened as five new episodes a week. As of 2024[ [update]], \"EastEnders\" produces four episodes a week.\nUK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. In their early years, \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" used 16 mm film for footage shot on location. Since the 1980s, UK soap opera have routinely featured scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community which the soap focuses on.\n\"Hollyoaks\" and \"Family Affairs\" were taped on high-definition video, and used the filmizing process.\nTurkey.\nAs of 2017,[ [update]] Turkey is the second largest exporter of television soap operas. In 2016, Turkish TV exports earned $350\u00a0million, making it the second largest drama exporter in the world behind the United States. Turkish soap operas have a large following across Asia, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\"See List of longest-serving soap opera actors\"\nAustralia.\nAustralia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two and a half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes. Unlike soap operas from the U.S. and UK which run year round, Australian soaps are produced in seasons, and every year, usually in November, the season finale in broadcast, with a new season airing from January or February.\nStylistically, these series most closely resemble British soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in the studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace, and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences. Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the caf\u00e9, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.\nEarly serials.\nThe genre began in Australia on the radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, \"Big Sister\", featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best-known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera \"Blue Hills\", which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was \"Autumn Affair\" (1958) featuring radio personality and \"Blue Hills\" star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. \"Autumn Affair\" failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by \"The Story of Peter Grey\" (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. \"The Story of Peter Grey\" ran for 164 episodes.\nThe first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with \"Bellbird\", produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This rural-based serial was screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. \"Bellbird\" was a moderate success but built up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. \"Motel\" (1968) was Australia's first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.\nThe 1970s.\nThe first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama \"Number 96\", a nighttime series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network 10, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape within marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, \"Number 96\" had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of \"Number 96\" prompted the creation of \"The Box\", which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered \"The Box\" to be a more slickly produced and better written show than \"Number 96\". \"The Box\" also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after \"Number 96\". For 1974 \"Number 96\" was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year \"The Box\" occupied the number two spot.\nAlso in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia's first \"teen\" soap opera, \"Class of '74\". With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", its high school setting and early evening timeslot, \"Class of '74\" came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.\nBy 1975, both \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity, shifting more towards comedic plots. \"Class of '74\" was renamed \"Class of '75\" and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap \"The Unisexers\" failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap \"Until Tomorrow\" ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.\nA feature film version of \"Bellbird\" entitled \"Country Town\" was produced in 1971 by two of the show's stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.\nIn November 1976 \"The Young Doctors\" debuted on the Nine Network. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later \"The Sullivans\", a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, \"The Sullivans\" became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period \"Number 96\" re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show's declining ratings. \"Bellbird\" experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.\n\"Bellbird\", \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. \"The Young Doctors\" and \"The Sullivans\" continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series \"Cop Shop\" (1977\u20131984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced \"The Restless Years\" (1977\u20131981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.\nThe Seven Network, achieving success with \"Cop Shop\" produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce \"Skyways\", a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network's popular talk show \"The Don Lane Show\". \"Skyways\", which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, prostitution, drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and murder, and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.\nThe 1980s.\nThe Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women's-prison drama \"Prisoner\" (1979\u20131986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic family saga \"Sons and Daughters\" (1982\u20131987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.\nGrundy soap \"The Young Doctors\" and Crawford Productions' \"The Sullivans\" continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: \"Taurus Rising\" (1982), \"Waterloo Station\" (1983), \"Starting Out\" (1983) and \"Possession\" (1985), along with \"Prime Time\" (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created \"Neighbours\", a suburban-based daily serial devised as a gentle family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.\nProduced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, \"Neighbours\" achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show \"Perfect Match\" on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in \"Neighbours\" as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep \"Neighbours\" on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas \"A Country Practice\" and \"Sons and Daughters\".\nAfter the network cancelled \"Neighbours\", it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences; however, after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. In January 2011 it moved to Eleven and ended after 8,903 episodes on 28 July 2022. In November 2022, Amazon Freevee revived the show with an order of 400 episodes to begin airing in 2023. It is Australia's longest-running soap opera.\nThe success of \"Neighbours\" in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as \"Home and Away\" (1988\u2013present) on Channel Seven, where compared to \"Neighbours\", \"Home and Away's\" storylines were more adult-themed and hard-hitting, as well as becoming the most-awarded and highest-rated soap opera on Australian television, and \"Richmond Hill\" (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however \"Richmond Hill\" emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by \"E Street\" (1989\u20131993).\nNine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama \"Family and Friends\" in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme \"Chances\" in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" in an attempt to attract attention. \"Chances\" achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.\nAustralian soaps internationally.\nSeveral Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of \"The Young Doctors\", \"The Sullivans\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Neighbours\" (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's \"Prisoner\" began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however, the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. \"Prisoner\" also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated \"Prisoner\" in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of \"Sons and Daughters\". During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\" had resulted in the debuts of \"Taurus Rising\" and \"Return to Eden\", two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.\nOther shows to achieve varying levels of international success include \"Richmond Hill\", \"E Street\", \"Paradise Beach\" (1993\u20131994), and \"Pacific Drive\" (1995\u20131997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven's \"Home and Away\", a teen soap developed as a rival to \"Neighbours\", has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.\nThe 1990s and beyond.\n\"Something in the Air\", a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.\nAttempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" saw the creation of \"Echo Point\" (1995) and \"Breakers\" (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, \"Neighbours\" was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode \u2013 considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for \"Neighbours\" had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for. During this period \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.\nIt has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.\n\"Neighbours\" was carried in the United States on the Oxygen cable channel in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as \"All My Children\" and \"The Young and the Restless\", and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.\n\"headLand\" made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of \"Home and Away\" that was to have been produced in conjunction with \"Home and Away\"'s UK broadcaster, Channel 5. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK. Nickelodeon's \"\" appeared in July 2006 on Network Ten. Since Connie considered this mention as a torrid soap opera, this was mentioned in the Steven Universe episode \"Love Letters\".\nAfter losing the UK television rights to \"Neighbours\" to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial \"Out of the Blue\", which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One's weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008 but low ratings prompted its move to BBC Two on 19 May 2008. The series was cancelled after its first season.\n\"Neighbours\"' continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven on January 11, 2011. However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales.\n\"Neighbours\" was cancelled due to Channel 5, the UK broadcaster of the show, deciding to drop the programme \u2013 the money they were paying for the rights was providing the majority of its funding. It ended on 29 July 2022. Months after its series finale, Fremantle Australia, the programme's production company, announced on 17 November 2022, that production on the programme would restart in 2023 after the company agreed on a deal with Amazon Freevee. Amazon Freevee aired the programme for free in the UK and the US while Network 10 retained the rights to the programme.\nIn February 2025, the series was cancelled again, with production concluding in July and episodes ceasing to air in December.\nNew Zealand.\nTelevision.\nPioneering series \"Pukemanu\" aired over two years (1971\u201372) and was the NZBC's first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town.\n\"Close to Home\" is a New Zealand television soap opera that ran on TVNZ 1 from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make \"The Governor\"). \"Gloss\" is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap \"Dynasty\", with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in \"Shortland Street\", which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on TVNZ 2.\nRadio.\nRadio New Zealand began airing its first radio soap \"You Me Now\" in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.\nCanada.\nRelatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included \"Family Passions\", \"Scarlett Hill\", \"Strange Paradise\", \"Metropia\", \"Train 48\" and the international co-production \"Foreign Affairs\". \"Family Passions\" was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including \"49th &amp; Main\" and \"North/South\", have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.\nNotable prime time soap operas in Canada have included \"Riverdale\", \"House of Pride\", \"Paradise Falls\", \"Lance et Compte\" (\"He Shoots, He Scores\"), \"Heartland\", \"Loving Friends and Perfect Couples\", and \"The City\". The \"Degrassi\" franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.\nOn French-language television in Quebec, the \"t\u00e9l\u00e9roman\" has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable t\u00e9l\u00e9romans have included \"Rue des Pignons\", \"Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut\", \"Diva\", \"La famille Plouffe\", and the soap opera parody \"Le C\u0153ur a ses raisons\".\nIndia.\nUnlike the season-based production in most countries, most of Indian television fiction tends to be regular-broadcasting soap opera. These started in the 1980s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture when Balaji Telefilms's Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi premiered on Disney's 21st Century Fox owned StarPlus, becoming the highest rated show in Asia on weekdays prime time 10:30pm. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India, and many includes family melodrama. Indian soap operas have multilingual production.\nMany soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and South East Asia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.\nEurope.\nRemakes of Australian serials.\nThe Australian serial \"The Restless Years\" was remade in the Netherlands as (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to \"good times, bad times\". These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.\nA later Australian serial, \"Sons and Daughters\", has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are \"Verbotene Liebe\" (Germany, 1995\u20132015); \"Skilda v\u00e4rldar\" (Sweden, 1996\u20132002); \"Apagorevmeni agapi\" (Greece, 1998); \"Cuori Rubati\" (Italy, 2002\u20132003) and \"Zabranjena ljubav\" (Croatia, 2004\u20132008). Both \"The Restless Years\" and \"Sons and Daughters\" were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.\nAnother Australian soap opera reformatted for a European audience was \"E Street\" which ran on Network 10 in Australia from 1989 to 1993. Germany produced 37 episodes of \"Westerdeich\" (\"Westside\") in 1995 using scripts from 1989 episodes of \"E Street\". It was also remade in Belgium as \"Wittekerke\" (\"Whitechurch\") and ran from 1993 to 2008.\nNorway.\nThe Norwegian soap opera \"Hotel C\u00e6sar\" aired on TV 2 from 1998 to 2017, and is the longest-running television drama in Scandinavia. Popular foreign soaps in the country include \"Days of Our Lives\" (broadcast on TV6 (Norway), \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (TNT (Norway) and \"Home and Away\" (TV 2), all of which are subtitled.\nNetherlands.\nSerials have included (1990\u2013present), \"Onderweg naar Morgen\" (1994\u20132010) and \"Goudkust\" (1996\u20132001). In 2016 \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" spin-off \"Nieuwe Tijden\" started airing, but was ultimately cancelled by broadcaster RTL in 2018. Linear viewership for \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\", the country's most prominent soap opera, has decreased in recent years. However, due to a rising viewership on streaming platforms, RTL has decided to continue producing the show throughout the 2022/2023 television season. U.S. daytime serials \"As The World Turns\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" have aired in the Netherlands; \"As the World Turns\" began airing in the country in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.\nGermany.\nIn the 1980s, West German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with \"Lindenstra\u00dfe\", which was seen as a German counterpart to \"Coronation Street\". Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13\u00a0million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before \"\" became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the RTL network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7\u00a0million viewers by 2002. Not long after , Das Erste introduced \"Marienhof\", which aired twice a week.\nAfter successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like \"GZSZ\", the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled \"Verbotene Liebe\", which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of \"Verbotene Liebe\", the network turned \"Marienhof\" into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa\u2013produced \"Unter uns\" in late 1994.\nZDF started a business venture with Canada and co-produced the short-lived series \"Family Passions\", starring actors such as Gordon Thomson, Roscoe Born, Dietmar Sch\u00f6nherr and a young Hayden Christensen. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted \"Jede Menge Leben\". Even after a crossover with three soaps, \"Freunde f\u00fcrs Leben\", \"Forsthaus Falkenau\" and , the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with \"So ist das Leben! Die Wagenfelds\", before failing with \"Geliebte Schwestern\". RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with \"Alle zusammen \u2013 jeder f\u00fcr sich\".\nThe teen soap opera \"Schloss Einstein\" debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near Berlin. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.\nIn 1999, after the lasting success of , \"Marienhof\", \"Unter uns\" and \"Verbotene Liebe\", ProSieben aired \"Mallorca \u2013 Suche nach dem Paradies\", set on the Spanish island with the same name. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on free-to-air and pay television.\nIn 2006, \"Alles was z\u00e4hlt\" became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. \"Unter uns\" was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show's producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After \"Unter uns\" was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. \"Marienhof\" had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however \"Marienhof\" was canceled in June 2011. \"Verbotene Liebe\" was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after \"Marienhof\" was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.\nWhile , \"Unter uns\" and \"Alles was z\u00e4hlt\" are currently the only daily soaps on the air after \"Verbotene Liebe\" has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas \"Sturm der Liebe\" and \"Rote Rosen\" are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.\nBelgium.\nIn Belgium, the two major soap operas are \"Thuis\" (\"Home\") and \"Familie\" (\"Family\"), both prime time soap operas. Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. \"Familie\" debuted in late 1991, and with more han 6,700 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. The highest-rated soap opera is \"Thuis\", which has aired on \"\u00e9\u00e9n\" since late 1995. \"Thuis\" is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.6\u00a0million Flemings in total).\nDuring the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as \"Neighbours\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as \"Days of Our Lives\", Australia's \"Home and Away\" and Germany's \"Sturm der Liebe\". Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include \"The Young and the Restless\", \"EastEnders\" (both on VTM), \"Port Charles\" (at \u00e9\u00e9n, then known as TV1) and \"Coronation Street\" (on Vitaya). \"Santa Barbara\" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.\nIn the early 2000s, the only teen soap opera on Belgian television was \"Spring\" (\"Jump\" in English), which aired on the youth-oriented Ketnet and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.\nItaly.\nThe most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series \"Un posto al sole\" (\"A Place Under the Sun\"), which had aired on Rai 3 since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\"). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as \"Ricominciare\" (\"Starting Over\"), \"Cuori rubati\" (\"Stolen Hearts\"), \"Vivere\" (\"Living\"), \"Sottocasa\" (\"Downstairs\"), \"Agrodolce\" (\"Bittersweet\") and \"Centovetrine\" (\"Hundred Shop Windows\").\nThe most popular Italian prime-time soap opera, \"Incantesimo\" (\"Enchantment\"), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on Rai 1. The same happened with \"Il paradiso delle signore\" (\"Woman's Paradise\"), a period drama, which ran from 2015 to 2017 in prime time, and became a daytime period soap opera from 2018.\nIreland.\nTelevision.\nIn the early years of RT\u00c9, the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RT\u00c9's first television soap was \"Tolka Row\", which was set in urban Dublin. For several years, both \"Tolka Row\" and \"The Riordans\" were produced by RT\u00c9; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera \"The Riordans\", which premiered in 1965. Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for \"The Riordans\" in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted \"Emmerdale Farm\" (now \"Emmerdale\"), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, \"The Riordans\" was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his \"Agri-soap\" trilogy \"Bracken\", starring Gabriel Byrne, whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of \"The Riordans\". Bracken was soon replaced by the third \"Agri-soap\" \"Glenroe\", which ran until 2001. \nIn 1989, RT\u00c9 decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. \"Fair City\", which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989\u201390 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location \u2013 in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RT\u00c9 made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RT\u00c9's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RT\u00c9 expanded \"Fair City\" to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. From the early 2000s, the series went through periods of airing three or four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. \"Fair City\" currently airs Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays on RT\u00c9 One.\nTG4 produce the Irish language soap \"Ros na R\u00fan\" (\"Headland of the Secrets\" or \"Headland of the Sweethearts\"); set in the fictional village of \"Ros Na R\u00fan\", located outside Galway and near Spiddal, it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town's residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality \u2013 with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of \"Ros Na R\u00fan\" has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. \"Ros na R\u00fan\" is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4's launch, it aired on RT\u00c9 One in the early 1990s.\nThe first soap to air outside RTE/TG4 was \"Red Rock\" which was broadcast on Virgin Media Ireland from January 2015 to 2020 . Red Rock aired twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Focusing on the activities of the detectives of the local Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na station and townsfolk, three series of the programme were broadcast, concluding just over five years from the date of its debut.\nRadio.\nRT\u00c9 Radio produced its first radio soap, \"Kennedys of Castleross\", which ran from April 13, 1955, to 1975. In 1979 RT\u00c9 long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985. In the mid-1980s, RT\u00c9 debuted a new radio soap, \"Harbour Hotel\", which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, \"Konvenience Korner\" and \"Riverrun\", which were followed in 2004 by \"Driftwood\". RT\u00c9 does not run any radio soaps, however RT\u00c9 Radio 1 continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule.\nGreece.\nIn Greece, there have been several soap operas.\nANT1.\nAn early serial was \"Sti skia tou hrimatos\" (\"Money Shadows\"), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of \"Lampsi\" (\"the Shining\"), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece's longest-running soap opera. After the success of \"Lampsi\" came the short lived \"To galazio diamandi\" (\"Blue Diamond\") and \"Simphonia siopis\" (\"Omert\u00e0\"). \"Lampsi\" was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by \"Erotas\" (\"Love\"), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.\nGreece's second longest-running soap is \"Kalimera Zoi\" (\"Goodmorning Life\"), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.\nMEGA.\nMega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial \"I Dipsa\" (\"The Thirst\"), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included \"Paralliloi dromoi\" (1992\u20131994) and its successor \"Haravgi\" (\"Daylight\", 1994\u20131995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials \"Apagorevmeni Agapi\" (\"Forbidden Love\"), which ran from 1998 to 2006; \"Gia mia thesi ston Ilio\" (\"A Spot Under the Sun\"), which ran from 1998 to 2002; \"Filodoxies\" (\"Expectations\"), which ran from 2002 to 2006; and \"Vera Sto Deksi\" (\"Ring on the Right Hand\"), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to \"Lampsi\", causing that show's ratings to decline.\n\"Ta Mistika Tis Edem\" (\"Edem Secrets\"), which was created by the producers of \"Vera Sto Deksi\", debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show's success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.\nERT.\nYENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas \"I Kravgi Ton Likon\" and \"Megistanes\". ERT also produced the long-running soap \"O Simvoleografos\".

It premiered on MBC 1 and https:// on March 1, 2020. The series is a melodramatic saga that delves into the social, economic, and cultural aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. It revolves around the intense rivalry between two families, the Bahitanis and the Khawatnis, and includes elements of romance, secrets, and schemes.\nAL Mirath has been a highly successful series. Initially, it was commissioned for 250 episodes. Due to its popularity, the series continued with additional seasons, and by 2023, it had produced 750 episodes.\nEgypt\nIn February 2022, MBC launched the first Egyptian daily soap opera, \"Downtown West El Balad\". In Cairo, two brothers became enemies after the death of their father because the eldest son was excluded from the inheritance. 190 episodes have already been produced.\nLatin America.\nIn Latin America, for many years, primetime (as well as part of daytime) programming, for the most part, has been traditionally composed of telenovelas. However, throughout the years, there have been cases where a number of television programs tended to \"mix\" the concepts of television series and telenovela, such as, for example, a telenovela that lasted several seasons to end. With this \"overlap\", many people consider that these shows could be more accurately described as \"soap operas\". With this being said, the two most notable Latin American examples of TV programs that could fit on the definition of a \"soap opera\" are \"Chiquititas\" (in both Argentina and Brazil) and \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" (only in Brazil).\n\"Chiquititas\" was first broadcast in Argentina by Telefe in 1995 and soon became a national hit, especially among children. In regards to the audience, all eight seasons (the final season ended in 2006) of \"Chiquititas\" guaranteed the first place in the Argentine TV ratings for Telefe. Throughout the years, \"Chiquititas\" had a number of spin-offs not only in Argentina, but also in Brazil, Mexico and Portugal. In 1997, Silvio Santos, founder and owner of the Brazilian television network SBT, seeing the good ratings of \"Chiquititas\" in Argentina, decided to make a partnership with Telefe, and thus, SBT started to broadcast \"Chiquititas\" in Brazil, but in the format of \"remake\", with the use of the Portuguese language instead of Spanish, with the use of dubbing when singing the soundtrack songs (unlike the Argentine version, on which the actors themselves sung the songs), with a Brazilian cast and with slight modifications in regards to its plot (the Brazilian version was set in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo instead of Buenos Aires, although many scenes of the Brazilian adaptation were actually filmed at the same Telefe studios in Buenos Aires where the Argentine version was also recorded, due to the aforementioned partnership between Telefe and SBT). The Brazilian version of \"Chiquititas\", which lasted five seasons and ended in 2001, was successful in the ratings as well, in a slightly smaller scale compared to the Argentine version, and despite the success of \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" (see below), the soap opera was one of the most known TV programs of the late 1990s in Brazil, enough to put \"Chiquititas\" also in the imaginary of many Brazilian children (a proof of this is that the casting process for the third season of \"Chiquititas\" in 1999 reunited about 15,000 children in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo alone, a record number not seen even in any Brazilian telenovela). In 2013, SBT decided to make a second adaptation of \"Chiquititas\", which lasted two seasons (the final season ended in 2015), but unlike the first version, which resembled more like its Argentine counterpart, the second version, produced only by SBT, is different not only because the soundtrack is entirely sung by the actors themselves (as well as on the Argentine version, on which the actors did not dub the songs, but unlike the first Brazilian adaptation). Despite the fact that the ratings of the 2013 version of \"Chiquititas\" were smaller, the soap opera was not considered a failure by the critics. SBT executives evaluated the ratings as being \"satisfactory\", and some fans consider the 2013 version to be a small \"revival\" of the 1997 version of \"Chiquititas\".\n\"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" has been transmitted by Rede Globo on almost every week since 1995 and has become the most successful Brazilian soap opera in the ratings. On each one of the 27 seasons shown as of 2021, the soap opera stayed in the first place on the ratings (like the Argentine version of \"Chiquititas\"). Moreover, \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" also had a number of spin-offs being produced in Brazil. However, unlike \"Chiquititas\", \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" is more focused on teenagers, with more mature issues like teenage pregnancy, sexual relationships and the use of illicit drugs being discussed on its plot. Another interesting topic is that \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" is considered by some fans as being the \"entrance door\" to many rookie actors who obtain the first opportunity of working on Rede Globo, because history has shown that a good acting in \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" increases the possibility of being \"promoted\" to the primetime telenovelas (also broadcast by Rede Globo). In fact, estimates indicate that hundreds of actors participate in the casting process of \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" each year, proving that many aspiring actors want to appear in this soap opera to further progress their careers.\nInternet and mobile soap opera.\nWith the advent of internet television and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including \"\", a spin-off of the established \"EastEnders\". For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.\nOn September 13, 2011, TG4 launched a new 10-part online series titled, \"Na R\u00fain\" (an Internet spin-off of \"Ros na R\u00fan\"). The miniseries took on the theme of a mystery; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorc\u00e1n's blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character's thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.\nIn 1996, Canadian artificial intelligence researcher Chris McKinstry created the online soap opera \"CR6\" (an acronym for \"Clickable Reality\"); despite its obscurity, it received some media attention at the time and featured talent such as Brendan Fehr; at least eight episodes of \"CR6\" were released. It remains an early example of a web-series but despite the seemingly positive media buzz for the show, according to McKinstry, he lost over CAD$1 million on production and distribution costs, and \"CR6\" was considered a failure; while McKinstry would take his own life in 2006, thanks to the series' historical context, \"CR6\" has amassed a cult following from lost media searchers.\nHome video release.\nDue to the massive number of episodes typically produced for a long-running soap opera (into the tens of thousands for some) and the fact that many episodes are lost over time, home video release (in VHS, DVD or Blu-ray) of daily soap operas is generally considered impractical and impossible beyond occasional retrospective releases or highlights. A notable exception is the 1966\u20131971 series \"Dark Shadows\", which has had its entire run of 1,225 episodes (with an audio recreation of its sole missing episode) released to home video. In the case of American \"primetime soap operas\" this generally does not apply as typically such series produce far fewer episodes (generally on par with that of other genres), allowing home video release.\nParodies.\nIn film, the 1982 comedy \"Tootsie\" has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long-running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.\nThe 1991 comedy \"Soapdish\" stars Sally Field as an aging soap opera actress on the fictional series \"The Sun Also Sets\" who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes, such as her live-in boyfriend, who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the programme.\nAnother 1991 comedy, \"Delirious\", stars John Candy as a soap opera writer who, after a head injury, has a dream experience of being in his own creation. The dream experience is an increasingly outrageous exaggeration of soap opera plot elements.\nOn television, several soap opera parodies have been produced:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27010", "revid": "37666339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27010", "title": "Software engineering", "text": "Engineering approach to software development\nSoftware engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet user needs.\nThe terms \"programmer\" and \"coder\" overlap \"software engineer\", but they imply only the construction aspect of a typical software engineer workload.\nA software engineer applies a software development process, which involves defining, implementing, testing, managing, and maintaining software systems, as well as developing the software development process itself.\nHistory.\nBeginning in the 1960s, software engineering was recognized as a separate field of engineering.\nThe development of software engineering was seen as a struggle. Problems included software that was over budget, exceeded deadlines, required extensive debugging and maintenance, and unsuccessfully met the needs of consumers or was never even completed.\nIn 1968, NATO organized the first conference on software engineering, which addressed emerging challenges in software development. The event played a key role in formalizing guidelines and best practices for creating reliable and maintainable software.\nThe origins of the term \"software engineering\" have been attributed to various sources. The term appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of \"Computers and Automation\" and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of \"Communications of the ACM\" (Volume 9, number 8) in \"President's Letter to the ACM Membership\" by Anthony A. Oettinger. It is also associated with the title of a NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer. Margaret Hamilton described the discipline of \"software engineering\" during the Apollo missions to give what they were doing legitimacy. At the time, there was perceived to be a \"software crisis\". The 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2018) celebrates 50 years of \"Software Engineering\" with the Plenary Sessions' keynotes of Frederick Brooks and Margaret Hamilton.\nIn 1984, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.\nWatts Humphrey founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process. The Process Maturity Levels introduced became the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV), which defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development team.\nModern, generally accepted best practices for software engineering have been collected by the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 subcommittee and published as the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Software engineering is considered one of the major computing disciplines.\nIn modern systems, where concepts such as Edge Computing, Internet of Things and Cyber-physical Systems are prevalent, software is a critical factor. Thus, software engineering is closely related to the Systems Engineering discipline. The Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge claims:\nSoftware is prominent in most modern systems architectures and is often the primary means for integrating complex system components. Software engineering and systems engineering are not merely related disciplines; they are intimately intertwined...Good systems engineering is a key factor in enabling good software engineering.\nTerminology.\nDefinition.\nNotable definitions of software engineering include:\n\"An engineering discipline concerned with all aspects of software production.\" \u2014 Ian Sommerville\nThe term has also been used less formally:\nSuitability.\nIndividual commentators have disagreed sharply on how to define \"software engineering\" or its legitimacy as an engineering discipline. David Parnas has said that software engineering is, in fact, a form of engineering. Steve McConnell has said that it is not, but that it should be. Donald Knuth has said that programming is an art and a science. Edsger W. Dijkstra claimed that the terms \"software engineering\" and \"software engineer\" have been misused in the United States.\nWorkload.\nRequirements analysis.\nRequirements engineering is about elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software. Software requirements can be functional, non-functional or domain.\nFunctional requirements describe expected behaviors (i.e. outputs). Non-functional requirements specify issues like portability, security, maintainability, reliability, scalability, performance, reusability, and flexibility. They are classified into the following types: interface constraints, performance constraints (such as response time, security, storage space, etc.), operating constraints, life cycle constraints (maintainability, portability, etc.), and economic constraints. Knowledge of how the system or software works is needed when it comes to specifying non-functional requirements. Domain requirements have to do with the characteristic of a certain category or domain of projects.\nDesign.\nSoftware design is the process of making high-level plans for the software. Design is sometimes divided into levels:\nConstruction.\nSoftware construction typically involves programming (a.k.a. coding), unit testing, integration testing, and debugging so as to implement the design.\"Software testing is related to, but different from, ... debugging\". \nTesting.\nSoftware testing is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software under test. Software testing can be viewed as a risk based activity. \nWhen described separately from construction, testing typically is performed by test engineers or quality assurance instead of the programmers who wrote it. It is performed at the system level and is considered an aspect of software quality. The testers' goals during the testing process are to minimize the overall number of tests to a manageable set and make well-informed decisions regarding which risks should be prioritized for testing and which can wait.\nProgram analysis.\nProgram analysis is the process of analyzing computer programs with respect to an aspect such as performance, robustness, and security.\nMaintenance.\nSoftware maintenance refers to supporting the software after release. It may include but is not limited to: error correction, optimization, deletion of unused and discarded features, and enhancement of existing features.\nUsually, maintenance takes up 40% to 80% of project cost.\nEducation.\nKnowledge of computer programming is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer. In 2004, the IEEE Computer Society produced the SWEBOK, which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 1979:2005, describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.\nMany software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery, and updated in 2014. A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; as of 2010[ [update]], there were 244 Campus Bachelor of Software Engineering programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.\nIn addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through military service in software engineering.\nSoftware engineering degree programs.\nA small but growing number of practitioners have software engineering degrees. In 1987, the Department of Computing at Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering bachelor's degree in the world; in the following year, the University of Sheffield established a similar program. In 1996, the Rochester Institute of Technology established the first software engineering bachelor's degree program in the United States; however, it did not obtain ABET accreditation until 2003, the same year as Rice University, Clarkson University, Milwaukee School of Engineering, and Mississippi State University. \nSince then, software engineering undergraduate degrees have been established at many universities. A standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees, SE2004, was defined by a steering committee between 2001 and 2004 with funding from the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. As of 2004[ [update]], about 50 universities in the U.S. offer software engineering degrees, which teach both computer science and engineering principles and practices. The first software engineering master's degree was established at Seattle University in 1979. Since then, graduate software engineering degrees have been made available from many more universities. Likewise in Canada, the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers has recognized several software engineering programs.\nAdditionally, many online advanced degrees in Software Engineering have appeared such as the Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSE) degree offered through the Computer Science and Engineering Department at California State University, Fullerton. Steve McConnell opines that because most universities teach computer science rather than software engineering, there is a shortage of true software engineers. ETS (\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure) University and UQAM (Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al) were mandated by IEEE to develop the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), which has become an ISO standard describing the body of knowledge covered by a software engineer.\nProfession.\nLegal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer. In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation. In Europe, Software Engineers can obtain the European Engineer (EUR ING) professional title. Software Engineers can also become professionally qualified as a Chartered Engineer through the British Computer Society.\nIn the United States, the NCEES began offering a Professional Engineer exam for Software Engineering in 2013, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized. NCEES ended the exam after April 2019 due to lack of participation. Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial.\nThe IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the two main US-based professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE's \"Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge \u2013 2004 Version\", or SWEBOK, defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing software engineer to have. The most current version is SWEBOK v4. The IEEE also promulgates a \"Software Engineering Code of Ethics\".\nEmployment.\nThere are an estimated 26.9 million professional software engineers in the world as of 2022, up from 21 million in 2016.\nMany software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Many companies hire interns, often university or college students during a summer break, or externships. Specializations include analysts, architects, developers, testers, technical support, middleware analysts, project managers, software product managers, educators, and researchers.\nMost software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Potential injuries in these occupations are possible because like other workers who spend long periods sitting in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, Thrombosis, Obesity, and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.\nUnited States.\nThe U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counted 1,365,500 software developers holding jobs in the U.S. in 2018. Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees. The BLS estimates 2024 to 2034 the growth for software engineers is 15% which is lesser than their prediction from 2023 to 2033 that computer software engineering would increase by 17%. This is down from the 2022 to 2032 BLS estimate of 25% for software engineering. And, is further down from their 30% 2010 to 2020 BLS estimate. Due to this trend, job growth may not be as fast as during the last decade, as jobs that would have gone to computer software engineers in the United States would instead be outsourced to computer software engineers in countries such as India and other foreign countries. In addition, the BLS Job Outlook for Computer Programmers, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook predicts a decline of -7 percent from 2016 to 2026, a further decline of -9 percent from 2019 to 2029, a decline of -10 percent from 2021 to 2031. and then a decline of -11 percent from 2022 to 2032. Currently their prediction for 2024 to 2034 is a decline of -6 percent. Since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower. Furthermore, the ratio of women in many software fields has also been declining over the years as compared to other engineering fields. Then there is the additional concern that recent advances in Artificial Intelligence might impact the demand for future generations of Software Engineers. However, this trend may change or slow in the future as many current software engineers in the U.S. market flee the profession or age out of the market in the next few decades.\nCertification.\nThe Software Engineering Institute offers certifications on specific topics like security, process improvement and software architecture. IBM, Microsoft and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations. Many IT certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies. These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.\nBroader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. As of 2006[ [update]], the IEEE had certified over 575 software professionals as a Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP). In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA). The ACM and the IEEE Computer Society together examined the possibility of licensing of software engineers as Professional Engineers in the 1990s,\nbut eventually decided that such licensing was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering. John C. Knight and Nancy G. Leveson presented a more balanced analysis of the licensing issue in 2002.\nIn the U.K. the British Computer Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called \"Chartered IT Professional (CITP)\", available to fully qualified members (\"MBCS\"). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the British Computer Society or Institution of Engineering and Technology and so qualify to be considered for Chartered Engineer status through either of those institutions. In Canada the Canadian Information Processing Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called \"Information Systems Professional (ISP)\". In Ontario, Canada, Software Engineers who graduate from a \"Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)\" accredited program, successfully complete PEO's (\"Professional Engineers Ontario\") Professional Practice Examination (PPE) and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the \"Professional Engineers Ontario\" and can become Professional Engineers P.Eng. The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two. This has sparked controversy and a certification war. It has also held the number of P.Eng holders for the profession exceptionally low. The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.\nImpact of globalization.\nThe initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / time zone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by foreign visa workers. Additionally, the glut of high-tech workers has led to a wider adoption of the 996 working hour system and \u2018007\u2019 schedules as the expected work load. Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected. Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the follow-the-sun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations. When North Americans leave work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans arrive to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.\nWhile global outsourcing has several advantages, global \u2013 and generally distributed \u2013 development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical, temporal, cultural and communication (that includes the use of different languages and dialects of English in different locations). Research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity. As with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas.\nPrizes.\nThere are various prizes in the field of software engineering:\nCriticism.\nSome call for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field.\nSome claim that the concept of software engineering is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in software engineering textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters.\nSome claim that a core issue with software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a \"theoretical environment.\"\nEdsger Dijkstra, a founder of many of the concepts in software development today, rejected the idea of \"software engineering\" up until his death in 2002, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what he called the \"radical novelty\" of computer science:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name \"Software Engineering\". As economics is known as \"The Miserable Science\", software engineering should be known as \"The Doomed Discipline\", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter \"How to program if you cannot.\"\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1984, the institute is now sponsored by the United States Department of Defense and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and administrated by Carnegie Mellon University.\nThe activities of the institute cover cybersecurity, software assurance, software engineering and acquisition, and component capabilities critical to the United States Department of Defense.\nAuthority.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute is a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The SEI also has offices in Washington, DC; Arlington County, Virginia; and Los Angeles, California. The SEI operates with major funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. The SEI also works with industry and academia through research collaborations.\nOn November 14, 1984, the U.S. Department of Defense elected Carnegie Mellon University as the host site of the Software Engineering Institute.\nThe institute was founded with an initial allocation of $6 million, with another $97 million to be allocated in the subsequent five years. The SEI's contract with the Department of Defense is subject to review and renewal every five years.\nSEI focuses on several technical directions: software engineering, cybersecurity, assurance, and DoD critical component capabilities.\nAreas of work.\nThe SEI defines specific initiatives aimed at improving organizations' software engineering capabilities.\nManagement practices.\nOrganizations need to effectively manage the acquisition, development, and evolution (ADE) of software-intensive systems. Success in software engineering management practices helps organizations predict and control quality, schedule, cost, cycle time, and productivity. The best-known example of SEI in management practices is the SEI's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Software (now Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)). The CMMI approach consists of models, appraisal methods, and training courses that have been proven to improve process performance. In 2006, Version 1.2 of the CMMI Product Suite included the release of CMMI for Development. CMMI for Development was the first of three constellations defined in Version 1.2: the others include CMMI for Acquisition and CMMI for Services. The CMMI for Services constellation was released in February 2009. Another management practice developed by CERT, which is part of the SEI, is the Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM). The CERT-RMM is a capability model for operational resilience management. Version 1.0 of the Resilience Management Model was released in May 2010.\nEngineering practices.\nSEI work in engineering practices increases the ability of software engineers to analyze, predict, and control selected\nfunctional and non-functional properties of software systems. Key SEI tools and methods include the SEI Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) method, the SEI Framework for Software Product Line Practice, and the SEI Service Migration and Reuse Technique (SMART).\nSecurity.\nThe SEI is also the home of the CERT/CC (CERT Coordination Center), a federally funded computer security organization. The SEI CERT Program's primary goals are to ensure that appropriate technology and systems-management practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services in spite of successful attacks, accidents, or failures. The SEI CERT program is working with US-CERT to produce the Build Security In (BSI) website, which provides guidelines for building security into every phase of the software development lifecycle. The SEI has also conducted research on insider threats and computer forensics. Results of this research and other information now populate the CERT Virtual Training Environment.\nSpecial programs.\nSEI Partner Network.\nThe SEI Partner Network helps the SEI disseminate software engineering best practices. Organizations and individuals in the SEI Partner Network are selected, trained, and licensed by the SEI to deliver authentic SEI services, which include courses, consulting methods, and management processes. The network currently consists of nearly 250 partner organizations worldwide.\nConferences.\nThe SEI sponsors national and international conferences, workshops, and user-group meetings. Other events cover subjects including the acquisition of software-intensive systems, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based systems, network security and survivability, software process research, software product lines, CMMI, and the SEI Team Software Process.\nEducation and training.\nSEI courses are currently offered at the SEI's locations in the United States and Europe. In addition, using licensed course materials, SEI Partners train individuals.\nMembership program.\nThe SEI Membership Program helps the software engineering community to network. SEI Members include small business owners, software and systems programmers, CEOs, directors, and managers from both Fortune 500 companies and government organizations.\nAffiliate program.\nThrough the SEI Affiliate Program, organizations place technical experts with the SEI for periods ranging from 12 months to four years. Affiliates currently are working on projects with the SEI to identify, develop, and demonstrate improved software engineering practices.\nSoftware Process Achievement award program.\nIn order to recognize outstanding achievements in improving an organization's ability to create and evolve software-dependent systems, the SEI and IEEE Computer Society created the Software Process Achievement Award program. In addition to rewarding excellence, the purpose of this award is to foster continuous advancement in the practice of software engineering and to disseminate insights, experiences, and proven practices throughout the relevant research and practitioner communities.\nResearch and publications.\nThe SEI publishes reports that offer new technical information about software engineering topics, whether theoretical or applied. The SEI also publishes books on software engineering for industry, government and military applications and practices.\nIn addition, the SEI offers public courses, workshops, and conferences in process improvement, software architecture and product lines, and security.\nControversies.\nOn November 11, 2015, Roger Dingledine from the Tor Project accused the Software Engineering Institute of aiding the Federal Bureau of Investigation in uncovering the identities of users of the Tor network. Later prosecution showed the hack was paid for by the Department of Defense and subpoenaed by the FBI.\nFocus of progressive protests.\nSEI has been an occasional site of anti-war movement and peace movement protests, many of which have been organized by Pittsburgh's Thomas Merton Center.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.\nHistory.\nThe term \"software crisis\" was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany.

{"id": "27013", "revid": "24927429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27013", "title": "Swedish Academy", "text": "Swedish Royal Academy\nThe Swedish Academy (), founded in 1786 by King Gustav III, is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. Its 18 members, who are elected for life, comprise the highest Swedish language authority. Outside Scandinavia, it is best known as the body that chooses the laureates for the annual Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded in memory of the donor Alfred Nobel.\nHistory.\nThe Swedish Academy was founded in 1786 by King Gustav III. Modelled after the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, it has 18 members. It is said that Gustaf III originally intended there to be twenty members, half the number of those in the French Academy, but eventually decided on eighteen because the Swedish expression \"De Aderton\" \u2013 'The Eighteen' \u2013 had such a fine solemn ring. The academy's motto is \"Talent and Taste\" (\"Snille och Smak\" in Swedish). The academy's primary purpose is to further the \"purity, strength, and sublimity of the Swedish language\" (\"Svenska Spr\u00e5kets renhet, styrka och h\u00f6ghet\") (Walshe, 1965).\nThe academy's statutes was drawn up by Gustav III himself. The specified tasks for the Academy included to compile a dictionary of the Swedish language and arrange annual competions in oratory and poetry on given themes. Moreover, Gustav instructed that the Academy would hold an annual grand ceremony on 20 December, and that a medal would be struck every year to commemorate a prominent Swede.\nIn the wake of Gustav's death in 1792 the standings of the academy deteriorated, but the institution nevertheless managed to maintain its position as the nations highest authority in literary and linguistic matters.\nAfter having flourished in the mid-19th century, by the end of the century the academy, fiercly negative to new literary movements, had detoriated and was not looked upon favourably.\nAfter some initial hesitation, by the turn of the 20th century the academy accepted the task of awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature, and soon after a modernisation of the academy began with several new school writers and its first female member, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, elected.\nHeadquarters.\nThe building now known as the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building was built for the bourgeoisie. The bottom floor was used as a trading exchange (this later became the stock exchange), and the upper floor was used for balls, New Year's Eve parties, etc. When the academy was founded, the ballroom was the biggest room in Stockholm that could be heated and thus used in the winter, so the King asked if he could borrow it.\nThe academy has had its annual meeting there every year since, attended by members of the Swedish royal family. However, it was not until 1914 that the academy gained permanent use of the upper floor as their own. It is here that the academy meets and, among other business, announces the names of Nobel Prize laureates. This task arguably makes the academy one of the world's most influential literary bodies.\nThe Swedish King is the only person who, apart from the members, has the right to attend the meetings of the academy. On 3 March 2022 the Swedish King attended a weekly academy meeting, the first time a Swedish king has done so in over 200 years.\nMembers.\nMembers are elected by a secret ballot in the Academy and before the result is made public it must be submitted to the Academy's Patron, the King of Sweden, for his approval. Members of the Academy include writers, linguists, literary scholars, historians and a prominent jurist. Initially writers were in the minority in the Academy, but during the twentieth century the number of writers grew to represent more than half of The Eighteen. The Swedish Academy has a long history of being a heavily male-dominated institution, but the Academy has recently moved towards better equality. Since 20 December 2019 one third of the chairs belong to female Academy members.\nPrior to 2018 it was not possible for members of the academy to resign; membership was for life, although the academy could decide to exclude members. This happened twice to Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, who was excluded in 1794, re-elected in 1805 and excluded again in 1811. In 1989, members Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten chose to stop participating in the meetings of the academy, over its refusal to express support for Salman Rushdie when Ayatollah Khomeini condemned him to death for \"The Satanic Verses\", shortly after a third member, Werner Aspenstr\u00f6m, also stopped participating in the meetings for unspecified reasons. In 2005, Knut Ahnlund made the same decision, as a protest against the choice of Elfriede Jelinek as Nobel laureate for 2004, calling her work \"unenjoyable, violent pornography\", and stating that awarding her the prize had \"caused irreparable harm to the value of the award for the foreseeable future\". On 25 November 2017, Lotta Lotass said in an interview that she had not participated in the meetings of the academy for more than two years and did not consider herself a member any more.\nAssets.\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld's former farm at Back\u00e5kra, close to Ystad in southern Sweden, was bought in 1957 as a summer residence by Hammarskj\u00f6ld, then Secretary-General of the United Nations (1953\u20131961). The south wing of the farm is reserved as a summer retreat for the 18 members of the Swedish Academy, of which Hammarskj\u00f6ld was a member.\nOn 11 April 2019, the academy published its financial statements for the first time in its history. According to it, the academy owned financial assets worth 1.58\u00a0billion Swedish kronor at the end of 2018 (equal to $170M, \u20ac150M, or \u00a3130M).\nControversies.\n1794\u20131795 Armfelt Conspiracy and suspension of the Academy.\nIn the wake of the Academy's founder King Gustav III's death in 1792, the standing of the Swedish Academy deteriorated. In 1794, member Gustav Mauritz Armfelt was excluded from the Academy after being sentenced for treason for a conspiracy against the Swedish government, and in 1795 the Academy was suspended altogether for two years on political grounds. Armfelt was eventually reinstated in the Academy in 1805, but after being forced to exile in Russia following the coup of 1809, he was again excluded from the Academy in 1811.\n1881 Henning Hamilton affair.\nIn 1881, member Henning Hamilton was excluded from the Academy after being found guilty of embezzlement through falsifying a relative's signature.\n1989 Rushdie affair.\nFollowing the Academy meeting on 23 February 1989, members Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten resigned from their seats in protest to the Academy's refusal to condemn Iran's death decree against writer Salman Rushdie for his novel \"The Satanic Verses\", which was considered blasphemous by Moslems. \"I am so disappointed and sad that the Academy couldn't choose sides for or against Rushdie,\" Ekman said. \"The academy should have supported Rushdie, it is a question of freedom of speech.\" Gyllensten said: \"Death threats and oppression from Iranian fundamentalists are violations of everything the Academy stands for.\" Shortly after, a third member, Werner Aspenstr\u00f6m, also left his seat. Aspenstr\u00f6m did not reveal his reasons for resigning but indicated support for a stronger statement by the Academy on the Rushdie case. At the time it was not possible for a member to formally resign and be replaced, as they were elected for life, so the number of Academy members were reduced following the controversy.\nThe Academy's decision to stay with its traditional policy not to make any political statements in an effort to avoid any accusations of a politicization of the Nobel Prize in Literature was heavily criticized by various commentators in the Swedish press.\nIn March 2016, the Swedish Academy condemned the death warrant against Salman Rushdie.\n2018 controversies.\nIn April 2018, three Swedish Academy members (Klas \u00d6stergren, Kjell Espmark, and Peter Englund) resigned in response to a sexual-misconduct investigation involving author Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to the member Katarina Frostenson. Arnault was accused of sexual assault and harassment by at least 18 women. He and his wife were also accused of leaking the names of prize recipients on at least seven occasions so friends could profit from online bets. He denied all accusations, although he was later convicted of rape and sentenced to two years and six months in prison. Sara Danius, the permanent secretary, hired a law firm to investigate if Frostenson had violated the Academy's regulations by leaking any confidential information and whether Arnault had any influence on the Academy, but no legal action was taken. The investigation caused a division among the members of the Academy. Following a vote to stop Frostenson's membership, the three members resigned in protest over the decisions made by the Academy. Two former permanent secretaries, Sture All\u00e9n and Horace Engdahl, called Danius a weak leader.\nOn 10 April, Danius was requested to resign from her position by the Academy, bringing the number of empty seats to four. Although the Academy voted against removing Katarina Frostenson from the committee, she voluntarily agreed to withdraw from participating in the academy, bringing the total of withdrawals to five. Because two other seats were still vacant from the Rushdie affair, this left only 11 active members. On 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the selection of that years Nobel prize laureate would be postponed until 2019, when two laureates would be chosen. It was still technically possible to choose a 2018 laureate, as only eight active members are required to choose a recipient. However, there were concerns that the academy was not in any condition to credibly present the award.\nThe scandal was widely seen as damaging to the credibility of the prize and its authority. As noted by Andrew Brown in \"The Guardian\" in a lengthy deconstruction of the scandal: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The scandal has elements of a tragedy, in which people who set out to serve literature and culture discovered they were only pandering to writers and the people who hang around with them. The pursuit of excellence in art was entangled with the pursuit of social prestige. The academy behaved as if the meals in its clubhouse were as much an accomplishment as the work that got people elected there.\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden said a reform of the rules may be evaluated, including the introduction of the right to resign in respect of the current lifelong membership of the committee. On 5 March 2019, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature would once again be awarded, and laureates for both 2018 and 2019 would be announced together. The decision came after several changes were made to the structure of the Swedish Academy as well as to the Nobel Committee members selection, to \"[restore] trust in the Academy as a prize-awarding institution\". On 19 November, the Swedish Academy added five temporary external members to help its five-strong Nobel Committee in their deliberations for the 2019 and 2020 awards: author and literary translator Gun-Britt Sundstrom; publisher Henrik Petersen; and literary critics Mikaela Blomqvist, Rebecka Karde and Kristoffer Leandoer. Just after two weeks, two of the newly added external members, Sundstrom and Leandoer, left the committee, with the latter saying the work to reform the scandal-hit Swedish Academy was taking too long. \"I leave my job in the Nobel Committee because I have neither the patience nor the time to wait for the result of the work to change that has been started,\" Leandoer said.\nThe Academy's dictionaries.\nIn pursuance of its goals of maintaining and strengthening the Swedish language, the Academy publishes three dictionaries. The first is a one-volume spelling dictionary called \"Svenska Akademiens ordlista\" (\"SAOL\"), which is in its 14th edition. The second is a multi-volume dictionary (38 volumes so far), edited on principles similar to those of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", entitled \"Svenska Akademiens Ordbok\" (\"SAOB\"), the first volume of which was published in 1893 and the last one in 2023. The third is a two-volume dictionary edited at Gothenburg University and titled \"Svensk ordbok utgiven av Svenska Akademien\" ('Swedish dictionary published by the Swedish Academy'); it covers modern Swedish and includes pronunciations, etymologies etc, as well as definitions and some examples. In addition to printed publications, all three dictionaries are also available to access free of charge online at svenska.se.\nIn addition to the dictionaries the Academy has also published a four-volume grammar of the Swedish language (\"Svenska Akademiens grammatik\", SAG) aimed at researchers, linguists and university students among others, as well as a single-volume counterpart for those requiring something less comprehensive (\"Svenska Akademiens spr\u00e5kl\u00e4ra\", SAS).\nAwards and prizes.\nThe Swedish Academy annually awards nearly 50 different prizes and scholarships, most of them for domestic Swedish authors. Common to all is that they are awarded without competition and without application.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature.\nSince 1901, the Swedish Academy has annually decided who will be the laureate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded in memory of the donor Alfred Nobel. It is awarded at a ceremony on 10 December with the laureate receiving a medal, a diploma and, as of 2024, 11 million Swedish crowns.\nThe Great Prize.\nSwedish: Stora Priset, literally the Great Prize, was instituted by King Gustav III. The prize, which consists of a single gold medal, is the most prestigious award that can be awarded by the Swedish Academy. It has been awarded to, among others, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f (1904 and 1909), Herbert Tingsten (1966), Astrid Lindgren (1971), Evert Taube (1972) and Tove Jansson (1994).\nDobloug Prize.\nThe Dobloug Prize, one of the Academy's largest prizes at $40,000, is a literature prize awarded for Swedish and Norwegian fiction. It was first awarded in 1951 to Arnulf \u00d8verland and Eyvind Johnson. Since 1985, two authors from each country are awarded.\nThe Nordic Prize.\nThe Swedish Academy Nordic Prize was established at the Swedish Academy's 200th jubilee in 1986 and with a prize sum of 400\u00a0000 Swedish crowns is the largest prize the Academy awards after the Nobel Prize in Literature. Among others, it has been awarded to William Heinesen (1987), Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer (1991), Inger Christensen (1992), Klaus Rifbjerg (1999), Lars Nor\u00e9n (2003), Jon Fosse (2007), Per Olov Enquist (2010), Kjell Askildsen (2011), Sofi Oksanen (2013), Dag Solstad (2017) and Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd (2019).\nOther awards.\nOther prizes the Swedish Academy awards include Bellmanpriset, established in 1920 in memory of Carl Michael Bellman and awarded to \"a truly outstanding Swedish poet\", Kungliga priset (The Royal Prize) established in 1835 by the Swedish king Karl XIV Johan awarded to significant achievements in the Academy's fields of operation, and a number of other prizes and scholarships awarded to authors, scholars, teachers and librarians.\nCurrent members.\nThe current members of the Swedish Academy listed by seat number:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27019", "revid": "41152147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27019", "title": "South Korea", "text": "Country in East Asia\nSouth Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone, with the Yellow Sea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east. Like North Korea, South Korea claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. It has a population of about 52 million, of which half live in the Seoul metropolitan area, the ninth most populous metropolitan area in the world; other major cities include Busan, Daegu, and Incheon.\nThe Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early seventh century BC. From the mid first century BC, various polities consolidated into the rival kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. The lattermost eventually unified most of the peninsula for the first time in the late seventh century AD, while Balhae succeeded Goguryeo in the north. The Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) achieved lasting unification and established the basis for the modern Korean identity. The subsequent Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131897) generated cultural, economic, and scientific achievements and also established isolationism starting from the mid-17th century. The succeeding Korean Empire (1897\u20131910) sought modernization and reform but was annexed in 1910 into the Empire of Japan. Japanese rule ended following Japan's surrender in World War II, after which Korea was divided into two zones: the Soviet-occupied northern zone and the United States-occupied southern zone. After negotiations on reunification failed, the southern zone became the Republic of Korea in August 1948, while the northern zone became the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea the following month.\nIn 1950, a North Korean invasion triggered the Korean War, one of the first major proxy conflicts of the Cold War, which saw extensive fighting involving the American-led United Nations Command and the Soviet-backed People's Volunteer Army from China. The war ended in 1953 with an armistice and left three million Koreans dead and the economy in ruins; due to the lack of a peace treaty, the Korean conflict is still ongoing. South Korea endured a series of dictatorships punctuated by coups, revolutions, and violent uprisings, but also experienced a soaring economy and one of the fastest rises in average GDP per capita, leading to its emergence as one of the Four Asian Tigers. The June Democratic Struggle of 1987 ended authoritarian rule and led to the establishment of the current Sixth Republic.\nSouth Korea is now considered among the most advanced democracies in continental and East Asia. Under the 1987 constitution, it maintains a unitary presidential republic with a popularly elected unicameral legislature, the National Assembly. South Korea is a major non-NATO ally of the United States and is regarded as a regional power in East Asia and an emerging power in global affairs; its conscription-based armed forces are ranked as one of the strongest in the world and have the second highest number of military and paramilitary personnel. A highly developed country, South Korea's economy is ranked 14th largest in the world by nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP; it is the world's eleventh-largest exporter and seventh-largest importer.\nSouth Korea performs well in metrics of education, human development, democratic governance, and innovation. It has one of the world's longest life expectances, though its population is aging rapidly and has the lowest fertility rate in the world. South Korea has some of the fastest Internet connection speeds and densest high-speed railway networks. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture, particularly in music, TV dramas, and cinema, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean Wave. South Korea is a member of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, the G20, the IPEF, and the Paris Club.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Korea\" is an exonym derived from the historical Korean kingdom name \"Goryeo\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; MR:\u00a0). \"Goryeo\" was the shortened name officially adopted by Goguryeo in the 5th century and the name of its 10th-century successor state Goryeo. Visiting Arab and Persian merchants pronounced its name as \"Korea\". The modern name of Korea appears in the first Portuguese maps of 1568 by Jo\u00e3o vaz Dourado as \"Conrai\" and later in the late 16th century and early 17th century as \"Corea\" (Korea) in the maps of Teixeira Albernaz of 1630.\nThe Kingdom of Goryeo became first known to Westerners when Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca in 1511 and described the people who traded in this part of the world as the \"Gores\". Despite the coexistence of the spellings \"Corea\" and \"Korea\" in 19th-century publications, some Koreans believe that Imperial Japan intentionally standardized the spelling of \"Korea\" in order to make Japan appear first alphabetically during occupation.\nAfter Goryeo was replaced by the Kingdom of Joseon (; ; ) in 1392, Joseon became the official name for the entire territory, though it was not universally accepted. The new official name was derived from the ancient kingdom of Gojoseon. In 1897, King Gojong changed the country's official name from \"Joseon\" to the Korean Empire (; ; ; ; lit.\u00a0Great Han Empire). The latter half of the Korean Empire's name \"Daehan\" (; ; lit.\u00a0Great Han) derives from Samhan (Three Han), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula. However, the name \"Joseon\" was still widely used by Koreans to refer to their country, even though it was no longer the official name. Under Japanese rule, the two names \"Han\" and \"Joseon\" coexisted.\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, in 1945, the \"Republic of Korea\" was adopted as the legal English name for the new country. The Korean name \"Daehan Minguk\" (; ; lit.\u00a0Great Han Republic) is sometimes used by South Koreans as a metonym to refer to the Korean nation as a whole, rather than just the South Korean state.\nHistory.\nAncient Korea.\nThe Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period.\nAccording to Korea's founding mythology, the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as \"Gojoseon\", or \"Old Joseon\", to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BC by the legendary Dangun. Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century. Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of Manchuria. Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century BC, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. In 108 BC, the Han dynasty defeated Wiman Joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the Lelang commandery remained a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive Chinese dynasties ruling for four centuries, until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313. \nThe linguistic homeland of Proto-Koreans is located somewhere in southern Siberia/Manchuria, such as the Liao River area or the Amur River area. Proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speaking Yayoi and likely causing their migration to the Japanese archipelago.\nThree Kingdoms of Korea.\nDuring the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms period, the states of Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and Samhan occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the Three Kingdoms of Korea emerged: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.\nGoguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu, who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to contesting control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War, in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.\nBaekje was a maritime power, sometimes called the \"Phoenicia of East Asia\". Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and spreading continental culture to Japan. Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo, but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its advantage.\nIn 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the Northern and Southern States period, in which relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful. Balhae, a Goguryeo successor state founded by a general, controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and was called the \"Prosperous Country in the East\". In addition to Koreans, there were many other ethnicities such as the Mohe, Turkic, and Chinese.\nLate Silla was a wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju grew to become the fourth largest city in the world. It experienced a golden age of art and culture, exemplified by monuments such as Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and the Emille Bell. It also carried on the maritime legacy and prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea, and Japan, most notably during the time of Chang Pogo. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River. However, Silla was later weakened due to internal strife and the revival of successor states Baekje and Goguryeo, which culminated into the Later Three Kingdoms period in the late 9th century.\nBuddhism flourished during this time. Many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhist circles and greatly contributed to Chinese Buddhism. Examples of significant Korean Buddhists from this period include Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.\nUnified dynasties.\nIn 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by Wang Geon, who established Goryeo as a successor state to Goguryeo. Balhae had fallen to the Khitan Empire in 926, and a decade later the last crown prince of Balhae fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type printing press. After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.\nHowever, the Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to Kublai Khan, who accepted and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince. Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations' royalty became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses. In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered Liaoyang, and defeated invasions by the Red Turbans. However, in 1392, General Yi Seong-gye, who had been ordered to attack China, turned his army around and staged a successful coup.\nYi Seong-gye established the House of Yi, renamed the nation to Joseon in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of Seoul). The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education, among them the creation of Hangul by Sejong the Great to promote literacy among the common people. The prevailing ideology of the time was Neo-Confucianism, which was epitomized by the seonbi class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598, Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched invasions of Korea, but the advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the Joseon Navy led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his renowned \"turtle ship\") with assistance from righteous army militias formed by Korean civilians, and Ming dynasty Chinese troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the Manchus took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637. After normalizing relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.\nIn the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state. Additionally, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it the nickname \"the hermit kingdom\" became increasingly ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This was exemplified by the Joseon\u2013United States Treaty of 1882, which forced Joseon to open its borders.\nJapanese occupation and World War II.\nIn the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the First Sino-Japanese War against Qing China and the Russo-Japanese War against the Russian Empire. In 1897, King Gojong, the last king of Korea, proclaimed Joseon as the Korean Empire. However, Japan compelled Korea to become its protectorate in 1905 and formally annexed it in 1910. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed. This led to the March First Movement protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in China. Among the resistance groups was Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.\nTowards the end of World War II, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a U.S. zone and a Soviet zone. Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III suggested the 38th parallel as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.\nDivision of Korea.\nDespite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the division of Korea into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.\nIn the South, the United States appointed and supported the former head of the Korean Provisional Government Syngman Rhee as leader. Rhee won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May 1948. In the North, the Soviets backed a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, Kim Il Sung, who was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September.\nIn October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il Sung's government as sovereign over both the north and south. The UN declared Rhee's government as \"a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult\" and the government \"based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission\" in addition to a statement that \"this is the only such government in Korea.\" Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression of political opponents. South Korea requested military support from the United States but was denied, while North Korea's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.\nKorean War.\nOn June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War's first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the One-People Principle, an effort to build an obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to nationalism.\nThe 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War, making it one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era. In addition, virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed by the war.\nMiracle on the Han River.\nIn 1960, a student uprising (the \"April Revolution\") led to the resignation of the autocratic President Syngman Rhee. This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by the weak and ineffectual Second Republic. This instability was broken by the May 16, 1961 coup led by General Park Chung Hee. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid export-led economic growth enforced by political repression. Under Park, South Korea took an active role in the Vietnam War.\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a new constitution, which gave the president dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The Korean economy developed significantly during Park's tenure, largely due to investment in family-run conglomerates. The government developed the nationwide expressway system, the Seoul subway system, and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with his assassination on 26 October, 1979.\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General Chun Doo-hwan led the coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth. On May 17, 1980, Chun forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to Jeju Island. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the events of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly widespread in Gwangju, to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the 18\u201327 May 1980 Gwangju Democratization Movement at the cost of probably 500 to 2,000 civilian lives and 26 dead soldiers (half of them by friendly fire).\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a Seoul National University student, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death. On June 10, the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the incident, igniting the June Democratic Struggle across the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the Democratic Justice Party, and its leader, Roh Tae-woo, announced the June 29 Declaration, which promised a democratic election of the president.\nDemocracy.\nRoh Tae-woo went on to win the 1987 election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam. Seoul hosted the Olympic Games in 1988, which was widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South Korea's global image and economy.\nSouth Korea was formally invited to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile). He won against the backdrop of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, where he took IMF advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.\nIn June 2000, as part of President Kim Dae-jung's \"Sunshine Policy\" of engagement, a North\u2013South summit took place in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, now ruled by Kim Il Sung's son Kim Jong Il. Later that year, Kim received the Nobel Peace Prize \"for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular\". However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North Korean provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President Lee Myung-bak, former mayor of Seoul. While South Korean and Japanese relations improved when they jointly co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup, it later soured because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the Liancourt Rocks.\nIn 2010, there was an escalation in attacks by North Korea. In March 2010 the South Korean warship ROKS \"Cheonan\" was sunk killing 46 South Korean sailors, allegedly by a North Korean submarine. In November 2010 Yeonpyeongdo was attacked by a significant North Korean artillery barrage, with 4 people dying. The official UN report declined to explicitly name North Korea as the perpetrator for the \"Cheonan\" sinking. The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both South Korea and the international community caused significant anger with the South Korean public.\nContemporary history.\nThe children of presidents Park Chung Hee and Kim Jong Il would take power in the two Koreas from 2011 to 2012. Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as leader of North Korea in 2011, while South Korea elected the first ever female president Park Geun-hye in the 2012 election. The conservative Park Geun-hye administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of Park's close friend Choi Soon-sil in state affairs. There followed a series of nationwide public demonstrations from November 2016, and she was removed from office. After the fallout of Park's impeachment and dismissal, elections were held and Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party won the presidency, immediately taking office on May 10, 2017. His tenure saw an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In April 2018, Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail and convicted of abuse of power and corruption. The COVID-19 pandemic caused South Korea to record more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.\nIn March 2022, Yoon Suk Yeol, the candidate of the conservative opposition People Power Party, won a close election over Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung by the narrowest margin in the history of the Sixth Republic and was sworn in on May 10, 2022. He declared martial law on December 3, 2024, accusing the opposition of being pro-North Korean and conducting anti-state activities. After several hours, the National Assembly voted to nullify the declaration in a unanimous vote of 190/0, causing Yoon to end martial law early on December 4. Yoon's actions resulted in his impeachment on December 14, 2024, followed by his unanimous removal from office on April 4, 2025. Lee Jae-myung won the election to succeed Yoon, immediately taking office on June 4, 2025.\nGeography.\nSouth Korea occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, which extends some from the Continental and East Asian mainland. This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the Yellow Sea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east. Its southern tip lies on the Korea Strait and the East China Sea. The country, including all its islands, lies between latitudes 33\u00b0 and 39\u00b0N, and longitudes 124\u00b0 and 130\u00b0E. Its total area is .\nSouth Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains; a western region of broad coastal plains, river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the Nakdong River. South Korea is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Central Korean deciduous forests, Manchurian mixed forests, and Southern Korea evergreen forests. South Korea's terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not arable. Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, make up only 30% of the total land area. South Korea has 20 national parks and popular natural areas such as the Boseong Tea Fields, Suncheon Bay Ecological Park, and Jirisan.\nAbout 3,000 islands lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea, the vast majority small and uninhabited. Jeju Island, the country's largest island, is about off the southern coast of South Korea. Hallasan, a dormant volcano, is South Korea's highest point and reaches above sea level. The easternmost islands of South Korea are Ulleungdo and the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima), while Marado and Socotra Rock are the southernmost islands of South Korea.\nClimate.\nSouth Korea tends to have a humid continental climate and a humid subtropical climate, and is affected by the East Asian monsoon, with precipitation heavier in summer during a short rainy season called \"jangma\", which begins end of June and lasts through the end of July. In Seoul, the average January temperature range is , and the average August temperature range is . Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior. Summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding in most parts of the country. South Korea has four distinct seasons; spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring usually lasts from late March to early May, summer from mid-May to early September, autumn from mid-September to early November, and winter from mid-November to mid-March.\nRainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer typhoons that bring strong winds, heavy rains and sometimes floods. The average annual precipitation varies from in Seoul to in Busan.\nEnvironment.\nDuring the first 20 years of South Korea's growth surge, little effort was made to preserve the environment. Unchecked industrialization and urban development have resulted in deforestation and destruction of wetlands such as the Songdo Tidal Flat. However, there have been recent efforts to balance these problems, including a government run $84 billion five-year green growth project that aims to boost energy efficiency and green technology.\nThe climate initiative utilizes nearly two percent of the national GDP and facilitates creation of a nationwide bike network, solar and wind energy, decreasing combustion vehicles, backing daylight saving time and replacing obsolete lighting products in favor of environmentally friendly technologies such as LEDs. The country plans to build a nationwide next-generation network that will be 10 times faster than broadband facilities, in order to reduce energy usage.\nThe renewable portfolio standard program with renewable energy certificates runs from 2012 to 2022.\nQuota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more difficult to design and implement than a feed-in tariff. Around 350 residential micro combined heat and power units were installed in 2012. In 2017, South Korea was the world's seventh largest emitter of carbon emissions and the fifth largest emitter per capita. President Moon Jae-in pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero in 2050.\nSeoul's tap water recently became safe to drink, with city officials branding it \"Arisu\" in a bid to convince the public. Efforts have also been made with afforestation projects; South Korea had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.02/10, ranking it 87th globally out of 172 countries. Another multibillion-dollar project was the restoration of Cheonggyecheon, a stream running through downtown Seoul that had previously been paved over by a motorway. One major challenge is air quality, with acid rain, sulfur oxides, and annual yellow dust storms; however, many of these difficulties are a result of South Korea's proximity to China, which is a major air polluter.\nSouth Korea is a member of the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity Treaty, Kyoto Protocol (forming the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), regarding UNFCCC, with Mexico and Switzerland), Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (not into force), Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, and Whaling.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Like many democratic states, South Korea has a government divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. Local governments are semi-autonomous and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. South Korea is a constitutional democracy.\nThe constitution has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence. However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive. Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the Sixth Republic of Korea. The first direct election was also held in 1948.\nAlthough South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy. Today, the CIA World Factbook describes South Korea's democracy as a \"fully functioning modern democracy\", while \"The Economist Democracy Index\" classifies it as a \"full democracy\", ranking at 24th out of 167 countries in 2022. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices South Korea is the 3rd most electoral democratic country in Asia as of 2023. However, some political experts has argued that South Korea has been experiencing democratic backsliding and the reemergence of authoritarianism, particularly under the presidency of Yoon Suk Yeol, which culminated when he declared martial law for the first time since the 1980 military coup d'\u00e9tat after the assassination of dictator Park Chung Hee, and the first since democratization in 1987. South Korea is ranked 33rd on the Corruption Perceptions Index (6th in the Asia\u2013Pacific region), with a score of 63 out of 100.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe major administrative divisions in South Korea are eleven provinces, three special self-governing provinces, six metropolitan cities (self-governing cities that are not part of any province), one special metropolitan city and one special self-governing city.\nForeign relations.\nSouth Korea has been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. On January 1, 2007, former South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon served as UN Secretary-General from 2007 to 2016. South Korea has developed links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of \"ASEAN Plus three\", a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS). In November 2009, South Korea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member. South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010, a year that saw South Korea and the European Union conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) to reduce trade barriers. South Korea went on to sign a Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Australia in 2014, and another with New Zealand in 2015. South Korea and Britain have agreed to extend a period of low or zero tariffs on bilateral trade of products with parts from the European Union in October 2023.\nNorth Korea.\nBoth North and South Korea claim complete sovereignty over the entire peninsula and outlying islands. Despite mutual animosity, reconciliation efforts have continued since the initial separation between North and South Korea. Political figures such as Kim Ku worked to reconcile the two governments even after the Korean War. With longstanding animosity following the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace. On October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.\nDespite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006, 2009, and 2013. By early 2009, relationships between North and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles, ended its former agreements with South Korea, and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned. North and South Korea are still technically at war (having never signed a peace treaty after the Korean War) and share the world's most heavily fortified border. In January 2024, in response to increasing tensions, North Korea abandoned peaceful reunification plans and labeled South Korea as the most hostile country to North Korea.\nChina and Russia.\nHistorically, Korea had close relations with the dynasties in China, and some Korean kingdoms were members of the Imperial Chinese tributary system. The Korean kingdoms also ruled over some Chinese kingdoms including the Khitan people and the Manchurians before the Qing dynasty and received tributes from them. In modern times, before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation. However, after World War\u00a0II, the People's Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States. The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually, and South Korea and the PRC re-established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992. The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo, and South Korean\u2013Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992. The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) upon gaining official relations with the People's Republic of China, which does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. China has become South Korea's largest trading partner by far, sending 26% of South Korean exports in 2016 worth $124 billion, as well as an additional $32 billion worth of exports to Hong Kong. South Korea is also China's fourth largest trading partner, with $93 billion of Chinese imports in 2016.\nFollowing the Korean War, the Soviet Union's relation with North Korea resulted in little contact until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since the 1990s, there has been greater trade and cooperation between the two nations.\nJapan.\nKorea and Japan have had difficult relations since ancient times but also significant cultural exchange, with Korea acting as the gateway between East Asia and Japan. Contemporary perceptions of Japan are still largely defined by Japan's 35-year colonization of Korea in the 20th century, which is generally regarded in South Korea as having been very negative. There were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan directly after independence at the end of World War\u00a0II in 1945. South Korea and Japan eventually signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. Japan is today South Korea's third largest trading partner, with 12% ($46 billion) of exports in 2016.\nLongstanding issues such as Japanese war crimes against Korean civilians, the negationist re-writing of Japanese textbooks relating Japanese atrocities during World War\u00a0II, the territorial disputes over the Liancourt Rocks, known in South Korea as \"Dokdo\" and in Japan as \"Takeshima\", and visits by Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, honoring Japanese people (civilians and military) killed during the war continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations. The Liancourt Rocks were the first Korean territories to be forcibly colonized by Japan in 1905. Although it was again returned to Korea along with the rest of its territory in 1951 with the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan does not recant on its claims that the Liancourt Rocks are Japanese territory. In 2009, in response to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, President Roh Moo-hyun suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan in 2009. A summit between the nations' leaders was eventually held on February 9, 2018, during the Korean held Winter Olympics. South Korea asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and the IOC said in a statement \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement was approved in September 2010, and took effect on July 1, 2011. South Korea is the EU's tenth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South Korea's fourth largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded \u20ac90 billion in 2015 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 9.8% between 2003 and 2013.\nThe EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve the current geopolitical situation.\nUnited States.\nA close relationship with the United States began directly after World War II, when the United States temporarily administered Korea for three years (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea). Upon the onset of the Korean War in 1950, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South and subsequently fought as the largest contributor of UN troops. The United States participation was critical for preventing the near defeat of the Republic of Korea by northern forces, as well as fighting back for the territory gains that define the South Korean nation today.\nFollowing the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a \"Mutual Defense Treaty\", under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both. In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.\nThe two nations also share a close economic relationship, with the U.S. being South Korea's second largest trading partner, receiving $66 billion in exports in 2016. In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries. On October 12, 2011, the U.S. Congress passed the long-stalled trade agreement with South Korea. It went into effect on March 15, 2012.\nMilitary.\nUnresolved tension with North Korea has prompted South Korea to allocate 2.6% of its GDP and 13.2% of all government spending to its military (government share of GDP: 14.967%), while maintaining compulsory conscription for men. Consequently, the ROK Armed Forces is one of the largest and most powerful standing armed forces in the world with a reported personnel strength of 3,600,000 in 2022 (500,000 active and 3,100,000 reserve).\nThe South Korean military consists of the Army (ROKA), the Navy (ROKN), the Air Force (ROKAF), and the Marine Corps (ROKMC), and reserve forces. Many of these forces are concentrated near the Korean Demilitarized Zone. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically 18 months. In addition Korean Augmentation to the United States Army is a branch of the Republic of Korea Army that consists of Korean enlisted personnel who are augmented to the Eighth United States Army. In 2010, South Korea spent \u20a91.68 trillion in a cost-sharing agreement with the U.S. to provide budgetary support to the U.S. forces in Korea, on top of the \u20a929.6 trillion budget for its own military.\nFrom time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years. South Korea dispatched 325,517 troops to fight in the Vietnam War, with a peak strength of 50,000. In 2004, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help rebuilding in northern Iraq, and was the third largest contributor in the coalition forces after the U.S. and Britain. Beginning in 2001, South Korea had deployed 24,000 troops in the Middle East region to support the war on terror.\nThe right to conscientious objection was not recognized in South Korea until recently. Over 400 men were typically imprisoned at any given time for refusing military service for political or religious reasons in the years before right to conscientious objection was established. On June 28, 2018, the South Korean Constitutional Court ruled the Military Service Act unconstitutional and ordered the government to accommodate civilian forms of military service for conscientious objectors. On November 1, 2018, the South Korean Supreme Court legalized conscientious objection as a basis for rejecting compulsory military service.\nUnited States contingent.\nThere is a substantial United States military presence in South Korea. There are approximately 28,500 U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea, most of them serving one year unaccompanied tours. The U.S. troops, which are primarily ground and air units, are assigned to United States Forces Korea and mainly assigned to the Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and Naval Forces Korea. They are stationed in installations at Osan, Kunsan, Yongsan, Dongducheon, Sungbuk, Camp Humphreys, and Daegu, as well as at Camp Bonifas in the DMZ Joint Security Area.\nA fully functioning UN Command is at the top of the chain of command of all forces in South Korea, including the U.S. forces and the entire South Korean military\u00a0\u2013 if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves. There has been long-term agreement between the United States and South Korea that South Korea should eventually assume the lead for its own defense. This transition to a South Korean command has been slow and often postponed, although it is currently scheduled to occur in the 2020s.\nEconomy.\nSouth Korea's mixed economy is the 14th largest by nominal GDP and the 14th largest GDP by purchasing power parity in the world, identifying it as one of the G20 major economies. It is a developed country with a high-income economy and is the most industrialized member country of the OECD. South Korean brands such as LG Electronics and Samsung are internationally famous and garnered South Korea's reputation for its quality electronics and other manufactured goods. South Korea became a member of the OECD in 1996.\nIts massive investment in education has taken the country from mass illiteracy to a major international technological powerhouse. The country's national economy benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. South Korea's economy was one of the world's fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and was still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, the other three Asian Tigers. It recorded the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990. South Koreans refer to this growth as the Miracle on the Han River. The South Korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2014, South Korea was the fifth-largest exporter and seventh-largest importer in the world. In addition, the country has one of the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves.\nDespite the economy's high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on its financial markets. The International Monetary Fund compliments the resilience of the economy against various economic crises, citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address financial emergencies. Although it was severely harmed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the country managed a rapid recovery and subsequently tripled its GDP.\nFurthermore, South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession during the 2008 financial crisis. Its economic growth rate reached 6.2% in 2010 (the fastest growth for eight years after significant growth by 7.2% in 2002), a sharp recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2% in 2009 during the Great Recession. The unemployment rate also remained low in 2009 at 3.6%.\nTransportation.\nSouth Korea has a technologically advanced transport network consisting of high-speed railways, highways, bus routes, ferry services, and air routes that crisscross the country. Korea Expressway Corporation operates the toll highways and service amenities en route. Korail provides train services to all major South Korean cities. Two rail lines, Gyeongui and Donghae Bukbu Line, to North Korea are being reconnected. The Korean high-speed rail system, KTX, provides high-speed service along Gyeongbu and Honam Line. Major cities such as Seoul, Busan, and Daegu have urban rapid transit systems. Express bus terminals are available in most cities.\nThe main gateway and largest airport is Incheon International Airport, serving 58 million passengers in 2016. Other international airports include Gimpo, Busan and Jeju. There are also many airports that were built as part of the infrastructure boom but are barely used. The national carrier Korean Air served over 26 million passengers, including almost 19 million international passengers in 2016. Asiana Airlines also serves domestic and international traffic. Combined, South Korean airlines serve 297 international routes. Smaller airlines, such as Jeju Air, provide domestic service with lower fares.\nEnergy.\nSouth Korea is the world's fifth-largest nuclear power producer and the third-largest in Asia as of 2010[ [update]]. Supplying 45% of its electricity production, nuclear research is very active with research into a variety of advanced reactors, including small modular reactors, liquid-metal fast/transmutation reactors and high-temperature hydrogen generation reactors. Fuel production and waste handling technologies have also been developed locally. It is also a member of the ITER project.\nSouth Korea is an emerging exporter of nuclear reactors, having concluded agreements with the United Arab Emirates to build and maintain four advanced nuclear reactors, with Jordan for a research nuclear reactor, and with Argentina for construction and repair of heavy-water nuclear reactors. As of 2010[ [update]], South Korea and Turkey are in negotiations regarding construction of two nuclear reactors. South Korea is also preparing to bid on construction of a light-water nuclear reactor for Argentina.\nSouth Korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own due to U.S. political pressure, unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors in the international nuclear market. This impediment to South Korea's indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies. While successful in exporting its electricity-generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors, it cannot capitalize on the market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries, preventing it from further expanding its export niche. South Korea has sought unique technologies such as pyroprocessing to circumvent these obstacles and seek a more advantageous competition. The U.S. has recently been wary of the burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.\nSouth Korea is the 2nd highest ranked Continental Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index after Singapore\u2014an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. South Korea ranks 9th worldwide.\nTourism.\nSouth Korean tourism is driven by many factors, including the prominence of Korean pop culture such as South Korean pop music and television dramas, known as the Korean Wave or \"Hallyu\", has gained popularity throughout the world. The Hyundai Research Institute reported that the Korean Wave has a direct influence on encouraging direct foreign investment back into the country through demand for products, and the tourism industry. Among East Asian countries, China was the most receptive, investing $1.4 billion in South Korea, with much of the investment within its service sector, a sevenfold increase from 2001. In 2019, more than 17 million foreign tourists visited South Korea.\nAccording to an analysis by economist Han Sang-Wan, a 1% increase in the exports of Korean cultural content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083%, while a 1% increase in Korean pop content exports to a country produces a 0.019% bump in tourism.\nNational pension scheme.\nThe South Korean pension system was created to provide benefits to persons reaching old age, families and persons stricken with death of their primary breadwinner, and for the purposes of stabilizing the nation's welfare state. The structure is primarily based on taxation and is income-related. The system is divided into four categories distributing benefits to participants through national, military personnel, governmental, and private school teacher pension schemes. The national pension scheme is the primary welfare system providing allowances to the majority of persons. Eligibility for the national pension scheme is not dependent on income but on age and residence, where those between the ages of 18 and 59 are covered. Anyone under 18 is a dependent of someone who is covered or under a special exclusion where they are allowed to alternative provisions. The national pension scheme is divided into four categories of insured persons \u2013 the workplace-based insured, the individually insured, the voluntarily insured, and the voluntarily and continuously insured. An old-age pension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20 years of national pension coverage beforehand.\nScience and technology.\nScientific and technological development in South Korea at first did not occur largely because of more pressing matters such as the division of Korea and the Korean War that occurred right after its independence. It was not until the 1960s under the dictatorship of Park Chung Hee when South Korea's economy rapidly grew from industrialization and the chaebol corporations such as Samsung, LG, and SK. Ever since the industrialization of South Korea's economy, South Korea has placed its focus on technology-based corporations, which has been supported by infrastructure developments by the government.\nSouth Korea leads the OECD in graduates in science and engineering. From 2014 to 2019, the country ranked first among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. It was ranked 4th in the Global Innovation Index in 2025. Republic of Korea South Korea today is known as a launchpad of a mature mobile market that allows developers to reap benefits of a market where very few technology constraints exist. There is a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, utilizing the 4G and 5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea has the infrastructures to meet a high density of population and culture; this, along with high revenues, allows South Korean-only tech startups to reach valuations of $1 billion and above, a peak usually reserved for startups growing in several countries.\nTotal spending for research\u00a0and development grew from about 3.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013\u00a0to more than 4.9% in 2022 and was thus the second-highest in the world, only behind Israel which spent 5.9%. In 2023 the government\u00a0announced a spending cut by about\u00a011% for 2024 and the intention to shift resources to new initiatives, such as efforts to build rockets, pursue biomedical research, and develop US-style biotech innovation.\nCyber security.\nFollowing cyberattacks in the first half of 2013, whereby government, news-media, television station, and bank websites were compromised, the national government committed to the training of 5,000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017. The South Korean government blamed North Korea for these attacks, as well as incidents that occurred in 2009, 2011 and 2012, but Pyongyang denies the accusations. South Korea's government maintains a broad-ranging approach toward the regulation of specific online content and imposes a substantial level of censorship on election-related discourse and on many websites that the government deems subversive or socially harmful.\nAerospace engineering.\nSouth Korea has sent up 10 satellites since 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably Arirang-1 in 1999, and Arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with Russia. Arirang-1 was lost in space in 2008, after nine years in service. In April 2008, Yi So-yeon became the first Korean to fly in space, aboard the Russian Soyuz TMA-12.\nIn June 2009, the first spaceport of South Korea, Naro Space Center, was completed at Goheung, South Jeolla Province. The launch of Naro-1 in January 2013 was a success, after two previous failed attempts.\nEfforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle have been marred by persistent political pressure from the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea's indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which Korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by US-Korea agreements on restriction of rocket technology research and development. South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology. The two failed KSLV-I launch vehicles were based on the Universal Rocket Module, the first stage of the Russian Angara rocket, combined with a solid-fueled second stage built by South Korea.\nOn October 21, 2021, the KSLV-2 Nuri was successfully launched, making South Korea a country with indigenous orbital launch capability.\nRobotics.\nRobotics has been included in the list of main national research and development projects since 2003. In 2009, the government announced plans to build robot-themed parks in Incheon and Masan with a mix of public and private funding. In 2005, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed the world's second walking humanoid robot, HUBO. A team in the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology developed the first Korean android, EveR-1 in May 2006.\nEveR-1 has been succeeded by more complex models with improved movement and vision.\nPlans of creating English-teaching robot assistants to compensate for the shortage of teachers were announced in February 2010, with the robots being deployed to most preschools and kindergartens by 2013. Robotics are also incorporated in the entertainment sector; the \"Korean Robot Game Festival\" has been held every year since 2004 to promote science and robot technology.\nBiotechnology.\nSince the 1980s, the government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry. The medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics. Research and development in genetics and cloning has received increasing attention, with the first successful cloning of a dog, Snuppy in 2005, and the cloning of two females of an endangered species of gray wolves by the Seoul National University in 2007. The rapid growth of the industry has resulted in significant voids in regulation of ethics, as was highlighted by the scientific misconduct case involving Hwang Woo-Suk.\nSince late 2020, SK Bioscience Inc. (a division of SK Group) has been producing a major proportion of the Vaxzevria vaccine (also known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca), under license from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, for worldwide distribution through the COVAX facility under the WHO hospice. A recent agreement with Novavax expands its production for a second vaccine to 40 million doses in 2022, with a $450 million investment in domestic and overseas facilities.\nDemographics.\nSouth Korea had an estimated population of roughly 51.7 million in 2022. The population more than doubled from 21.5 million in 1955 to 50 million by 2010. However, it is expected to peak at 52 million in 2024 and decline to 36 million in 2072, owing to a rapid decline in birth rates that began in 1960. South Korea's birth rate became the world's lowest in 2009, at an annual rate of approximately 9 births per 1000 people. Fertility saw some modest increase afterwards, but dropped to a new global low in 2017, with fewer than 30,000 births per month for the first time since records began, and less than one child per woman in 2018. In 2020, the country recorded more deaths than births, resulting in the first population decrease since modern records began.\nBy 2021, the fertility rate stood at just 0.81 children per woman, well below the replacement rate of 2.1, falling to 0.78 in 2022 and 0.72 in 2023\u2014the lowest in the world. Consequently, South Korea has seen the steepest decline in working age population among OECD nations; the proportion of people aged 65 years and over is slated to reach over 20% by 2025 and close to 45% by 2050. The low birth rate has been declared a \"national emergency\" and prompted the creation of a new ministry in May 2024 dedicated to reversing the trend and addressing issues related to aging, immigration, and the workforce. The government has also launched various incentives to help entice families to have children, including a cash allowance for newborns and greater funding of childcare and fertility treatments.\nGovernment policy, along with a rebound in marriages delayed by COVID-19, may account for the Korean birth rate increasing in late 2024; total births in the third quarter were up 8% from the same period last year, marking the largest quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2012 and the first annual rise in total fertility since 2015. Data released in January 2025 show the number of births in November 2024 was 20,095, a 14.6% increase year-on-year, the highest growth rate since November 2010 (which recorded a 17.5% increase), and the third consecutive month of double-digit growth, following September's 10.1% and October's 13.4%.\nMost South Koreans live in urban areas following rapid migration from the countryside during the country's rapid economic expansion in the 1970s through the 1990s. About half the population (24.5 million) is concentrated in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, making it the world's second largest metropolitan area; other major cities include Busan (3.5 million), Incheon (3.0 million), Daegu (2.5 million), Daejeon (1.4 million), Gwangju (1.4 million) and Ulsan (1.1 million). Population density is estimated at in 2022, more than 10 times the global average.\nThe population has been shaped by international migration. After World War\u00a0II and the division of the Korean Peninsula, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration; large numbers of ethnic Koreans live overseas, sometimes in ethnic neighborhoods known as Koreatowns. The four largest diaspora populations are in China (2.3 million), the United States (1.8 million), Japan (850,000), and Canada (250,000).\nSouth Korea is among the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world, with ethnic Koreans representing approximately 96% of the total population. Precise numbers are difficult to estimate since official statistics do not record ethnicity, and many immigrants are ethnically Korean while a growing number of South Korean citizens are not. The percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly since the late 1990s, with South Korea having one of the fastest-growing foreign-born populations: As of November 2023, there was an all-time high of 2.46 million foreign residents, accounting for nearly 5 percent of the total population, compared to 2016 figures of 1.4 million foreign residents (roughly 2.75 percent of the population). Much of this growth was driven by foreign workers and international students.\nAbout 30,000 foreign born residents obtain South Korean citizenship every year since 2010; in 2023, the number of foreigners who had acquired Korean nationality was 234,506, an increase of 4.8 percent from the prior year. The number of children of foreign residents born in South Korea increased by 7,809, or 2.8 percent, to 289,886. Many foreign citizens are ethnic Koreans: migrants from China (PRC) are the largest foreign-born group both proportionally and numerically, accounting for 56.5% of foreign nationals, but approximately 70% of these Chinese citizens are (), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity. In addition, about 43,000 English teachers from English-speaking countries reside temporarily in Korea.\nCorresponding to its socioeconomic development, South Korea has experienced a dramatic increase in life expectancy, from 79.10 years in 2008 (which was 34th in the world), to 83.53 years in 2024\u2014the fifth highest of any country or territory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage.\nKorean is the official language of South Korea and is classified by most linguists as a language isolate. It incorporates a significant number of loan words from Chinese. Korean uses an indigenous writing system called Hangul, which was created in 1446 by Sejong the Great to provide a convenient alternative to the Classical Chinese Hanja characters that were difficult to learn and did not fit the Korean language well. South Korea still uses some Chinese Hanja characters in niche areas, such as print media and legal documentation.\nThe Korean language in South Korea has a standard dialect known as the Seoul dialect, with an additional four dialects (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeongsang, and Jeolla) and one language (Jeju) in use around the country. Almost all South Korean students today learn English throughout their education.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2024 results of the Korea Research's regular survey 'Public Opinion Within Public Opinion', more than half of the South Korean population (51%) declared themselves not affiliated with any religious organizations. In a 2012 survey, 52% declared themselves \"religious\", 31% said they were \"not religious\" and 15% identified themselves as \"convinced atheists\". Of the people who are affiliated with a religious organization, most are Christians and Buddhists. According to the survey, 31% of the population were Christians (20% identified themselves as Protestants, 11% as Roman Catholics) and 17% were Buddhists. Other religions include Islam (Approximately 130,000 Muslims, which includes 73% of migrant workers from Pakistan,Bangladesh and 27% accounting to 35,000 Korean Muslims), the homegrown sect of Won Buddhism, and a variety of indigenous religions, including Cheondoism (a Confucianizing religion), Jeungsanism, Daejongism, Daesun Jinrihoe, and others. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, and there is no state religion. Overall, between 2015 and 2024, there has been a slight rise in Christianity (from 27.6% to 31%), a slow rise in Buddhism (from 15.5% to 17%), and a decline in the unaffiliated population (from 56.9% to 51%).\nChristianity is South Korea's largest organized religion, accounting for more than half of all South Korean adherents of religious organizations. There are approximately 16 million Christians in South Korea today; about two thirds of them belonging to Protestant churches, and the rest to the Catholic Church. The number of Protestants had been stagnant throughout the 1990s and the 2000s but increased to a peak level throughout the 2010s. Roman Catholics increased significantly between the 1980s and the 2000s but declined throughout the 2010s. Christianity, unlike in other East Asian countries, found fertile ground in Korea in the 18th century, and by the end of the 18th century it persuaded a large part of the population, as the declining monarchy supported it and opened the country to widespread proselytism as part of a project of Westernization. The weakness of Korean shamanism, which\u2014unlike Japanese Shinto and China's religious system\u2014never developed into a national religion of high status, combined with the impoverished state of Korean Buddhism, (after 500 years of suppression at the hands of the Joseon state, by the 20th century it was virtually extinct) left a free hand to Christian churches. Christianity's similarity to native religious narratives has been studied as another factor that contributed to its success in the peninsula. The Japanese colonization of the first half of the 20th century further strengthened the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism, as the Japanese coopted native Korean shamanism into the Nipponic Imperial Shinto that they tried to establish in the peninsula. Widespread Christianization of the Koreans took place during State Shinto, after its abolition, and then in the independent South Korea as the newly established military government supported Christianity and tried to utterly oust native shamanism.\nAmong Christian denominations, Presbyterianism is the largest. About nine million people belong to one of the hundred different Presbyterian churches; the biggest ones are the HapDong Presbyterian Church, TongHap Presbyterian Church and the Koshin Presbyterian Church. South Korea is also the second-largest missionary-sending nation, after the United States.\nBuddhism was introduced to Korea in the 4th century. It soon became a dominant religion in the southeastern kingdom of Silla, the region that hitherto hosts the strongest concentration of Buddhists in South Korea. In the other states of the Three Kingdoms Period, Goguryeo and Baekje, it was made the state religion respectively in 372 and 528. It remained the state religion in Later Silla and Goryeo. It was later suppressed throughout much of the subsequent history under the unified kingdom of Joseon, which officially adopted a strict Korean Confucianism. Today, South Korea has about 8.7 million Buddhists, most of them affiliated to the Jogye Order. Most of the National Treasures of South Korea are Buddhist artifacts.\nEducation.\nA centralized administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school. The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins at the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February. The country adopted a new educational program to increase the number of foreign students through 2010. According to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea would have (under the program) doubled by that time, and the number of foreign students would have reached 100,000.\nSouth Korea is one of the top-performing Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 519, compared with the OECD average of 492, placing it ninth in the world. The country has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its highly feverish outlook on education, where its national obsession with education has been called \"education fever\". This obsession with education has catapulted the resource-poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. In 2014, South Korea ranked second worldwide (after Singapore) in the national rankings of students' math and science scores by the OECD. Higher education is a serious issue in South Korean society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is often a source of honor and pride for families and within South Korean society at large, and is seen as a fundamental necessity to channel one's social mobility to ultimately improve one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Due to the importance of education in Korean society, many students attend cram schools.\nIn 2015, the country spent 5.1% of its GDP on all levels of education\u2014roughly 0.8 percentage points above the OECD average of 4.3%. A strong investment in education, a militant drive to achieve academic success, as well as the passion for scholarly excellence has helped the resource-poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn land to a prosperous, developed country.\nHealth.\nSouth Korea has a universal health care system. According to the Health Care Index ranking, it has the world's best healthcare system as of 2021. South Korean hospitals have advanced medical equipment and facilities readily available, ranking 4th for MRI units per capita and 6th for CT scanners per capita in the OECD. It also had the OECD's second largest number of hospital beds per 1000 people at 9.56 beds. Life expectancy has been rising rapidly and South Korea ranked 6th in the world for life expectancy at 83.5 years in 2023. It also has the third highest health adjusted life expectancy in the world. Suicide in South Korea is the 12th highest in the world according to the World Health Organization, as well as the highest suicide rate in the OECD.\nCulture.\nSouth Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Historically, while the culture has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless independently managed to develop a unique cultural identity in its own right that is distinct from its larger neighbors. As of 2024[ [update]], South Korea has 24 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, along with 16 World Heritage Sites. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs. According to the 2023 edition of the Press Freedom Index, South Korea has the second highest level of press freedom in Continental and East Asia, behind Taiwan.\nIndustrialization and urbanization have brought many changes to the way modern Koreans live. Changing economic circumstances and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. A 2014 Euromonitor study on 44 countries found that South Koreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. South Koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average with Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand following.\nArt.\nKorean art has been highly influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts. Korean pottery and porcelain, such as Joseon's \"baekja\" and buncheong, and Goryeo's celadon are well known throughout the world. The Korean tea ceremony, \"pansori\", \"talchum,\" and \"buchaechum\" are also notable Korean performing arts.\nPost-war modern Korean art started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, when South Korean artists took interest in geometrical shapes and intangible subjects. Establishing a harmony between man and nature was also a favorite of this time. Because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s. Art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in Korea, which brought more diversity. The Olympic Sculpture Garden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the Whitney Biennial to Seoul, the creation of the Gwangju Biennale and the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995 were notable events.\nArchitecture.\nBecause of South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.\nTraditional Korean architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. Ancient architects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called \"ondol\". People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs and lifting eaves. Traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called \"hanok\", and special sites like Hahoe Folk Village, Yangdong Folk Village and Korean Folk Village. Traditional architecture may also be seen at several of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nWestern architecture was first introduced at the end of the 19th century. Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles. With the annexation by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed. Anti-Japanese sentiment and the Korean War led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.\nModern Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles. Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape with the opening up of the market to foreign architects. Contemporary architectural efforts have attempted to balance the traditional philosophy of \"harmony with nature\" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.\nEntertainment.\nIn addition to domestic consumption, South Korea has a thriving entertainment industry where various facets of South Korean entertainment, including television dramas, films, and popular music, have garnered international popularity and generated significant export revenues for the nation's economy. The cultural phenomenon known as \"Hallyu\" or the \"Korean Wave\", has swept many countries across Continental and East Asia making South Korea a major soft power as an exporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling Western nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom.\nUntil the 1990s, trot and traditional folk-based ballads dominated the South Korean popular music scene. The emergence of the pop group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as K-pop. Since the 1990s, the genre of K-pop has continuously engaged in a process of ongoing reinvention and modernization by assimilating various elements of popular musical genres and trends from across the world such as Western popular music, experimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, hip hop, rhythm and blues, electronic dance, reggae, country, folk, and rock on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music roots. Though Western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, electronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the contemporary South Korean popular music scene, trot still continues to be appreciated and enjoyed by older South Koreans. K-pop idols are well known across Continental Asia, have found fame in the Western World, and have generated millions of dollars in export revenue beyond the confines of the traditional East Asian music market. Many K-pop acts have also established themselves by securing a strong global following using online social media platforms such as YouTube. K-pop first began to make its mark outside of Continental and East Asia following the unexpected success of singer Psy's international music sensation, \"Gangnam Style\", which topped global music charts in 2012.\nSince the success of the film \"Shiri\" in 1999, the Korean film industry has grown substantially, garnering recognition both nation-wide and across the globe. Domestic films have a dominant share of the South Korean film market, partly because of the existence of government screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films for at least 73 days of the year. 2019's \"Parasite\", directed by Bong Joon-ho, became the highest-grossing film in South Korea as well as the first non-English language film to win Best Picture at the United States-based Academy Awards that year amongst numerous other accolades.\nSouth Korean television shows have become popular outside of Korea. Television dramas, known as K-dramas, have begun to find fame internationally. Many dramas tend to have a romantic focus. Historical dramas are also famous\".\" The 2021 survival drama \"Squid Game\", created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, received critical acclaim and widespread international attention upon its release, becoming Netflix's most-watched series at launch and garnering a viewership of more than 142 million households during its first four weeks from launch.\nHolidays.\nThe Korean New Year, or \"Seollal\", is celebrated on the first day of the Korean calendar. Korean Independence Day falls on March 1 and commemorates the March First Movement of 1919. Memorial Day is celebrated on June 6, and its purpose is to honor the men and women who died in South Korea's independence movement. Constitution Day is on July 17, and it celebrates the promulgation of Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Liberation Day, on August 15, celebrates Korea's liberation from the Empire of Japan in 1945.\nEvery 15th day of the 8th lunar month, Koreans celebrate the Midautumn Festival, in which Koreans visit their ancestral hometowns and eat a variety of traditional Korean foods. On October 1, Armed Forces Day is celebrated, honoring the military forces of South Korea. October 3 is National Foundation Day. Hangul Day on October 9 commemorates the invention of hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean language.\nCuisine.\nKorean cuisine, \"hanguk yori\", or \"hansik\", has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\nKorean cuisine is largely based on rice, noodles, tofu, vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional meals are noted for the number of side dishes, \"banchan\", which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. Kimchi, a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish, is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best-known dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with sesame oil, \"doenjang\" (a type of fermented soybean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, and \"gochujang\" (a hot pepper paste). Other well-known dishes are \"bulgogi\", grilled marinated beef; \"gimbap\"; and \"tteokbokki\", a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\nSoups are also a common part of a meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as \"guk\" are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, \"tang\" has less water and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is \"jjigae\", a stew that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\nPopular Korean alcoholic drinks include \"Soju\", \"Makgeolli\" and \"Bokbunja ju\". Korea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal chopsticks. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.\nSports.\nThe martial art taekwondo originated in Korea. In the 1950s and 1960s, modern rules were standardized, with taekwondo becoming an official Olympic sport in 2000. Other Korean martial arts include Taekkyon, hapkido, Tang Soo Do, Kuk Sool Won, kumdo and subak.\nFootball has traditionally been regarded as the most popular sport in Korea, with baseball as the second. Recent polling indicates that a majority, 41% of South Korean sports fans continue to self-identify as football fans, with baseball ranked 2nd at 25% of respondents. However, the polling did not indicate the extent to which respondents follow both sports.\nThe national football team became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. The Korea Republic national team (as it is known) has qualified for every World Cup since Mexico 1986, and has broken out of the group stage in 2002, in 2010, when it was defeated by eventual semi-finalist Uruguay in the Round of 16, and in 2022. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the bronze medal for football.\nBaseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905. Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and ticket prices for professional baseball games. The Korea Professional Baseball league, a 10-team circuit, was established in 1982. The South Korea national team finished third in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and second in the 2009 tournament. The team's 2009 final game against Japan was widely watched in Korea, with a large screen at Gwanghwamun crossing in Seoul broadcasting the game live. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the gold medal in baseball. Also in 1982, at the Baseball Worldcup, Korea won the gold medal. At the 2010 Asian Games, the Korean National Baseball team won the gold medal. Several Korean players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball.\nBasketball is a popular sport in the country as well. South Korea has traditionally had one of the top basketball teams in Asia and one of the continent's strongest basketball divisions. Seoul hosted the 1967 and 1995 Asian Basketball Championship. The Korea national basketball team has won a record number of 23 medals at the event to date.\nSouth Korea hosted the Asian Games in 1986 (Seoul), 2002 (Busan), and 2014 (Incheon). It also hosted the Winter Universiade in 1997, the Asian Winter Games in 1999, and the Summer Universiade in 2003 and 2015. In 1988, South Korea hosted the Summer Olympics in Seoul, coming fourth with 12 gold medals, 10 silver medals, and 11 bronze medals. South Korea regularly performs well in archery, shooting, table tennis, badminton, short track speed skating, handball, field hockey, freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, baseball, judo, taekwondo, speed skating, figure skating, and weightlifting. The Seoul Olympic Museum is dedicated to the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nPyeongchang hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. South Korea has won more medals in the Winter Olympics than any other Asian country, with a total of 45 (23 gold, 14 silver, and 8 bronze). At the 2010 Winter Olympics, South Korea ranked fifth in the overall medal rankings. South Korea is especially strong in short track speed skating. Speed skating and figure skating are also popular, and ice hockey is an emerging sport, with Anyang Halla winning their first ever Asia League Ice Hockey title in March 2010.\nSeoul hosted a professional triathlon race, which is part of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championship Series in 2010. In 2011, the South Korean city of Daegu hosted the 2011 IAAF World Championships in Athletics. In 2010, South Korea hosted its first Formula One race at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam. The Korean Grand Prix was held from 2010 to 2013.\nDomestic horse racing events are followed by South Koreans and Seoul Race Park in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province is located closest to Seoul out of the country's three tracks.\nCompetitive video gaming, better known as esports, has become more popular in South Korea in recent years, particularly among young people. The two most popular games are \"League of Legends\" and \"StarCraft\". The gaming scene is managed by the Korean e-Sports Association.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27020", "revid": "287161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27020", "title": "History of South Korea", "text": " \nThe history of South Korea begins with the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. At that time, South Korea and North Korea were divided, despite being the same people and on the same peninsula. In 1950, the Korean War broke out. North Korea overran South Korea until US-led UN forces intervened. At the end of the war in 1953, the border between South and North remained largely similar. Tensions between the two sides continued. South Korea alternated between dictatorship and liberal democracy. It underwent substantial economic development.\nBackground.\nAfter Japan's defeat in the Pacific War in 1945, the Korean region, which was part of Japan's territory, was occupied by American and Soviet forces. In 1948, with the end of the U.S. military government, South Korea declared its independence from Japan as the Republic of Korea. In 1952, when Japan approved the independence of the Korean region under the San Francisco Peace Treaty, it became a completely independent and sovereign nation under international law. The unconditional surrender of Japan led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones (similar to the four zones in Germany), with the United States administering the southern half of the peninsula and the Soviet Union administering the area north of the 38th parallel. This division was meant to be temporary (as was in Germany) and was first intended to return a unified Korea back to its people after the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China could arrange a single government for the peninsula.\nThe two parties were unable to agree on the implementation of a Joint Trusteeship over Korea because of 2 different opinions. This led in 1948 to the establishment of two separate governments with the two very opposite ideologies; the Communist-aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the West-aligned First Republic of Korea \u2013 each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. On 25 June 1950, the Korean War broke out. After much destruction, the war ended on 27 July 1953, with the 1948 status quo being restored, as neither the DPRK nor the First Republic had succeeded in conquering the other's portion of the divided Korea. The peninsula was divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone and the two separate governments stabilized into the existing political entities of North and South Korea.\nSouth Korea's subsequent history is marked by alternating periods of democratic and autocratic rule. Civilian governments are conventionally numbered from the First Republic of Syngman Rhee to the contemporary Sixth Republic. The First Republic, arguably democratic at its inception (though preceded by major anti-communist and anti-socialist purges), became increasingly autocratic until its collapse in 1960. The Second Republic was strongly democratic but was overthrown in under a year and replaced by an autocratic military regime. The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Republics were nominally democratic, but are widely regarded as the continuation of military rule. With the current Sixth Republic, the country has gradually stabilized into a liberal democracy.\nSince its inception, South Korea has seen substantial development in education, economy, and culture. Since the 1960s, the nation has developed from one of Asia's poorest to one of the world's wealthiest nations. Education, particularly at the tertiary level, has expanded dramatically. It is said to be one of the \"Four Tigers\" of rising Asian states along with Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.\nU.S. military administration (1945\u20131948).\nEmperor Hirohito announced the surrender of the Empire of Japan to the Allied Powers on 15 August 1945. General Order No. 1 for the surrender of Japan (prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of U.S. military forces and approved on 17 August 1945) prescribed separate surrender procedures for Japanese forces in Korea north and south of the 38th parallel. After Japan's surrender to the Allies (formalised on 2 September 1945), division at the 38th parallel marked the beginning of Soviet and U.S. occupation of the North and South, respectively. This division was meant to be temporary, to be replaced by a trusteeship of the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China which would prepare for Korean independence. The trusteeship had been discussed at the Yalta Conference in February 1945. U.S. forces landed at Incheon on 8 September 1945, and established a military government shortly thereafter. Lieutenant General John R. Hodge, their commander, took charge of the government. Faced with mounting popular discontent, in October 1945 Hodge established the Korean Advisory Council. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them. Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People's Republic of Korea and its People's Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December. A year later, an interim legislature and interim government were established, headed by Kim Kyu-shik and Syngman Rhee respectively. Political and economic chaos \u2013 arising from a variety of causes \u2013 plagued the country in this period. The after-effects of the Japanese exploitation remained in the South, as in the North. In addition, the U.S. military was largely unprepared for the challenge of administering the country, arriving with little knowledge of the language, culture or political situation. Thus many of their policies had unintended destabilizing effects. Waves of refugees from North Korea and returnees from abroad added to the turmoil.\nIn December 1945 a conference convened in Moscow to discuss the future of Korea.\nA five-year trusteeship was discussed, and a US-Soviet joint commission was established. The commission met intermittently in Seoul but deadlocked over the issue of establishing a national government. In September 1947, with no solution in sight, the United States submitted the Korean question to the UN General Assembly.\nThe resolution from the UN General Assembly called for a UN-supervised general election in Korea, but after the North rejected this proposition, a general election for a Constitutional Assembly took place in the South only, in May 1948. A constitution was adopted, setting forth a presidential form of government and specifying a four-year term for the presidency. According to the provisions of the Constitution, an indirect presidential election took place in July. Rhee Syngman, as head of the new assembly, assumed the presidency and proclaimed the Republic of Korea (South Korea) on 15 August 1948.\nFirst Republic (1948\u20131960).\nOn 15 August 1948, the Republic of Korea was formally established, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. With the establishment of Rhee's government, de jure sovereignty also passed into the new government. On 9 September 1948, a communist government, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), was proclaimed under Kim Il Sung. However, on 12 December 1948, by its resolution 195 in the Third General Assembly, the United Nations recognized the Republic of Korea as the sole legal government of Korea.\nIn 1946, the North implemented land reforms by confiscating private property, Japanese and pro-Japanese owned facilities and factories, and placed them under state ownership. Demand for land reform in the South grew strong, and it was eventually enacted in June 1949. Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. Approximately 40 percent of total farm households became small landowners. However, because preemptive rights were given to people who had ties with landowners before liberation, many pro-Japanese groups obtained or retained properties.\nWith the country now divided, the relationship between the two Koreas turned more antagonistic as time passed. The Soviet forces having withdrawn in 1948, North Korea pressured the South to expel the United States forces, but Rhee sought to align his government strongly with America, and against both North Korea and Japan. Although talks towards normalization of relations with Japan took place, they achieved little. Meanwhile, the government took in vast sums of American aid, in amounts sometimes near the total size of the national budget. The nationalist government also continued many of the practices of the U.S. military government. In 1948, the Rhee government repressed military uprisings in Jeju, Suncheon and Yeosu. During the rebellion and its suppression 14,000 to 60,000 people were killed in all fighting. Of note, President Rhee's regime was intolerant of opposition. A famous event that highlighted this was the arrest and conviction of future President Park Chung Hee, for communist conspiracy in 1948.\nThe main policy of the First Republic of South Korea was anti-communism and \"unification by expanding northward\". The South's military was neither sufficiently equipped nor prepared, but the Rhee administration was determined to reunify Korea by military force with aid from the United States. However, in the second parliamentary elections held on 30 May 1950, the majority of seats went to independents who did not endorse this position, confirming the lack of support and the fragile state of the nation.\nWhen the communist army attacked from the North in June, retreating South Korean forces executed tens of thousands suspected communists or sympathisers, either in prison or in a reeducation movement, in what is known as the Bodo League massacre.\nOn 25 June 1950, North Korean forces invaded South Korea. Led by the U.S., a 16-member coalition undertook the first collective action under the United Nations Command (UNC) in defense of South Korea. Oscillating battle lines inflicted a high number of civilian casualties and wrought immense destruction. With the People's Republic of China's entry on behalf of North Korea in late 1950, the fighting came to a stalemate close to the original line of demarcation. Armistice negotiations, initiated in July 1951, finally concluded on 27 July 1953 at Panmunjom, now in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Following the armistice, the South Korean government returned to Seoul on the symbolic date of 15 August 1953.\nAfter the armistice, South Korea experienced political turmoil under years of autocratic leadership of Syngman Rhee, which was ended by student revolt in 1960. Throughout his rule, Rhee sought to take additional steps to cement his control of government. These began in 1952, when the government was still based in Busan due to the ongoing war. In May of that year, Rhee pushed through constitutional amendments which made the presidency a directly-elected position. To do this, he declared martial law, arrested opposing members of parliament, demonstrators, and anti-government groups. Rhee was subsequently elected by a wide margin.\nRhee regained control of parliament in the 1954 election, and thereupon pushed through an amendment to exempt himself from the eight-year term limit, and was once again re-elected in 1956. Soon after, Rhee's administration arrested members of the opposing party and executed the leader after accusing him of being a North Korean spy.\nThe administration became increasingly repressive while dominating the political arena, and in 1958, it sought to amend the National Security Law to tighten government control over all levels of administration, including the local units. These measures caused much outrage among the people, but despite public outcry, Rhee's administration rigged the March 1960 presidential election and won by a landslide.\nOn that election day, protests by students and citizens against the irregularities of the election burst out in the city of Masan. Initially these protests were quelled with force by local police, but when the body of a student was found floating in the harbor of Masan, the whole country was enraged and protests spread nationwide. On 19 April, students from various universities and schools rallied and marched in protest in the Seoul streets, in what would be called the April Revolution. The government declared martial law, called in the army, and suppressed the crowds with open fire. Subsequent protests throughout the country shook the government, and after an escalated protest with university professors taking to the streets on 25 April, Rhee submitted his official resignation on 26 April and fled into exile.\nSecond Republic (1960\u20131963).\nAfter the student revolution, power was briefly held by an interim administration under the Foreign Minister Heo Jeong. A new parliamentary election was held on 29 July 1960. The Democratic Party, which had been in the opposition during the First Republic, easily gained power and the Second Republic was established. The revised constitution dictated the Second Republic to take the form of a parliamentary cabinet system where the President took only a nominal role. This was the first and the only instance South Korea turned to a parliamentary cabinet system instead of a presidential system. The assembly elected Yun Po-sun as President and Chang Myon as the Prime Minister and head of government in August 1960.\nThe Second Republic saw the proliferation of political activity which had been repressed under the Rhee regime. Much of this activity was from leftist and student groups, which had been instrumental in the overthrow of the First Republic. Union membership and activity grew rapidly during the later months of 1960, including the Teachers' Union, Journalists' Union, and the Federation of Korean Trade Union. Around 2,000 demonstrations were held during the eight months of the Second Republic.\nUnder pressure from the left, the Chang government carried out a series of purges of military and police officials who had been involved in anti-democratic activities or corruption. A Special Law to this effect was passed on 31 October 1960. 40,000 people were placed under investigation; of these, more than 2,200 government officials and 4,000 police officers were purged. In addition, the government considered reducing the size of the army by 100,000, although this plan was shelved.\nIn economic terms as well, the government was faced with mounting instability. The government formulated a Five-Year Economic Development Plan, although it was unable to act on it prior to being overthrown. The Second Republic saw the \"hwan\" lose half of its value against the dollar between fall 1960 and spring 1961.\nAlthough the government had been established with support of the people, it had failed to implement effective reforms which brought about endless social unrest, political turmoil and ultimately, the May 16 coup.\nMilitary rule (1961\u20131963).\nThe May 16 coup, led by Major General Park Chung Hee on 16 May 1961, put an effective end to the Second Republic. Park was one of a group of military leaders who had been pushing for the de-politicization of the military. Dissatisfied with the cleanup measures undertaken by the Second Republic and convinced that the current disoriented state would collapse into communism, they chose to take matters into their own hands.\nThe National Assembly was dissolved and military officers replaced the civilian officials. In May 1961, the junta declared \"Pledges of the Revolution\": anticommunism; strengthened relations with the United States; an end to government corruption termed \"fresh and clean morality\"; a self-reliant economy; working towards reunification; and a return to democratic civilian government within two years.\nAs a means to check the opposition, the military authority created the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) in June 1961, with Kim Jong-pil, a relative of Park, as its first director. In December 1962, a referendum was held on returning to a presidential system of rule, which was allegedly passed with a 78% majority. Park and the other military leaders pledged not to run for office in the next elections. However, Park became presidential candidate of the new Democratic Republican Party (DRP), which consisted of mainly KCIA officials, ran for president and won the election of 1963 by a narrow margin.\nThird Republic (1963\u20131972).\nPark's administration started the Third Republic by announcing the Five-Year Economic Development Plan, an export-oriented industrialization policy. Top priority was placed on the growth of a self-reliant economy and modernization; \"Development First, Unification Later\" became the slogan of the times and the economy grew rapidly with vast improvement in industrial structure, especially in the basic and heavy chemical industries. Capital was needed for such development, so the Park regime used the influx of foreign aid from Japan and the United States to provide loans to export businesses, with preferential treatment in obtaining low-interest bank loans and tax benefits. Cooperating with the government, these businesses would later become the \"chaebol\".\nRelations with Japan were normalized by the Korea-Japan treaty ratified in June 1965. This treaty brought Japanese funds in the form of loans and compensation for the damages suffered during the colonial era without an official apology from the Japanese government, sparking much protest across the nation.\nThe government also kept close ties with the United States, and continued to receive large amounts of aid. A status of forces agreement was concluded in 1966, clarifying the legal situation of the US forces stationed there. Soon thereafter, Korea joined the Vietnam War, eventually sending a total of 300,000 soldiers from 1964 to 1973 to fight alongside US troops and South Vietnamese Armed Forces.\nEconomic and technological growth during this period improved the standard of living, which expanded opportunities for education. Workers with higher education were absorbed by the rapidly growing industrial and commercial sectors, and urban population surged. Construction of the Gyeongbu Expressway was completed and linked Seoul to the nation's southeastern region and the port cities of Incheon and Busan. Despite the immense economic growth, however, the standard of living for city laborers and farmers was still low. Laborers were working with low wages to increase the price competitiveness for the export-oriented economy plan, and farmers were in near poverty as the government controlled prices. As the rural economy steadily lost ground and caused dissent among the farmers, however, the government decided to implement measures to increase farm productivity and income by instituting the Saemaul Movement (\"New Village Movement\") in 1971. The movement's goal was to improve the quality of rural life, modernize both rural and urban societies and narrow the income gap between them.\nPark ran again in the 1967 presidential election, taking 51.4% of the vote. At the time the presidency was constitutionally limited to two terms, but a constitutional amendment was forced through the National Assembly in 1969 to allow him to seek a third term. Major protests and demonstrations against the constitutional amendment broke out, with large support gaining for the opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, but Park was again re-elected in the 1971 presidential election.\nParliamentary elections followed shortly after the presidential election where the opposition party garnered most of the seats, giving them the power to pass constitutional amendments. Park, feeling threatened, declared a state of national emergency on 6 December 1971. In the midst of this domestic insecurity, the Nixon Doctrine had eased tensions among the world superpowers on the international scene, which caused a dilemma for Park, who had justified his regime based on the state policy of anti-communism. In a sudden gesture, the government proclaimed a joint communiqu\u00e9 for reunification with North Korea on 4 July 1972, and held Red Cross talks in Seoul and Pyongyang. However, there was no change in government policy regarding reunification, and on 17 October 1972, Park declared martial law, dissolving the National Assembly and suspending the constitution.\nFourth Republic (1972\u20131981).\nThe Fourth Republic began with the adoption of the Yushin Constitution on 21 November 1972. This new constitution gave Park effective control over the parliament and the possibility of permanent presidency. The president would be elected through indirect election by an elected body, and the term of presidency was extended to six years with no restrictions on reappointment. The legislature and judiciary were controlled by the government, and educational guidelines were under direct surveillance as well. Textbooks supporting the ideology of the military government were authorized by the government, diminishing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education.\nDespite social and political unrest, the economy continued to flourish under the authoritarian rule with the export-based industrialization policy. The first two five-year economic development plans were successful, and the 3rd and 4th five-year plans focused on expanding the heavy and chemical industries, raising the capability for steel production and oil refining. However, large conglomerate \"chaebols\" continuously received preferential treatment and came to dominate the domestic market. As most of the development had come from foreign capital, most of the profit went back to repaying the loans and interest.\nStudents and activists for democracy continued their demonstrations and protests for the abolition of the Yushin system and in the face of continuing popular unrest, Park's administration promulgated emergency decrees in 1974 and 1975, which led to the jailing of hundreds of dissidents. The protests grew larger and stronger, with politicians, intellectuals, religious leaders, laborers and farmers all joining in the movement for democracy. In 1978, Park was elected to another term by indirect election, which was met with more demonstrations and protests. The government retaliated by removing the opposition leader Kim Young-sam from the assembly and suppressing the activists with violent means. In 1979, mass anti-government demonstrations occurred nationwide. In the midst of this political turmoil, Park Chung Hee was assassinated by the director of the KCIA, Kim Jae-gyu, thus bringing the 18-year rule of military regime to an end.\nFifth Republic (1981\u20131988).\nAfter the assassination of Park Chung Hee, Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah took the president's role only to be usurped 6 days later by Major General Chun Doo-hwan's 1979 Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth. In May of the following year, a vocal civil society composed primarily of university students and labour unions led strong protests against authoritarian rule all over the country. Chun Doo-hwan declared martial law on 17 May 1980, and protests escalated. Political opponents Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil were arrested, and Kim Young-sam was confined to house arrest.\nOn 18 May 1980, a confrontation broke out in the city of Gwangju between protesting students of Chonnam National University and the armed forces dispatched by the Martial Law Command. The incident turned into a citywide protest that lasted nine days until 27 May and resulted in the Gwangju massacre. Immediate estimates of the civilian death toll ranged from a few dozen to 2000, with a later full investigation by the civilian government finding nearly 200 deaths and 850 injured. In June 1980, Chun ordered the National Assembly to be dissolved. He subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee, and installed himself as a member. On 17 July, he resigned his position of KCIA Director, and then held only the position of committee member. In September 1980, President Choi Kyu-hah was forced to resign from president to give way to the new military leader, Chun Doo-hwan.\nIn September of that year, Chun was elected president by indirect election and inaugurated in March of the following year, officially starting the Fifth Republic. A new Constitution was established with notable changes; maintaining the presidential system but limiting it to a single 7-year term, strengthening the authority of the National Assembly, and conferring the responsibilities of appointing judiciary to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. However, the system of indirect election of the president stayed and many military persons were appointed to highly ranked government positions, keeping the remnants of the Yushin era.\nThe government promised a new era of economic growth and democratic justice. Tight monetary laws and low interest rates contributed to price stability and helped the economy boom with notable growth in the electronics, semi-conductor, and automobile industries. The country opened up to foreign investments and GDP rose as Korean exports increased. This rapid economic growth, however, widened the gap between the rich and the poor, the urban and rural regions, and also exacerbated inter-regional conflicts. These dissensions, added to the hard-line measures taken against opposition to the government, fed intense rural and student movements, which had continued since the beginning of the republic.\nIn foreign policy, ties with Japan were strengthened by state visits by Chun to Japan and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to Korea. U.S. President Ronald Reagan also paid a visit, and relations with the Soviet Union and China improved. The relationship with North Korea was strained when in 1983 a terrorist bomb attack in Burma killed 17 high-ranking officials attending memorial ceremonies and North Korea was alleged to be behind the attacks. However, in 1980 North Korea had submitted a \"one nation, two system\" reunification proposal which was met with a suggestion from the South to meet and prepare a unification constitution and government through a referendum. The humanitarian issue of reuniting separated families was dealt with first, and in September 1985, families from both sides of the border made cross visits to Seoul and Pyongyang in an historic event.\nThe government made many efforts for cultural development: the National Museum of Korea, Seoul Arts Center, and National Museum of Contemporary Art were all constructed during this time. The 1986 Asian Games were held successfully, and the bid for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul was successful as well.\nDespite economic growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by coup d'\u00e9tat was essentially a military regime and the public's support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the government party, clearly indicating that the public wanted a change. Many started to sympathize with the protesting students. The Gwangju massacre was never forgotten and in January 1987, when a protesting Seoul National University student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it to allow for the direct election of the president. This announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the June Struggle.\nOn 29 June 1987, the government's presidential nominee Roh Tae-woo gave in to the demands and announced the June 29 Declaration, which called for the holding of direct presidential elections and restoration of civil rights. In October 1987 a revised Constitution was approved by a national referendum and direct elections for a new president were held in December, bringing the Fifth Republic to a close.\nSixth Republic (1988\u2013present).\nThe Sixth Republic was established on 25 February 1988 and remains the current \u2014 and by far the longest-lasting \u2014 polity of South Korea.\nRoh Tae-woo, 1988\u20131993.\nRoh Tae-woo became president for the 13th presidential term in the first direct presidential election in 16 years. Although Roh was from a military background and one of the leaders of Chun's coup d'\u00e9tat, the inability of the opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam to agree on a unified candidacy led to him being elected. The first female presidential candidate, Hong Sook-ja, even withdrew from the race in order to back Kim Young-sam against Roh.\nRoh was officially inaugurated in February 1988. The government set out to eliminate past vestiges of authoritarian rule by revising laws and decrees to fit democratic provisions. Freedom of the press was expanded, university autonomy was recognised, and restrictions on overseas travel were lifted. However, the growth of the economy had slowed down compared to the 1980s, resulting in stagnant exports while commodity prices kept on rising.\nShortly after Roh's inauguration, the 1988 Summer Olympics took place, raising South Korea's international recognition and greatly influencing foreign policy. Roh's government announced the official unification plan, \"Nordpolitik\", and established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, China, and countries in Eastern Europe.\nA historic event was held in 1990 when North Korea accepted the proposal for exchange between the two Koreas, resulting in high-level talks and cultural and sports exchanges. In 1991, a joint communiqu\u00e9 on denuclearization was agreed upon, and the two Koreas simultaneously became members of the UN.\nKim Young-sam, 1993\u20131998.\nKim Young-sam was elected president in the 1992 elections after Roh's tenure. He was the country's first civilian president in 30 years since 1962 and promised to build a \"New Korea\". The government set out to address the authoritarianism of the previous administrations. Local government elections were held in 1995, and parliamentary elections followed in 1996. In response to popular demand, former presidents Chun and Roh were both indicted on charges linked to bribery, illegal funds, and, in the case of Chun, responsibility for the Gwangju Uprising. They were tried and sentenced to prison in December 1996.\nRelations with the North improved, and a summit meeting was planned but postponed indefinitely with the death of Kim Il Sung. Tensions varied between the two Koreas after that, with cycles of small military skirmishes and apologies. The government also carried out substantial financial and economic reforms, joining the OECD in 1996, but encountered difficulties with political and financial scandals involving his son. The country also faced a variety of catastrophes: the Gupo Station rail accident and the sinking of MV \"Seohae\" in 1993, the Seongsu Bridge disaster in 1994, and the Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995.\nIn 1997, the nation suffered a severe financial crisis, and the government approached the International Monetary Fund for relief. Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung won the presidency that year, a first for the country.\nKim Dae-jung 1998\u20132003.\nIn February 1998, Kim Dae-jung was officially inaugurated. South Korea had maintained its commitment to democratize its political processes and this was the first transfer of the government between parties by peaceful means. Kim's government faced the daunting task of overcoming the economic crisis, but with the joint efforts of the government's aggressive pursuit of foreign investment, cooperation from the industrial sector, and the citizen's gold-collecting campaign, the country was able to come out of the crisis in a relatively short period of time.\nIndustrial reconstruction of the big conglomerate \"chaebols\" was pursued, a national pension system was established in 1998, educational reforms were carried out, government support for the IT field was increased, and notable cultural properties were registered as UNESCO Cultural Heritage sites. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted with Japan, was a major cultural event where millions of supporters gathered to cheer in public places.\nIn diplomacy, Kim Dae-jung pursued the \"Sunshine Policy\", a series of efforts to reconcile with North Korea. This culminated in reunions of the separated families of the Korean War and a summit talk with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. For these efforts, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000.\nRoh Moo-hyun, 2003\u20132008.\nRoh Moo-hyun was elected to the presidency in December 2002 by direct election. His victory came with much support from the younger generation and civic groups who had hopes of participatory democracy, and Roh's administration consequently launched with the motto of \"participation government\". Unlike the previous governments, the administration decided to take a long-term view and execute market-based reforms gradually. This approach did not please the public: approval ratings fell by the end of 2003.\nThe Roh administration succeeded in overcoming regionalism in South Korean politics, diluting the collusive ties between politics and business, empowering civil society, settling the South Korea-United States trade disagreement, continuing summit talks with North Korea, and launching the high-speed train system KTX. But despite a boom in the stock market, youth unemployment rates were high, real estate prices skyrocketed, and the economy lagged.\nIn March 2004, the National Assembly voted to impeach Roh regarding breach of election laws and corruption. This motion rallied his supporters and affected the outcome of the parliamentary election held in April, with the ruling party becoming the majority. Roh was reinstated in May by the Constitutional Court, which had overturned the verdict. However, the ruling party then lost its majority in by-elections in 2005, as discontinued reform plans, continual labor unrest, Roh's personal feuds with the media, and diplomatic friction with the United States and Japan caused criticism of the government's competence on political and socioeconomic issues and on foreign affairs.\nIn April 2009, after leaving office, Roh Moo-hyun and his family members were investigated for bribery and corruption; Roh denied the charges. On 23 May 2009, Roh committed suicide by jumping into a ravine.\nLee Myung-bak, 2008\u20132013.\nRoh's successor, Lee Myung-bak, was inaugurated in February 2008. Stating \"creative pragmatism\" as a guiding principle, Lee's administration set out to revitalize the flagging economy, re-energize diplomatic ties, stabilize social welfare, and meet the challenges of globalization. In April 2008, the ruling party secured a majority in the National Assembly elections. Also that month, summit talks with the United States addressed the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement and helped ease tensions between the two countries caused by the previous administrations. Lee agreed to lift the ban on US beef imports, which caused massive protests and demonstrations in the months that followed, as paranoia of potential mad cow disease gripped the country.\nMany issues plagued the government, starting from the arson of the Namdaemun gates, in which the government was accused of not providing adequate security. Further controversies arose over the years regarding the appointment of high-ranking government officials, rampant political conflicts, accusations of oppression of media, and strained diplomatic relationships with North Korea and Japan. The global recession affected the economy as the worst economic crisis since 1997 hit the country. The Lee administration tackled these issues by actively issuing statements, reshuffling the cabinet, and implementing administrative and industrial reforms.\nThe economy bounced back after regulatory and economic reforms, with the country's economy marking growth and recovering from the global recession. The administration also pursued improved diplomatic relations by holding summit talks with the United States, China, and Japan and participating in the ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit to strengthen ties with other Asian countries. The 2010 G20 summit was held in Seoul, where issues regarding the global economic crisis were discussed.\nIn October 2020, South Korea's Supreme Court upheld a 17-year prison sentence for former president Lee Myung-bak because of taking bribes before and during his presidency.\nPark Geun-hye, 2013\u20132017.\nPark Geun-hye was inaugurated in February 2013. She is the eleventh President of South Korea and is the eldest child of South Korea's stratocratic third President, Park Chung Hee. She was the first woman to be elected South Korean president, and to be elected as a head of state in the modern history of Northeast Asia. Her reputation during her presidency was eventually marred by her incompetency of handling the \"Sewol\" ferry disaster, the 2015 MERS outbreak, and later a major scandal, leading to her impeachment in December 2016. The corruption scandal involving Choi Soon-sil quickly blew up after reports from multiple news organizations (the most notable of which was JTBC) in 2016, nationwide protests ensued weekly, with participant count hitting a maximum of over 2.3 million (as reported by the protesters). These protests turned out to be the biggest mass protests in Korean history. The protests continued even after Congress voted on Park's impeachment. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn acted as President of South Korea pending completion of investigations into the actions of Park Geun-hye, and in the absence of any intervening election. The Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on 10 March 2017, ending Park's presidency and forcing her out of office.\nIn April 2018, former president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail because of abuse of power and corruption.\nMoon Jae-in, 2017\u20132022.\nMoon Jae-in was inaugurated on 10 May 2017. As President, his tenure saw an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Moon Jae-in met with North Korean chairman Kim Jong Un at the April 2018 inter-Korean summit, May 2018 inter-Korean summit, and September 2018 inter-Korean summit. During the COVID-19 outbreak, President Moon had gained a positive reputation both domestically and internationally with the initial successes of controlling the outbreak. Subsequent outbreaks in 2021, however, caused his ratings to plummet. As of 2021, South Korea recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.\nIn April 2020, President Moon's Democratic party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. It took 180 seats in the 300-member National Assembly with its allies. The opposition People Power Party (UFP) won 103 seats.\nPresident Moon finished his term on 9 May 2022. His successor, People Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, took over the seat on 10 May 2022 after winning narrowly the 2022 South Korean presidential election.\nYoon Suk Yeol, 2022\u20132025.\nOn 29 October 2022, at least 153 people were crushed to death when a crowd surged in an alleyway during Halloween festivities in Seoul's Itaewon district. President Yoon declared a state of official national mourning.\nThe \"Unification Act on the Calculation of Age\" took effect on 28 June 2023. The \"Unification Act on the Calculation of Age\" was promoted to resolve social and administrative confusion and disputes arising from mixing various age calculation methods. It is President Yoon Suk Yeol's representative presidential election pledge and the 13th of the 120 state affairs of the Yoon Suk Yeol government.\nIn the 22nd National Assembly election held on 10 April 2024, the People Power Party to which Yoon Suk Yeol belongs won 108 out of 300 seats, while the opposition Democratic Party of Korea won 175.\nIn June 2024, South Korea suspended the 2018 military agreement with North Korea. \nOn 3 December 2024, Yoon enacted martial law to rid the opposition of 'Anti-State Influence'. Following a few hours of unrest, the National Assembly unanimously passed a motion to lift martial law. Many hours of protest later, with the army unable to stand down without presidential authority, Yoon lifted his prior declaration of martial law and ordered the military to stand down.\nYoon was subsequently impeached on 14 December by the National Assembly and suspended from office pending a final ruling by the Constitutional Court on whether to confirm his removal from the presidency.\nOn 29 December 2024, Jeju Air plane crash at Muan International Airport in South Korea killed 179 people, being the deadliest air disaster on the nation's soil.\nOn 4 April 2025, in a unanimous 8-0 verdict, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment, formally removing him from office and laying the groundwork for a new Presidential election to be held later that year.\nLee Jae-myung, 2025\u2013present.\nOn 4 June 2025, Lee Jae-myung was sworn in as South Korea's new president after having won a snap election by 49.4% of the vote as the candidate of Democratic Party.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The only country that shares a land border with South Korea is North Korea, lying to the north with of the border running along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. South Korea is mostly surrounded by water and has of coastline along three seas: to the west is the Yellow Sea (called \"Sohae\" Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; in South Korea, literally means \"west sea\"), to the south is the East China Sea, and to the east is the Sea of Japan (called \"Donghae\" Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; in South Korea, literally means \"east sea\"). Geographically, South Korea's landmass is approximately . of South Korea are occupied by water. The approximate coordinates are 37\u00b0 North, 128\u00b0 East.\nLand area and borders.\nThe Korean Peninsula extends southward from the northeast part of the Asian continental landmass. The Japanese islands of Honsh\u016b and Ky\u016bsh\u016b are located some 200\u00a0kilometers (124\u00a0miles) to the southeast across the Korea Strait, and the Shandong Peninsula of China lies 190 kilometers to the west. The west coast of the peninsula is bordered by the Korea Bay to the north and the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait to the south; the east coast is bordered by the East Sea. The 8,640-kilometer coastline is highly indented. Some 3,579 islands lie adjacent to the peninsula, most found along the south and west coasts.\nAfter World War II and before 25 June 1950, the line between the two Korean states was the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude. After the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) formed the boundary between the two. The DMZ is a heavily guarded, 4,000-meter-wide strip of land that runs along the demarcation line established by the Korean Armistice Agreement from the east to the west coasts for a distance of 241 kilometers (238 kilometers of that line from the land boundary with North Korea).\nThe total land area of the peninsula, including the islands, is 223,170 square kilometers. Some 44.8 percent (100,210 square kilometers) of this total, excluding the area within the DMZ, constitutes the territory of the Republic of Korea. The combined territories of North Korea and South Korea are about the same size as the United Kingdom. South Korea alone is about the size of Portugal or Hungary, or the U.S. state of Indiana.\nThe largest island, Jeju Province, lies off the southwest corner of the peninsula and has a land area of 1,825 square kilometers. Other important islands include Ulleung and Liancourt Rocks in the East Sea and Ganghwa Island at the mouth of the Han River. Although the eastern coastline of South Korea is generally unindented, the southern and western coasts are jagged and irregular. The difference is caused by the eastern coast gradually rising while the southern and western coasts are subsiding.\nTopography and drainage.\nSouth Korea is largely mountainous, with three-fourths of its landmass consisting of mountains. Early European visitors to Korea remarked that the land resembled \"a sea in a heavy gale\" because of the large number of successive mountain ranges. Many mountains exceeding , which are concentrated in the north and the east, form the \"topological backbone\" of the country. There are two major mountain ranges within South Korea: the Taebaek Mountains, and the Sobaek Mountains. The highest mountain peak in South Korea is Hallasan (), which is the cone of a volcanic formation constituting Jeju Island. Geologically, Precambrian rocks such as granite make up the landmass.\nApproximately 30 percent of the area of South Korea consists of lowlands, with the rest consisting of uplands and mountains. The great majority of the lowland area lies along the coasts, particularly the west coast, and along the major rivers. The most important lowlands are the Han River plain around Seoul, the Pyeongtaek coastal plain southwest of Seoul, the Geum River basin, the Nakdong River basin, and the Yeongsan River and the Honam plains in the southwest. A narrow littoral plain extends along the east coast. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,833\u00a0kilometers2 of tidal flats in South Korea, making it the 17th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.\nThe Nakdong is South Korea's longest river (). The Han River, which flows through Seoul, is long, and the Geum River is long. These three rivers have their sources in the Taebaek Mountains. Other major rivers include the Imjin, which flows through both North Korea and South Korea and forms an estuary with the Han River; the Bukhan, a tributary of the Han that also flows out of North Korea; and the Somjin. The major rivers flow north to south or east to west and empty into the Yellow Sea or the Korea Strait. They tend to be broad and shallow and to have wide seasonal variations in water flow.\nIn the early part of the 20th century and especially the period during and after World War II and the Korean War, much of the existing Korean forests were cut down, which led to problems with flooding and soil erosion. Combination of reforestation efforts (e.g. Arbor Day was celebrated as a national holiday starting in 1949) and policies designed to reduce the use of firewood as a source of energy (e.g. restriction of inflow of firewood into Seoul and other major cities starting in 1958) helped to spark a recovery in the 1950s. Comprehensive reforestation programs starting in the 1970s and continuing into the late 1990s aided in an acceleration of forest volume increase. The forest cover reached a peak of 65% of national land area in 1980 as opposed to a low of 35% in 1955.\nNews that North Korea was constructing a huge multipurpose dam at the base of Geumgangsan () north of the DMZ caused considerable consternation in South Korea during the mid-1980s. In 1987, the Geumgangsan Dam was a major issue that Seoul sought to raise in talks with Pyongyang. Though Seoul completed a \"Peace Dam\" on the Pukhan River to counteract the potential threat of Pyongyang's dam project before the 1988 Olympics, the North Korean project still was in its initial stages of construction in 1990.\nMaritime claims:\n\"territorial sea:\"\n\"contiguous zone:\"\n\"exclusive economic zone:\"\n\"continental shelf:\"\nnot specified\nElevation extremes:\n\"lowest point:\"\nSea level 0\u00a0m\n\"highest point:\"\nHallasan \nClimate.\nPart of the East Asian Monsoon region, South Korea has humid continental and humid subtropical climates with four distinct seasons. The movement of air masses from the Asian continent exerts a greater influence on South Korea's weather than air movement from the Pacific Ocean. Winters are usually long, cold, and dry, whereas summers are short, hot, and humid. Spring and autumn are pleasant but short in duration. Seoul's mean temperature in January is ; in July the mean temperature is about . Because of its southern and seagirt location, Jeju Island has warmer and milder weather than other parts of South Korea. Mean temperatures on Jeju range from in January to in July.\nThe country generally has sufficient rainfall to sustain its agriculture. Rarely does less than of rainfall fall in any given year; for the most part, rainfall is over . Amounts of precipitation, however, can vary from year to year. Serious droughts occur about once every eight years, especially in the rice-producing southwestern part of the country. About two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs between June and September.\nSouth Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. Typically one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country's generally mountainous terrain.\nIn September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to offer unprecedented humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.\nRainy season.\nThe rainy season of South Korea refers to a phenomenon in which it rains continuously for several days in the summer or rainy season, or the weather, or the rain itself. On average, the rainy season is 30 to 35 days, but it does not continue to rain during this period. It rains for about 15 to 20 days, and among them, it falls only for about 12 to 16 days due to the stagnant front. However, the rainy season varies greatly from year to year. The rainy season is representative of summer weather in East Asian countries, including the Republic of Korea, and accounts for more than 30% of the precipitation on the Korean Peninsula. For this reason, some call the rainy season the \"fifth season.\" \nIt is usually a form of torrential rain that pours suddenly and then stops. In particular, the recent rainy season is referred to as a \"nocturnal rainy season,\" and it is often in the form of a lull during the day with local heavy rain pouring down at night. In the case of cloudy days, the upper layer may be heated rather than the ground during the day, and at night, the clouds trap the heat of the lower layer while the upper layer cools, so convection develops. Considering that showers come during the day, nights account for a high percentage of 55%. \nA distinct congestion front is created between the cold and humid Okhotsk Sea air mass located on the northern Russian coast and the hot and humid North Pacific air mass near the Ogasawara Islands, resulting in a rainy season. However, in the case of the Korean Peninsula, not only the Okhotsk Sea air mass but also the cold and dry Siberian air mass contributes to the rainy season. Another cause of the rainy season is said to be the Bering Sea and the Tibetan Plateau. To be exact, the speed of high-pressure formation varies depending on the amount of ice in the Bering Sea and the amount of snow accumulated in the Tibetan Plateau, as the rainy season begins with the speed at which each high pressure in the north and south of the Korean Peninsula moves. For this reason, rainy seasons are regarded as a kind of East Asian seasonal wind climate abroad. \nThe rainy season ends when the North Pacific high pressure expands and the Okhotsk Sea fleet retreats. Since then, as the North Pacific high pressure began to dominate the Korean Peninsula, the heat wave began in earnest and entered the middle of summer. However, during the period from summer to autumn, as the North Pacific high-pressure contracts and cold air expands in the north, the stagnant front moves south again and settles near the Korean Peninsula, which is called the \"Autumn rainy season\" or \"second rainy season.\" The autumn rainy season generally occurs between late August and early September, and although it is usually shorter than the early summer rainy season, it sometimes pours more rain than the summer rainy season.\nDue to severe climate change caused by global warming in India, daytime temperatures have risen to 32 degrees Celsius since mid-April and 39 degrees in late April, resulting in a strong heat wave in mid-summer, which also hit Korea in early June 2022.\nThe head of the Korea Meteorological Administration pointed out in 2022 that it was impossible to predict the recent heavy rain, and that the traditional expression of \"rainy season\" now seems to have expired.\nYellow dust.\nAsian Dust, known in Korea as the Yellow Dust, refers to a phenomenon in which when low pressure passes through the desert area of China, a large amount of yellow dust floats in the air or lands on the move due to strong winds and topography, affecting Korea. Yellow Dust occurs in desert areas in China and Mongolia, and the addition of several conditions to the sand particles generated here affects South Korea. Deserts where Yellow dust usually occurs include Taklamakan, Ordos, and Gobi. In South Korea, Yellow Dust usually occurs in spring, especially in April. Yellow dust has been recorded since ancient times, and the damage was not so severe because it was only a sandstorm in ancient times, but in modern times, the damage is getting worse due to China's rapid industrialization and desertification.\nIn summer or autumn, the roots of rain and plants play a role in holding onto the sand. However, in spring, the dry soil, which had been frozen throughout the winter, melts and breaks down into small pieces, resulting in small sand dust of less than 20 \u03bcm in size. When low pressure passes over the generated sand dust, it rises to a high sky of 3,000-5,000m by a strong ascending air current and then travels in westerlies and jets of about 30m per second. Since then, it has descended from Korea and Japan, where wind speed has slowed, and sometimes even moved to the United States (April 1998). It takes about two to three days to get to the Korean Peninsula from the origin.\nIn South Korea, Yellow Dust is observed for 3 to 6 days mainly from March to May every year. In terms of the total number of observations nationwide, Jeolla-do (Gwangju, the region with the largest number of occurrences) has been observed. In terms of the number of days of occurrence, Seoul, Gyeonggi and the west coast are long. In rare cases, it was observed in Seoul in the winter of 1991 (30 November 1991 to 3 December). Early yellow dust occurred on 25 January 1999, and severe yellow dust occurred around 1 p.m. on 2 January 2001.\nHowever, there is also a strange tendency, such as yellow dust in December 2022 in winter.\nTyphoons.\nSouth Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country's generally mountainous terrain.\nTyphoons often occur from midsummer to early autumn, July, August, and September. Most of the typhoons invading the Korean Peninsula are concentrated during this period, and sometimes indirect effects occur in June and October. Even October has a direct impact and lands.In the summer, the water on the surface of the ocean, which received hot heat, evaporates and rises by convection and condenses, and the latent heat released heats up the surrounding water vapor again to the troposphere interface.\nIn the case of typhoons heading to Korea, most of them fall into Japan, or Jeju Island, Gyeongsangnam-do, and Jeollanam-do are often directly damaged. However, In September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to make an unprecedented offer of humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.\nAs global warming progresses, the power of typhoons is likely to become stronger. In fact, hurricanes that occur in the Atlantic Ocean, where the average water temperature is 1 to 2 degrees higher than in the Pacific Ocean, are causing much more intensive damage than typhoons in the Pacific Ocean. Since 2013, the typhoon season has been delayed due to climate change, reducing summer typhoons and increasing autumn typhoons. The season came in October 2013, 2020, and November 2019. As a result, the number of super typhoons is increasing.\nSouth Korea produces coal, tungsten, graphite, molybdenum, lead, and has potential for hydropower.\nArable land: 15.3%\nPermanent crops: 2.2%\nPermanent pasture: 0.6%\nForest: 63.9%\nOther: 18.0% (figures as at 2011)\nResources and land use.\nLand use.\nApproximately 17% (as at 2022) of the land surface of South Korea is used for crop production (including temporary crops), most of the remainder being mountains and hill land. South Korea is self-sufficient in rice and potatoes but depends on imports to support its dominantly urban population.\n8,804\u00a0km\u00b2\n69.7\u00a0km3\nTotal: 25.47\u00a0km3/yr (26%/12%/62%)\nPer capita: 548.7 m3/yr\nEnvironmental concerns.\nNatural hazards.\nThere are occasional big typhoons that bring high winds and floods. There is also low-level seismic activity, which is common in the southwest.\nVolcanism and Earthquakes.\nUnlike Japan or the northern provinces of China, the Korean Peninsula is geologically stable. There are no active volcanoes (aside from Baekdu Mountain on the border between North Korea and China, most recently active in 1903), and there have been no strong earthquakes. Historical records, however, describe volcanic activity on Mount Halla during the Goryeo Dynasty.\nHallasan (elev. ) is considered historically active although it has not erupted in many centuries. Earthquake activity is minimal; however, since 2016, there have been two earthquakes over 5.4 magnitude. Records of historical periods of Korean history (27AD to 1904), alongside data from surviving buildings, have been used to refine estimates for the severity of historical earthquakes both in and under the sea round the Korean peninsula.\nEnvironment.\nCurrent issues.\nHabitat loss and degradation, especially of wetlands, through coastal reclamation (e.g. Saemangeum, Shiwa, Song Do, Namyang Bay, Asan Bay, in the south-west, Gwangyang Bay and the Nakdong Estuary) have caused huge declines in fisheries and of biodiversity. Most riverine wetland in Korea is now threatened by the proposed Grand Korean Waterway project. There are also some problems with air pollution in large cities; as well as water pollution from the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents. Drift netting is another issue.\nInternational agreements.\nSouth Korea is a party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27022", "revid": "42234187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27022", "title": "Demographics of South Korea", "text": "Demographic features of South Korea's population include population density, ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. The common language and especially culture are widely considered more important elements by South Koreans in terms of identity than citizenship.\nIn 2012, South Korea's population surpassed 50 million citizens for the first time in history, and by the end of 2021, the country's population had peaked at approximately 51.77 million people. However, in recent years the total fertility rate (TFR) of South Korea has plummeted, leading some researchers to suggest that if current trends continue, the country's population will shrink to approximately 28 million people by the end of the 21st century. In 2018, fertility in South Korea became a topic of international debate after only 26,500 babies were born in October and an estimated 325,000 babies for the year, causing the country to achieve the lowest birth rate in the world. In a further indication of South Korea's dramatic decline in fertility, in 2020 the country recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time since modern records began. In 2024, South Korea had a total fertility rate of 0.75, the lowest in the world.\nSouth Korea's population decline has been a direct result of record-low birth rates, which have been, according to many experts and researchers, a consequence of the country's high economic inequality, relatively high costs of living, low wages for an OECD member country, lack of job opportunities for young adults, and rising housing costs. Additionally, South Korea is also the country with the highest suicide rate among OECD member states and the wider developed world.\nIn South Korea, a variety of different Asian people had migrated to the Korean Peninsula in past centuries; however, few have remained permanently. South Korea is a highly homogenous nation, but has in recent decades become home to a number of foreign residents (4.37%), whereas North Korea has not experienced this trend. However, many of them are ethnic Koreans with foreign citizenship. Many residents from China, post-Soviet states, the United States, and Japan are, in fact, repatriated ethnic Koreans (labeled \"Overseas Koreans\") who may meet criteria for expedited acquisition of South Korean citizenship. For example, migrants from the People's Republic of China (PRC) make up 56.5% of foreign nationals; however, approximately 70% of the Chinese citizens in Korea are (), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity.\nPopulation trends.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population of South Korea showed robust growth since the republic's establishment in 1948, and then dramatically slowed down with the effects of its economic growth. In the first official census, taken in 1949, the total population of South Korea was calculated at 20,188,641 people. The 1985 census total was 40,466,577. Population growth was slow, averaging about 1.1% annually during the period from 1949 to 1955, when the population registered at 21.5 million. Growth accelerated between 1955 and 1966 to 29.2 million or an annual average of 2.8%, but declined significantly during the period 1966 to 1985 to an annual average of 1.7%. Thereafter, the annual average growth rate was estimated to be less than 1%, similar to the low growth rates of most industrialized countries and to the target figure set by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs for the 1990s. As of January 1, 1989, the population of South Korea was estimated to be approximately 42,200,000.\nThe proportion of the total population under fifteen years of age has risen and fallen with the growth rate. In 1955, approximately 41.2% of the population was under fifteen years of age, a percentage that rose to 43.5% in 1966 before falling to 38.3% in 1975, 34.2% in 1980, and 29.9% in 1985. In the past, the large proportion of children relative to the total population put great strains on the country's economy, particularly because substantial resources were invested in education facilities. With the slowdown in the population growth rate and a rise in the median age (from 18.7 years to 21.8 years between 1960 and 1980), the age structure of the population has begun to resemble the columnar pattern typical of developed countries, rather than the pyramidal pattern found in most parts of the Third World.\nThe decline in the population growth rate and in the proportion of people under fifteen years of age after 1966 reflected the success of official and unofficial birth control programs. The government of President Syngman Rhee (1948\u201360) was conservative in such matters. Although Christian churches initiated a family planning campaign in 1957, it was not until 1962 that the government of Park Chung Hee, alarmed at the way in which the rapidly increasing population was undermining economic growth, began a nationwide family planning program. Other factors that contributed to a slowdown in population growth included urbanization, later marriage ages for both men and women, higher education levels, a greater number of women in the labor force, and better health standards.\nPublic and private agencies involved in family planning included the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea, and the Korea Institute of Family Planning. In the late 1980s, their activities included the distribution of free birth control devices and information, classes for women on family planning methods, and the granting of special subsidies and privileges (such as low-interest housing loans) to parents who agreed to undergo sterilization. There were 502,000 South Koreans sterilized in 1984, as compared with 426,000 in the previous year.\nThe 1973 Maternal and Child Health Law legalized abortion. In 1983, the government began suspending medical insurance benefits for maternal care for pregnant women with three or more children. It also denied tax deductions for education expenses to parents with two or more children.\nAs in China, cultural attitudes posed problems for family planning programs. A strong preference for sons\u2014who in Korea's traditional Confucian value system are expected to care for their parents in old age and carry on the family name\u2014means that parents with only daughters usually continued to have children until a son is born. The government encouraged married couples to have only one child. This has been a prominent theme in public service advertising, which stresses \"have a single child and raise it well.\"\nTotal fertility rates (the average number of births a woman will have during her lifetime) fell from 6.1 births per female in 1960 to 4.2 in 1970, 2.8 in 1980, and 2.4 in 1984. The number of live births, recorded as 711,810 in 1978, grew to a high of 917,860 in 1982. This development stirred apprehensions among family planning experts of a new \"baby boom.\" By 1986, however, the number of live births had declined to 806,041.\nDecline in population growth continued, and between 2005 and 2010 total fertility rate for South Korean women was 1.21, one of the world's lowest according to the United Nations. Fertility rate well below the replacement level of 2.1 births per female has triggered a national alarm, with some predicting an aging society unable to grow or support its elderly. Recent Korean governments have prioritized the issue on their agenda, promising to enact social reforms that will encourage women to have children.\nThe country's population increased to 46 million by the end of the twentieth century, with growth rates ranging between 0.9% and 1.2%. The population is expected to stabilize (that is, cease to grow) in the year 2023 at around 52.6 million people. In the words of \"Asiaweek\" magazine, the \"stabilized tally will approximate the number of Filipinos in 1983, but squeezed into less than a third of their [the Philippines'] space.\"\nAs of early 2019, the birth rate of South Korea reached an alarmingly low number. In February 2019, the Korean TFR fell to 0.98, well below the replacement level of 2.1 births. South Korea is now the fastest-aging developed country in the world. The Korean government (and its failing actions against the birth rate issue) and the worsening economic environment for young people are blamed as the main causes.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nPopulation settlement patterns.\nSouth Korea is one of the world's most densely populated countries, with an estimated 425 people per square kilometer in 1989\u2014over sixteen times the average population density of the United States in the late 1980s. By comparison, China had an estimated 114 people, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) 246 people, and Japan 323 people per square kilometer in the late 1980s. Because about 70% of South Korea's land area is mountainous and the population is concentrated in the lowland areas, actual population densities were in general greater than the average. As early as 1975, it was estimated that the density of South Korea's thirty-five cities, each of which had a population of 50,000 or more inhabitants, was 3,700 people per square kilometer. Because of continued migration to urban areas, the figure was higher in the late 1980s.\nIn 1988 Seoul had a population density of 17,030 people per square kilometer as compared with 13,816 people per square kilometer in 1980. The second largest city, Busan, had a density of 8,504 people per square kilometer in 1988 as compared with 7,272 people in 1980. Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds the capital and contains Incheon, the country's fourth largest city, was the most densely populated province; Gangwon Province in the northeast was the least densely populated province.\nAccording to the government's Economic Planning Board, the population density will be 530 people per square kilometer by 2023, the year the population is expected to stabilize.\nRural areas in South Korea consist of agglomerated villages in river valleys and range from a few houses to several hundred. These villages are located in the south that are backed by hills and give strong protection from winter winds.\nSince 1960, the pace of urbanization in South Korea has hit a considerable decline in population of rural areas and the traditional rural lifestyle has been slowly fading away.\nFertility.\nOver the past 20 years, South Korea has recorded some of the lowest fertility and marriage levels in the world. As of 2024, it is the country with the world's lowest total fertility rate (TFR), standing at 0.75. Additionally, the country's capital, Seoul, registered a TFR of 0.64, which was likely the lowest level anywhere in the world.\nLow birth rates have discouraged South Korean doctors from entering pediatrics out of the fear that the field has no future. Due to how medical insurance is structured in South Korea, pediatric care relies especially on volume to compensate for its low reimbursement rates. The number of pediatric facilities in Seoul fell by 12.5 percent between 2018 and 2022, compared to an increase of 76.8 percent for psychiatry clinics and a 41.2 percent rise for anesthesiology centers. Conditions such as overcrowded waiting rooms and a shortage of hospital beds have led to the death of at least one child. The difficulty in obtaining pediatric care is causing many South Korean couples to reconsider having babies.\nAge structure.\nPopulation of South Korea by age and sex (demographic pyramid)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (Census 01.XI.2015):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.VII.2018) (Data refer to national projections.):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (Census 01.XI.2020) (Data include both Koreans and foreigners. De jure residence refers to expected length of stay of more than three months.):\nSouth Korea faces the issue of a rapidly aging population. In fact, the speed of aging in Korea is unprecedented in human history, 18 years to double aging population from 7\u201314% (fewest years), overtaking even Japan. Statistics support this observation; the percentage of elderly aged 65 and above, has sharply risen from 3.3% in 1955 to 10.7% in 2009. The shape of its population has changed from a pyramid in the 1990s, with more young people and fewer old people, to a diamond shape in 2010, with fewer young people and a large proportion of middle-aged individuals.\nThere are several implications and issues associated with an aging population. A rapidly aging population is likely to have several negative implications on the labour force. In particular, experts predict that this might lead to a shrinking of the labour force. As an increasing proportion of people enter their 50s and 60s, they either choose to retire or are forced to retire by their companies. As such, there would be a decrease in the percentage of economically active people in the population. Also, with rapid aging, it is highly likely that there would be an imbalance in the young-old percentage of the workforce. This might lead to a lack of vibrancy and innovation in the labour force, since it is helmed mainly by the middle-aged workers. Data shows that while there are fewer young people in society, the percentage of the economically active population, made up of people ages 15\u201364, has increased by 20% from 55.5% to 72.5%. This shows that the labour force is indeed largely made up of middle-aged workers.\nA possible consequence might be that South Korea would be a less attractive candidate for investment. Investors might decide to relocate to countries like Vietnam, where there is an abundance of cheaper, younger labour. If employers were to choose to maintain operations in South Korea, there is a possibility that they might incur higher costs in retraining or upgrading the skills of this group of middle-age workers. On top of that, higher healthcare costs might also be incurred and the government would need to set aside more money to maintain a good healthcare system to cater to the elderly.\nDue to the very low birth rate, South Korea is predicted to enter a Russian Cross pattern once the large generation born in the 1960s starts to die off, with potentially decades of population decline.\nSince 2016, the number of elderly people (aged 65 and older) has outnumbered children (0\u201314 years) and the country has become an \"aged society.\" People older than 65 make up more than 14% of the total population.\nUrbanization.\nLike other newly industrializing economies, South Korea experienced rapid growth of urban areas caused by the migration of large numbers of people from the countryside. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Seoul, by far the largest urban settlement, had a population of about 190,000 people. There was a striking contrast with Japan, where Edo (Tokyo) had as many as 1 million inhabitants and the urban population comprised as much as 10% to 15% of the total during the Tokugawa Period (1600\u20131868). During the closing years of the Joseon period and the first years of Japanese colonial rule, the urban population of Korea was no more than 3% of the total. After 1930, when the Japanese began industrial development on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the northern provinces adjacent to Manchuria, the urban portion of the population began to grow, reaching 11.6% for all of Korea in 1940.\nBetween 1945 and 1985, the urban population of South Korea grew from 14.5% to 65.4% of the total population. In 1988, the Economic Planning Board estimated that the urban portion of the population would reach 78.3% by the end of the twentieth century. Most of this urban increase was attributable to migration rather than to natural growth of the urban population. Urban birth rates have generally been lower than the national average. The extent of urbanization in South Korea, however, is not fully revealed in these statistics. Urban population was defined in the national census as being restricted to those municipalities with 50,000 or more inhabitants. Although many settlements with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants were satellite towns of Seoul or other large cities or mining communities in northeastern Gangwon Province, which would be considered urban in terms of the living conditions and occupations of the inhabitants, they were still officially classified as rural.\nThe dislocation caused by the Korean War accounted for the rapid increase in urban population during the early 1950s. Hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of them from North Korea, streamed into the cities. During the post-Korean War period, rural people left their ancestral villages in search of greater economic and educational opportunities in the cities. By the late 1960s, migration had become a serious problem, not only because cities were terribly overcrowded, but also because the rural areas were losing the most youthful and productive members of their labor force.\nIn 1970, the Park Chung Hee government launched the Saemaul Undong (New Community Movement) as a rural reconstruction and self-help movement to improve economic conditions in the villages, close the wide gap in income between rural and urban areas, and stem urban migration\u2014as well as to build a political base. Despite a huge amount of government-sponsored publicity, especially during the Park era, it was not clear by the late 1980s that the Saemaul undong had achieved its objectives. By that time, many, if not most, farming and fishing villages consisted of older persons; relatively few able-bodied men and women remained to work in the fields or to fish. This trend was apparent in government statistics for the 1986\u201387 period: the proportion of people fifty years old or older living in farming communities grew from 28.7% in 1986 to 30.6% in 1987, while the number of people in their twenties living in farming communities declined from 11.3% to 10.8%. The nationwide percentages for people fifty years old or older and in their twenties were, in 1986, 14.9% and 20.2%, respectively.\nIn 1985, the largest cities were Seoul (9,645,932 inhabitants), Busan (3,516,807), Daegu (2,030,672), Incheon (1,387,491), Gwangju (906,129), and Daejeon (866,695). According to government statistics, the population of Seoul, one of the world's largest cities, surpassed 10 million people in late 1988. Seoul's average annual population growth rate during the late 1980s was more than 3%. Two-thirds of this growth was attributable to migration rather than to natural increase. Surveys revealed that \"new employment or seeking a new job,\" \"job transfer,\" and \"business\" were major reasons given by new immigrants for coming to the capital. Other factors cited by immigrants included \"education\" and \"a more convenient area to live.\"\nTo alleviate overcrowding in Seoul's downtown area, the city government drew up a master plan in the mid-1980s that envisioned the development of four \"core zones\" by 2000: the original downtown area, Yongdongpo-Yeouido, Yongdong, and Jamsil. Satellite towns would also be established or expanded. In the late 1980s, statistics revealed that the daytime or commuter population of downtown Seoul was as much as six times the officially registered population. If the master plan is successful, many commuters will travel to work in a core area nearer their homes, and the downtown area's daytime population will decrease. Many government ministries have been moved out of Seoul, and the army, navy, and air force headquarters have been relocated to Daejeon.\nIn 1985, the population of Seoul constituted 23.8% of the national total. Provincial cities, however, experienced equal and, in many cases, greater expansion than the capital. Growth was particularly spectacular in the southeastern coastal region, which encompasses the port cities of Busan, Masan, Yosu, Jinhae, Ulsan, and Pohang. Census figures show that Ulsan's population increased eighteenfold, growing from 30,000 to 551,300 inhabitants between 1960 and 1985. With the exception of Yosu, all of these cities are in South Gyeongsang Province, a region that has been an especially favored recipient of government development projects. By comparison, the population of Gwangju, capital of South Jeolla Province, increased less than threefold between 1960 and 1985, growing from 315,000 to 906,129 inhabitants.\nRapid urban growth has brought familiar problems to developed and developing countries alike. The construction of large numbers of high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul and other large cities alleviated housing shortages to some extent. But it also imposed hardship on the tens of thousands of people who were obliged to relocate from their old neighborhoods because they could not afford the rents in the new buildings. In the late 1980s, squatter areas consisting of one-story shacks still existed in some parts of Seoul. Housing for all but the wealthiest was generally cramped. The concentration of factories in urban areas, the rapid growth of motorized traffic, and the widespread use of coal for heating during the severe winter months caused dangerous levels of air and water pollution, issues that still persist today even after years of environmentally friendly policies.\nIn 2016, 82.59 percent of South Korea's total population lived in urban areas and cities.\nVital statistics.\nSource:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nTotal fertility rate from 1900 to 1924.\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

However, with its emergence as an economic powerhouse, demand for foreign immigrants increased and in 2007 the number of foreign citizen residents in South Korea passed the one million mark for the first time in history, and the number reached 2 million in 2016. Of those, 1,016,000 came from China, with more than half of them being ethnic Koreans of Chinese citizenship. The next largest group was from Vietnam with 149,000 residents. The third largest group was from the United States with 117,000 residents, excluding the American troops stationed in the country. Thailand, Philippines, Kazakhstan and other countries followed. Many of the foreign residents from China and the former Soviet Union, including Russia and Kazakhstan, are ethnic Koreans (see Koreans in China, Koryo-saram). The number of foreign residents in the country last month set a record-high 2.73 million, comprising 5.3% of the national population of 51,164,582.\nChinese in South Korea.\nSince The People's Republic of China and South Korea established their diplomatic relationship in 1992, the number of Chinese immigrants, majorly Joseonjok, has continued to increase. In the early 1990s, a trade agreement allowed merchants from China to conduct business trades in South Korea. There are also Chaoxianzu in Korea: Chinese nationals of Korean ethnicity living in South Korea.\nNorth Americans in South Korea.\nSouth Korea is a country with one of the largest American immigrant populations in the world, numbering over 100,000. Most Americans tend to be Korean Americans who have returned to South Korea. About 43,000 Korean Americans reported living in South Korea in 2020, more than twice the number in 2005. South Korea also has a Canadian population of over 20,000.\nVietnamese in South Korea.\nThe relationship between Vietnamese and Koreans date back to when L\u00fd D\u01b0\u01a1ng C\u00f4n left for \"Goryeo\" after succession of power dispute. Likewise in 1226, L\u00fd Long T\u01b0\u1eddng, a prince of the L\u00fd dynasty of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (in modern-day Vietnam), later became Yi Yongsang () of Hwasan, a general of Korea. He is an ancestor of one branch of the Lee (or Rhee) family today in South Korea. Nowadays, most Vietnamese immigrants are either manual labor workers, marriage immigrants, or cooks in Vietnamese cuisines.\nFilipinos in South Korea.\nRelationship between Filipinos and South Koreans can be traced back to 1950s during the Korean War. Over 7,500 Filipino soldiers fought on the United Nations' side to help South Korea. As of 2019, there were more than 55,000 Filipino immigrants living in South Korea. Population decline in rural regions led to shortage of young people especially young women in those areas and it led many Koreans to marry Filipino brides.\nLanguages.\nThe Korean language is the native language spoken by the vast majority of the population. English is widely taught in both public and private schools as a foreign language. However, general fluency in English in the country is relatively low compared to other industrialized developed countries. There is a Chinese minority who speak Mandarin and Cantonese. Some elderly people may still be able to speak Japanese, which was de facto (1910\u20131938) and de jure (1938\u20131945) official during the Japanese rule in Korea.\nIn different areas of South Korea, different dialects are spoken. For example, the Gyeongsang dialect spoken around Busan and Daegu to the south is often perceived to sound quite rough and aggressive compared to standard Korean. \nReligion.\nKoreans have historically lived under the religious influences of Korean shamanism, Buddhism, Daoism, or Confucianism.\nKorea is a country where three of the world's major religions, Christianity, Buddhism, and Confucianism, peacefully coexist. According to 2015 statistics, 43.1% of Korean population has a religion and 2008 statistics show that over 510 religious organizations were in the South Korea population.\nMigration.\nEmigration.\nLarge-scale emigration from Korea began around 1904 and continued until the end of World War II. During the Japanese rule, many Koreans emigrated to Manchuria (present-day China's northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang), other parts of China, the Soviet Union, Hawaii, and the contiguous United States.\nMost emigrated for economic reasons; employment opportunities were scarce, and many Korean farmers lost their land after the Japanese introduced a system of land registration and private land tenure, imposed higher land taxes, and promoted the growth of an absentee landlord class charging exorbitant rents. Koreans from the northern provinces of Korea migrated mainly to Manchuria, China, and Siberia. Most people from the southern provinces went to Japan or the United States. Koreans were conscripted into Japanese labor battalions or the Japanese army, especially during World War II. In the 1940\u201344 period, nearly 2 million Koreans lived in Japan, 1.4 million in Manchuria, 600,000 in Siberia, and 130,000 in China. An estimated 40,000 Koreans were scattered among other countries, mainly the United States. At the end of World War II, approximately 2 million Koreans were repatriated from Japan and Manchuria.\nMore than 4 million ethnic Koreans lived outside the peninsula during the early 1980s. The largest group, about 1.7 million people, lived in China, the descendants of the Korean farmers who had left the country during the Japanese occupation. Most had assumed Chinese citizenship. The Soviet Union had about 430,000 ethnic Koreans, known as the Koryo-saram, scattered in several Soviet republics.\nBy contrast, many of Japan's approximately 700,000 Koreans had below-average standards of living. This situation occurred partly because of discrimination by the Japanese majority and partly because a large number of resident Koreans, loyal to the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung, preferred to remain separate from and hostile to the Japanese mainstream. The pro\u2013North Korea Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) initially was more successful than the pro\u2013South Korea Mindan (Association for Korean Residents in Japan) in attracting adherents among residents in Japan. Since diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Tokyo in 1965, however, the South Korean government has taken an active role in promoting the interests of their residents in Japan in negotiations with the Japanese government. It also has provided subsidies to Korean schools in Japan and other community activities.\nBy the end of 1988, the South Korean diaspora was estimated at around two million people. North America was home to over 1.2 million. Smaller Korean communities formed in Australia (100,000), Central and South America (45,000), the Middle East (12,000), Western Europe (40,000), New Zealand (30,000), other Asian countries (27,000), and Africa (25,000). A limited number of South Korean government-sponsored migrants settled in Chile, Argentina, and other Latin American countries.\nBecause of South Korea's rapid economic expansion, an increasing number of its citizens reside abroad on a temporary basis as business executives, technical personnel, foreign students, and construction workers. A large number of formerly expatriate South Koreans have returned to South Korea primarily because of the country's much improved economic conditions and the difficulties they experienced in adjusting to living abroad.\nImmigration.\nThere are 2,650,783 foreign residents in South Korea as of December 2024, 5.18% of the total population. Roughly half of this population was Chinese (958,959), followed by Vietnamese (305,936), Thai (188,770) and American (170,251). Out of the total foreign population, 557,057 were short-term residents on fixed-term employment contracts. These figures exclude foreign-born citizens who have naturalized and obtained South Korean citizenship; the total number of naturalized South Korean citizens from 1957 to 2019 surpassed 200,000.\nFair amount of the foreign residents from some countries are Korean descendants. Two thirds of Chinese, half of Russian, one fourth of Uzbeks are repatriated ethnic Koreans (labelled \"Overseas Koreans\") who may meet criteria for expedited acquisition of South Korean citizenship. They are Korean Chinese and Koryo-saram.\nAlso, sizeable number of migrants from countries with primarily multicultural immigrant population, such as Australia, Canada, United States, and Japan are also of Korean ethnic descent.\nNumber of Foreign Residents in South Korea of Different Ethnicity &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27023", "revid": "50627401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27023", "title": "Politics of South Korea", "text": "Political system of South Korea\nThe politics of South Korea take place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president is the head of state, and of a multi-party system. To ensure a separation of powers, the government of the Republic of Korea is made up of three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The government exercises executive power, and legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises a Supreme Court, appellate courts, and a Constitutional Court. \nSince 1948, the constitution has undergone five major revisions, each signifying a new republic. The current Sixth Republic began with the last major constitutional revision that took effect in 1988. From its founding until the June Democratic Struggle, the South Korean political system operated under a military authoritarian regime, with the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted. During that period, there were no freely elected national leaders, political opposition was suppressed, dissent was not permitted and civil rights were curtailed.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated South Korea a \"full democracy\" in . According to the V-Dem Democracy indices in 2024, South Korea was the fifth most electoral democratic country, as well as the fourth most liberal democratic country in Asia. South Korea is often cited as a model of democracy due to its relatively peaceful and internally-driven democratic transition.\nThe period from the mid-2000s to mid-2010s are often considered South Korea's backsliding period. Although, some have argued South Korea has hit a democratic ceiling and changes are more characteristic of democratic stagnation, rather than outright regression. This took the form of more state involvement (particularly through the Korea Communications Commission or KCC) in media control and less editorial independence among journalists with conservative media owners. \nOverall, political expression lagged behind comparable democracies. Additionally, South Korea has very strict election and campaign finance regulations, that includes no door-to-door canvassing and, consequently, some have cited these regulations as barriers to political expression and free and fair elections. These changes have largely attributed to South Korea's weak political party structure that emphasizes leaders and, consequently, hyper-presidentialism. Moreover, a right-left ideological divide has been more deeply entrenched into South Korean political society. However, South Korea is considered to have a strong civil society or \"simin sahoe\" manifested through a large number of civic organizations that prevented further backsliding via the 2016-2017 Candlelight Demonstrations. South Korea was also plagued by strong regionalism, dating back to the Silla-Baekje rivalry.\nUnder more recent administrations such as President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has taken a stance as a \"Global Pivotal State,\" which involves a greater role in East Asia as a democratic power. Despite its own democratic struggles, South Korea has taken an active role on democracy on the global stage, having hosted the 2024 Summit for Democracy and committing to \"strengthen coordination on promoting democracy and protecting human rights\" at the 2023 Camp David Summit with the U.S. and Japan, bolstering their trilateral relationship.\nNational government.\nExecutive branch.\nThe head of state is the president, who is elected by direct popular vote for a single five-year term. The president is Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces and enjoys considerable executive powers.\nThe president appoints the prime minister with approval of the National Assembly, as well as appointing and presiding over the State Council of chief ministers as the head of government. On 12 March 2004, the executive power of then President Roh Moo-hyun was suspended when the Assembly voted to impeach him and Prime Minister Goh Kun became an Acting President. On 14 May 2004, the Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment decision made by the Assembly and Roh was reinstated.\nOn 4 June 2025, Lee Jae-myung succeeded Yoon Suk Yeol as president of South Korea.\nLegislative branch.\nThe National Assembly (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term, 253 members in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea is the largest party in the Assembly.\nJudicial branch.\nThe South Korean judiciary is independent of the other two branches of government, and is composed of two different highest courts. Inferior ordinary courts are under the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed by the president of South Korea with the consent of the National Assembly. In addition, the Constitutional Court oversees questions of constitutionality, as single and the only court whose justices are appointed by the president of South Korea by equal portion of nomination from the president, the National Assembly, and the Supreme Court Chief justice. South Korea has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nSouth Korea elects on national level a head of state \u2013 the president \u2013 and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The National Assembly (\"Gukhoe\") has 300 members, elected for a four-year term, 253 members in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation.\nThe main two political parties in South Korea are the centrist or centre-left Democratic Party of Korea (lit.\u2009'Together Democratic Party' or DPK) and the conservative People Power Party (PPP), formerly the United Future Party (UFP). These are the dominant forces of South Korean politics at present.\nPolitical nature.\nSouth Korea's political history has always been prone to splits from and merges with other parties. One reason is that there is a greater emphasis around the 'politics of the individual' rather than the party; therefore, party loyalty is not strong when disagreements occur. The graph below illustrates the extent of the political volatility within the last 10 years alone. These splits were intensified after the 2016 South Korean political scandal. Party realignment is a persistent feature of Korean party politics. The repeated mergers and splits among political parties indicate a low level of institutionalization. Studies have generally assessed the institutionalization of Korean party politics as weak. After democratization, a personalistic party structure, a lack of voluntary party foundation, a lack of development into a policy party, and confrontational relations between political parties have been identified as major factors contributing to the low institutionalization of Korean party politics. The following is an explanation of the four factors above. Since democratization, Korean political parties have long had a fragmented structure centered on party leaders with regional bases. It also functioned as an electoral body to realize the personal political goals of party leaders. As political parties repeatedly merged and disintegrated according to the political interests of their leaders, the stable institutionalization of party politics failed to take place. Korean political parties have operated under an undemocratic structure, with the central party and grassroots organizations centered around leaders. Even recently, there have been criticisms that the distinction between public and private affairs within political parties has become blurred, resulting in nominations being made for the personal gain of the party leader. As a result, voluntary voter participation in party politics has been limited, making it difficult for parties to establish a stable organizational foundation. The absence of voluntary voter participation has hindered the institutionalization of party politics. And this has also made it difficult for political parties to carry out their essential functions, namely, expressing and uniting social interests. A survey result also showed that when National Assembly members choose important agendas, they consider their party's platform and policies more important than the policy preferences of their constituents or public opinion. In a survey on factors influencing the agenda of National Assembly members' legislative activities, 61.4% of respondents chose 'affiliated party's platform and policies', while 43.8% chose 'preferences for local constituents' policies'. Accordingly, the development of a political party with policy differentiation has also been delayed. As a result, Korean political parties have not been able to sufficiently perform their political agenda-setting function of gathering the diverse demands of voters and turning these demands into political issues. South Korea's party politics has shown limited effectiveness in resolving social conflicts and promoting social integration. Despite a long period of democratization, party politics still maintains a confrontational structure, hindering productive legislative activity that responds promptly to public demands. \nSome have argued that South Korea's political parties, dominated by powerful politicians and driven by competition, have maintained stability without a solid public organizational foundation. The South Korean party system, dominated by a small number of powerful politicians, has been labeled a \"partyless democracy.\" In Korean political parties, patron-client relationships between faction leaders and their followers influence party decision-making and significantly impact nomination outcomes. During the 20th general election, the Saenuri Party promised 100% bottom-up nominations, but its nomination management committee unilaterally excluded non-Park Geun-hye figures from the nomination process. The Democratic Party of Korea pursued a system-based nomination system, but it implemented factional nominations that conflicted with the party constitution and rules. \nDuring the 22nd National Assembly election, the major political parties also faced similar controversies during their nomination processes. The Democratic Party of Korea advocated for \"systematic nominations\" and emphasized the transparency of its internal nomination process. However, some media outlets pointed out that a large number of candidates from certain factions were nominated. In the case of the Democratic Party of Korea, 45% of its candidates for the 21st general election were replaced. Approximately 110 candidates, primarily those sympathetic to Lee Jae-myung, received nominations. As a result, after the 22nd general election, the Democratic Party of Korea became a party dominated by those who supported Lee Jae-myung. \nThe recent emergence of \"fandom politics\" in Korean politics is an extension of the party system dominated by a small number of influential politicians. \"Fandom politics\" refers to groups or political phenomena where fans worship a particular politician, as if they were celebrities or sports stars, and engage in fan-like activities. This phenomenon of politicians becoming celebrities, coupled with the proliferation of network media such as the Internet and social media as well as traditional legacy media, has led to the \"personalization of politics,\" in which the influence of individual politicians is strengthened and the influence of institutional political organizations such as political parties is relatively weakened. The phenomenon of political leaders' personal charisma and leadership overwhelming the influence of political parties reflects the trend toward \"personalization of politics.\" This personalization has forced political parties to move beyond their traditional supporter-centric mobilization strategies and explore new political lines. As a result, the policy and ideological elements of political parties have been relatively diminished, while emotional factors, such as the personal appeal of political leaders and popular sympathy, have come to play a greater role in shaping political support. \nMost researchers agree that the term \u201cfandom politics\u201d in South Korea began to be used after the formation of the political community \u201cNosamo,\u201d which supported former President Roh Moo-hyun, in May 2000. The 16th presidential election in 2002, held in the Web 1.0 era, ushered in an era of widespread online campaigning, sparking a surge in online campaigning. In the two-way primary between Lee Hoi-chang of the Grand National Party and Roh Moo-hyun of the Millennium Democratic Party, Roh emerged victorious, outpacing Lee in online campaigning. Upon Roh's victory, domestic and international media outlets proclaimed him \"the world's first internet president.\" In March 2004, a group supporting Park Geun-hye, \"ParkSamo,\" emerged. In Korea, the original political fan clubs are largely divided into the progressive \"NoSamo\" and the conservative \"ParkSamo.\" ParkSamo spearheaded Park Geun-hye's victory in the 2012 presidential election and actively and devotedly defended former President Park both before and after the election. A prime example is the nationwide candlelight protests demanding an investigation into the truth behind the botched Sewol ferry disaster and the Choi Soon-sil scandal, which led to the presidential impeachment. ParkSamo held rallies and other events during the impeachment process, confronting the candlelight protesters. Since then, Korean political fandom has continued with fandoms of Moon Jae-in, Lee Jae-myung, and Han Dong-hoon. Moon Jae-in's fandom actively spread political messages by sharing information about former President Moon Jae-in online, creating fan art and merchandise, and Lee Jae-myung's fandom called themselves \"dog daughters\" (daughters of reform) and even launched a comment relay saying, \"We will become daughters\" after his defeat in the presidential election. They exert strong solidarity around each politician, influencing not only the formation of political discourse but also the actual political process.\nLatest elections.\nPresidential election.\nOn June 3, 2025, Lee Jae-myung won the election with 49.42% of the votes over the ruling party's Kim Moon-soo. He will be sworn into office only hours after the election.\nCollusion between politics and Protestantism.\nSouth Korea's two major political parties (People Power Party, Democratic Party of Korea) are very conscious of the votes of South Korean Protestant voters. This has led to South Korean politics neglecting LGBTQ rights and reluctance to enact anti-discrimination laws. Because, South Korea has adopted a single-member district system without a two-round system for its National Assembly elections. This is advantageous for conservative South Korean Protestants, who can leverage their strong unity to push through their agenda. Especially in areas like Gyeonggi Province and Seoul, where margins of victory can be as small as 1%, 2%, or 3%, South Korean Christian groups are highly organised and powerful. Therefore, campaigning to defeat a candidate would inevitably jeopardize their own political careers, forcing them to adopt a passive stance.\nThis political collusion with South Korean Protestantism is hindering the introduction of comprehensive sexuality education, a program aimed at improving South Korea's criticised sex education system. South Korean Protestantism makes the scientifically unsubstantiated claim that comprehensive sexuality education promotes early sexualization.(\uc870\uae30 \uc131\uc560\ud654, \"jogi seongaehwa\")\nActually, South Korea's Protestantism is being criticised for actively interfering in the politics of own country and for pushing through some of their demands, rendering the separation of church and state meaningless.\nAdministrative divisions.\nOne Special City (\"Teukbyeolsi\", Capital City), six Metropolitan Cities (\"Gwangyeoksi,\" singular and plural), nine Provinces (\"Do,\" singular and plural) and one Special Autonomous City (Sejong City).\nForeign relations.\nSouth Korea is a member of the \nInterest Groups of South Korea.\nDefinition.\nAn Interest Group is defined as a collective of individuals who strive to influence public policy to achieve their members' common interests . These groups employ various means and methods to exert influence throughout the political process, aiming to advance either members' interests (private interests) or the public interest. The influence of interest groups is evident at every stage of the policy process, encompassing agenda-setting, policy formulation and decision-making, as well as policy implementation and evaluation. In South Korea, the active exertion of influence by interest groups became prominent following the country's democratization in 1987, as the system transitioned towards a pluralistic interest representation system. \nAlthough interest groups are not formal participants in the policy-making process, they are classified as informal participants because they seek to exert influence over the formal participants to further their own interests.\nIn South Korea, interest groups can generally be categorized into four types: economic interest groups, labor interest groups, professional interest groups, and consumer &amp; civic organizations.\nEconomic Interest Groups of South Korea.\nKorean Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).\nThe Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), founded in 1884, is the oldest and largest business organization in South Korea, representing about 140,000 member companies through 71 regional chambers. As the nation\u2019s sole representative to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), KCCI connects Korean enterprises with over 200 chambers worldwide, supporting their global expansion. It serves as a key policy partner of the government, addressing business, labor, and trade issues while protecting corporate interests. KCCI also offers management consulting, trade information, and training services, and has administered national qualification examinations since 1962 as an authorized testing institution.\nThe Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) carries out various initiatives to improve Korea\u2019s business environment, promote entrepreneurship, encourage corporate social responsibility, and strengthen global competitiveness. KCCI contributes to creating a favorable business climate by providing economic insights such as the Business Survey Index (BSI), submitting policy proposals on finance, taxation, and regulation, and promoting cooperative labor-management relations. It also conducts analyses of industrial trends and develops strategies to enhance the competitiveness of both traditional and emerging industries.\nTo foster entrepreneurship, the KCCI supports startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through education, management consulting, and global cooperation programs, including the Korea\u2013Japan Startup Forum. It also conducts research on the state of entrepreneurship and recommends policy measures to encourage innovation and sustainable growth.\nIn the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the KCCI promotes the spread of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) management by providing guidelines and analysis, supports initiatives to address demographic challenges such as low birth rates and population aging, and leads social contribution activities including childcare support projects and aid for veterans and first responders.\nThe KCCI also plays a key role in enhancing global competitiveness by expanding international business cooperation through 34 economic committees in 32 countries, participating in multilateral forums such as the OECD\u2019s Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), and collaborating with global think tanks to address international trade and supply chain issues. It further works to resolve challenges faced by Korean businesses abroad by facilitating dialogue with foreign embassies and government officials.\nFederation of Korean Industries (FKI).\nFounded in 1961, Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) is one of Korea\u2019s four major economic bodies and serves as a representative voice of Korean businesses. It promotes industrial development and international economic exchange while unifying business opinions on fiscal, financial, and trade matters to influence national economic policy.\nFKI promotes a better business environment, entrepreneurship, corporate social responsibility, and global competitiveness. It enhances policy efficiency, supports legal and regulatory advancement, and fosters cooperative labor relations. FKI encourages entrepreneurship through education, SME support, and international collaboration. It leads CSR initiatives by promoting ESG management and addressing demographic challenges. Additionally, FKI strengthens global competitiveness by expanding international cooperation, dispatching business delegations, and supporting Korean companies in overcoming global business challenges.\nFKI has established and supported several affiliated organizations to promote industrial development and enhance corporate management efficiency. These include the Korea Management Association (KMA), Korea Employers Federation (KEF), National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), Korea Energy Agency (KEA), Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization (Korea BIO), Korea Advertisers Association (KAA), Korea Information Industry Association (KIIA), and Korea Business Finance Association. Through these institutions, the FKI contributes to advancing Korea\u2019s economy and fostering collaboration across various industries.\nKorea Enterprises Federation (KEF).\nThe Korea Enterprises Federation (KEF) is a comprehensive economic organization in South Korea established in 1970. It was founded to contribute to the development of the national economy by promoting free-market economic and social policies, enhancing corporate competitiveness, and fostering cooperative labor-management relations.\nThe Federation\u2019s main objectives include strengthening corporate competitiveness, improving labor systems and employment, and creating jobs. In recent years, its activities have expanded beyond traditional labor-management issues to encompass broader economic areas, including economic policy, industrial policy, business systems, and regulatory innovation. Reflecting this wider scope, the organization changed its English name from 'Korea Employers Federation' to 'Korea Enterprises Federation.'\nAs a key government partner in shaping economic policy, KEF participates in major policy discussions and strives to stabilize labor relations and foster a cooperative labor culture. It represents the business community in domestic and international economic cooperation networks and provides consulting and support services related to wages, labor management systems, and working hours. The Federation also offers education and up-to-date information on industrial relations and human resources for its member companies.\nKEF publishes the monthly 'KEF e-Magazine', which provides analyses and commentary on revised labor laws, pension reform, and employment insurance policy, as well as surveys on youth employment trends. To support the advancement of ESG management, it also releases a monthly report titled 'ESG Trends', featuring updates on sustainability reporting standards in the EU (VSME and ESRS), carbon reduction initiatives, and carbon circulation pilot projects.\nKorea International Trade Association (KITA).\nSince its establishment in 1946, Korea International Trade Association(KITA) has been the largest business organization in South Korea and currently represents over 77,000 member companies. \nKITA represent the interests and rights of Korea\u2019s business community and perform multiple functions such as providing hands-on support to business, formulating new trade strategies, promoting private sector trade cooperation, and building trade infrastructure.\nKITA coordinates overseas trade missions and conducts market research to facilitate global business connections. It provides advisory and consulting services for exporters and importers regarding trade rules and regulations. KITA operates three offices in the United States and maintains seven branches in other countries.\nAs an economic organization, the goal of KITA is to contribute to Korea\u2019s economic growth by standing up for the Korean trade industry\u2019s interests and rights, facilitating global trade.\nAs global ESG regulations are strengthened, export companies are facing challenges in responding. KITA is taking the lead in supporting ESG management for exporters. It recognizes ESG as an essential element directly related to export competitiveness. The association aims to provide ESG assessments for 50 companies and customized on-site consulting for 20 companies through specialized organizations. KITA also provides consulting services for member companies on greenhouse gas inventory development and international certification.\nProfessional Interest Group.\nDefinition.\nProfessional interest groups are organizations formed by individuals working in specific professions or fields of expertise, which aim both to represent the rights and interests of their members and to improve their social and economic status. These associations typically bring together licensed or credentialed practitioners such as lawyers, nurses, or teachers and act collectively to influence public policy, regulatory frameworks, labor conditions and professional standards. In doing so, they combine the functions of a professional association that promotes ethical standards and professional practice and advocacy body, seeking better remuneration, autonomy and working conditions Also, as a policy stakeholder that shapes legislation, regulation and public-service delivery. Because their members share a discrete occupation and common professional identity, professional interest groups are distinguished from broader labor or trade unions by their focus on professional status, expertise, self-regulation and the socio-economic advancement of the profession. Moreover, these groups often engage in research, public education, and collaboration with governmental and international organizations to advance their professions\u2019 contributions to society. They serve as vital intermediaries between the state and professional communities, ensuring that expertise informs policymaking while safeguarding the autonomy and integrity of professional practice.\nGeneral Characteristics.\nProfessional interest groups typically display several identifiable characteristics which reflect their dual role as both professional associations and policy-actors. One key feature is expertise-based membership. These groups are formed by individuals possessing specialized training, certification or licensing in a distinct professional field, and their identity and authority rest on that specialized knowledge.\nAnother characteristic is a formal membership system. Professional interest groups maintain defined criteria for membership such as credentialing, licensing or affiliation, membership dues or fees, and institutional structures that ensure the organization represents the defined professional constituency rather than general labor.\nThey often make the tension between public vs. private interest while they advance the socio-economic status of their own members, they also claim to protect public interest through professional standards, ethics and service quality. This can lead to what some describe as a \u201ctwo-faced\u201d nature: on one hand professional enhancement, on the other interest protection.\nThese groups frequently have close ties with the government. Because their members operate in regulated fields such as law, medicine, and education. They interact with state agencies, ministries, licensing boards, and regulatory processes. \nThey engage in lobbying and pressure tactics\u2014making policy submissions, organizing collective action, protests or strikes when necessary\u2014to influence legislation, regulation or administrative decisions that affect their profession.\nBecause the membership is credentialled and the profession specialized, they display exclusive expertise, reinforcing the perception that only qualified members can define standards, self-regulate, and speak for the profession.\nThey tend to be \"strongly organized\", with centralized national leadership, regional branches, professional staff, secretariats, and research or policy units, enabling sustained advocacy.\nFinally, they exert policy influence by providing expert testimony, drafting policy proposals, participating in advisory committees and shaping the regulatory environment for their profession. Their combination of technical expertise, membership density, and institutional access gives them notable influence in policy-making processes.\nBackground.\nThe emergence of professional interest groups in South Korea is closely related to the nation\u2019s political modernization, socio-economic transformation, and the institutionalization of professional occupations throughout the twentieth century. During the Japanese colonial period (1910\u20131945), modern systems of law, medicine, and education were introduced, and Western-style professional qualifications began to take root in Korea, leading to the formation of early professional identities among lawyers, physicians, and teachers. \nAfter Korea\u2019s independent in 1945, professional organizations were restructured within the framework of state-building and national development. These organizations sought to restore professional autonomy while cooperating with state authorities in rebuilding national institutions.\nDuring the developmental state era under President Park Chung-hee in the 1960s and 1970s, the government actively mobilized professional associations as partners in modernization, while these groups simultaneously acted as policy advocates or pressure groups within corporatist arrangements.\nFollowing democratization in 1987, constitutional guarantees of freedom of association and expression expanded the scope of civil society, enabling professional associations to engage more actively in policy debates, social advocacy, and ethical self-regulation. In contemporary Korea, professional interest groups serve not only as occupational representatives but also as institutional actors influencing lawmaking, healthcare reform, and educational policy, reflecting their evolution into key intermediaries between the state and expert communities.\nKorean Bar Associatation.\nThe Korean Bar Association (KBA), established in 1952, is the national organization representing all licensed lawyers in South Korea. It regulates legal ethics, oversees training and professional conduct, and promotes the independence of the legal profession. The KBA also provides policy advice, offers continuing education, and conducts public service through legal aid and human rights advocacy. As both a regulatory and representative body, it maintains cooperation and tension with the government, balancing members\u2019 professional interests with the broader goal of upholding justice and the rule of law in Korean society.\nKorean Medical Association.\nThe Korean Medical Association (KMA) represents physicians across South Korea and serves as the country\u2019s largest professional body for doctors. Founded in 1908, it aims to improve medical standards, protect physicians\u2019 rights, and influence public health policy. The KMA organizes medical education programs, publishes research journals, and engages in health-policy negotiations with government authorities. It often acts as a lobbying organization, mobilizing collective actions when medical autonomy or working conditions are threatened. Through these functions, the KMA plays a crucial role in shaping national healthcare policy and representing physicians\u2019 professional and ethical interests.\nKorean Nursing Association.\nThe Korean Nurses Association (KNA), founded in 1923, is the leading organization representing registered nurses in South Korea. It promotes professional education, policy participation, and the social recognition of nursing. The KNA supports legislative initiatives that strengthen the nursing workforce and improve healthcare quality. It also fosters international collaboration through global nursing networks. With its emphasis on professional ethics and patient safety, the KNA works to advance both nurses\u2019 welfare and the quality of public healthcare services, illustrating the growing influence of nursing as a professional interest group in Korean society.\nKorean Federation of Teachers' Association.\nThe Korean Federation of Teachers\u2019 Associations (KFTA), established in 1947, is South Korea\u2019s largest organization for educators. It represents teachers from primary to secondary education, promoting professional development, fair labor conditions, and high teaching standards. The KFTA actively participates in education policy discussions, collaborating with the Ministry of Education on curriculum reform and teacher welfare. It also provides training and research support for members. Balancing advocacy and public responsibility, the KFTA seeks to enhance the professional status of teachers while contributing to the development of equitable and effective educational policies nationwide.\nConsumer Interest Group &amp; Civic Organization.\nDefinition of Consumer Interest Groups.\nIt is an interest group that represents the consumer sector among the economic sectors. It refers to a social group that is organized to protect and promote the rights and interests of consumers, exerts influence on the government or companies, and demands market monitoring and corporate social responsibility. It also refers to an organization that systematically gathers and works to protect and improve the rights that arise when consumers use products or services. As a representative of consumers, it exerts influence on society as a whole, including participating in the government's policy-making process, monitoring corporate unfair behavior, and demanding improvement. It is also an interest group that makes efforts to strengthen the voices of consumers, the weak, in the economic structure centered on large corporations.\nThe main functions of consumer interest groups are the function of protecting and advocating consumer rights and interests, as well as the function of providing information and education for consumers. The consumer rights and interests protection function is to help consumers buy goods, use services, and solve damage. It also mediates problem-solving or provides legal support. The consumer education function is to provide and educate various information to help consumers spend reasonably. It is to educate them on what to be careful about when signing a contract and how to deal with damage.\nBackground.\nKorea entered a consumer society in earnest in the 1980s. People began to express their individuality not only through the use of goods but also through consumption. As consumption emerged as an important part of society, the problems faced by consumers began to become diverse and important. \nBased on these social changes, Korea's consumer policy began in earnest with the enactment of the 'Consumer Protection Act' in 1980. The content of the law was that the state legally recognizes and protects consumer rights. Based on this law, consumers have the basis for claiming their rights, and the enactment of this law became the basis for consumer interest groups to operate.\nSince then, Korea's economy has rapidly developed, companies have grown, and groups such as large corporations have increased their share of the economy, making it difficult for consumers to speak out individually against them. Therefore, the need for consumer interest groups has grown in order for many people to share the difficult battle with large corporations, which is difficult alone. \nExamples.\nGreen Consumer Alliance.\nThe Green Consumer Alliance is an organization that aims to preserve the ecological environment and build a safe and humane society by protecting consumers' rights and practicing a consumer life that considers the environment together. The organization is campaigning to establish an environmental lifestyle together to overcome the increasingly deepening global environmental crisis and seeks to transition to an environmentally friendly and sustainable socio-economic system.\nMajor projects include consumer rights protection and legal aid projects, environmental conservation projects through various campaigns, fair trade order establishment and monopoly prevention projects, consumer behavior networks and local organization projects, and information provision projects. \nKorea Consumer Federation.\nFounded in January 1970, the Korea Consumer Federation was the first private organization specializing in the consumer movement in Korea, and it laid the foundation for the Korean consumer movement by developing and implementing methodologies such as consumer counseling, product testing, consumer research, and consumer education. It also established various laws and systems for consumer protection, established consumer policies, and established standards for resolving consumer disputes to remedy consumer damage, laying the foundation for the guarantee of consumers' rights before and after.\nThe Consumer Federation has local organizations in nine regions, including Incheon, Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Daegu, Jeonnam, Busan, Daejeon, and Gwangju, including its headquarters and Seoul branch, and conducts information exchange and solidarity activities with consumer organizations around the world.\nThere are four major activities of the Korea Consumer Federation. The first is the operation of the Consumer Information Center, which operates a counseling center to receive and process consumer complaints about various products and services through phone calls or online, and to provide necessary information to consumers. In recent years, professional counseling and monitoring activities are mainly conducted to prevent and respond to new types of consumer damage caused by the development of information.\nThe second is consumer education. Consumer education is conducted nationwide to cultivate reasonable consumers and prevent consumer damage. Instructors are dispatched to institutions and schools that require consumer education, and textbooks for education are produced.\nThe third is product testing. Through specialized experiments on the quality, performance, and safety of various products, it provides comparison information for each product required for consumers to choose, and allows safety problems or defective products to be recovered and improved.\nThe last is a collective consumer action. In order to demand the correction and suspension of the continuing unfair behavior that hinders the consumer interests of the business operator, the consumer group lawsuit system is being used to solve the problem through litigation. To this end, the Korea Consumer Federation created the 'Consumer Public Interest Litigation Center' in March 2015 and has formed and operated a collective consumer lawsuit response team composed of consumer law scholars and lawyers. In addition to class action, efforts are being made to improve laws and systems by discovering consumer problems that are not improving due to lack of laws and systems. \nKorea Consumer Organization Council.\nThe Korea Consumer Organization Council aims to effectively develop consumer protection campaigns by forming a council that combines organizations engaged in consumer protection activities to promote consumers' sound and independent organizational activities and protect their rights and interests.\nStarting with four organizations in 1976, the Korea Consumer Organization Council is currently carrying out a consumer movement with 11 member organizations and 255 local organizations.\nMajor tasks include overseeing consumer counseling and damage relief, information service projects to increase the utilization of data by building a database of information necessary for consumers, monthly consumer publishing and public relations activities, and overseeing price research and monitoring activities. \nDefinition of Civic Organization.\nInterest groups usually refer to organizations that represent the interests of a specific group or class. However, civic groups can also be viewed as a type of interest group in a broad sense. Civic groups are distinguished from political parties in that they promote citizen participation, secure autonomy over the state, and promote the public interest. Although civic groups are characterized by the pursuit of the public interest, they can be classified as a form of interest group in a broad sense in that they strive to influence policy in order to achieve the goal of the public interest.\nCivic groups intend to expand their political support base by participating in committees, contacting lawmakers or bureaucrats, promoting legislation, and holding seminars to make certain social issues a policy agenda. Some civic groups exert the same influence as other interest groups based on their expertise in specific issues. \nBackground.\nIn June 1987, Korea gained freedom and democracy through a historical event called the June Democratic Uprising. Since June, freedom of speech, assembly, and association has been greatly guaranteed, people's awareness of participation has increased, and an environment has been established in which citizens can gather their will to work. Civic groups monitored political and economic power through the voluntary participation of citizens and suggested specific policies and alternatives. The real-name financial system and property disclosure of public officials proposed by the Economic Justice Action Coalition (1989) were accepted as government policies and contributed to economic democratization. In addition, it was a major player in changes in Korean society, such as the demand for environmental organizations to implement the waste-based system, the abolition of the Australian system by women's organizations, and the mandatory sexual harassment prevention education.In addition, civic groups' political participation began in earnest in the 1990s, and 63.6% of civic groups were established at this time.\nHowever, after the 2000s, criticism of the 'citizen-free civic movement' appeared and faced a crisis. Since then, the agenda of the civic movement has diversified, the national democratization as well as the civic movement for welfare, education, medical care, culture, women, and youth has been relatively strengthened, and the theory of crisis has calmed down. Early civic groups were strong political actors because of the special political situation in Korea, but institutional politics stabilized and quickly depoliticized. Therefore, specialization and diversification are currently taking place by subject.\nExamples.\nSolidarity for Participatory Democracy.\nThe People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy is a civic group to create a just and democratic society. Launched on September 10, 1994, it strives to establish the rule of law based on citizens' democratic participation by monitoring and accusing the abuse of power and monopoly of opportunity in various fields of society.\nMajor activities include the campaign to enact the Anti-Corruption Act and enhancing transparency in corporate management through minority shareholder movements.\nIn 2024, he conducted activities such as the Itaewon Disaster Citizens' Countermeasures Conference, Pension Reform, Public Medical Movement, Peace Action on the Korean Peninsula in 70 years of the armistice, and Solidarity for the enactment of anti-discrimination laws.\nThis solidarity activity is one of the important ways of activities of the participatory solidarity, and it is a strategy of the participatory solidarity to maximize the impact of the movement. The Participatory Solidarity categorizes solidarity activity organizations into three categories: permanent domestic solidarity organizations, temporary domestic solidarity organizations, and permanent international solidarity organizations. If specific topics and activity deadlines are set for each case and agenda, temporary and comprehensive activity goals are classified as permanent organizations in the case of photography. In January 2025, there were 10 domestic standing organizations, 84 domestic temporary organizations, and 8 international standing organizations.\nthe Union for Environmental Movement.\nEnvironmental Movement Alliance is an alliance founded in 1988 with the roots of the Korea International Union for the Elimination of Pollution Movement. Immediately after the foundation of the Korea International Union for the Elimination of Pollution Movement, environmental organizations involving office workers, housewives, students, and experts began to be formed across the country. With the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environmental Development held in Rio, the Korean environmental movement came to pursue new changes. A coalition was formed to preserve the global environment through national solidarity, expanding the scope from the victim-centered anti-pollution movement to citizens. As a result, eight environmental organizations across the country were integrated to form the National Federation of Environmental Movement.\nThe core values of the environmental movement alliance are 'life, peace, and ecological participation', and the core goals are four. The first is the earth where life breathes, the second is the peaceful Korean Peninsula, the third is a sustainable ecological democratic society, and the fourth is a free civil community.\nMajor areas of activity include climate energy, denuclearization, resource circulation, ocean, ecological conservation, chemical safety, international solidarity, and environment in general.\nThe Environmental Movement Union is an organization that accuses illegal environmental damage through direct environmental monitoring activities and focuses on improving environmental awareness of consumers and citizens through environmental education.\nLabor Union.\nThe History and Major Events of Korean Labor Unions.\nThe history of labor unions in Korea has developed in various forms through constant struggles by workers and changes in national policies over time. Labor union activities in Korea date back to the late 19th century, when the number of dock workers began to increase. \nAfter liberation in 1945, nationwide organizations began to emerge under government control. The first nationwide organization formed by Korean workers was the Korean Confederation of Labor Unions (Jeonpyeong), established in 1945. During the turbulent post-liberation period, workers voluntarily gathered to assert their rights, marking an important moment in labor history.However, after the establishment of the government and the Korean War, labor unions were mainly formed within individual companies under strong state control, leading to the dominance of the enterprise-based union system until 1987. \nFollowing the April Revolution of 1960, a democratization movement led by students, the wave of change also reached the labor sector. The only labor organization at the time, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), was criticized for being too close to the government. As a result, workers began to call for the democratization of labor unions, realizing that unions should truly represent workers\u2019 voices free from external influence. \nThe 1980s were a period of intense aspiration for democratization in Korean society. In particular, the June Democratic Uprising of 1987 greatly empowered the labor movement. The long-suppressed awareness of workers\u2019 rights erupted, leading to large scale strikes and demonstrations across the country a movement known as the Great Workers\u2019 Struggle. During this period, numerous new unions were established, and workers strongly asserted their legitimate rights, marking a major turning point in Korean labor history. \nAfter the 1987 democratization, Korean labor unions expanded rapidly, but the 1997 IMF crisis increased non-regular employment and job insecurity, leading to a gradual decline in unionization. By 2023, union membership reached 2.737 million with an organization rate of 13.0%, a slight 0.5% increase in members from the previous year. However, as the number of eligible workers grew faster, the unionization rate still fell by 0.1 percentage points, showing the continued struggle of unions to maintain influence in a changing labor market.\nThe Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU).\nFederation of Korean Trade Unions|The Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), established in 1960, is one of Korea\u2019s two major national labor union organizations. It places great importance on protecting workers\u2019 rights and interests through dialogue and negotiation, and on achieving social consensus. The FKTU has long emphasized social partnership, actively engaging in dialogue with the government and employers especially during difficult economic times.\nThe FKTU has been an active participant in the Tripartite Commission, which include representatives from labor, management, and the government. Through this participation, the FKTU strives to reflect workers\u2019 voices on not only labor-related issues but also key national matters, seeking reasonable solutions through dialogue and compromise.In January 1998, during the IMF financial crisis, President Kim Daejung launched the Tripartite Commission to overcome the national crisis. Unlike the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), the FKTU chose to participate, demonstrating a willingness to cooperate and find solutions. Since then, the Tripartite Commission, which includes the FKTU, https://, and the Ministry of Labor, has continued to operate as a permanent legal institution.\nDuring times of national financial or economic crisis, the FKTU has often shown a cooperative stance, joining efforts with the government and employers to overcome difficulties. In particular, during the 1997 IMF crisis, the FKTU played a crucial role in protecting jobs and revitalizing the economy through its participation in the Tripartite Commission. This led to the first-ever grand social compromise in Korean constitutional history, achieved in just 20 days, after which the commission was formally institutionalized.\nIn recent years, the FKTU has also participated in social pacts involving labor, management, the government, and local communities to discuss practical measures for job retention and sharing, as well as government support policies to overcome economic downturns. This reflects the FKTU\u2019s recognition that labor movements should pursue not only wage increases but also broader social goals through collective effort.\nThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU).\nKorean Confederation of Trade Unions|The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) emerged as a result of the revitalized labor movement following the 1987 Democratization Movement. Rooted in a critical stance toward the government and capital (business sector), the KCTU strongly pursues direct struggle and social reform to protect and advance workers\u2019 rights. \nAfter the 1987 democratization, Korean workers sought to break away from the state controlled union system and achieve genuine labor liberation through their own power. Within this atmosphere, the KCTU grew rapidly, and the labor politics movement which emphasized the political participation of workers became active. This laid the foundation for the working class to emerge as a significant social force with the official establishment of the KCTU in 1995. \nThe KCTU tends to rely more on direct collective actions such as strikes and demonstrations rather than dialogue with the government or corporations, in order to push forward its demands. This approach reflects the organization\u2019s ideological background, which aims not only to address issues within individual companies but also to challenge the structural problems of capitalist society and promote broader social transformation. In February 1999, the KCTU withdrew from the Tripartite Commission and did not participate again until 2012, demonstrating its willingness to reject institutionalized dialogue and maintain an independent struggle-oriented stance in certain situations. Studies analyzing the collective actions of workers in Ulsan, a major industrial city, also highlight how workers have resisted in various forms over the past 30 years, reinforcing the militant nature of the KCTU\u2019s labor movement. \nThe KCTU places strong emphasis on union autonomy and workers\u2019 solidarity. It promotes a structure in which union activists take the lead, and workers make decisions and act independently without external interference. This principle is often described as a form of \u201cmilitant democracy,\u201d reflecting the KCTU\u2019s readiness to take assertive even confrontational actions to defend democracy and workers\u2019 rights. However, some critics argue that the KCTU\u2019s labor movement can be too factional or centered on regular workers in large enterprises, rather than being fully inclusive of the broader and more diverse working class.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By nominal GDP, the economy was worth \u20a92.61 quadrillion (US$1.87 trillion). It has the 4th largest economy in Asia and the 13th largest in the world as of 2025. South Korea is notable for its rapid economic development from an underdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country in a few decades. This economic growth has been described as the Miracle on the Han River, which has allowed it to join the OECD and the G20. It is included in the group of Next Eleven countries as having the potential to play a dominant role in the global economy by the middle of the 21st century. Among OECD members, South Korea has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 15.5% of GDP. South Korea spends around 4.93% of GDP on advanced research and development across various sectors of the economy.\nSouth Korea's education system and the establishment of a motivated and educated populace were largely responsible for spurring the country's high technology boom and economic development. South Korea began to adapt an export-oriented economic strategy in the 1960s to fuel its economy. In 2022, South Korea was the ninth largest exporter and ninth largest importer in the world. The Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of South Korea.\nRenowned financial organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund, note the resilience of the South Korean economy against various economic crises. They cite the country's economic advantages as reasons for this resilience, including low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilised to address any expected financial emergencies. South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession during the Great Recession. Despite the South Korean economy's high growth and structural stability, South Korea is experiencing damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to North Korea in times of military crises. The recurring conflict affects the financial markets of its economy. The South Korean economy faces challenges due to a declining and ageing population, with a fertility rate among the lowest in the world.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nFollowing the Korean War, South Korea remained a country with less developed markets for a little more than a decade. The growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to South Korea's economic development. In 1986, manufacturing industries accounted for approximately 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 25 percent of the work force. Due to strong domestic encouragement and some foreign aid, Seoul's industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities, increased the production of commodities\u2014especially those for sale in foreign markets\u2014and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion. As a result, industry altered South Korea's landscape, drawing millions of labourers to urban manufacturing centres.\nA downturn in the South Korean economy in 1989 spurred by a decrease in exports and foreign orders caused concern in the industrial sector. Ministry of Trade and Industry analysts stated that decreased export performance resulted from structural problems, including an overly strong won, increased wages and labour costs, frequent strikes, and higher interest rates. The result was an increase in inventories and cutbacks in production at a number of electronics, automobile, and textile manufacturers, as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts. Factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labour, to boost productivity with a smaller work force, and to improve competitiveness.\nColonial period.\nJapan colonized Korea, officially annexing it on 22 August 1910 as the Province of Choson.24 Japan encouraged an inflow of Japanese capital to Korea's less developed economy.24 A large majority of major firms in Korea became Japanese owned and operated as a result, with key positions reserved for Japanese.24 Koreans were permitted to work in menial roles under harsh labor conditions.24 Most of Korea's coal, iron, and crop production was shipped to Japan.24\nRapid growth from 1960s to 1980s.\nFollowing the coup that brought General Park Chung Hee to power in 1961, which at first caused political instability and an economic crisis, a protectionist economic policy began, pushing a bourgeoisie that developed in the shadow of the State to reactivate the internal market. To promote development, a policy of export-oriented industrialisation was applied, closing the entry into the country of all kinds of foreign products, except raw materials. Agrarian reforms were carried out and Park nationalised the financial system to swell the powerful state arm, whose intervention in the economy was through five-year plans.\nThe spearhead was the chaebols, diversified family conglomerates such as Hyundai, Samsung, and LG Corporation, which received state incentives such as tax breaks, legality for their exploitation system and cheap or free financing: the state bank facilitated the planning of concentrated loans by item according to each five-year plan, and by economic group selected to lead it.\nSouth Korea received donations from the United States due to the Cold War, and foreign economic and military support continued for some years. Chaebols started to dominate the domestic economy and, eventually, began to become internationally competitive. Under these chaebols, workers began to see their wages and working conditions improve, which increased domestic consumption. By the 1980s, the country rose from low income to middle income.\nSouth Korea's real GDP expanded by an average of more than 8 percent per year, from US$2.7 billion in 1962 to US$230 billion in 1989, breaking the trillion dollar mark in the early 2000s. Nominal GDP per capita grew from $103.88 in 1962 to $5,438.24 in 1989, reaching the $20,000 milestone in 2006. The manufacturing sector grew from 14.3 percent of the GNP in 1962 to 30.3 percent in 1987. Commodity trade volume rose from US$480 million in 1962 to a projected US$127.9 billion in 1990. The ratio of domestic savings to GNP grew from 3.3 percent in 1962 to 35.8 percent in 1989. In the early 1960s, South Korea's rate of growth exceeded North Korea's rate of growth in most industrial areas.\nThe most significant factor in rapid industrialisation was the adoption of an outward-looking strategy in the early 1960s. This strategy was particularly well-suited to that time because of South Korea's low savings rate and small domestic market. The strategy promoted economic growth through labour-intensive manufactured exports, in which South Korea could develop a competitive advantage. Government initiatives played an important role in this process. Entrepreneurs such as Kim Hyung-mok were key figures in supporting industrial growth by investing in education and infrastructure aligned with the state\u2019s economic goals. Through the model of export-led industrialisation, the South Korean government incentivised corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency to compete the global market. By adhering to state regulations and demands, firms were awarded subsidisation and investment support to develop their export markets in the evolving international arena. In addition, the inflow of foreign capital was encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled South Korea to achieve growth in exports and subsequent increases in income.\nBeginning in 1973, South Korea's government used its National Investment Fund and the Korea Development Bank to invest large amounts of money into what Park Chung Hee's government viewed as the six strategic industries: steel, non-ferrous metals, shipbuilding, industrial machinery, electronics, and petrochemicals.136 This developmental approach was frequently criticized at the time from outside Korea, including by the World Bank.136 The strategy was successful and ultimately also helped develop companies like Samsung and POSCO and reduced input costs for production in downstream industries as well.136\nBy emphasising the industrial sector, Seoul's export-oriented development strategy left the rural sector barely touched. The steel and shipbuilding industries in particular played key roles in developing South Korea's economy during this time. Except for mining, most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast. Heavy industries were located in the south of the country. Factories in Seoul contributed over 25 percent of all manufacturing value-added in 1978; taken together with factories in the surrounding Gyeonggi Province, factories in the Seoul area produced 46 percent of all manufacturing that year. Factories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province employed 48 percent of the nation's 2.1 million factory workers. Increased income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a problem by the 1970s despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural areas \nIn the early 1980s, in order to control inflation, a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted. Growth of the money supply was reduced from the 30 percent level of the 1970s to 15 percent. During this time, Seoul froze its budget for a short while. Government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalised to promote competition. To reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors, Seoul expanded investments in public projects, such as roads and communications facilities, while further promoting farm mechanisation.\nThe measures implemented early in the decade, coupled with significant improvements in the world economy, helped South Korea regain its lost momentum. South Korea achieved an average of 9.2 percent real growth between 1982 and 1987 and 12.5 percent between 1986 and 1988. The double-digit inflation of the 1970s was brought under control. Wholesale price inflation averaged 2.1 percent per year from 1980 through 1988; consumer prices increased by an average of 4.7 percent annually. Seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance of payments in 1986 and recorded a US$7.7 billion and a US$11.4 billion surplus in 1987 and 1988 respectively. This development permitted South Korea to begin reducing its level of foreign debt. The trade surplus for 1989, however, was only US$4.6 billion, and a small negative balance was projected for 1990.\n1990s and the Asian Financial Crisis.\nFor the first half of the 1990s, the South Korean economy continued a stable and strong growth in both private consumption and GDP. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, after several other Asian currencies were attacked by speculators, the Korean won started to depreciate in October 1997. The problem was exacerbated due to non-performing loans at many of Korea's merchant banks. By December 1997, the IMF had approved a US$21 billion loan, that would be part of a US$58.4 billion bailout plan. By January 1998, the government had shut down a third of Korea's merchant banks. Throughout 1998, Korea's economy would continue to shrink quarterly at an average rate of \u22126.65%. and South Korean chaebol Daewoo was dismantled by the government in 1999 due to debt problems. General Motors managed to purchase the motors division. Indian conglomerate Tata Group purchased the trucks and heavy vehicles division of Daewoo.\nActions by the South Korean government and debt swaps by international lenders contained the country's financial problems. Much of South Korea's recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis can be attributed to labour adjustments (i.e. a dynamic and productive labour market with flexible wage rates) and alternative funding sources. By the first quarter of 1999, GDP growth had risen to 5.4%, and strong growth thereafter combined with deflationary pressure on the currency led to a yearly growth of 10.5%. In December 1999, President Kim Dae-jung declared the currency crisis over.\n2000s.\nSouth Korea's economy has moved away from a centrally planned, government-directed investment model toward a more market-oriented one. These economic reforms, pushed by President Kim Dae-jung, helped South Korea maintain one of Asia's few expanding economies, with growth rates of 10.8% in 1999 and 9.2% in 2000. Growth fell back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the slowing global economy, decreased exports, and perceptions that corporate and financial reforms had stalled.\nAfter the bounce back from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the economy continued strong growth in 2000 with a GDP growth of 9.08%. However, the South Korean economy was affected by the September 11 attacks. The slowing global economy, falling exports, and the perception that corporate and financial reforms had stalled caused growth to decrease to 3.8% in 2001 Thanks to industrialisation GDP per hour worked (labour output) more than tripled from US$2.80 in 1963 to US$10.00 in 1989. More recently the economy stabilised and maintained a growth rate of between 4\u20135% from 2003 onwards.\nLed by industry and construction, growth in 2002 was 5.8%, despite anemic global growth. The restructuring of chaebols, bank privatisation, and the creation of a more liberalised economy\u2014with a mechanism for bankrupt firms to exit the market\u2014remain an unfinished reform task. Growth slowed in 2003, but production expanded 5% in 2006, due to popular demand for key export products such as HDTVs and mobile phones.\nLike most industrialised economies, South Korea experienced setbacks during the Great Recession. Growth fell by 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 from the previous quarter, the first negative quarterly growth in 10 years, with year on year quarterly growth continuing to be negative into 2009. Many sectors of the economy at the time reported declines, with manufacturing dropping 25.6% as of January 2009, and consumer goods sales dropping 3.1%. Exports in autos and semiconductors, two pillars of the economy, shrank 55.9% and 46.9% respectively, while exports overall fell by a record 33.8% in January, and 18.3% in February 2009 year on year. As in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Korean currency also experienced massive fluctuations, declining by 34% against the US dollar. Annual growth in the economy slowed to 2.3% in 2008, and was expected to drop to as low as \u22124.5% by Goldman Sachs, but South Korea was able to limit the downturn to a standstill at 0.2% in 2009. Despite the Great Recession, the South Korean economy, helped by timely stimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated for decreased exports, was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialised economies, posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of the crisis. In 2010, South Korea made an economic rebound with a growth rate of 6.1%, signaling a return of the economy to pre-crisis levels. South Korea's exports recorded $424 billion in the first eleven months of the year 2010, already higher than its export in the whole year of 2008.\nThe South Korean government signed the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA) on 5 December 2013, with the Australian government seeking to benefit its industries\u2014including automotive, services, and resources and energy\u2014and position itself alongside competitors, such as the U.S. and ASEAN. South Korea is Australia's third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a 2012 trade value of A$32 billion. The agreement contains an Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clause that permits legal action from South Korean corporations against the Australian government if their trade rights are infringed upon.\nThe government cut the work week from six days to five in phases, from 2004 to 2011, depending on the size of the firm. The number of public holidays was expanded to 16 by 2013.\nSouth Korean economy decreased in the first quarter of 2019, which happened to be its worst drop since the Great Recession. GDP declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from the previous quarter.\nSouth Korea's prices rose more than 6 percent in July compared with last year, the fastest jump in nearly a quarter century.\nIn July 2022, South Korea's Consumer price index rose 6.3 percent, the highest rate since November 1998.\nHigh-tech industries in the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn 1990, South Korean manufacturers planned a shift in future production plans toward high-technology industries. In June 1989, panels of government officials, scholars, and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials, mechatronics\u2014including industrial robotics\u2014bioengineering, microelectronics, fine chemistry, and aerospace. This shift in emphasis, however, did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production, which had dominated the economy in the 1980s.\nSouth Korea relies upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy, with finished products such as electronics, textiles, ships, automobiles, and steel being some of its most important exports. Although the import market has liberalised in recent years, the agricultural market has remained protectionist due to disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market. As of 2005, the price of rice in South Korea was four times that of the average price of rice on the international market, and it was believed that opening the agricultural market would affect South Korean agricultural sector negatively. In late 2004, however, an agreement was reached with the WTO in which South Korean rice imports will gradually increase from 4% to 8% of consumption by 2014. In addition, up to 30% of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by 2010, where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods. Following 2014, the South Korean rice market will be fully opened.\nSouth Korea today is known as the Launchpad of a mature mobile market, where developers thrive in a market where few technology constraints exist. There is a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, using the 4G and 5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea today has the infrastructure to meet a density of population and culture that has the capability to create strong local particularities.\nThe economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSouth Korea faced a turning point in its economy in 2023. With the constant growth of mainland China's manufacturing industry and the impact of COVID-19, South Korea's manufacturing sector is experiencing a consistent decline. According to SP Global, South Korea's export of manufactured goods to mainland China, one of the biggest trading partners of South Korea, had decreased by 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and by 31% in January 2023. On the other hand, their primary electronic manufacturing industry is facing a downturn. While information and communication technology maintained 34% of South Korea's total 2022 exports, at the end of the year, it decreased to 24%. The government had to incur a massive fiscal spending in 2020, leading a rise in the fiscal deficit as projected in their budget. Moreover, their forecasted debt-to-GDP ratio jumped to 41.2% of GDP in 2020 from 37.1% of GDP in 2019. In 2021, the government unveiled a $29 billion extra budget to aid small businesses and boost employment. In 2024, the government forecast a debt-to-GDP ratio was 47.4% of GDP.\nWith downturns in many manufacturing industries, South Korea has been facing a recession. Many economists state the reason for industries' slowdown as deteriorating global conditions. The inflation rate in South Korea is regularly rising, and the problems in the domestic economy, such as household debt, population problems, and productivity problems, are the key fiscal and monetary factors that hold South Korea's economic growth.\nDue to the sudden evolution of COVID-19, private consumption decreased, and a bottleneck in the supply sector occurred. With this situation, the Bank of Korea indicated that the consumer inflation rate rose about three percent after COVID-19 evolved. Assuming that South Korea's interest rate was low compared to other countries, raising house prices and household debt became one of the problems in South Korea's economy. \nExperts assessed the Moon Jae-in administration (2020\u20132022) as implementing a comprehensive set of economic policies to address the economic crisis induced by COVID-19. A wide array of industrial and employment support measures was introduced to mitigate the pandemic's economic impact []. \nEmployment retention subsidies were expanded, targeting sectors severely affected by COVID-19, such as aviation, tourism, and accommodation. Partial wage support was provided when companies opted for short-term suspension or furlough rather than layoffs []. In addition, experts evaluated the introduction of the Emergency Employment Stabilization Support System, which provided up to 1.5 million won per month to specially employed workers and freelancers who were not previously covered by employment insurance []. Youth employment and short-term job creation programs were also expanded, implementing labor market measures to promote youth employment and alleviate short-term unemployment pressures [].\nRegarding industrial policy, experts assessed that the establishment of the Key Industry Stabilization Fund (approximately 40 trillion won) contributed to preventing insolvency in critical sectors such as aviation and shipping, thereby enhancing overall economic stability []. During the easing of social distancing measures, private consumption was promoted through campaigns targeting consumer sectors, including tourism and dining, while an integrated strategy was implemented to maintain the K-Quarantine system and simultaneously restore consumption and employment. Differentiated support measures were applied according to social distancing levels, and in 2021, the Small Business Loss Compensation Act was enacted, which is considered to have compensated for direct economic losses. During the period of eased restrictions, various initiatives, including discount coupons, were implemented to stimulate consumption in the tourism, accommodation, and dining sectors [].\nFurthermore, the Korean New Deal program promoted large-scale investments in digital and green industries. Experts assessed that it enhanced the competitiveness of advanced industries such as AI, semiconductors, urban air mobility (UAM), clean hydrogen, autonomous driving, battery recycling, and MyData-based services, while facilitating industrial restructuring []. While these measures provided a short-term economic cushion, they reportedly imposed fiscal burdens and contributed to inflationary pressures.\nThe government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic is evaluated as having achieved a rapid and robust recovery through the implementation of multifaceted economic policies designed to bolster domestic demand and mitigate economic disruption. Experts estimated that private consumption grew by 3.6% in 2021, recovering from the severe contraction in 2020, while facility investment increased by 8.3% in 2021 []. Exports reportedly reached a record high of $644.5 billion, driven by the global economic recovery, increased semiconductor demand, and government support []. This performance is cited as evidence of Korea\u2019s recognition as a model country in crisis response, given its relatively low negative growth rate among G20 and OECD member countries and its rapid recovery of economic scale to pre-crisis levels []. Experts also noted Korea's success in mitigating the overall economic impact, supporting small businesses, driving export-oriented growth, and accelerating the transition to a digital economy, thereby fostering development in sectors associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\nThe Yoon Seok-yeol administration (2022\u2013April 2025) was assessed as implementing a multifaceted policy framework aimed at post-COVID-19 economic recovery, restoring fiscal soundness, and transforming industrial structures. To address high inflation, the government reportedly expanded the energy voucher program for low-income households to alleviate heating costs []. Loan maturity extensions and repayment deferrals (2022\u20132024) were provided to small and medium-sized enterprises and the self-employed, and interest rate reduction programs were implemented for young people and financially vulnerable groups to mitigate financial burdens []. To stabilize consumer prices, the Consumer Price Stabilization Committee was established, and customized measures were introduced to secure essential living expenses, including discount coupons for agricultural, livestock, and fishery products [].\nExperts assessed that a market-led growth strategy was pursued to transform industrial structures and attract investment, thereby strengthening the role of the private sector. Large-scale regulatory reforms and investment promotion policies were implemented, with the objective of enhancing national competitiveness by fostering strategic industries such as semiconductors and secondary batteries. To increase public spending efficiency, a shift toward private-sector-led development was emphasized. Regarding labor market and social safety net policies, the expansion of employment insurance coverage for platform and non-regular workers, as well as programs supporting asset accumulation and youth employment (e.g., the Youth Leap Account), were implemented []. Furthermore, the promotion of advanced industries under the New Growth Strategy 4.0 was actively pursued, reportedly achieving outcomes in both export recovery and structural industrial transformation [].\nDespite challenging domestic and international conditions, including high inflation and elevated interest rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Yoon Seok-yeol administration implemented various economic measures, including strengthened fiscal support and private-sector-led growth initiatives. Experts particularly evaluated the targeted fiscal support for small business owners and the self-employed as effective in improving the business environment and fostering a shift toward private-sector-driven growth. However, the overall impact of these policies was perceived as limited, and evaluations of their effectiveness were mixed.\nThe Moon Jae-in administration\u2019s COVID-19 economic measures are assessed as having focused on short-term economic stabilization and direct support, with an emphasis on economic recovery and consumption revitalization through targeted interventions for affected industries. Experts noted that financial support for SMEs, the self-employed, and youth job creation programs provided immediate economic relief. In contrast, the Yoon Seok-yeol administration emphasized long-term industrial competitiveness and structural transformation. Experts highlighted that the administration sought to foster strategic industries such as semiconductors and secondary batteries, establish a cutting-edge industrial ecosystem under the New Growth Strategy 4.0, and promote investment in emerging industries, including urban air mobility (UAM), clean hydrogen, autonomous driving, battery recycling, and MyData-based services. This focus on private-sector-led growth and structural industrial transformation laid the foundation for sustained, long-term economic growth.\nConsequently, the Moon Jae-in administration is characterized by its focus on supporting existing industries impacted by the pandemic and providing short-term, direct economic relief. The Yoon Seok-yeol administration, by contrast, expanded policy scope to prioritize the development of strategic, advanced industries and structural industrial transformation.\nThe forthcoming Lee Jae-myung administration is expected to prioritize the development of future-oriented industries, including AI, secondary batteries, biotechnology, and clean energy, as central components of its economic policy agenda. Experts predict that these sectors, as advanced technology-based strategic industries, will strengthen domestic manufacturing competitiveness, secure new growth engines, and play a pivotal role in creating high value-added employment and transforming industrial structures []. \nIn particular, AI and data-driven industries are expected to be crucial for long-term economic growth and international competitiveness, by enhancing productivity, enabling customized services, and achieving global market leadership. Therefore, experts anticipate that the Lee Jae-myung administration's policy emphasis on fostering future-oriented industries represents a strategic investment in structural recovery and sustainable, long-term economic growth, rather than a short-term economic stimulus.\nTo stabilise the inflated economy, the government has passed the \"Korean New Deal Program\" to invest 144 billion dollars. This expansionary fiscal policy promoted private consumption and increased the number of jobs. This expansionary fiscal stimulus is designed to recover the economic and social impact of COVID-19 from the existing climate and environmental dangers. The New Deal policy is divided explicitly into healthcare and green industries.\nSouth Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance asserted the New Growth Strategy 4.0 in August 2023. The New Growth Strategy suggests projects for South Korea's long-term industry growth. The South Korean government advocates these policies as a New Growth 4.0 project, which aims to generate tangible outcomes in the future by setting the focus of policy and investments towards emerging industries. To achieve these goals, the strategy outlines the following key guidelines:\nBesides this, South Korea is one of the countries with excellent healthcare systems, biomedical technology, and AI technology. While South Korea's value in the medical industry is projected at around 6.7 billion dollars, the medical technology market is projected to reach 11.5 billion dollars. The annual projected growth rate of the medical industry is over 6%, which indicates a bright future for the industry. Many economists suggest that by adopting AI technology, South Korea will be a bio-medical industry-leading country.\u00a0An article about the future data-driven healthcare industry in South Korea suggests that AI technology helps the medical industry provide customised medical services for patients and can utilise the benefits and costs.\nIn April 2025, the incorporation of Korean government bonds into the \"World Government Bond Index\" was postponed from November this year to April next year. After being listed as a prospective candidate for incorporation in September 2022, it was successfully included in the regular market classification report in the second half of October 2024.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022\u20132027). Inflation below 5% is in green.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSectors.\nGovernment finance \nIn 2023, Government expenditure in South Korea accounted for 35% of its GDP. The total amount of Government expenditure has increased significantly since the 1990s. From the 1960s to the 1980s, when Korea's economic development was concentrated, the government's finances were mainly focused on economic development. The proportion of government finances devoted to social development was relatively insignificant. The government's fiscal scale gradually expanded, and in 1981, \u2018Consolidated Fiscal scale\u2019 as a Percentage of GDP reached 23.1%, but the government implemented a strong fiscal austerity policy aimed at economic stability, and the relative fiscal scale shrank significantly to the 15% range. Although the targeted price stability was achieved, the reduced government finance could not fulfill its original function, and the social development sector, which was relatively out of interest in government expenditure, was hit hard. Under these circumstances, the expansionary fiscal stance has been promoted \"for the normalization of fiscal functions\" since the 1990s. Kim Young-sam administration, which was launched in 1993, increased the tax burden to support the expansionary finances. Since then, Kim Dae Jung administration and Roh Moo Hyun administration have also continued to expand fiscal spending through tax increase. This also led to an increase in welfare expenditure. Kim Dae Jung administration established a welfare system by introducing the National Basic Livelihood Security System, and Roh Moo Hyun administration set an annual welfare expenditure growth rate of 10% and tried to allocate budget to the welfare sector first. The tax increase policy changed in the Lee Myung Bak government. In 2008, Lee Myung Bak government implemented a tax reduction policy that significantly lowered the tax rates of income tax, corporate tax, and comprehensive real estate holding tax. Park Geun Hye administration adopted \u2018no-tax increase\u2019 policy stance, continuing the Lee Myung Bak administration's tax reduction stance.\nThe role of government finance in the national economy is growing, and government expenditure keeps increasing. But the growth rate of the national budget varies across administrations, reflecting shifts in fiscal policy between expansionary and austerity stances. Under the Moon Jae-in administration, the 'year-on-year growth rate of the national budget' steadily increased after its inauguration in 2017, reaching nearly 9% from 2019 onward. However, with the transition to the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, the growth rate slowed to around 5% and further declined to approximately 2.5% in 2025 budget. Lee Jae-myung administration has allocated a record-high budget of 728 trillion KRW for 2026, with the year-on-year growth rate rising again to around 8%.\nAutomobile.\nThe automobile industry was one of South Korea's major growth and export industries in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, the capacity of the South Korean motor industry had increased more than fivefold since 1984; it exceeded 1 million units in 1988. Total investment in cars and car-component manufacturing was over US$3 billion in 1989. Total production (including buses and trucks) for 1988 totaled 1.1 million units, a 10.6 percent increase over 1987, and grew to an estimated 1.3 million vehicles (predominantly passenger cars) in 1989. Almost 263,000 passenger cars were produced in 1985\u2014a figure that grew to approximately 846,000 units in 1989. In 1988 automobile exports totaled 576,134 units, of which 480,119 units (83.3 percent) were sent to the United States. Throughout most of the late 1980s, much of the growth of South Korea's automobile industry was the result of a surge in exports; 1989 exports, however, declined 28.5 percent from 1988. This decline reflected sluggish car sales to the United States, especially at the less expensive end of the market, and labour strife at home. South Korea today has developed into one of the world's largest automobile producers. The Hyundai Motor Group is South Korea's largest automaker in terms of revenue, production units and worldwide presence.\nConstruction.\nConstruction has been an important South Korean export industry since the early 1960s, and remains a critical source of foreign currency and \"invisible\" export earnings. By 1981, overseas construction projects, most of them in the Middle East, accounted for 60 percent of the work undertaken by South Korean construction companies. Contracts that year were valued at US$13.7 billion. In 1988, however, overseas construction contracts totaled only US$2.6 billion (orders from the Middle East were US$1.2 billion), a 1 percent increase over the previous year, while new orders for domestic construction projects totaled US$13.8 billion, an 8.8 percent increase over 1987. South Korean construction companies therefore concentrated on the rapidly growing domestic market in the late 1980s. By 1989, there were signs of a revival of the overseas construction market: the Dong Ah Construction Company signed a US$5.3 billion contract with Libya to build the second phase (and other subsequent phases) of Libya's Great Man-Made River Project, with a projected cost of US$27 billion when all 5 phases were completed. South Korean construction companies signed over US$7 billion of overseas contracts in 1989. South Korea's largest construction companies include Samsung C&amp;T Corporation, which built some of the highest buildings and most noteworthy skyscrapers such as three consecutively the world's tallest buildings: the Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, and the Burj Khalifa.\nDefense.\nDuring the 1960s, South Korea was dependent on the United States to supply its armed forces, but after the elaboration of President Richard M. Nixon's policy of Vietnamisation in the early 1970s, South Korea began to manufacture its own weapons.\nSince the 1980s, South Korea has begun exporting military equipment and technology to boost its international trade. Some of its key military export projects include the T-155 Firtina self-propelled artillery for Turkey; the K11 air-burst rifle for the United Arab Emirates; the Bangabandhu class guided-missile frigate for Bangladesh; fleet tankers such as Sirius class for the navies of Australia, New Zealand, and Venezuela; Makassar class amphibious assault ships for Indonesia; and the KT-1 trainer aircraft for Turkey, Indonesia, and Peru.\nSouth Korea also exports various core components of other countries' advanced military hardware. Those hardware include modern aircraft such as F-15K fighters and AH-64 attack helicopters which will be used by Singapore, whose airframes will be built by Korea Aerospace Industries in a joint-production deal with Boeing. In other major outsourcing and joint-production deals, South Korea has jointly produced the S-300 air defence system of Russia via Samsung Group, and will facilitate the sales of Mistral class amphibious assault ships to Russia that will be produced by STX Corporation. The deal was cancelled in 2014 due to Russia's actions in Ukraine and the ships were sold to Egypt instead. South Korea's defence exports were $1.03 billion in 2008 and $1.17 billion in 2009.\nElectronics.\nElectronics is one of South Korea's main industries. During the 1980s through the 2000s, South Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, and SK led South Korea's growth. In 2017, 17.1% of South Korea's exports were semiconductors produced by Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Samsung and LG are also major producers in electronic devices such as televisions, smartphones, display, and computers. semiconductor exports reached a record $15 billion in August 2025, an increase of nearly a third from 2024, contributing to total monthly exports of $58.4 billion.\nMining.\nMost of the mineral deposits on the Korean Peninsula are located in North Korea, with the South only possessing an abundance of tungsten and graphite. Coal, iron ore, and molybdenum are found in South Korea, but not in large quantities and mining operations are on a small scale. Much of South Korea's minerals and ore are imported from other countries. Most South Korean coal is anthracite that is only used for heating homes and boilers.\nIn 2019, South Korea was the 3rd-largest world producer of bismuth, the 4th largest world producer of rhenium, and the 10th largest world producer of sulfur.\nShipbuilding.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea became a leading producer of ships, including oil supertankers, and oil-drilling platforms. The country's major shipbuilder was Hyundai, which built a 1-million-ton capacity drydock at Ulsan in the mid-1970s. Daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in 1980 and finished a 1.2-million-ton facility at Okpo on Geoje Island, south of Busan, in mid-1981. The industry declined in the mid-1980s because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession. There was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late 1980s; new orders for 1988 totaled 3 million gross tons valued at US$1.9\u00a0billion, decreases from the previous year of 17.8 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. These declines were caused by labour unrest, Seoul's unwillingness to provide financial assistance, and Tokyo's new low-interest export financing in support of Japanese shipbuilders. However, the South Korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early 1990s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing. South Korea eventually became the world's dominant shipbuilder with a 50.6% share of the global shipbuilding market as of 2008. Notable Korean shipbuilders are Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and the now bankrupt STX Offshore &amp; Shipbuilding.\nTourism.\nIn 2012, 11.1 million foreign tourists visited South Korea, making it one of the most visited countries in the world, up from 8.5 million in 2010. Many tourists from all around Asia visit South Korea which has been due to the rise of the Korean Wave (\"Hallyu\").\nSeoul is the principal tourist destination for visitors; popular tourist destinations outside of Seoul include the major coastal city of Busan, the Seorak-san national park, the historic city of Gyeongju, and subtropical Jeju Island.\nMergers and acquisitions.\nSince 1991, there has been a steady upwards trend in South Korean M&amp;A until 2018 with only a short break around 2004. Since 1991, around 18,300 deals in, into or out of South Korea have been announced, which sum up to a total value of over 941 bil. USD. 2016 has been the year with the largest deal value (1,818 in bil. USD) and the most deals (82,3).\nTarget industries are distributed very evenly with no industry taking a larger share than 10%. The top three target industries are electronics (9.7%), semiconductors (9.1%) and metals and mining (7.7%). However, over 51% of the acquiring companies originate from the financial and brokerage sector.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

The number of telephones in use in 1987 reached 9.2 million, a considerable increase from 1980, when there were 2.8 million subscribers (which, in turn, was four times the number of subscribers in 1972).\nRadio, and in more recent years television, reached virtually every resident. By 1945 there were about 60,000 radio sets in the country. By 1987 there were approximately 42 million radio receivers in use, and more than 100 radio stations were broadcasting. Transistor radios and television sets have made their way to the most remote rural areas. Television sets, now mass-produced in South Korea, became far less expensive; most city people and a significant number of rural families owned or had access to a television. Ownership of television sets grew from 25,000 sets when broadcasting was initiated in 1961 to an estimated 8.6 million sets in 1987, and more than 250 television stations were broadcasting.\nTelephone.\nMobile phone.\nThere are three mobile phone service providers: SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus.\nTelevision.\nSouth Korea has seven national terrestrial television networks from four broadcaster; KBS 1TV, KBS 2TV, KBS NEWS D, MBC TV, SBS TV, EBS 1TV, and EBS 2TV. All terrestrial channels are digital (ATSC) since January 2013. KBS NEWS D, a terrestrial MMS channel that opened before and after the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, is the latest broadcasting station to open.\nFrom November 2011, four generalist channel are available on cable television; TV CHOSUN, JTBC, Channel A, and MBN.\nInternet.\nIT and Broadband Development.\nToday, South Korea has the highest number of broadband users. The rapid growth of the Korean broadband market was the result of a combination of government pushes and market factors. The government was active in promoting privatization and deregulation in general, and the information technology (IT) sector was no exception.\nThe government implemented structural reforms in July 1990. Since the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has pursued a policy of high-speed telecommunication infrastructure as a foundation to build a \u201cknowledge-based society.\u201d In the telecommunications sector, competition was allowed on an incremental basis and, in the market for value added services, full competition was allowed. In March 1995, Korea Information Infrastructure (KII) was established. KII's goal was to advance the nation's IT infrastructure. In August 1995, the Framework Act on Information Promotion was enacted.\nThe country then experienced economic crisis in 1997 with the rest of the region. During the economic reforms being implemented after the financial crisis, the information technology (IT) sector was one of several that was targeted and considered to be an important factor in the recovery of the nation's economy. In 1999, the government implemented the program known as Cyber Korea 21, which was intended to accelerate IT development.\nIn 1999, the government provided US$77 million in loans with preferential rates to facilities service providers (FSP). In 2000, another US$77 million was provided in loans for suburban areas, small cities and towns, and regional industrial areas. Another US$926 million was provided until 2005 in order to supply the rural areas with broadband.\nCommensurate with its investment funding, the government implemented various policies designed to increase internet use among the general population. The government provided \u201cinternet literacy\u201d lessons to homemakers, the elderly, military personnel, and farmers. In June 2000, the government implemented what was known as the \u201cTen Million People Internet Education\u201d project, the purpose of which was to provide internet education to ten million people.\nThe number of broadband subscribers in Korea reached 10 million in October 2002, with about 70% out of 14.3 million homes connected at the speed of over 2\u00a0Mbit/s.\nIn 2002, there were six operators providing broadband services in Korea. The market share leader was Korea Telecom (KT), with approximately 45.8% market share (4.5 million subscribers), followed by Hanaro Telecom with approximately 28.6% of the market and Thrunet with approximately 13.1%. of the market. In terms of technology, KT primarily uses Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). Hanaro uses a mix of cable and DSL. Thrunet service is mainly provided through cable modem.\nAt end of June 2011, subscribers of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service achieve 10.1 million or around 20 percent of South Korea's population.\nOn February 27, 2024, Twitch has ended service in Korea due to the double charge of internet usage fee by the 3 Korean mobile service providers."}
{"id": "27026", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27026", "title": "Transport in South Korea", "text": "Transportation in South Korea is provided by extensive networks of railways, highways, bus routes, ferry services and air routes that traverse the country. South Korea is the third country in the world to operate a maglev train, which was an automatically run people mover at Incheon International Airport.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of modern infrastructure began with the first Five-Year Development Plan (1962\u201366), which included the construction of 275 kilometers of railways and several small highway projects. Construction of the Gyeongbu Expressway, which connects the two major cities of Seoul and Busan, was completed on 7 July 1970.\nIn 1970, around half of the population of Seoul, one of South Korea's most industrial cities, had moved to it only in the prior decade. With the rapid increase of people traveling across the country, a means of transporting large groups of people was needed. Public transportation, such as trams and railways, was installed for these people to move quickly. These people naturally settled in close proximity to jobs or near easy-to-move stations. The concentration of population in large cities continued and more transportation was needed to move these people.\nThe 1970s saw increased commitment to infrastructure investments. The third Five-Year Development Plan (1972\u201376) added the development of airports and seaports. The Subway system was built in Seoul, the highway network was expanded by 487\u00a0km and major port projects were started in Pohang, Ulsan, Masan, Incheon and Busan.\nThe development of industry and automobile technology in the 1960s led to a growing number of people having private cars, mainly in advanced countries such as Europe. The number of cars has more than doubled in Europe in a decade. People can go anywhere, anytime by car. Even now, the demand for cars continues to grow. Increased demand for cars has also helped ease the population's downtown concentration. This is because you can buy a cheap house in a relatively remote area that was difficult to access by public transportation and travel by car. At first, residential areas were formed in the center of the city, and the size of the city grew as the concentric circle grew from the center. Of course, new roads had to be built and intersections, circular roads and highways had to be built to accommodate the growing number of cars. In other words, transportation systems such as private cars and road expansion have been developed to speed up travel time. The problem of environmental pollution is also a reason why public transportation has developed. The car's fuel is consumed and pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and dust due to incomplete combustion are also released. By the 1990s, cars also emitted sulfur dioxide.\nThe railroad network experienced improvements in the 1980s with electrification and additional track projects. Operation speed was also increased on the main lines. Though the railroad was still more useful for transportation of freight, passenger traffic was also growing. There was 51,000 kilometers of roadways by 1988. Expressway network was expanded to connect more major cities and reached a combined length of 1,539 kilometers before the end of the decade.\nRail.\nThe largest railway operator is Korail. Railway network is managed by Korea Rail Network Authority.\nKorea Train Express began service in April 2004 as Korea's first high-speed service. Intercity services are provided by ITX-Saemaeul and Mugunghwa-ho. ITX-Saemaeul generally stops less than Mugunghwa-ho. They stop in all stations and seat reservation is not available. On routes where KTX operates, air travel significantly declined with fewer passengers choosing to fly and airlines offering fewer flights.\nNuriro Train service runs between Seoul-Sinchang route and other lines. Nuriro Train serves commuters around Seoul Metropolitan Area, providing shorter travel time than Seoul Subway. The rapid trains have same cost and seat reservation as Mugunghwa-ho. Korail plans to expand the service area. (Stopped its service)\nSubways.\nSouth Korea's six largest cities \u2014 Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, Daejeon and Incheon \u2014 all have subway systems.\nSeoul's subway system is the oldest system in the country, with the Seoul Station \u2013 Cheongnyangni section of Line 1 opening in 1974.\nTrams.\nThe first tram line in Seoul started operation between Seodaemun and Cheongnyangni in December 1898. The network was expanded to cover the whole downtown area (Jung-gu and Jongno-gu districts) as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, including Cheongnyangni in the east, Mapo-gu in the west, and Noryangjin across the Han River to the south.\nThe networks reached its peak in 1941, but was abandoned in favor of cars and the development of a subway system in 1968. Seoul Subway Line 1 and Line 2 follow the old streetcar routes along Jongno and Euljiro, respectively.\nA new tram line is scheduled to open in Seoul in 2025, and openings are planned in Suwon and Seongnam in Gyeonggi-do, as well as in Busan and Daejeon.\nBuses.\nRegional services.\nVirtually all towns in South Korea of all sizes are served by regional bus service. Regional routes are classified as \"gosok bus\" (\uace0\uc18d\ubc84\uc2a4, \"high speed\" express bus) or \"sioe bus\" (\uc2dc\uc678\ubc84\uc2a4, \"suburban\" intercity bus) with gosok buses operating over the longer distances and making the fewest (if any) stops en route. Shioe buses typically operate over shorter distances, are somewhat slower, and make more stops. It is possible to reach another city by https://. From Seoul, the place is Express Bus Terminal, the subway station is served by Seoul Subway Lines 3, 7 and 9.\nLocal services.\nWithin cities and towns, two types of city bus operate in general: \"jwaseok\" (\uc88c\uc11d, \"coach\") and \"dosihyeong\" (\ub3c4\uc2dc\ud615, \"city type\") or \"ipseok\" (\uc785\uc11d, \"standing\"). Both types of bus often serve the same routes, make the same (or fewer) stops and operate on similar frequencies, but jwaseok buses are more expensive and offer comfortable seating, while doshihyeong buses are cheaper and have fewer and less comfortable seats. Many small cities and towns do not have jwaseok buses and their buses are officially called \"nongeochon\" (\ub18d\uc5b4\ucd0c, \"rural area\" bus). The local buses in Seoul and other cities are categorized by colours: the blue buses are trunk lines that cross the entire city, the green ones are circulator/short run lines that connect passengers with subway or railway stations, and the red buses are express lines go out of the city to nearby suburbs.\nSome cities have their own bus classifying systems.\nOther services.\nIncheon International Airport is served by an extensive network of high-speed buses from all parts of the country.\nBeginning in the late 1990s, many department stores operated their own small networks of free buses for shoppers, but government regulation, confirmed by a court decision on June 28, 2001, have banned department stores from operating buses. However, most churches, daycare centres and private schools send buses around to pick up their congregants, patients or pupils.\nFares.\nBus fares vary depending on the type of bus, the method of payment, and the age of the passenger. Passengers pay the right fare by placing their transportation card, which they can fill with money prior, on a card terminal. Among the various types (mainly classified according to distance traveled), there is a separate application for bus booking. The app has a simple payment function and passengers can quickly make a reservation, choosing a boarding date and seat. There are machines at bus stops that allow passengers to check their remaining balance on their transportation cards. In addition, the arrival time and remaining seats of the buses at the bus stop in question are displayed on the electronic display board. Passengers can determine the arrival time of a bus on various transportation applications.\nInclusion of Taxis.\nIn South Korea, public transportation methods and facilities, like buses and railroad stations, receive financial support from the government. Not included in the list are taxis. Some South Koreans argue that taxi drivers should be included in public transportation even if they do not have regular connections due to the nature of taxis. On the other hand, other South Koreans disagree and express their opinions that what is considered the current means of public transportation should be maintained.\nSome members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea proposed a bill to include taxis in the scope of public transportation in 2012, but bus drivers and operators decided to suspend the operation of buses in Korea in protest. In addition, the bill was opposed by the South Korean government. In April 2023, another bill has been put forward to include taxis in the group of public transportation methods.\nAccommodations.\nPublic transportation in South Korea lack accommodations for people with disabilities. For buses, there are low floor buses with low footrest heights and though they have increased in number compared to the past, they are still lacking. There are some areas where low-floor buses have difficulty running, making people who use them face difficulty when traveling to those areas. For subways, there are elevators and spaces for wheelchairs to help people with disabilities travel, however these places are often crowded and used by other passengers as well. Even for taxis (which are still being debated on being a part of public transportation), people with disabilities must reserve priorly to ride a taxi, and even then, usually have to wait a long time before it arrives. The lack of accommodations in the transportation system also has a social effect, as it has affected the number of people with disabilities who leave their homes to travel.\nRoads.\nHighways in South Korea are classified as freeways (expressways/motorways), national roads and various classifications below the national level. Almost all freeways are toll highways and most of the expressways are built, maintained and operated by Korea Expressway Corporation (KEC).\nThe freeway network serves most parts of South Korea. Tolls are collected using an electronic toll collection system. KEC also operates service amenities (dining and service facilities) en route.\nThere are also several privately financed toll roads. Nonsan-Cheonan Expressway, Daegu-Busan Expressway, Incheon International Airport Expressway, Seoul-Chuncheon Expressway and parts of the Seoul Ring Expressway are wholly privately funded and operated BOT concessions. Donghae Expressway was built in cooperation between KEC and the National Pension Service.\nTotal length of the South Korean road network was 86,989\u00a0km in 1998. Of this, 1,996\u00a0km was expressways and 12,447\u00a0km national roads. By 2009, combined length of the expressways had reached approximately 3,000\u00a0km, it mostly equal to the whole area of South Korea\nBicycle.\nIn Korea, there is a record that Seo Jae-pil first introduced bicycles in 1895 after returning from the U.S. in the 1890s and toured the construction site of Independence Gate. At that time, it was called a wheelbarrow, but the government named it Bicycle in the 1903s.\nWhen other public transportation is crowded, office workers often use bicycles as a faster transportation method when commuting. As the number of bicycle riders increased, almost every part of the country also built bike lanes. Bicycle-only roads are mainly accessible, and are designed to reduce the contact accidents between pedestrians and bicycles.\nSocial Benefits.\nThere are many bicycle clubs in South Korea, as many people enjoy riding bicycles as a leisure activity. Many join bicycle clubs so they can build a bond between people and live a healthier life. However, there are growing calls for improvement as they are driving on motorways rather than bicycle lanes, and are feared to cause contact accidents between bicycles and cars.\nWaterways.\nVirtually cut off from the Asian mainland, South Korea is a seafaring nation, with one of the world's largest shipbuilding industries and an extensive system of ferry services. South Korea operates one of the largest merchant fleets serving China, Japan and the Middle East. Most fleet operators are large conglomerates, while most ferry operators are small, private operators.\nThere are 1,609\u00a0km of navigable waterways in South Korea, though use is restricted to small craft.\nFerries.\nThe southern and westerns coasts of the country are dotted with small islands which are served by ferries. In addition, the larger offshore Jeju and Ulleung Islands are also served by ferry. Major centres for ferry service include Incheon, Mokpo, Pohang and Busan, as well as China and Japan.\nPorts and harbours.\nThe cities have major ports Jinhae, Incheon, Gunsan, Masan, Mokpo, Pohang, Busan ( Busan Port), Donghae, Ulsan, Yeosu, Jeju.\nMerchant Marine.\nIn 1999, there was a total of 461 merchant ships (1,000 GT or over) totalling 5,093,620 GT/\u00a0tonnes deadweight (DWT). These are divisible by type as follows:\nAir travel.\nKorean Air was founded by the government in 1962 to replace Korean National Airlines and has been privately owned since 1969. It was South Korea's sole airline until 1988. In 2008, Korean Air served 2,164 million passengers, including 1,249 million international passengers.\nA second carrier, Asiana Airlines, was established in 1988 and originally served Seoul, Jeju and Busan domestically and Bangkok, Singapore, Japan and Los Angeles internationally. By 2006, Asiana served 12 domestic cities, 66 cities in 20 foreign countries for commercial traffic and 24 cities in 17 countries for cargo traffic.\nCombined, South Korean airlines currently serve 297 international routes. Smaller airliners, such as Air Busan, Jin Air, Eastar Jet and Jeju Air, provide domestic service and Japan/Southeast Asian route with lower fares.\nSouth Korea contains the busiest passenger air corridor as measured by passengers per year. Over ten million people traveled between Seoul Gimpo Airport and Jeju in 2015 alone. As competition is fierce and prices affordable, the trend has been increasingly towards more air travel on this route. Similarly, air travel is also growing between Jeju and other mainland airports. There is discussion about a Jeju Undersea Tunnel which would make many of these domestic flights redundant.\nAlong other routes, air travel competes with the KTX high speed rail service and has declined in the 2000s and 2010s.\nAirports.\nConstruction of South Korea's largest airport, Incheon International Airport, was completed in 2001, in time for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. By 2007, the airport was serving 30 million passengers a year. The airport has been selected as the \"Best Airport Worldwide\" for four consecutive years since 2005 by Airports Council International.\nSeoul is also served by Gimpo International Airport (formerly Kimpo International Airport). International routes mainly serve Incheon, while domestic services mainly use Gimpo. Other major airports are in Busan and Jeju.\nThere are 103 airports in South Korea (1999 est.) and these may be classified as follows.\nAirports with paved runways:\n\"total:\"\n67\n\"over 3,047 m:\"\n1\n\"2,438 to 3,047 m:\"\n18\n\"1,524 to 2,437 m:\"\n15\n\"914 to 1,523 m:\"\n13\n\"under 914 m:\"\n20 (1999 est.)\nAirports with unpaved runways:\n\"total:\"\n36\n\"over 3,047 m:\"\n1\n\"914 to 1,523 m:\"\n3\n\"under 914 m:\"\n32 (1999 est.)\nHeliports:\n203 (1999 est.)\nEtiquette.\nIn South Korean buses and subways, proper etiquette includes not talking or calling loudly as the systems are used by many other people, keeping the facilities clean, and avoiding the consumption of foods. For safety reasons, passengers board in order and get off in turn. In the subway, the proper system of passengers getting on and off is considered to be waiting for passengers to get off first and then getting on. Younger individuals are expected to give up their seat when the elderly and the weak board on the bus or subway as well.\nPipelines.\nThese pipelines are for petroleum products.\nAdditionally, there is a parallel petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) pipeline being completed\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The ROK Armed Forces is one of the largest and most powerful standing armed forces in the world with a reported personnel strength of 3,600,000 in 2022 (500,000 active and 3,100,000 reserve).\nThe Republic of Korea Armed Forces traces its roots back to the establishment of the Korean Republic in 1919 wherein its armed wing was called the Korean Liberation Army and it conducted warfare against the Japanese occupation by conducting large-scale offensives, assassinations, bombings, sabotage, and search and rescue missions. Formally founded in 1948, following the establishment of the South Korean government after the liberation of Korea in 1945, South Korea's military forces are responsible for maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state and also engage in peacekeeping operations, humanitarian and disaster relief efforts worldwide.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces can be traced back to the Korean Independence Army, which was established by the Provisional Government of Korea in exile in Chongking, Republic of China in 1940 during the Japanese rule of Korea. Many of its members became part of the South Korean armed forces later. In addition, some ethnic Korean Kuomintang and Manchukuo soldiers also contributed to the forces.\nAfter Korea was liberated from the Empire of Japan on August 15, 1945, the Korean Constabulary () and the Korean Coast Guard (\uc870\uc120\ud574\uc548\uacbd\ube44\ub300, organized by Sohn Won-yil and others) were established through the United States Army Military Government in Korea. The Korean Constabulary and the Korean Coast Guard became the Republic of Korea Army and Republic of Korea Navy respectively, and formed the Republic of Korea Armed Forces after the South Korean government was established on August 15, 1948. The Republic of Korea Air Force was founded in October 1949.\nThe South Korean armed forces remained largely constabulary forces until the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, requiring the United Nations to intervene with United States-led forces. The South Korean military rapidly developed during the Korean War, despite suffering enormous casualties. As the Soviets had armed North Korea, the U.S. armed and trained the South Korean military throughout the Korean War. After the Korean War, South Korea established a joint military partnership with the United States, termed the ROK-U.S. Alliance, as outlined by the Mutual Defense Treaty. During the Vietnam War, the ROK Army and ROK Marines were among those fighting alongside South Vietnam and the United States.\nIn the 1970s, through the Park Chung Hee Administration's \"\"Yulgok\" Plan\" (), South Korea began to build up self-reliant, national defense capability. The name derived from a scholar and an advisor to the king during the Joseon Dynasty. He had called out for an army of 10,000 men to keep the nation safe from any attacks. During South Korea's period of rapid growth in the 1980s, the military modernized, benefiting from several government-sponsored technology transfer projects and indigenous defense capability initiatives. In the 1990s, South Korean industries provided about 70 percent of the weapons, ammunition, communications and other types of equipment, vehicles, clothing, and other supplies needed by the military, and as of 2022, there are currently a total of 85 defense contractors in South Korea.\nToday, the South Korean armed forces enjoy a good mix of avant-garde as well as older conventional weapons. Its capabilities include many sophisticated Western weapon systems, complemented by a growing and increasingly more advanced indigenous defense manufacturing sector. For example, by taking advantage of the strong local shipbuilding industry, the ROK Navy has embarked on a rigorous modernization plan with ambitions to become a blue-water navy in the 2020s.\nFuture.\nThe ROK military forces are undergoing some preparation for assuming wartime operational control of the ROK's defenses. Several cutting-edge military systems are currently being inducted.\nBased on the Moon Jae-in Administration's 'Defense Reform 2.0' (\uad6d\ubc29\uac1c\ud601 2.0) and in line with the overall troop drawdown scheme, the number of generals and admirals will be reduced by 17 percent from the current 436 to 360 by 2022 to reduce the bloated top command apparatus. This means the removal of 66 general-level positions for the Army and five each for the Navy and Air Force. At the same time, the ROK Armed Forces will see a reduction in active duty personnel from 640,000 to 517,000, and the length of compulsory military service will also be reduced to 18 \u2013 22 months by 2022.\n'Defense Reform 2.0' is also intended to make the ROK military more independent to prepare for the ROK military retaining operational control authority in wartime (OPCON transfer), rather than American general taking command. Initial operational control capability was verified in 2019, with full operational capability planned for 2021, and full mission capability planned for 2022.\nDefense strategy.\nThe signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953 by the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), ended the active hostilities of the Korean War. Since an official peace treaty has not been signed by North and South Korea, defensive actions needed to be implemented by the Republic of Korea Army in case of another North Korean attack.\nDuring the Cold War era, a variety of anti-tank barricades were constructed over roads and railroad tracks leading in and out of Seoul, as well as within the Gyeonggi Province. The anti-tank barricades or \"rock drops\" are made up of giant concrete blocks mounted on thin walls, made to look like fake bridges and overpasses, that lead to nowhere but house hundreds of tons of rubble. \nThese structures are rigged with explosives and are designed to be blown up by the South Korean Army which would drop the rubble blocking roads and railways. Along with the anti-tank barricades, the South Korean Army placed barbed-wire fences along the Han River and hundreds of 3-foot tall concrete pillars arranged in rows, known as \"dragon teeth\", across open fields. During the 1970s and 1980s when most of these structures were built, the goal was to slow down enemy tanks, troops, and other vehicles and to buy time for South Korean civilians to flee from the invading North Korean forces, as well as to allow for the Republic of Korea and the United States Army to employ troops to defensive positions. \nThe South Korean Ministry of National Defense claims that the anti-tank barricades are inspected regularly for safety concerns, but the barricades show cracks and signs of erosion.\nLocal governments and civilians are now demanding that the anti-tank barricades be removed as they pose a great safety risk, obstruct new development, and many people believe have outlived their purpose. There are about 250,000 vehicles a day that pass by the barricades and their vibrations contribute to weakening the structures. Despite safety concerns, tearing down barricades is a complicated matter.\nSince North Korea lost security and economic support from Russia in 1990 and China in 1992, a full-ground force assault on South Korea is unlikely according to military analysts. North Korea has changed its military tactics and now focuses on long-range and covert strikes. Through long-range artillery barrages, missile strikes, or chemical weapons that are used to deliberately attack non-American targets and short of all-out war, the North could seek to hold Seoul hostage with the hope of renegotiating a new status quo. Special warfare units are expected to use wartime tunnels or various infiltration means such as submarines, air-cushion vehicles (ACVs), AN-2 aircraft, and helicopters to infiltrate the forward and rear areas and conduct hybrid operations in the form of striking major units and facilities, assassinating key figures, and disturbing the rear area.\nThe Defense Reform Base Plan was originally presented by President Roh Moo-hyun in December 2006, but after years of evolution, and political and military pushback the reform was launched by President Moon Jae-in's administration. The ROK Armed Forces will firmly implement Defense Reform 2.0 to proactively respond to changes in the security environment and omnidirectional security threats, as well as support peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula based on strength. To this end, the ROK Armed Forces will work toward \"steadfast national defense.\nOn 27 December 2022 North Korea sent five drones over the border, one reaching Seoul. All five returned to the North, despite a five hour chase involving fighter jets and attack helicopters, with some 100 rounds being fired. A KAI KT-1 Woongbi crashed although both crew survived. The Joint Chiefs of Staff released a statement in which it acknowledges it can stop attack drones. However, its ability to stop smaller spy drones is \"limited\". A senior official, Kang Shin-chul, said: \"Our military's lack of preparedness has caused a lot of concern to the people...actively employ detection devices to spot the enemy's drone from an early stage and aggressively deploy strike assets\". The South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has indicated that South Korea will invest in stealthy drones that could penetrate North Korea with the creation of a new military unit.\nThe South Korean Defence Ministry announced a new series of anti-drone measures, spending some 560 billion won over the next five years. The money will go towards four new initiatives. One is an airborne laser that will be used to destroy larger drones whilst a jammer would be used on smaller drones. A new counter drone unit, made up of two squadrons, would also be created. The laser is already in the test process and is expected to become operational in 2027. The jamming system has been described as \"soft kill\". Further work will be done on stealth jets and anti-rocket artillery systems. The total amount of the spending over the next five years is 331.4 trillion. The previous Defence budget for the last financial year was just 54.6 trillion won as a comparison.\nCommand structure.\nCommand over the ROK Armed Forces is established in the Constitution. The President is the Commander-in-Chief Forces \"ex officio\". The military authority runs from the President to the Minister of National Defense, who is often to be (but not legally bound to be) a retired four-star general. The President and Minister of National Defense are in charge of the entire military establishment, maintaining civilian control of the military. The Minister of National Defense, by order of the President, takes charge of military affairs, and supervises the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the chief of staff of each service of the Armed Forces.\nTo coordinate military strategy with political affairs, the President has a National Security Council headed by the National Security Advisor.\nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff consists of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the military service chiefs from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Unlike the U.S. counterpart, operational command of combat units falls within the purview of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who reports to the Minister of National Defense.\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a four-star general or admiral, is the senior officer of the Armed Forces. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff assists the Minister of National Defense with regard to operational command authority, and supervises the combat units of each service of the Armed Forces, by order of the Minister of National Defense. The chain of operational control runs straight from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the commandants of the Army, Navy, and Air Force operational commands. The respective chiefs of staff of each service branch (Army, Navy, and Air Force) has administrative control over his or her own service.\nService branches.\nThe ROK Armed Forces consists of the ROK Army, ROK Navy, and ROK Air Force. The ROK Marine Corps functions as a branch of the Navy. The ROK Reserve Forces is a reserve component.\nROK Army.\nThe ROK Army (ROKA) is by far the largest of the military branches, with about 420,000 personnel as of 2020. This comes as a response to both the mountainous terrain native to the Korean Peninsula (70% mountainous) as well as the heavy North Korean presence, with its 1-million-strong army, two-thirds of which is permanently garrisoned in the frontline near the DMZ. The current administration has initiated a program of self-defense, whereby South Korea would be able to fully counter the North Korean threat with purely domestic means by about 2030.\nThe ROK Army was formerly organized into three armies: the First Army (FROKA), Third Army (TROKA) and Second Operational Command each with its own headquarters, corps (not Second Operational Command), and divisions. The Third Army was responsible for the defense of the capital as well as the western section of the DMZ. The First Army was responsible for the defense of the eastern section of the DMZ whereas the Second Operational Command formed the rearguard.\nUnder a restructuring plan aimed at reducing redundancy, the First and Third Armies will be incorporated into the newly formed First Operations Command, whereas the Second ROK Army has been converted into the Second Operational Command. The army consists of the Army Headquarters, the Aviation Command, and the Special Warfare Command, with 9 corps, 36 divisions, some 464,000 troops and estimated as many as 5,850 tanks and armored vehicles, 11,337 artillery systems, 7,032 missile defense systems and 13,000 infantry support systems.\nThe army will take the brunt of the personnel reduction part of the Defense Reform 307. Associated with this personnel reduction would be a significant reduction in the ROK Army force structure, in particular decreasing the current force of 47 divisions (active duty and reserve) down to a force of about 28 divisions.\nROK Navy.\nThe ROK Navy (ROKN) is responsible for naval and amphibious operations. The ROK Navy has about 70,000 regular personnel including 29,000 Republic of Korea Marines. There are about 150 commissioned ships with the ROK Navy (a total displacement of about 215,000 tonnes). The naval aviation force consists of about 70 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.\nThe Republic of Korea Navy includes the Republic of Korea Navy Headquarters, Republic of Korea Fleet, and Republic of Korea Marine Corps. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is the highest-ranking officer of the ROK Navy, and oversees the administration of organizing, recruiting, training, equipping, supplying, and mobilizing the ROK Navy. The Republic of Korea Fleet is the highest operational command of the ROK Navy.\nSince the 1990s, the ROK Navy has been trying to build an ocean-going fleet to protect the sea lines of communication. During Admiral An Pyong-tae's tenure as CNO, President Kim Young-sam supported the Navy by approving a long-term shipbuilding plan for the ocean-going navy. In the first decade of the 21st century, the ROK Navy launched the lead ships of larger and better equipped warships with local shipbuilders: In 2002, ROKS \"Chungmugong Yi Sunshin\" (DDH 975), a 4,500-ton destroyer, was launched; in 2005, the 14,000-ton amphibious warfare ship, ROKS \"Dokdo\" (LPH 6111) was launched; in 2006, the ROK Navy launched ROKS \"Sohn Wonyil\" (SS 072), an 1,800-ton Type 214 submarine with Air-Independent propulsion (AIP) system. In 2007, the ROK Navy launched the lead ship (DDG 991) of \"Sejong the Great-\"class destroyers with the Aegis Combat System.\nThe ROK Navy completed a new naval base called Jeju Civilian-Military Complex Port in 2016 on the southern coast of Jeju Island to protect the sea lines of communication. In order to support ocean-going operations, the ROK Navy commissioned the 10,000-ton logistics support ship, ROKS \"Soyang\" (AOE 51), and launched the first locally designed 3,000-ton submarine, \"Dosan Ahn Changho\" (SS 083) in 2018. The ROK Navy continues to upgrade ongoing shipbuilding programs such as the Korean Submarine (KSS), Korean Destroyer Experimental (KDX), Frigate Experimental (FFX), and Landing Transport Experimental (LPX).\nThe ROK Navy aims to become a blue-water navy in the 2020s.\nROK Marine Corps.\nThe ROK Marine Corps (ROKMC) is a branch of the Republic of Korea Navy responsible for amphibious operations, and also functions as a rapid reaction force and a strategic reserve. The ROK Marine Corps, with 29,000 personnel, is organized into two divisions and two brigades. The ROK Marine Corps has about 300 tracked vehicles including assault amphibious vehicles, main battle tanks, and self-propelled artillery.\nThe Commandant of the Republic of Korea Marine Corps is a three-star general. Following the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010 and the subsequent establishment of the Northwest Islands Defense Command (NWIDC), the Commandant of the ROKMC has been dual-hatted as the Commander NWIDC.\nROK Air Force.\nThe ROK Air Force (ROKAF) maintains a modern air and space force in order to defend itself from various modes of threats, including the North Korean Army. The ROK Air Force fields some 450 combat aircraft of American design. In contrast, the North Korean Army has roughly 650 combat aircraft, but mostly obsolete types of Soviet and Chinese origin.\nKorea began a program for the development of indigenous jet trainers beginning in 1997. This project eventually culminated in the KAI T-50, dubbed the \"Golden Eagle\" which is used as a trainer for jet pilots, now being exported to Indonesia. A multirole all-weather version of the T-50 is the modified FA-50, which can be externally fitted with Rafael's Sky Shield or LIG Nex1's ALQ-200K ECM pods, Sniper or LITENING targeting pods, and Condor 2 reconnaissance pods to further improve the fighter's electronic warfare, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities. Other improved weapon systems over FA-50 include SPICE multifunctional guidance kits, Textron CBU-97/105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon with WCMD tail kits, JDAM, and JDAM-ER for more comprehensive air-to-ground operations, and AIM-120 missiles for BVR air-to-air operations. FA-50 has provisions for, but does not yet integrate, Python and Derby missiles, also produced by Rafael, and other anti-ship missiles, stand-off weapons, and sensors to be domestically developed by Korea.\nThe Republic of Korea Air Force also expressed interests in acquiring the RQ-4 Global Hawk and Joint Direct Attack Munition kits to further improve their intelligence and offensive capabilities.\nThe replacement programs for the F-4D/E and F-5A/B/E/F are the KTX-2 and F-X, respectively. The latter has been fulfilled by the Boeing F-15K.\nThe South Korean government also announced its plan to develop domestic helicopter manufacturing to replace the aging UH-1 helicopters, many of which had seen service during the Vietnam War. The program originally included plans to develop both a civilian and a military helicopter. This was later revised and gave priority to the utility helicopter program. Based on the success and experience of the civilian KMH (Korean Multi-purpose Helicopter), an attack helicopter with a shared configuration is planned to be developed.\nPersonnel.\nConscription in South Korea requires male citizens between the age of 18 and 28 to perform compulsory military service. Women are not required to perform military service, but they may volunteer as officers, warrant officers, or non-commissioned officers.\nThe length of compulsory military service varies based on service branches: Active duty enlisted personnel serve 18 months in the Army or Marine Corps, 20 months in the Navy, and 21 months in the Air Force (the length of military service will be reduced to 18 \u2013 22 months by 2022.). Commissioned officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers are volunteer-based, and serve longer terms than those of enlisted personnel, or as career. Non-active duty personnel such as social work personnel serve for various lengths. After conscripts finish their military service, they are automatically placed on the reserve roster.\nRanks.\nIn the South Korean armed forces, ranks fall into one of four categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer, and junior enlisted (\"\"Byeong\"), in decreasing order of authority. Commissioned officer ranks are subdivided into \"Jangseong\"-level (general) officers, \"Yeonggwan\"-level (field-grade) officers, and \"Wigwan\"\"-level (company-grade) officers. All three branches of the South Korean Armed Forces share the same rank insignia and titles in Korean (The English titles are given as comparative examples with the US Army ranks.).\nROK Navy commissioned officer ranks have two distinct sets of rank insignia: On dress uniform, a series of stripes similar to Commonwealth naval ranks are worn; on service uniforms, working uniforms, and special uniform situations (combat utilities and flight suits), the rank insignia are the same as the equivalent rank in the Army or the Air Force.\nBudget.\nSouth Korea has one of the highest defense budgets in the world, ranking 9th globally in 2021, with a budget of nearly $46.7 billion U.S. dollars, and the defense budget trends from 1975 to 2025 based on South Korea's 2020 GDP announced by the Ministry of National Defense are as follows, and the actual annual military expenditure may be higher because the amount of the executive budget does not include the supplementary budget.\nOverseas deployments.\nAs part of its mission, the ROK Armed Forces have engaged in peacekeeping operations, humanitarian, and disaster-relief efforts worldwide. In 2008, officers and soldiers of Unit Dongmyeong, stationed in Lebanon with the UNIFIL, received honorary medals from the United Nations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The country has also been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. South Korea has also hosted major international events such as the 1988 Summer Olympics and 2002 World Cup Football Tournament (2002 FIFA World Cup co-hosted with Japan) and the 2011 IAAF World Championships Daegu South Korea. Furthermore, South Korea had hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics which took place in Pyeongchang from 9 to 25 February.\nSouth Korea is a member of the United Nations, WTO, OECD/DAC, ASEAN Plus Three, East Asia Summit (EAS), and G-20. It is also a founding member of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East Asia Summit.\nOn January 1, 2007, South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon assumed the post of UN Secretary-General, serving in that post until December 31, 2016. The country held the 2023 South Korea-Pacific Islands Summit and the 2024 South Korea-Africa Summit, and is also promoting the Korea-Central Asia Summit to deepen cooperation with developing countries.\nForeign policy.\nSouth Korea's Indo-Pacific strategy is a comprehensive strategy that encompasses the economic and security spheres of Indo-Pacific countries. Announcing the strategy, the country said, \"While strengthening the rules-based International order, which is conducive to a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific, we will work towards a regional order that enables a diverse set of nations to cooperate and prosper together.\"\nFree trade agreements.\nSouth Korea has the following trade agreements:\nAs of late 2021 states of GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council\u2014Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates), Israel, Japan, Malaysia, MERCOSUR (Southern Common Market\u2014Mercado comun del sur), Mexico, Mongolia, RCEP (Asian 10 Countries, Korea, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India), Russia (BEPA), SACU (South Asia Cooperation Union) and South Korea-China-Japan are in negotiations about the FTA with South Korea. On 22 November 2023, South Korea and the United Kingdom opened up negotiations for a new Free Trade Agreement, to replace the current continuity trade agreement.\nAsia.\nChina (PRC).\nActive South Korean-Chinese people-to-people contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists and particularly families divided between South Korea and the People's Republic of China (PRC) were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Nearly 2 million ethnic Koreans, especially in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province of Northeast China, have interacted with South Koreans.\nTrade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless, Furthermore, China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the United States, and between North Korea and Japan. China also initiated and promoted tripartite talks between North Korea, South Korea and the U.S.\nSouth Korea had long been an ally of Taiwan. Diplomatic ties between Seoul and Taipei were nevertheless severed in 1992. Formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing on August 24, 1992.\nIn 2004 the PRC government began the Northeast Project, sparking a massive uproar in South Korea when the project was widely publicized.\nAfter the KORUS FTA (United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement) was finalized on June 30, 2007, the Chinese government has immediately begun seeking an FTA agreement with South Korea. The FTA between South Korea and China are under discussion. South Korea has been running a trade surplus with China which hit a record US$32.5 billion in 2009.\nTaiwan (ROC).\nOn 23 August 1992, the government of the Republic of China (by then only in control of the island of Taiwan and a few outlying areas) severed diplomatic relations with South Korea in advance of its announcement of formal recognition of the People's Republic of China based in Beijing. The Yonhap News said in 2002 that since then relations between the two governments have been \"in a rut\".\nJapan.\n \nThe relation between South Korea and Japan has both political conflicts and economic intimacies. Examples of conflicts include the East sea naming dispute, visits by successive Japanese Prime Ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine and the disputed ownership of Dokdo of the island Korea.\nOn January 18, 1952, The first president of South Korea Syngman Rhee declared that the vicinity of Dokdo was a territory of South Korea (Syngman Rhee line). Subsequently, some 3,000 Japanese fishermen who conducted fishery operations in this vicinity were captured. This incident, called the Dai Ichi Daihoumaru Ship case strained relations between South Korea and Japan.\nJune 22, 1965, The president in South Korea Park Chung Hee concluded the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and South Korea As a result, Japan considered South Korea to be the legitimate successor of its rule over the Korean Peninsula.\nSouth Korea's trade with Japan was US$892.1 million in 2008, with a surplus of nearly US$327.1 million on the Japanese side. Japanese and South Koreans firms often had interdependent relations, which gave Japan advantages in South Korea's growing market.\nIn 1996 FIFA announced that the South Korea-Japan would jointly host the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The next few years would see leaders of both countries meet to warm relations in preparations for the games. The year 2005 was designated as the \"Japan-South Korea Friendship Year\". However, the Liancourt Rocks controversy erupted again when Japan's Shimane Prefecture declared \"Takeshima Day\", inciting mass demonstrations in South Korea.\nJapan calls South Korea a partner in its diplomatic charter, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol also said, \"Korea and Japan are now partners who share universal values and pursue common interests.\"\nMongolia.\n \nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on March 26, 1990. South Korea has an embassy in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Mongolia has an embassy in Seoul.\nPhilippines.\nSince the establishment of diplomatic ties on 3 March 1949, the relationship between the Philippines and South Korea has flourished. The Philippines was one of the first countries that extended diplomatic recognition to South Korea. This was cemented with the Philippine government's deployment of the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea (PEFTOK) to help South Korea against the invasion of the communist North during the Korean War in the 1950s. After the war, the Philippines provided development assistance to South Korea and helped the country rebuild itself.\nSince then, the Philippines's relations with South Korea have evolved with South Korea becoming one of the Philippines's most important bilateral partners aside from the United States, China and Japan. The Philippines's government seeks to cultivate strategic ties with South Korea given its increasing presence in the country. In the coming years, the Philippines anticipates to benefit from exploring unprecedented opportunities from South Korea that shall contribute significantly to the country's trade and economy, defense and security, and society and culture.\nVietnam.\nThe relationship between these two Sinosphere countries is usually described as \"from enemies to friends\". Despite the two states' hostile positions in the Vietnam War and South Korean war crimes and atrocities in the Vietnam War, which still causes lingering controversies between the two states, both countries have still become each other's most important trade partner throughout their relationship. South Korea is the third biggest trade partner of Vietnam while also being the second-biggest ODA provider and the biggest foreign direct investor to Vietnam; meanwhile, Vietnam is the third-biggest trade partner of South Korea and it is also hosting many important factories and facilities of South Korea's biggest conglomerate such as Samsung and LG.\nIn December 2022, the two nations have elevated their ties to \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" \u2013 technically the highest level of bilateral relationship that is designated by the Vietnamese side. Both countries have aimed to raise their two-way trade to 100 billion U.S. dollars in 2023 and expected to reach 150 billion by the end of this decade. Besides major economic ties and cooperations, South Korea and Vietnam also plan to further cooperate in politics, cultural exchange, resources exploitation, national security as well as in the defense sectors. Both countries share core benefits, concerns, and support to each other in issues related to the security of the region, noticeably Vietnamese support towards South Korea's effort in denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula (mentioning North Korea) and South Korea's support on Vietnam's attitude towards the stability and freedom of navigation of the South China Sea. Vietnam is also an important partner of South Korea to exercise its Indo-Pacific strategy and the insight to strengthen South Korea's relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It is said that Vietnam can be a \"bridge\" or \"ambassador\" representing South Korea's influence to the Southeast Asia region.\nIn the state visit of the President of Vietnam to South Korea in December 2022, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has honored Vietnamese President Nguy\u1ec5n Xu\u00e2n Ph\u00fac as \"my very first national guest\" (referring the fact that his Vietnamese counterpart was the first head of state to visit South Korea during his terms), and also saying that the people of Vietnam and South Korea are \"close brothers\".\nNorth Korea.\nInter-Korean relations may be divided into five periods. The first stage was between 1972 and 1973; the second stage was Pyongyang North Korea's delivery of relief goods to South Korea after a typhoon caused devastating floods in 1984 and the third stage was the exchange of home visits and performing artists in 1985. The fourth stage, activated by Nordpolitik under Roh, was represented by expanding public and private contacts between the two Koreas. The fifth stage was improved following the 1997 election of Kim Dae-jung. His \"Sunshine Policy\" of engagement with North Korea set the stage for the historic June 2000 Inter-Korean summit.\nThe possibility of Korean reunification has remained a prominent topic. However, no peace treaty has yet been signed with the North. In June 2000, a historic first North Korea-South Korea summit took place, part of the South Korea's continuing Sunshine Policy of engagement. Since then, regular contacts have led to a cautious thaw. President Kim was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for the policy.\nWith that policy, continued by the following administration of president Roh Moo-hyun, economic ties between the two countries have increased, humanitarian aid has been sent to North Korea and some divided families have been briefly reunited. Military ties remain fraught with tension, however, and in 2002 a brief naval skirmish left four South Korean sailors dead, leaving the future of the Sunshine policy uncertain. The North Korea cut off talks but the South remained committed to the policy of reconciliation and relations began to thaw again. The resurgence of the nuclear issue two years later would again cast relations in doubt, but South Korea has sought to play the role of intermediary rather than antagonist, and economic ties at the time seemed to be growing again.\nDespite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006 and 2009. As of early 2009[ [update]], relationships between North Korea and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles, Ended its former agreements with South Korea and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.\nAs of 2009 North Korea and South Korea are still opposed and share a heavily fortified border.\nOn May 27, 2009, North Korea media declared that the armistice is no longer valid due to the South Korean government's pledge to \"definitely join\" the Proliferation Security Initiative. To further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations, the sinking of the South Korean warship \"Cheonan\" in March 2010, killing 46 seamen, is as of May 20, 2010 claimed by a team of researchers around the world to have been caused by a North Korean torpedo, which the North denies. South Korea agreed with the findings from the research group and president Lee Myung-bak declared in May 2010 that Seoul would cut all trade with North Korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at North Korea diplomatically and financially. As a result of this, North Korea severed all ties and completely abrogated the previous pact of non aggression.\nIn November 2010, the Unification Ministry officially declared the Sunshine Policy a failure, thus bringing the policy to an end. On November 23, 2010, North Korean artillery shelled Yeonpyeong with dozens of rounds at Yeonpyeong-ri and the surrounding area.\nAccording to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 3% of South Koreans view North Korea's influence positively, with 91% expressing a negative view. A 2015 government-sponsored poll revealed that 41% of South Koreans consider North Korea to be an enemy, with negative views being more prevalent among younger respondents. Still, in a 2017 poll, 58% of South Koreans said they don't expect another war to break out with North Korea.\nEurope.\nRussia.\nIn the 1980s South Korean president Roh Tae Woo's Nordpolitik and Mikhail Gorbachev's \"New Thinking\" were both attempts to reverse their nations' recent histories. Gorbachev had signaled Soviet interest in improving relations with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region including South Korea as explained in his July 1986 Vladivostok and August 1988 Krasnoyarsk speeches.\nIn initiating Nordpolitik Roh's confidential foreign policy adviser was rumored to have visited Moscow Russia to consult with Soviet policymakers. Kim Young Sam visited Moscow, Russian Federation from June 2 to June 10, 1989, as the Kremlin announced that it would allow some 300,000 Soviet-South Koreans who had been on the Soviet island of Sakhalin since the end of World War II to return permanently to South Korea. Moscow even arranged Kim's meeting with the North Korean ambassador to the Soviet Union In June 1990, Roh held his first summit with president Gorbachev in San Francisco, United States.\nSouth Korea and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations on September 30, 1990. These relations continued by the Russian Federation on December 27, 1991. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Seoul in February 2001 while South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun visited Moscow, Russia in September 2004.\nRussian Federal Space Agency and the Korean Astronaut Program cooperated together to send South Korea's first astronaut into space. Yi So-Yeon became the first South Korean national as well as the third woman to be the first national in space on 8 April 2008 when Soyuz TMA-12 departed from Baikonur Cosmodrome.\nSince the 1990s there has been greater trade and cooperation between the Russian Federation and South Korea. The total trade volume between South Korea and Russia in 2003 was 4.2 billion U.S. dollars.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe establishment of diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and South Korea began on 18 January 1949.\nVisits from South Korea to the United Kingdom:\nFrom the United Kingdom to South Korea:\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement has been approved in September 2010, following Italy's conditional withdrawal of its veto of the free trade agreement. The compromise made by Italy was that free trade agreement would take provisional effect on July 1, 2011. South Korea is the EU's eighth largest trade partner and the EU has become South Korea's second largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded \u20ac65 billion in 2008 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 7.5% between 2004 and 2008.\nThe EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962 and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into South Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in South Korea market due to stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with South Korea, the EU is seeking to improve this situation.\nAmericas.\nUnited States.\nThe United States engaged in the decolonization of Korea (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea) from Japan after World War II. After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established. Upon the onset of the Korean War, U.S. forces were sent to defend South Korea against invasion by North Korea and later China. Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a \"Mutual Defense Treaty\", under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both.\nIn 1968, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War. The U.S. Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and U.S. Naval Forces Korea are stationed in South Korea. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.\nSince the late 1980s, the country has instead sought to establish an American partnership, which has made the Seoul\u2013Washington relationship subject to severe strains. Trade had become a serious source of friction between the two countries. In 1989, the United States was South Korea's largest and most important trading partner and South Korea was the seventh-largest market for United States goods and the second largest market for its agricultural products.\nFrom Roh Tae-woo's administration to Roh Moo Hyun's administration, South Korea sought to establish a U.S. partnership, which has made the Seoul\u2013Washington relationship subject to some strains. In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was reportedly signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation has been repeatedly delayed, pending further approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.\nThe relations between the United States and South Korea have greatly strengthened under the Lee Myung-bak administration. At the 2009 G-20 London summit, U.S. President Barack Obama called South Korea \"one of America's closest allies and greatest friends.\"\nHowever, some anti-American sentiment in South Korea still exists; the United States' alleged role in the May 1980 Gwangju uprising was a pressing South Korean political issue of the 1980s. Even after a decade, some Gwangju citizens and other South Koreans still blamed the United States for its perceived involvement in the bloody uprising. In 2008, the protests against U.S. beef was a center of a major controversy that year.\nIn a June 2010 open letter from President of South Korea Lee Myung-bak published in the \"Los Angeles Times\", he expressed gratitude for the 37,000 Americans who were killed in the Korean War defending South Korea, saying that they fought for the freedom of South Koreans they did not even know. He stated that thanks to their sacrifices, the peace and democracy of the South Korean state was protected.\nThe U.S. states that \"The Alliance is adapting to changes in the 21st Century security environment. We will maintain a robust defense posture, backed by allied capabilities which support both nations' security interests We will continue to deepen our strong bilateral economic, trade and investment relations In the Asia-Pacific region we will work jointly with regional institutions and partners to foster prosperity, keep the peace, and improve the daily lives of the people of the region The United States and South Korea will work to achieve our common Alliance goals through strategic cooperation at every level.\"\nOn 9 October 2024, South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun emphasized the need for stronger joint military drills with the U.S. to counter North Korean threats and address concerns about growing North Korea-Russia military ties.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which South Korea maintains diplomatic relations with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Seoul, the largest city and capital, is classified as a \"teukbyeolsi\" (Special City), while the next six-largest cities are classified as \"gwangyeoksi\" (Metropolitan Cities). Smaller cities are classified as \"si\" (\"cities\") and are under provincial jurisdiction, at the same level as counties.\nCity status.\nArticle 10 of the Local Autonomy Act defines the standards under which a populated area may become a city: an area which is predominantly urbanised and has a population of at least 50,000; a which has an urbanised area with a population of at least 50,000; or a which has a total population of at least 150,000 and multiple urbanised areas each with a population of at least 20,000. \nUnder Article 3 of the Local Autonomy Act, a city with a population of less than 500,000 may create administrative subdivisions in the form of in its urbanised area and or in its rural area, while a city with a population of more than 500,000 may create administrative subdivisions in the form of non-autonomous .\nClassifications for large municipal cities.\nThe national government can designate cities of at least 500,000 inhabitants as special status cities. This status expands the scope of administrative authority delegated from the provincial government to the city government. \nBig city.\nA big city is a city (other than a special city or a metropolitan city) that has a population greater than 500,000, and has been designated by an order of the national government under Article 198 of the Local Autonomy Act. Big municipal cities are given the power to subdivide themselves into non-autonomous districts (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0). \nDue its legal status as an administrative city, Jeju City cannot be designated as a \"big city\" under the Local Autonomy Law, despite having an estimated population exceeding 500,000 as of 2022. The designation of \"administrative city\" was created by the law which granted special self-governing status to Jeju Province; that law specifically states that the Local Autonomy Act would not apply to administrative cities. As such, Jeju City does not enjoy special autonomy and only has the same legal powers as the much smaller Seogwipo. The administrative authority of Jeju City is trying to expand the scope of administrative authority delegated from the provincial government to the city government.\nSpecial-status city.\nA special-status city is a subclass of big municipal city that has a population greater than 1,500,000.\nCities by population.\nThis is a list cities of South Korea by population including provincial-level divisions: special city (\ud2b9\ubcc4\uc2dc/\u7279\u5225\u5e02) and metropolitan cities (\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc/\u5ee3\u57df\u5e02), and municipal-level division: cities (\uc2dc/\u5e02).

He was interviewed in the 1986 documentary \"Big Fun in the Big Town\". He later embraced an Afrocentric style, bringing Afrocentric culture to hip hop along with KRS-One.\nSchoolly D contributed songs and music to many Abel Ferrara films, including \"P.S.K.\" and \"Saturday Night\" (from \"Saturday Night! \u2013 The Album\") as well as \"King of New York\" to Ferrara's film of the same name and the title track from \"Am I Black Enough For You?\" that was played during the climactic shoot-out in that film, the title track from \"How a Black Man Feels\", and \"Signifying Rapper\" (from \"Smoke Some Kill\"), which was used in Ferrara's film \"Bad Lieutenant\". Because Led Zeppelin successfully sued because of an uncleared interpolation of its song \"Kashmir\" in \"Signifying Rapper\", the song was omitted from the soundtrack of the film and from subsequent releases of the film.\nComposer Joe Delia tapped Schoolly to co-write and record \"The Player\" for Ferrara's film \"The Blackout\", which Delia scored. Schoolly also wrote the score to Ferrara's \"'R Xmas\". In 2006, Schoolly D co-wrote the indie film soundtrack of the historical science fiction thriller \"Order of the Quest\" with Chuck Treece. The project series is produced by Benjamin Barnett, and Jay D Clark of Media Bureau. His eighth album, \"Funk 'N Pussy\", on Jeff \"Met\" Thies' Chord Recordings features guest appearances by Public Enemy's Chuck D, Chuck Chillout, Lady B and a drum and bass remix of the classic Schoolly D track \"Mr. Big Dick\" (remixed by UK trip hop crew The Sneaker Pimps).\nSchoolly also performed the music and occasional narration for the cult animated series \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. He was a guest on a first-season episode of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\". He also created the song \"Sharkian Nights\" for the Adult Swim series \"12 oz. Mouse\". The character Jesse B. Weaver from \"The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show\" was also named after him.\nOn December 30, 2022, he released his newest album, \"Cause Schoolly D Is Crazy\".\nLegacy.\nRapper Ice-T, who is often given credit for the creation of gangsta rap, discussed Schoolly D's influence on him in his autobiography:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first record that came out along those lines was Schoolly D's \"P.S.K.\" Then the syncopation of that rap was used by me when I made \"6 in the Mornin'.\" The vocal delivery was the same: \"...P.S.K. is makin' that green,\" \"...six in the morning, police at my door.\" When I heard that record I was like, \"Oh shit!\" and call it a bite or what you will but I dug that record. My record didn't sound like \"P.S.K.,\" but I liked the way he was flowing with it. \"P.S.K.\" was talking about Park Side Killers but it was very vague. That was the only difference, when Schoolly did it, it was \"...one by one, I'm knockin' em out.\" All he did was represent a gang on his record. I took that and wrote a record about guns, beating people down, and all that with \"6 in the Mornin'.\" \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27032", "revid": "45366078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27032", "title": "Rock paper scissors", "text": "Hand game for two players or more\nRock paper scissors (also known by several other names and word orders) is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are \"rock\" (a closed fist: \u270a), \"paper\" (a flat hand: \u270b), and \"scissors\" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V: \u270c\ufe0f). The earliest form of a \"rock paper scissors\"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century. \nA simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors (\"rock crushes scissors\" or \"breaks scissors\" or sometimes \"blunts scissors\"), but will lose to one who has played paper (\"paper covers rock\"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (\"scissors cuts paper\"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied, but is usually replayed until there is a winner.\nRock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with some degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.\nNames.\nThe modern game is known by several other names such as Rochambeau, Roshambo, Ro-sham-bo, Bato Bato Pik, and Jan-ken-pon. While the game's name is a list of three items, different countries often have the list in a different order.\nIn North America and the United Kingdom, it is known as \"rock, paper, scissors\" or \"scissors, paper, stone\". If this name is chanted while actually playing the game, it might be followed by an exclamation of \"shoot\" at the moment when the players are to reveal their choice (i.e. \"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!\").\nThere have been claims that there are regional variations of the name in Australia; one video claimed that it was referred to as \"scissors, paper, rock\" in New South Wales, \"rock, paper, scissors\" in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and \"paper, scissors, rock\" in Queensland, though this has been disputed.\nIn New Zealand, the most common name in English is \"paper, scissors, rock\". In M\u0101ori, it is known as (lit.\u2009'paper, scissors, rock').\nIn France, the game is sometimes called Shifumi (sometimes spelled Chifoumi).\nEtymology.\nThe name \"rock paper scissors\" is simply a translation of the Japanese words for the three gestures involved in the game, though the Japanese name for the game is different.\nThe name Roshambo or Rochambeau has been claimed to refer to Count Rochambeau, who allegedly played the game during the American Revolutionary War. The legend that he played the game is apocryphal, as all evidence points to the game being brought to the United States later than 1910; if this name has anything to do with him it is for some other reason. It is unclear why this name became associated with the game, with hypotheses ranging from a slight phonetic similarity with the Japanese name \"jan-ken-pon,\" to the presence of a statue of Rochambeau in a neighborhood of Washington, DC.\nGameplay.\nThe players may start by counting to three aloud, or by speaking the name of the game (e.g. \"Rock! Paper! Scissors!\"), raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down with each syllable onto their other hand (or in a less common variant, holding it behind their back). They then \"throw\" or \"shoot\" by extending their selected sign towards their opponent on what would have been the fourth count, often saying the word \"shoot\" while doing so. \nVariations include a version where players throw immediately on the third count (thus throwing on the count of \"Scissors!\"), a version including five counts rather than four (\"Rock! Paper! Scissors! Says! Shoot!\"), and a version where players say \"Scissors! Paper! Rock!\", and a version where players shake their hands three times before \"throwing\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe first known mention of the game was in the book \"Wuzazu\" by the Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhe (fl. c. 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE). In the book, the game was called \"shoushiling\". Li Rihua's book \"Note of Liuyanzhai\" also mentions this game, calling it \"shoushiling\" (t. \u624b\u52e2\u4ee4; s. \u624b\u52bf\u4ee4), \"huozhitou\" (t. \u8c41\u6307\u982d; s. \u8c41\u6307\u5934), or \"huaquan\" (\u5212\u62f3).\nFrom China the game was brought to Japan. Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to \"sansukumi-ken\", meaning \"ken\" (fist) games \"of the three who are afraid of one another\" (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A).\nThe earliest \"sansukumi-ken\" in Japan was apparently \"mushi-ken\" (\u866b\u62f3), a version imported directly from China. In \"mushi-ken\" the \"frog\" (represented by the thumb) triumphs over the \"slug\" (represented by the little finger), which, in turn prevails over the \"snake\" (represented by the index finger), which triumphs over the \"frog\". (The Chinese and Japanese versions differ in the animals represented; in adopting the game, the Chinese characters for the venomous centipede (\u8708\u8719) were apparently confused with the characters for the slug (\u86de\u8753)).\nThe most popular \"sansukumi-ken\" game in Japan was \"kitsune-ken\" (). In this game, a fox (\u72d0), often attributed supernatural powers in Japanese folklore, defeats the village head, the village head (\u5e84\u5c4b) defeats the hunter, and the hunter (\u731f\u5e2b) defeats the fox. \"Kitsune-ken\", unlike \"mushi-ken\" or rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors, requires gestures with both hands.\nToday, the best-known \"sansukumi-ken\" is called , which is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. \"Jan-ken\" uses the rock, paper, and scissors signs and is the direct source of the modern version of rock paper scissors. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper, and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th century, between the Edo and Meiji periods.\nSpread beyond East Asia.\nBy the early 20th century, rock paper scissors had spread beyond East Asia, especially through increased Japanese contact with the west. Its English-language name is therefore taken from a translation of the names of the three Japanese hand-gestures for rock, paper and scissors; elsewhere in East Asia the open-palm gesture represents \"cloth\" rather than \"paper\". The shape of the scissors is also adopted from the Japanese style.\nA 1921 article about cricket in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" described \"stone, scissors, and paper\" as a \"Teutonic method of drawing lots\", which the writer \"came across when travelling on the Continent once\". Another article, from the same year, the \"Washington Herald\" described it as a method of \"Chinese gambling\".\nIn Britain in 1924 it was described in a letter to \"The Times\" as a hand game, possibly of Mediterranean origin, called \"zhot\".\nA reader then wrote in to say that the game \"zhot\" referred to was evidently Jan-ken-pon, which she had often seen played throughout Japan. Although at this date the game appears to have been new enough to British readers to need explaining, the appearance by 1927 of Gerard Fairlie's popular thriller novel with the title \"Scissors Cut Paper\", followed by Fairlie's \"Stone Blunts Scissors\" (1929), suggests it quickly became popular.\nThe game is referred to in two of Hildegard G. Frey's novels in the \"Campfire Girls\" series: \"The Campfire Girls Go Motoring\" (1916) and \"The Campfire Girls' Larks and Pranks\" (1917), which suggests that it was known in America at least that early. The first passage where it appears says \"In order that no feelings might be involved in any way over which car we other girls traveled in, Nyoda, Solomon-like, proposed that she and Gladys play 'John Kempo' for us. (That isn't spelled right, but no matter.)\" There is no explanation in any of the places where it is referenced of what the game actually is. This suggests that the author at least believed that the game was well known enough in America that her readers would understand the reference.\nIn 1927 \"La Vie au patronage : organe catholique des \u0153uvres de jeunesse\", a children's magazine in France, described it in detail, referring to it as a \"jeu japonais\" (\"Japanese game\"). Its French name, \"Chi-fou-mi\", is based on the Old Japanese words for \"one, two, three\" (\"hi, fu, mi\").\nA 1932 \"New York Times\" article on the Tokyo rush hour describes the rules of the game for the benefit of American readers, suggesting it was not at that time widely known in the U.S. Likewise, the trick-taking card game \"Jan-Ken-Po\", first published in 1934, describes the rules of the hand-game without mentioning any American game along the lines of \"rock paper scissors\". The 1933 edition of the \"Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia\" described it as a common method of settling disputes between children in its article on Japan; the name was given as \"John Kem Po\" and the article pointedly asserted, \"This is such a good way of deciding an argument that American boys and girls might like to practice it too.\"\nStrategies.\nIt is impossible to gain an advantage over an opponent that chooses their move uniformly at random. However, it is possible to gain a significant advantage over a non-random player by predicting their move, which can be done by exploiting psychological effects or by analyzing statistical patterns of their past behavior. As a result, there have been programming competitions for algorithms that play rock paper scissors.\nDuring tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement. Some tournament players employ tactics to confuse or trick the other player into making an illegal move, resulting in a loss. One such tactic is to shout the name of one move before throwing another, in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent.\nThe \"rock\" move, in particular, is notable in that it is typically represented by a closed fist\u2014often identical to the fist made by players during the initial countdown. If a player is attempting to beat their opponent based on quickly reading their hand gesture as the players are making their moves, it is possible to determine if the opponent is about to throw \"rock\" based on their lack of hand movement, as both \"scissors\" and \"paper\" require the player to reposition their hand. This can likewise be used to deceive an anticipating opponent by keeping one's fist closed until the last possible moment, leading them to believe that one is about to throw \"rock\".\nAlgorithms.\nAs a consequence of rock paper scissors programming contests, many strong algorithms have emerged. For example, Iocaine Powder, which won the First International RoShamBo Programming Competition in 1999, uses a heuristically designed compilation of strategies. For each strategy it employs, it also has six metastrategies which defeat second-guessing, triple-guessing, as well as second-guessing the opponent, and so on. The optimal strategy or metastrategy is chosen based on past performance. The main strategies it employs are history matching, frequency analysis, and random guessing. Its strongest strategy, history matching, searches for a sequence in the past that matches the last few moves in order to predict the next move of the algorithm. In frequency analysis, the program simply identifies the most frequently played move. The random guess is a fallback method that is used to prevent a devastating loss in the event that the other strategies fail. There have since been some innovations, such as using multiple history-matching schemes that each match a different aspect of the history \u2013 for example, the opponent's moves, the program's own moves, or a combination of both. There have also been other algorithms based on Markov chains.\nIn 2012, researchers from the Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory at the University of Tokyo created a robot hand that can play rock paper scissors with a 100% win rate against a human opponent. Using a high-speed camera the robot recognizes within one millisecond which shape the human hand is making, then produces the corresponding winning shape.\nVariations.\nThere exist numerous cultural and personal variations on rock paper scissors. Differences vary from simply playing the same game with different objects to expanding into more weapons and rules. \nDifferent rules.\nIn Korea, where the standard version of the game is called \"gawi-bawi-bo\", a more complex version exists by the name \"muk-jji-ppa\". After showing their hands, the player with the winning throw shouts \"\"muk-jji-ppa!\" upon which both players throw again. If they throw differently, whoever wins this second round shouts \"muk-jji-ppa!\"\" and thus the play continues until both players throw the same, at which point whoever was the last winner becomes the final winner. \nIn \"rock paper scissors minus one\", another popular variant in Korea, both players throw with both hands simultaneously. Each player chooses one hand to remove, and the winner is decided by the remaining hands in play; a tie leads to a replay. This variation was featured in the second season of the Netflix series \"Squid Game.\"\nIn Japan, a strip game variant of rock paper scissors is known as \u91ce\u7403\u62f3 (\"Yaky\u016bken\"). The loser of each round removes an article of clothing. The game is a minor part of porn culture in Japan and other Asian countries after the influence of TV variety shows and Soft On Demand.\nIn the Philippines, the game is called \"jak-en-poy\" (from the Japanese \"jankenpon\"). In a longer version of the game, a four-line song is sung, with hand gestures displayed at the end of each (or the final) line: \"Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Sino'ng matalo, / siya'ng unggoy!\" (\"Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Whoever loses is the monkey!\") In the former case, the person with the most wins at the end of the song, wins the game. A shorter version of the game uses the chant \"Bato-bato-pick\" (\"Rock-rock-pick [i.e. choose]\") instead.\nA variation with more players can be played: Players stand in a circle and all throw at once. If rock, paper, and scissors are all thrown, it is a stalemate, and they rethrow. If only two throws are present, all players with the losing throw are eliminated. Play continues until only the winner remains.\nDifferent weapons.\nIn Indonesia, the game is called \"suten\", \"suit\" or just \"sut\", and the three signs are elephant (slightly raised thumb), human (outstreched index finger) and ant (outstreched pinky finger). Elephant is stronger than human, human is stronger than ant, but elephant is afraid of the ant.\nUsing the same tripartite division, there is a full-body variation in lieu of the hand signs called \"Bear, Hunter, Ninja\". In this iteration the participants stand back-to-back and at the count of three (or ro-sham-bo as is traditional) turn around facing each other using their arms evoking one of the totems. The players' choices break down as: Hunter shoots bear; Bear eats ninja; Ninja kills hunter.\nAdditional weapons.\nGeneralized rock-paper-scissors games where the players have a choice of more than three weapons have been studied. Any variation of rock paper scissors is an oriented graph, where the nodes represent the symbols (weapons) choosable by the players, and an edge from A to B means that A defeats B. Each oriented graph is a potentially playable rock paper scissors game. According to theoretical calculations, the number of distinguishable (i.e. not isomorphic) oriented graphs grows with the number of weapons = 3, 4, 5, ... as follows:\n 7, 42, 582, 21480, 2142288, 575016219, 415939243032, ... (sequence in the OEIS).\nThe French game \"pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits\" (stone, paper, scissors, well) is unbalanced; both the stone and scissors fall in the well and lose to it, while paper covers both stone and well. This means two \"weapons\", well and paper, can defeat two moves, while the other two weapons each defeat only one of the other three choices. The stone has no advantage to well, so optimal strategy is to play each of the other objects (paper, scissors and well) one-third of the time.\nVariants in which the number of moves is an odd number and each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half are typically considered. Variations with up to 101 different moves have been published. Adding new gestures has the effect of reducing the odds of a tie, while increasing the complexity of the game. The probability of a tie in an odd-number-of-weapons game can be calculated based on the number of weapons \"n\" as 1/\"n\", so the probability of a tie is 1/3 in standard rock paper scissors, but 1/5 in a version that offered five moves instead of three.\nOne popular five-weapon expansion is \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;rock paper scissors Spock lizard\", invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, which adds \"Spock\" and \"lizard\" to the standard three choices. \"Spock\" is signified with the \"Star Trek\" Vulcan salute, while \"lizard\" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in \"The Times\" of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\" in 2008 (as \"rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock\").\nA game-theoretic analysis showed that 4 variants of 582 possible variations using 5 different weapons have non-trivial mixed strategy equilibria. The most representative game of these 4 is \"rock, paper, scissors, fire, water\". Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, fire beats everything except water, and water is beaten by everything except it beats fire. The perfect game-theoretic strategy is to use rock, paper, and scissors formula_1 of the time and formula_2 of the time for fire and water. Nevertheless, experiments show that people underuse water and overuse rock, paper, and scissors in this game.\nAnalogues in real life.\nLizard mating strategies.\nThe common side-blotched lizard (\"Uta stansburiana\") exhibits a rock paper scissors pattern in its mating strategies. Of its three throat color types of males, \"orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange\" in competition for females, which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\nBacteria.\nSome bacteria also exhibit a rock paper scissors dynamic when they engage in antibiotic production. The theory for this finding was demonstrated by computer simulation and in the laboratory by Benjamin Kerr, working at Stanford University with Brendan Bohannan. Additional \"in vitro\" results demonstrate rock paper scissors dynamics in additional species of bacteria. Biologist Benjamin C. Kirkup Jr. demonstrated that these antibiotics, bacteriocins, were active as \"Escherichia coli\" compete with each other in the intestines of mice, and that the rock paper scissors dynamics allowed for the continued competition among strains: antibiotic-producers defeat antibiotic-sensitives; antibiotic-resisters multiply and withstand and out-compete the antibiotic-producers, letting antibiotic-sensitives multiply and out-compete others; until antibiotic-producers multiply again.\nRock paper scissors is the subject of continued research in bacterial ecology and evolution. It is considered one of the basic applications of game theory and non-linear dynamics to bacteriology. Models of evolution demonstrate how intragenomic competition can lead to rock paper scissors dynamics from a relatively general evolutionary model. The general nature of this basic non-transitive model is widely applied in theoretical biology to explore bacterial ecology and evolution.\nMechanical devices and geometrical constructions.\nIn the televised robot combat competition \"BattleBots\", relations between \"lifters, which had wedged sides and could use forklift-like prongs to flip pure wedges\", \"spinners, which were smooth, circular wedges with blades on their bottom side for disabling and breaking lifters\", and \"pure wedges, which could still flip spinners\" are analogical to relations in rock paper scissors games and called \"robot Darwinism\".\nInstances of usage.\nAmerican court case.\nIn 2006, American federal judge Gregory Presnell from the Middle District of Florida ordered opposing sides in a lengthy court case to settle a trivial (but lengthily debated) point over the appropriate place for a deposition using the game of rock paper scissors. The ruling in \"Avista Management v. Wausau Underwriters\" stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Upon consideration of the Motion\u00a0\u2013 the latest in a series of Gordian knots that the parties have been unable to untangle without enlisting the assistance of the federal courts\u00a0\u2013 it is ORDERED that said Motion is DENIED. Instead, the Court will fashion a new form of alternative dispute resolution, to wit: at 4:00 P.M. on Friday, June 30, 2006, counsel shall convene at a neutral site agreeable to both parties. If counsel cannot agree on a neutral site, they shall meet on the front steps of the Sam M. Gibbons U.S. Courthouse, 801 North Florida Ave., Tampa, Florida 33602. Each lawyer shall be entitled to be accompanied by one paralegal who shall act as an attendant and witness. At that time and location, counsel shall engage in one (1) game of \"rock, paper, scissors\". The winner of this engagement shall be entitled to select the location for the 30(b)(6) deposition to be held somewhere in Hillsborough County during the period 11\u201312 July 2006.\nAuction house selection.\nIn 2005, when Takashi Hashiyama, CEO of Japanese television equipment manufacturer Maspro Denkoh, decided to auction off the collection of Impressionist paintings owned by his corporation, including works by Paul C\u00e9zanne, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh, he contacted two leading auction houses, Christie's International and Sotheby's Holdings, seeking their proposals on how they would bring the collection to the market as well as how they would maximize the profits from the sale. Both firms made elaborate proposals, but neither was persuasive enough to earn Hashiyama's approval. Unwilling to split up the collection into separate auctions, Hashiyama asked the firms to decide between themselves who would hold the auction, which included C\u00e9zanne's \"Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan\", estimated to be worth between $12 million to $16 million.\nThe houses were unable to reach a decision. Hashiyama told the two firms to play rock paper scissors to decide who would get the rights to the auction, explaining that \"it probably looks strange to others, but I believe this is the best way to decide between two things which are equally good.\"\nThe auction houses had a weekend to come up with a choice of move. Christie's went to the 11-year-old twin daughters of the international director of Christie's Impressionist and Modern Art Department Nicholas Maclean, who suggested \"scissors\" because \"Everybody expects you to choose 'rock'.\" Sotheby's said that they treated it as a game of chance and had no particular strategy for the game, but went with \"paper\". Christie's won the match and sold the $20 million collection, earning millions of dollars of commission for the auction house.\nFA Women's Super League match.\nPrior to a 26 October 2018 match in the FA Women's Super League, the referee, upon being without a coin for the pregame coin toss, had the team captains play rock paper scissors to determine which team would kick-off. The referee was subsequently suspended for three weeks by The Football Association.\nPlay by chimpanzees.\nIn Japan, researchers have taught chimpanzees to identify winning hands according to the rules of rock paper scissors.\nGame design.\nIn many games, it is common for a group of possible choices to interact in a rock paper scissors style, where each selection is strong against a particular choice, but weak against another. Such mechanics can make a game somewhat self-balancing, prevent gameplay from being overwhelmed by a single dominant strategy and single dominant type of unit.\nMany card-based video games in Japan use the rock paper scissors system as their core fighting system, with the winner of each round being able to carry out their designated attack. In \"Alex Kidd in Miracle World\", the player has to win games of rock paper scissors against each boss to proceed. Others use simple variants of rock paper scissors as subgames.\nMany Nintendo role-playing games prominently feature a rock paper scissors gameplay element. In \"Pok\u00e9mon\", there is a rock paper scissors element in the type effectiveness system. For example, a Grass-typed Pok\u00e9mon is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to Water, and Water is weak to Grass. In the 3DS remake of ' and ', the battles in the second mode use a \"Power Triangle\" system based on the game's three attack types: Melee, Ranged, and Flying. In the \"Fire Emblem\" series of strategy role-playing games, the Weapon Triangle and Trinity of Magic influence the hit and damage rates of weapon types based on whether they are at an advantage or a disadvantage in their respective rock paper scissors system. In the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, the three basic actions used during battles are described in their respective rock paper scissors system: attack, defense, and grab.\nThe \"Card-Jitsu\" minigame in \"Club Penguin\" is a rock-paper-scissors game using cards that represent the three elements, Fire, Water and Snow. Fire beats snow, snow beats water, water beats fire.\nTournaments.\nVarious competitive rock paper scissors tournaments have been organised by different groups.\nWorld Rock Paper Scissors Association.\nStarted in 2015, the WRPSA has hosted Professional Rock Paper Scissors Tournaments all around the world.\nWorld Rock Paper Scissors Society.\nThe World Rock Paper Scissors Society hosted Professional Rock Paper Scissors Tournaments from 2002 to 2009. These open, competitive championships were widely attended by players from around the world and attracted widespread international media attention. WRPS events were noted for their large cash prizes, elaborate staging, and colorful competitors.\nIn 2004, the championships were broadcast on the U.S. television network Fox Sports Net (later known as Bally Sports), with the winner being Lee Rammage, who went on to compete in at least one subsequent championship. The 2007 tournament was won by Andrea Farina. The last tournament hosted by the World RPS Society was in Toronto, Canada, on November 14, 2009.\nUK championships.\nSeveral RPS events have been organised in the United Kingdom by Wacky Nation. The 1st UK Championship took place on 13 July 2007, and were then held annually. The 2019 event was won by Ellie Mac, who went on to pick up the cash prize of \u00a320,000 but was unable to double her earnings in 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nUSARPS tournaments.\nUSA Rock Paper Scissors League is sponsored by Bud Light. Leo Bryan Pacis was the first commissioner of the USARPS. Cody Louis Brown was elected as the second commissioner of the USARPS in 2014.\nIn April 2006, the inaugural USARPS Championship was held in Las Vegas. Following months of regional qualifying tournaments held across the US, 257 players were flown to Las Vegas for a single-elimination tournament at the House of Blues where the winner received $50,000. The tournament was shown on the A&amp;E Network on 12 June 2006.\nThe $50,000 2007 USARPS Tournament took place at the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay in May 2007.\nIn 2008, Sean \"Wicked Fingers\" Sears beat 300 other contestants and walked out of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino with $50,000 after defeating Julie \"Bulldog\" Crossley in the finals.\nThe inaugural Budweiser International Rock, Paper, Scissors Federation Championship was held in Beijing, China after the close of the 2008 Summer Olympics at Club Bud. A Belfast man won the competition.\nNational XtremeRPS Competition 2007\u20132008.\nThe XtremeRPS National Competition is a US nationwide RPS competition with Preliminary Qualifying contests that started in January 2007 and ended in May 2008, followed by regional finals in June and July 2008. The national finals were to be held in Des Moines, Iowa, in August 2008, with a chance to win up to $5,000.\n\"Guinness Book of World Records\".\nThe largest rock paper scissors tournament hosted 2,950 players and was achieved by Oomba, Inc. (USA) at Gen Con 2014 in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, on 17 August 2014.\nWorld Series.\nFormer Celebrity Poker Showdown host and USARPS Head Referee Phil Gordon has hosted an annual $500 World Series of Rock Paper Scissors event in conjunction with the World Series of Poker since 2005. The winner of the WSORPS receives an entry into the WSOP Main Event. The event is an annual fundraiser for the \"Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation\" via Gordon's charity \"Bad Beat on Cancer\". Poker player Annie Duke won the Second Annual World Series of Rock Paper Scissors. The tournament is taped by ESPN and highlights are covered during \"The Nuts\" section of ESPN's annual WSOP broadcast. 2009 was the fifth year of the tournament.\n\"Jackpot En Poy\" of \"Eat Bulaga!\".\nJackpot En Poy is a game segment on the Philippines' longest running noontime variety show, \"Eat Bulaga!\". The game is based on the classic children's game rock paper scissors (Jak-en-poy in Filipino, derived from the Japanese Jan-ken-pon) where four players are paired to compete in the three-round segment. In the first round, the first pair plays against each other until one player wins three times. The next pair then plays against each other in the second round. The winners from the first two rounds then compete against each other to finally determine the ultimate winner. The winner of the game then moves on to the final round. In the final round, the player is presented with several Dabarkads, each holding different amounts of cash prize. The player will then pick three Dabarkads who they will play rock paper scissors against. The player plays against them one at a time. If the player wins against any of the \"Eat Bulaga!\" hosts, they will win the cash prize.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The orthography is based on the spoken dialects of central northern Sardinia, identified by certain attributes which are not found, or found to a lesser degree, among the Sardinian dialects centered on the other written form, Campidanese. Its ISO 639-3 code is \"src\".\nCharacteristics.\nLatin and before , are not palatalized in Logudorese, in stark contrast with all other Romance languages. Compare Logudorese ' with Italian ' , Spanish ' and French ' . Like the other varieties of Sardinian, most subdialects of Logudorese also underwent lenition in the intervocalic plosives of --, --, and --/ (e.g. Lat. &gt; \"fire\", &gt; \"shore, bank\", &gt; \"wheel\"). Finally, Logudorese shifts the Latin labiovelars and into medially and word-initially (Lat. &gt; \"tongue\", &gt; \"what\").\nLogudorese is intelligible to those from the southern part of Sardinia, where Campidanese Sardinian is spoken, but it is not to those from the extreme north of the island, where Corsican\u2013Sardinian dialects are spoken.\nSardinian is an autonomous linguistic group rather than an Italian dialect as it is often noted because of its morphological, syntactic, and lexical differences from Italian. Therefore, Italian speakers do not understand Logudorese or any other dialect of the Sardinian language.\nLocation and distribution.\nThe area of Logudoro (the term originated as a blend of the kingdom's name of Logu de Torres), in which it is spoken, is a northern subregion of the island of Sardinia with close ties to Ozieri (\"Othieri\") and Nuoro (\"N\u00f9goro\") for culture and language, as well as history, with important particularities in the western area, where the most important town is Ittiri. It is an area of roughly 150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0km with some 500,000\u2013700,000 inhabitants.\nOrigins and features.\nThe origins of Sardinian have been investigated by Eduardo Blasco Ferrer and others. The language derives from Latin and a pre-Latin, Paleo-Sardinian (Nuragic) substratum, but has been influenced by Catalan and Spanish due to the dominion of the Crown of Aragon and later the Spanish Empire over the island. Logudorese is the northern macro-dialect of the Sardinian language, the southern macro-dialect being Campidanese, spoken in the southern half of the island. The two dialects share a clear common origin and history, but have experienced somewhat different developments.\nThough the language is typically Romance, some words are not of Latin origin, and are of uncertain etymology. One such is \"nura\", found in \"nuraghe\", the main form of pre-Roman building, hence the term for the pre-Roman era as the Nuragic Period. Various place names similarly have roots that defy analysis.\nLogudorese Sardinian changed only very slowly from Vulgar Latin compared to other Romance lects, showing certain notably conservative phonological features relative to other Romance languages.\nFor example, linguist Mario Pei in a 1949 paper measured Logudorese Sardinian's accent vocalization as having diverged less from Vulgar Latin than had French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, or Old Proven\u00e7al. The paper emphasized, however, that it represented only \"a very elementary, incomplete and tentative demonstration\" of how statistical methods could measure linguistic change, assigned \"frankly arbitrary\" point values to various types of stressed-vowel change, and did not compare languages in the sample with respect to any characteristics other than stressed vowels, among other caveats.\nDue to its conservatism, as well as the preservation of many works of traditional literature from the 15th century onwards, Logudorese is often considered to be the most prestigious variety of Sardinian.\nSamples of text.\nJonah 1:4-9.\n\"4\" Su Segnore per\u00f2 mandesit unu grande bentu in su mare: et facta est una tempestade manna in mare, et sa nae perigulaiat de si fracassare.\n\"5\" Et timesint sos marineris, et clamesint sos homines ad su Deus ipsoro: et bettesint sas mercanzias, qui fint in sa nae, in mare, ad tales qui si allezerigheret da ipsas: et Jonas si que fit faladu ad s' internu de sa nae, et dormiat a somnu grae.\n\"6\" Et s' accostesit ad ipsu su patronu, et li nesit: Et proite tue ti laxas opprimere dai su somnu? pesa, et invoca su Deus tou, si pro sorte si ammentet Deus de nois, et non morzamus.\n\"7\" Et nesit s' unu ad s' ateru cumpagnu: Benide, et tiremus a sorte, et iscamus, proite custa istroscia siat ad nois.

But Jonah had gone below into the stern of the ship, had lain down, and fallen sound asleep. \"6\" So the captain approached him and said, \"How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish.\"\n\"7\" And each man said to his mate, \"Come, let\u2019s cast lots so that we may find out on whose account this catastrophe has struck us.\" So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. \"8\" Then they said to him, \"Tell us, now! On whose account has this catastrophe struck us? What is your occupation, and where do you come from? What is your country, and from what people are you?\" \"9\" So he said to them, \"I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land.\"\nSubdialects.\nLogudorese Sardinian has multiple subdialects, some confined to individual villages or valleys.

Many Romance linguists consider it, together with Italian, as the language that is the closest to Latin among all of Latin's descendants. However, it has also incorporated elements of Pre-Latin (mostly Paleo-Sardinian and, to a much lesser degree, Punic) substratum, as well as a Byzantine Greek, Catalan, Spanish, French, and Italian superstratum. These elements originate in the political history of Sardinia, whose indigenous society experienced competition and, at times, conflict with a series of colonizing newcomers.\nFollowing the end of the Roman Empire in Western Europe, Sardinia passed through periods of successive control by the Vandals, Byzantines, local Judicates, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Savoyard state, and finally Italy. These regimes varied in their usage of Sardinian as against other languages. For example, under the Judicates, Sardinian was used in administrative documents. Under Aragonese control, Catalan and Castilian became the island's prestige languages, and would remain so well into the 18th century. More recently, Italy's linguistic policies have encouraged diglossia, reducing the predominance of both Sardinian and Catalan.\nInformation about control and usage.\nAfter a long strife for the acknowledgement of the island's cultural patrimony, in 1997, Sardinian, along with the other languages spoken therein, managed to be recognized by regional law in Sardinia without challenge by the central government. In 1999, Sardinian and eleven other \"historical linguistic minorities\", i.e. locally indigenous, and not foreign-grown, minority languages of Italy (, as defined by the legislator) were similarly recognized as such by national law (specifically, Law No. 482/1999). Among these, Sardinian is notable as having, in terms of absolute numbers, the largest community of speakers.\nAlthough the Sardinian-speaking community can be said to share \"a high level of linguistic awareness\", policies eventually fostering language loss and assimilation have considerably affected Sardinian, whose actual speakers have become noticeably reduced in numbers over the last century. The Sardinian adult population today primarily uses Italian, and less than 15 percent of the younger generations were reported to have been passed down some residual Sardinian, usually in a deteriorated form described by linguist Roberto Bolognesi as \"an ungrammatical slang\".\nThe rather fragile and precarious state in which the Sardinian language now finds itself, where its use has been discouraged and consequently reduced even within the family sphere, is illustrated by the \"Euromosaic\" report, in which Sardinian \"is in 43rd place in the ranking of the 50 languages taken into consideration and of which were analysed (a) use in the family, (b) cultural reproduction, (c) use in the community, (d) prestige, (e) use in institutions, (f) use in education\".\nAs the Sardinians have almost been completely assimilated into the Italian national mores, including in terms of onomastics, and therefore now only happen to keep but a scant and fragmentary knowledge of their native and once first spoken language, limited in both scope and frequency of use, Sardinian has been classified by UNESCO as \"definitely endangered\". In fact, the intergenerational chain of transmission appears to have been broken since at least the 1960s, in such a way that the younger generations, who are predominantly Italian monolinguals, do not identify themselves with the indigenous tongue, which is now reduced to the memory of \"little more than the language of their grandparents\".\nAs the long- to even medium-term future of the Sardinian language looks far from secure in the present circumstances, Martin Harris concluded in 2003 that, assuming the continuation of present trends to language death, it was possible that there would not be a Sardinian language of which to speak in the future, being referred to by linguists as the mere substratum of the now-prevailing idiom, i.e. Italian articulated in its own Sardinian-influenced variety, which may come to wholly supplant the islanders' once living native tongue.\nOverview.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now the question arises as to whether Sardinian is to be considered a dialect or a language. Politically speaking, of course, it is one of the many dialects of Italy, just like the Serbo-Croatian and the Albanian that are spoken in various Calabrian and Sicilian villages. The question, however, takes on a different nature when considered from a linguistic perspective. Sardinian cannot be said to be closely related to any dialect of mainland Italy; it is an archaic Romance tongue with its own distinctive characteristics, which can be seen in its rather unique vocabulary as well as its morphology and syntax, which differ radically from those of the Italian dialects.\u2014\u200a\nAs an insular language par excellence, Sardinian is considered the most conservative Romance language, as well as one of the most highly individual within the family; its substratum (Paleo-Sardinian or Nuragic) has also been researched. In the first written testimonies, dating to the eleventh century, Sardinian appears as a language already distinct from the dialects of Italy.\nA 1949 study by the Italian-American linguist Mario Pei, analyzing the degree to which seven Romance languages diverged from Vulgar Latin with respect to their accent vocalization, yielded the following measurements of divergence (with higher percentages indicating greater divergence from the stressed vowels of Vulgar Latin): Logudorese Sardinian 8%, Italian 12%, Spanish 20%, Romanian 23.5%, Occitan 25%, Portuguese 31%, and French 44%. The study emphasized, however, that it represented only \"a very elementary, incomplete and tentative demonstration\" of how statistical methods could measure linguistic change, assigned \"frankly arbitrary\" point values to various types of change, and did not compare languages in the sample with respect to any characteristics or forms of divergence other than stressed vowels, among other caveats.\nThe significant degree to which the Sardinian language has retained its Latin base was also noted by the French geographer Maurice Le Lannou during a research project on the island in 1941.\nAlthough its lexical base is mostly of Latin origin, Sardinian nonetheless retains a number of traces of the linguistic substratum predating the Roman conquest of the island: several words and especially toponyms stem from Paleo-Sardinian and, to a lesser extent, Phoenician-Punic. These etyma might refer to an early Mediterranean substratum, which reveal close relations with Basque.\nIn addition to the aforementioned substratum, linguists such as Max Leopold Wagner and Benvenuto Aronne Terracini trace much of the distinctive Latin character of Sardinia to the languoids once spoken by the Christian and Jewish Berbers in North Africa, known as African Romance. Indeed, Sardinian was perceived as rather similar to African Latin when the latter was still in use, giving credit to the theory that vulgar Latin in both Africa and Sardinia displayed a significant wealth of parallelisms. J. N. Adams is of the opinion that similarities in many words, such as ('grape'), ('shoulder blade') and ('reddish-brown'), prove that there might have been a fair amount of vocabulary shared between Sardinia and Africa. According to Wagner, it is notable that Sardinian is the only Romance language whose name for the Milky Way (, 'the Way of Straw') also recurs in the Berber languages.\nTo most Italians Sardinian is unintelligible, reminding them of Spanish, because of the way in which the language is acoustically articulated; characterized as it is by a sharply outlined physiognomy which is displayed from the earliest sources available, it is in fact considered a distinct language, if not an altogether different branch, among the Romance idioms; George Bossong summarises thus: \"be this as it may, from a strictly linguistic point of view there can be no doubt that Sardinian is to be classified as an independent Romance language, or even as an independent branch inside the family, and so it is classed alongside the great national languages like French and Italian in all modern manuals of Romance linguistics\".\nHistory.\nSardinia's relative isolation from mainland Europe encouraged the development of a Romance language that preserves traces of its indigenous, pre-Roman language(s). The language is posited to have substratal influences from Paleo-Sardinian, which some scholars have linked to Basque and Etruscan; comparisons have also been drawn with the Berber languages from North Africa to shed more light on the language(s) spoken in Sardinia prior to its Romanization. Subsequent adstratal influences include Catalan, Spanish, and Italian. The situation of the Sardinian language with regard to the politically dominant ones did not change until fascism and, most evidently, the 1950s.\nOrigins of modern Sardinian.\nThe origins of ancient Sardinian, also known as Paleo-Sardinian, are currently unknown. Research has attempted to discover obscure, indigenous, pre-Romance roots. The root \"s(a)rd\", indicating many place names as well as the island's people, is reportedly either associated with or originating from the Sherden, one of the Sea Peoples. Other sources trace instead the root \"s(a)rd\" from , a legendary woman from the Anatolian Kingdom of Lydia, or from the Libyan mythological figure of the Sardus Pater \"Babai\" (\"Sardinian Father\" or \"Father of the Sardinians\").\nIn 1984, Massimo Pittau claimed to have found the etymology of many Latin words in the Etruscan language, after comparing it with the Nuragic language(s). Etruscan elements, formerly thought to have originated in Latin, would indicate a connection between the ancient Sardinian culture and the Etruscans. According to Pittau, the Etruscan and Nuragic language(s) are descended from Lydian (and therefore Indo-European) as a consequence of contact with Etruscans and other Tyrrhenians from Sardis as described by Herodotus. Although Pittau suggests that the Tirrenii landed in Sardinia and the Etruscans landed in modern Tuscany, his views are not shared by most Etruscologists.\nAccording to Bertoldi and Terracini, Paleo-Sardinian has similarities with the Iberic languages and Siculian; for example, the suffix -\"ara\" in proparoxytones indicated the plural. Terracini proposed the same for suffixes in -', -', -', -' + ' + a paragogic vowel (such as the toponym \"Bunn\u00e0nnaru\"). Rohlfs, Butler and Craddock add the suffix -' (such as the toponym \"Bar\u00f9mini\") as a unique element of Paleo-Sardinian. Suffixes in /\"a\", \"e\", \"o\", \"u\"/ + -\"rr\"- found a correspondence in north Africa (Terracini), in Iberia (Blasco Ferrer) and in southern Italy and Gascony (Rohlfs), with a closer relationship to Basque (Wagner and Hubschmid). However, these early links to a Basque precursor have been questioned by some Basque linguists. According to Terracini, suffixes in -', -', -', and -' are common to Paleo-Sardinian and northern African languages. Pittau emphasized that this concerns terms originally ending in an accented vowel, with an attached paragogic vowel; the suffix resisted Latinization in some place names, which show a Latin body and a Nuragic suffix. According to Bertoldi, some toponyms ending in -' and -' indicated an Anatolian influence. The suffix -', widely used in Iberia and possibly of Celtic origin, and the ethnic suffix in -' and -\"\" (for example, the Sardinian ) have also been noted as Paleo-Sardinian elements (Terracini, Ribezzo, Wagner, Hubschmid and Faust).\nSome linguists, like Max Leopold Wagner (1931), Blasco Ferrer (2009, 2010) and Arregi (2017) have attempted to revive a theoretical connection with Basque by linking words such as Sardinian 'marshland' and Basque 'puddle'; Sardinian 'fresh grazing for cattle' and Basque 'cool, fresh'; Sardinian 'vagabond' and Basque 'stranger'; Sardinian and Basque 'holly'; Gallurese (Corso-Sardinian) 'pig' (with \"z\" for ) and Basque (with \"z\" for ). Genetic data have found the Basques to be close to the Sardinians.\nSince the Neolithic period, some degree of variance across the island's regions is also attested. The Arzachena culture, for instance, suggests a link between the northernmost Sardinian region (Gallura) and southern Corsica that finds further confirmation in the Natural History by Pliny the Elder. There are also some stylistic differences across Northern and Southern Nuragic Sardinia, which may indicate the existence of two other tribal groups (Balares and Ilienses) mentioned by the same Roman author. According to the archeologist Giovanni Ugas, these tribes may have in fact played a role in shaping the current regional linguistic differences of the island.\nAround the 10th and 9th century BC, Phoenician merchants were known to have made their presence in Sardinia, which acted as a geographical mediator in between the Iberian and the Italian peninsula. In the eighth and seventh centuries, the Phoenicians began to develop permanent settlements, politically arranged as city-states in similar fashion to the Lebanese coastal areas. It did not take long before they started gravitating around the Carthaginian sphere of influence, whose level of prosperity spurred Carthage to send a series of expeditionary forces to the island; although they were initially repelled by the natives, the North African city vigorously pursued a policy of active imperialism and, by the sixth century, managed to establish its political hegemony and military control over South-Western Sardinia. Punic began to be spoken in the area, and many words entered ancient Sardinian as well. Words like 'plateau' (cf. Hebrew 'forest, scrub'), 'nasturtium' (from Punic ), 'fringed rue' (cf. Arabic 'Syrian rue'), 'spring' (cf. Hebrew , 'source, fountainhead'), 'marsh horsetail' (from Punic 'common knotgrass'), 'sprout' (from , diminutive of Punic 'seed'), 'dill' (from Punic ; cf. Hebrew 'ale') and 'rosemary' (from Punic ) are commonly used, especially in the modern Sardinian varieties of the Campidanese plain, while proceeding northwards the influence is more limited to place names, such as the town of Magomadas, in Nuoro or in Gesico and Nureci, all of which deriving from the Punic 'new city'.\nThe Roman domination began in 238 BC, but was often contested by the local Sardinian tribes, who had by then acquired a high level of political organization, and would manage to only partly supplant the pre-Latin Sardinian languages, including Punic. Although the colonists and \"negotiatores\" (businessmen) of strictly Italic descent would later play a relevant role in introducing and spreading Latin to Sardinia, Romanisation proved slow to take hold among the Sardinian natives, whose proximity to the Carthaginian cultural influence was noted by Roman authors. Punic continued to be spoken well into the 3rd\u20134th century AD, as attested by votive inscriptions, and it is thought that the natives from the most interior areas, led by the tribal chief Hospito, joined their brethren in making the switch to Latin around the 7th century AD, through their conversion to Christianity. Cicero, who loathed the Sardinians on the ground of numerous factors, such as their outlandish language, their kinship with Carthage and their refusal to engage with Rome, would call the Sardinian rebels ('thieves with rough wool cloaks') or ('Africans') to emphasize Roman superiority over a population mocked as the refuse of Carthage.\nA number of obscure Nuragic roots remained unchanged, and in many cases Latin accepted the local roots (like \"nur\", presumably cognate of \"Norax\", which makes its appearance in \"nuraghe\", \"Nurra\", \"Nurri\" and many other toponyms). Barbagia, the mountainous central region of the island, derives its name from the Latin (a term meaning 'Land of the Barbarians', similar in origin to the now antiquated word \"Barbary\"), because its people refused cultural and linguistic assimilation for a long time: 50% of toponyms of central Sardinia, particularly in the territory of Olzai, are actually not related to any known language. According to Terracini, amongst the regions in Europe that went on to draw their language from Latin, Sardinia has overall preserved the highest proportion of pre-Latin toponyms. Besides the place names, on the island there are still a few names of plants, animals and geological formations directly traceable to the ancient Nuragic era.\nBy the end of the Roman domination, Latin had gradually become however the speech of most of the island's inhabitants. As a result of this protracted and prolonged process of Romanisation, the modern Sardinian language is today classified as Romance or neo-Latin, with some phonetic features resembling Old Latin. Some linguists assert that modern Sardinian, being part of the Island Romance group, was the first language to split off from Latin, all others evolving from Latin as Continental Romance. In fact, contact with Rome might have ceased from as early as the first century BC. In terms of vocabulary, Sardinian retains an array of peculiar Latin-based forms that are either unfamiliar to, or have altogether disappeared in, the rest of the Romance-speaking world.\nThe number of Latin inscriptions on the island is relatively small and fragmented. Some engraved poems in ancient Greek and Latin (the two most prestigious languages in the Roman Empire) are seen in the so-called \"Viper's Cave\" ( in Sardinian, in Italian, in Latin), a burial monument built in Caralis (Cagliari) by Lucius Cassius Philippus (a Roman who had been exiled to Sardinia) in remembrance of his dead spouse Atilia Pomptilla; we also have some religious works by Eusebius and Saint Lucifer, both from Caralis and in the writing style of whom may be noted the lexicon and perifrastic forms typical of Sardinian (e.g. in place of ; compare with Sardinian or 'to say').\nAfter a period of 80 years under the Vandals, Sardinia would again be part of the Byzantine Empire under the Exarchate of Africa for almost another five centuries. Luigi Pinelli believes that the Vandal presence had \"estranged Sardinia from Europe, linking its own destiny to Africa's territorial expanse\" in a bond that was to strengthen further \"under Byzantine rule, not only because the Roman Empire included the island in the African Exarchate, but also because it developed from there, albeit indirectly, its ethnic community, causing it to acquire many of the African characteristics\" that would allow ethnologists and historians to elaborate the theory of the Paleo-Sardinians' supposed African origin, now disproved. Casula is convinced that the Vandal domination caused a \"clear breaking with the Roman-Latin writing tradition or, at the very least, an appreciable bottleneck\" so that the subsequent Byzantine government was able to establish \"its own operational institutions\" in a \"territory disputed between the Greek- and the Latin-speaking world\".\nDespite a period of almost five centuries, the Greek language only lent Sardinian a few ritual and formal expressions using Greek structure and, sometimes, the Greek alphabet. Evidence for this is found in the \"condaghes\", the first written documents in Sardinian. From the long Byzantine era there are only a few entries but they already provide a glimpse of the sociolinguistical situation on the island in which, in addition to the community's everyday Neo-Latin language, Greek was also spoken by the ruling classes. Some toponyms, such as \"Jerzu\" (thought to derive from the Greek , 'untilled'), together with the personal names \"Mikhaleis\", \"Konstantine\" and \"Basilis\", demonstrate Greek influence.\nJudicates period.\nAs the Muslims made their way into North Africa, what remained of the Byzantine possession of the Exarchate of Africa was only the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. Pinelli believes that this event constituted a fundamental watershed in the historical course of Sardinia, leading to the definitive severance of those previously close cultural ties between Sardinia and the southern shore of the Mediterranean: any previously held commonality shared between Sardinia and Africa \"disappeared, like mist in the sun, as a result of North Africa's conquest by Islamic forces, since the latter, due to the fierce resistance of the Sardinians, were not able to spread to the island, as they had in Africa\". Michele Amari, quoted by Pinelli, writes that \"the attempts of the Muslims of Africa to conquer Sardinia and Corsica were frustrated by the unconquered valour of the poor and valiant inhabitants of those islands, who saved themselves for two centuries from the yoke of the Arabs\".\nAs the Byzantines were fully focused on reconquering southern Italy and Sicily, which had in the meanwhile also fallen to the Muslims, their attention on Sardinia was neglected and communications broke down with Constantinople; this spurred the former Byzantine province of Sardinia to become progressively more autonomous from the Byzantine oecumene, and eventually attain independence. Pinelli argues that \"the Arab conquest of North Africa separated Sardinia from that continent without, however, causing the latter to rejoin Europe\" and that this event \"determined a capital turning point for Sardinia, giving rise to a \"de facto\" independent national government\". Historian Marc Bloch believed that, owing to Sardinia being a country which found itself in \"quasi-isolation\" from the rest of the continent, the earliest documentary testimonies, written in Sardinian, were much older than those first issued in Italy.\nSardinian was the first Romance language of all to gain official status, being used by the four Judicates, former Byzantine districts that became independent political entities after the Arab expansion in the Mediterranean had cut off any ties left between the island and Byzantium. The exceptionality of the Sardinian situation, which in this sense constitutes a unique case throughout the Latin-speaking Europe, consists in the fact that any official text was written solely in Sardinian from the very beginning and completely excluded Latin, unlike what was happening \u2013 and would continue to happen \u2013 in France, Italy and Iberia at the same time; Latin, although co-official, was in fact used only in documents concerning external relations in which the Sardinian kings (, 'judges') engaged. Awareness of the dignity of Sardinian for official purposes was such that, in the words of Livio Petrucci, a Neo-Latin language had come to be used \"at a time when nothing similar can be observed in the Italian peninsula\" not only \"in the legal field\" but also \"in any other field of writing\".\nA diplomatic analysis of the earliest Sardinian documents shows that the Judicates provided themselves with chanceries, which employed an indigenous diplomatic model for writing public documents; one of them, dating to 1102, displays text in half-uncial, a script that had long fallen out of use on the European continent and F. Casula believes may have been adopted by the Sardinians of Latin culture as their own \"national script\" from the 8th until the 12th century, prior to their receiving outside influence from the arrival of mainly Italian notaries.\nOld Sardinian had a greater number of archaisms and Latinisms than the present language does, with few Germanic words, mostly coming from Latin itself, and even fewer Arabisms, which had been imported by scribes from Iberia; in spite of their best efforts with a score of expeditions to the island, from which they would get considerable booty and a hefty number of Sardinian slaves, the Arab assailants were in fact each time forcefully driven back and would never manage to conquer and settle on the island.\nAlthough the surviving texts come from such disparate areas as the north and the south of the island, Sardinian then presented itself in a rather homogeneous form: even though the orthographic differences between Logudorese and Campidanese Sardinian were beginning to appear, Wagner found in this period \"the original unity of the Sardinian language\". In agreement with Wagner is Paolo Merci, who found a \"broad uniformity\" around this period, as were Antonio Sanna and Ignazio Delogu too, for whom it was the islanders' community life that prevented Sardinian from localism. According to Carlo Tagliavini, these earlier documents show the existence of a Sardinian Koine which pointed to a model based on Logudorese.\nAccording to Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, it was in the wake of the fall of the Judicates of Cagliari and Gallura, in the second half of the 13th century, that Sardinian began to fragment into its modern dialects, undergoing some Tuscanization under the rule of the Republic of Pisa; it did not take long before the Genoese too started carving their own sphere of influence in northern Sardinia, both through the mixed Sardinian-Genoese nobility of Sassari and the members of the Doria family. A certain range of dialectal variation is then noted.\nA special position was occupied by the Judicate of Arborea, the last Sardinian kingdom to fall to foreign powers, in which a transitional dialect was spoken, that of Middle Sardinian. The Carta de Logu of the Kingdom of Arborea, one of the first constitutions in history drawn up in 1355\u20131376 by Marianus IV and the Queen, the 'Lady Judge' ( in Sardinian, in Catalan, in Italian) Eleanor, was written in this transitional variety of Sardinian, and would remain in force until 1827. The Arborean judges' effort to unify the Sardinian dialects were due to their desire to be legitimate rulers of the entire island under a single state ( 'Sardinian Republic'); such political goal, after all, was already manifest in 1164, when the Arborean Judge Barison ordered his great seal to be made with the writings ('Barison, by the grace of God, King of Sardinia') and ('The people's rule is equal to the Sardinians' own force').\nDante Alighieri wrote in his 1302\u20131305 essay \"De vulgari eloquentia\" that Sardinians were strictly speaking not Italians (), even though they appeared superficially similar to them, and they did not speak anything close to a Neo-Latin language of their own (), but resorted to aping straightforward Latin instead. Dante's view on the Sardinians, however, is proof of how their language had been following its own course in a way which was already unintelligible to non-islanders, and had become, in Wagner's words, an impenetrable \"sphinx\" to their judgment. Frequently mentioned is a previous 12th-century poem by the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, (\"Lady, so much I have endeared you\"); Sardinian epitomizes outlandish speech therein, along with non-Romance languages such as German and Berber, with the troubadour having the lady say \"\" (\"I don't understand you more than a German or Sardinian or Berber\"); the Tuscan poet Fazio degli Uberti refers to the Sardinians in his poem as \"\" (\"a people that no one is able to understand / nor do they come to a knowledge of what other peoples say about them\").\nThe Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, who lived in Palermo, Sicily at the court of King Roger II, wrote in his work ('The book of pleasant journeys into faraway lands' or, simply, 'The book of Roger') that \"Sardinians are ethnically , like the Berbers; they shun contacts with all the other nations and are people of purpose and valiant that never leave the arms\". According to Wagner, the close relationship in the development of Vulgar Latin between North Africa and Sardinia might not have only derived from ancient ethnic affinities between the two populations, but also from their common political past within the Exarchate of Africa.\nWhat literature is left to us from this period primarily consists of legal and administrative documents, besides the aforementioned and . The first document containing Sardinian elements is a 1063 donation to the abbey of Montecassino signed by Barisone I of Torres. Another such document (the so-called \"Carta Volgare\") comes from the Judicate of Cagliari and was issued by Torchitorio I de Lacon-Gunale in around 1070, written in Sardinian whilst still employing the Greek alphabet. Other documents are the 1080 \"Logudorese Privilege\", the 1089 Torchitorius' Donation (in the Marseille archives), the 1190\u20131206 Marsellaise Chart (in Campidanese Sardinian) and an 1173 communication between the Bishop Bernardo of Civita and Benedetto, who oversaw the Opera del Duomo in Pisa. The Statutes of Sassari (1316) and Castelgenovese (c.\u20091334) are written in Logudorese Sardinian.\nThe first chronicle in , called , was published anonymously in the 13th century, relating the events of the Judicate of Torres.\nIberian period \u2013 Catalan and Castilian influence.\nThe 1297 feoffment of Sardinia by Pope Boniface VIII led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sardinia: that is, of a state which, although lacking in , entered by right as a member in personal union within the broader Mediterranean structure of the Crown of Aragon, a composite state. Thus began a long war between the latter and, to the cry of , from 1353, the previously allied Judicate of Arborea, in which the Sardinian language was to play the role of an ethnic marker.\nThe war had, among its motives, a never dormant and ancient Arborean political design to establish \"a great island nation-state, wholly indigenous\" which was assisted by the massive participation of the rest of the Sardinians, i.e. those not residing within the jurisdiction of Arborea (), as well as a widespread impatience with the foreign importation of a feudal regime, specifically \" and \", which threatened the survival of deep-rooted indigenous institutions and, far from ensuring the return of the island to a unitary regime, had only introduced there \"\" ('as many petty rulers as there are villages'), whereas instead \"\" ('the Sardinians believed they had one single king').\nThe conflict between the two sovereign and warring parties, during which the Aragonese possessions making up the Kingdom of Sardinia were first administratively split into two separate \"halves\" () by Peter IV the Ceremonious in 1355, ended after sixty-seven years with the Iberian victory at Sanluri in 1409 and the renunciation of any succession right signed by William II of Narbonne in 1420. This event marked the definitive end of Sardinian independence, whose historical relevance for the island, likened by Francesco C. Casula to \"the end of Aztec Mexico\", should be considered \"neither triumph nor defeat, but the painful birth of today's Sardinia\".\nAny outbreak of anti-Aragonese rebellion, such as the revolt of Alghero in 1353, that of Uras in 1470 and finally that of Macomer in 1478, celebrated in , were and would have been systematically neutralised. From that moment, \"\".\nCasula believes that the Aragonese winners from the brutal conflict would then move on to destroy the pre-existing documentary production of the still living Sardinian Judicate, which was predominantly written in Sardinian language along with other ones the chancery was engaged with, leaving behind their trail only \"a few stones\" and, overall, a \"small group of documents\", many of which are in fact still preserved and/or refer to archives outside the island. Specifically, the Arborean documents and the palace in which they were kept would be completely set on fire on May 21, 1478, as the viceroy triumphantly entered Oristano after having tamed the aforementioned 1478 rebellion, which threatened the revival of an Arborean identity which had been \"de jure\" abolished in 1420 but was still very much alive in popular memory.\nThereafter, the ruling class in Sardinia proceeded to adopt Catalan as their primary language. The situation in Cagliari, a city subject to Aragonese repopulation and where, according to Giovanni Francesco Fara ( / ), for a time Catalan took over Sardinian as in Alghero, was emblematic, so much so as to later generate idioms such as ('he does not know Catalan') to indicate a person who could not express themselves \"correctly\". Alghero is still a Catalan-speaking enclave on Sardinia to this day. Nevertheless, the Sardinian language did not disappear from official use: the Catalan juridical tradition in the cities coexisted with that of the Sardinians, marked in 1421 by the Parliamentary extension of the Arborean to the feudal areas during the Reign of King Alfonso the Magnanimous. Fara, in the same first modern monograph dedicated to Sardinia, reported the lively multilingualism in \"one and the same people\", i.e. the Sardinians, because of immigration \"by Spaniards and Italians\" who came to the island to trade with the natives.\nThe long-lasting war and the so-called Black Death had a devastating effect on the island, depopulating large parts of it. People from the neighbouring island of Corsica, which had been already Tuscanised, began to settle en masse in the northern Sardinian coast, leading to the birth of Sassarese and then Gallurese, two Italo-Dalmatian lects.\nDespite Catalan being widely spoken and written on the island at this time, leaving a lasting influence in Sardinia, Sardinian continued to be used in documents pertaining to the Kingdom's administrative and ecclesiastical spheres until the late 17th century. Religious orders also made use of the language. The regulations of the seminary of Alghero, issued by the bishop Andreas Baccallar on July 12, 1586, were in Sardinian; since they were directed to the entire diocese of Alghero and Unions, the provisions intended for the direct knowledge of the people were written in Sardinian and Catalan. The earliest catechism to date found in from the post-Tridentine period is dated 1695, at the foot of the synodal constitutions of the archbishopric of Cagliari.\nThe sociolinguistic situation was characterised by the active and passive competence of the two Iberian languages in the cities and of Sardinian in the rest of the island, as reported in various contemporary testimonies: in 1561, the Portuguese Jesuit Francisco Antonio estimated Sardinian to be \u00abthe ordinary language of Sardinia, as Italian is of Italy; in the cities of Cagliari and Alghero the ordinary language is Catalan, although there are many people who also use Sardinian\u00bb. Crist\u00f2for Despuig, in , had previously claimed in 1557 that, although Catalan had carved out a place for itself as , in many parts of the island the \"ancient language of the Kingdom\" (\"\") was still preserved; the ambassador and Martin Carillo (supposed author of the ironic judgment on the Sardinians' tribal and sectarian divisions: \"\" 'few, thickheaded, and badly united') noted in 1611 that the main cities spoke Catalan and Spanish, but outside these cities no other language was understood than Sardinian, which in turn was understood by everyone in the entire Kingdom; Joan Gaspar Roig i Jalp\u00ed, author of , reported in the mid-seventeenth century that in Sardinia \"\" ('they speak Catalan very well, as though I was in Catalonia'); Anselm Adorno, originally from Genoa but living in Bruges, noted in his pilgrimages how, many foreigners notwithstanding, the natives still spoke their own language ();); another testimony is offered by the rector of the Jesuit college of Sassari Baldassarre Pinyes who, in Rome, wrote: \"As far as the Sardinian language is concerned, Your Paternity should know that it is not spoken in this city, nor in Alghero, nor in Cagliari: it is only spoken in the towns\".\nThe 16th century is marked by a new literary revival of Sardinian, starting from the 15th-century , written by Ant\u00f2ni Canu (1400\u20131476) and published in 1557. , by Hieronimu Araolla, was aimed at \"glorifying and enriching Sardinian, our language\" () as the Spanish, French and Italian poets had already done for their own languages ( and ). This way, Araolla is one of the first Sardinian authors to bind the language to a Sardinian nation, the existence of which is not outright stated but naturally implied. Antonio Lo Frasso, a poet born in Alghero (a city he remembered fondly) who spent his life in Barcelona, wrote lyric poetry in Sardinian.\nAgreeing with Fara's aforementioned , the Sardinian attorney Sigismondo Arquer, author of in Sebastian M\u00fcnster's Cosmographia universalis (whose report would also be quoted in Conrad Gessner's \"On the different languages used by the various nations across the globe\" with minor variations), stated that Sardinian prevailed in most of the Kingdom, with particular regard for the interior, while Catalan and Spanish were spoken in the cities, where the predominantly Iberian ruling class \"occupies most of the official positions\"; although the Sardinian language had become fragmented due to foreign domination (i.e. \"namely Latins, Pisans, Genoese, Spanish, and Africans\"), Arquer pointed to there being many Sardinian words with apparently no traceable origin and reported that Sardinians nevertheless \"understand each other perfectly\".\nEspecially through the reorganization of the monarchy led by the Count-Duke of Olivares, Sardinia would gradually join a broad Spanish cultural sphere. Spanish was perceived as an elitist language, gaining solid ground among the ruling Sardinian class; Spanish had thus a profound influence on Sardinian, especially in those words, styles and cultural models owing to the prestigious international role of the Habsburg monarchy as well as the Court. Most Sardinian authors would write in both Spanish and Sardinian until the 19th century and were well-versed in the former, like Vicente Bacallar y Sanna that was one of the founders of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola; according to Bruno Anatra's estimates, around 87% of the books printed in Cagliari were in Spanish. A notable exception was Pedro Delitala (1550\u20131590), who decided to write in Italian instead. Nonetheless, the Sardinian language retained much of its importance, earning respect from the Spaniards in light of it being the ethnic code the people from most of the Kingdom kept using, especially in the rural areas. Sardinian endured, moreover, in religious drama and the drafting of notarial deeds in the interior. New genres of popular poetry were established around this period, like the or (sacred hymns), the (lullabies), the (funeral laments), the (quatrains), the and (curses), and the improvised poetry of the and .\nSardinian was also one of the few official languages, along with Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese, whose knowledge was required to be an officer in the Spanish \"tercios\", among which the Sardinians were fully considered and counted as \"spanyols\", as requested by the Stamenti in 1553.\nIoan Matheu Garipa, a priest from Orgosolo who translated the Italian into Sardinian () in 1627, was the first author to claim that Sardinian was the closest living relative of classical Latin and, like Araolla before him, valued Sardinian as the language of a specific ethno-national community. In this regard, the philologist Paolo Maninchedda argues that by doing so, these authors did not write \"about Sardinia or in Sardinian to fit into an island system, but to inscribe Sardinia and its language \u2013 and with them, themselves \u2013 in a European system. Elevating Sardinia to a cultural dignity equal to that of other European countries also meant promoting the Sardinians, and in particular their educated countrymen, who felt that they had no roots and no place in the continental cultural system\".\nSavoyard period \u2013 Italian influence.\nThe War of the Spanish Succession gave Sardinia to Austria, whose sovereignty was confirmed by the 1713\u201314 treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt. In 1717 a Spanish fleet reoccupied Cagliari, and the following year Sardinia was ceded to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy in exchange for Sicily. The Savoyard representative, the Count of Lucerna di Campiglione, received the definitive deed of cession from the Austrian delegate Don Giuseppe dei Medici, on condition that the \"rights, statutes, privileges of the nation\" that had been the subject of diplomatic negotiations were preserved. The island thus entered the Italian orbit after the Iberian one, although this transfer would not initially entail any social nor cultural and linguistic changes: Sardinia would still retain for a long time its Iberian character, so much so that only in 1767 were the Aragonese and Spanish dynastic symbols replaced by the Savoyard cross. Until 1848, the Kingdom of Sardinia would be a composite state, and the island of Sardinia would remain a separate country with its own traditions and institutions, albeit without \"summa potestas\" and in personal union as an overseas possession of the House of Savoy.\nThe Sardinian language, although practiced in a state of diglossia, continued to be spoken by all social classes, its linguistic alterity and independence being universally perceived; Spanish, on the other hand, was the prestige code known and used by the Sardinian social strata with at least some education, in so pervasive a manner that Joaqu\u00edn Arce refers to it in terms of a paradox: Castilian had become the common language of the islanders by the time they officially ceased to be Spanish and, through their annexation by the House of Savoy, became Italian through Piedmont instead. Given the current situation, the Piedmontese ruling class which held the reins of the island, in this early phase, resolved to maintain its political and social institutions, while at the same time progressively hollowing them out as well as \"treating the [Sardinian] followers of one faction and of the other equally, but keeping them divided in such a way as to prevent them from uniting, and for us to put to good use such rivalry when the occasion presents itself\".\nAccording to Amos Cardia, this pragmatic stance was rooted in three political reasons: in the first place, the Savoyards did not want to rouse international suspicion and followed to the letter the rules dictated by the Treaty of London, signed on 2 August 1718, whereby they had committed themselves to respect the fundamental laws of the newly acquired Kingdom; in the second place, they did not want to antagonize the hispanophile locals, especially the elites; and finally, they lingered on hoping they could one day manage to dispose of Sardinia altogether, while still keeping the title of Kings by regaining Sicily. In fact, since imposing Italian would have violated one of the fundamental laws of the Kingdom, which the new rulers swore to observe upon taking on the mantle of King, Victor Amadeus II emphasised the need for the operation to be carried out through incremental steps, small enough to go relatively unnoticed (), as early as 1721. Such prudence was again noted, when the King claimed that he was nevertheless not intentioned to ban either Sardinian or Spanish on two separate occasions, in 1726 and 1728.\nThe fact that the new masters of Sardinia felt at loss as to how they could better deal with a cultural and linguistic environment they perceived as alien to the Mainland, where Italian had long been the prestige and even official language, can be deduced from the study (\"Account of the proposed ways to introduce the Italian language to this Kingdom\") commissioned in 1726 by the Piedmontese administration, to which the Jesuit Antonio Falletti from Barolo responded suggesting the (\"to introduce an unknown language [Italian] through a known one [Spanish]\") method as the best course of action for Italianisation. In the same year, Victor Amadeus II had already said he could no longer tolerate the lack of ability to speak Italian on the part of the islanders, in view of the inconveniences that such inability was putting through for the functionaries sent from the Mainland. Restrictions to mixed marriages between Sardinian women and the Piedmontese officers dispatched to the island, which had hitherto been prohibited by law, were at one point lifted and even encouraged so as to better introduce the language to the local population.\nEduardo Blasco Ferrer argues that, in contrast to the cultural dynamics long established in the Mainland between Italian and the various Romance dialects thereof, in Sardinia the relationship between the Italian language \u2013 recently introduced by Savoy \u2013 and the native one had been perceived from the start by the locals, educated and uneducated alike, as a relationship (albeit unequal in terms of political power and prestige) between two very different languages, and not between a language and one of its dialects. The plurisecular Iberian period had also contributed in making the Sardinians feel relatively detached from the Italian language and its cultural sphere; local sensibilities towards the language were further exacerbated by the fact that the Spanish ruling class had long considered Sardinian a distinct language, with respect to their own ones and Italian as well. The perception of the alterity of Sardinian was also widely shared among the Italians who happened to visit the island and recounted their experiences with the local population, whom they often likened to the Spanish and the ancient peoples of the Orient, an opinion illustrated by the Duke Francis IV and Antonio Bresciani; a popular assertion by the officer Giulio Bechi, who would participate in a military campaign against Sardinian banditry dubbed as (\"great hunt\"), was that the islanders spoke \"a horrible language, as intricate as Saracen, and sounding like Spanish\".\nHowever, the Savoyard government eventually decided to directly introduce Italian altogether to Sardinia on the conventional date of 25 July 1760, because of the Savoyards' geopolitical need to draw the island away from Spain's gravitational pull and culturally integrate Sardinia into the orbit of the Italian peninsula, through the thorough assimilation of the island's cultural models, which were deemed by the Savoyard functionaries as \"foreign\" and \"inferior\", to Piedmont. In fact, the measure in question prohibited, among other things, \"the unreserved use of the Castilian idiom in writing and speaking, which, after forty years of Italian rule, was still so deeply rooted in the hearts of the Sardinian teachers\". In 1764, the exclusive imposition of the Italian language was finally extended to all sectors of public life, including education, in parallel with the reorganisation of the Universities of Cagliari and Sassari, which saw the arrival of personnel from the Italian mainland, and the reorganisation of lower education, where it was decided likewise to send teachers from Piedmont to make up for the lack of Italian-speaking Sardinian teachers. In 1763, it had already been planned to \"send a number of skilled Italian professors\" to Sardinia to \"rid the Sardinian teachers of their errors\" and \"steer them along the right path\". The purpose did not elude the attention of the Sardinian ruling class, who deplored the fact that \"the Piedmontese bishops have introduced preaching in Italian\" and, in an anonymous document attributed to the conservative Sardinian Parliament and eloquently called (\"Grievance of the Kingdom\"), denounced how \"the arms, the privileges, the laws, the language, University, and currency of Aragon have now been taken away, to the disgrace of Spain, and to the detriment of all particulars\".\nSpanish was replaced as the official language, even though Italian struggled to take roots for a long time: Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals wrote in 1863 that Catalan had been used in notarial instruments from Sardinia well into the 1780s, together with Sardinian, while parish registers and official deeds continued to be drawn up in Spanish until 1828. The most immediate effect of the order was thus the further marginalization of the Sardinians' native idiom, making way for a thorough Italianisation of the island. For the first time, in fact, even the wealthy and most powerful families of rural Sardinia, the , started to perceive Sardinian as a handicap. Girolamo Sotgiu asserts on the matter that \"the Sardinian ruling class, just as it had become Hispanicized, now became Italianised, without ever managing to become Sardinian, that is to say, to draw from the experience and culture of their people, from which it came, those elements of concreteness without which a culture and a ruling class always seem foreign even in their homeland. This was the objective that the Savoyard government had set itself and which, to a good measure, it managed to pursue\".\nFrancesco Gemelli, in , depicts the island's linguistic pluralism in 1776, and referring to Francesco Cetti's for a more meticulous analysis of \"the character of the Sardinian language (\"\") and the main differences between Sassarese and Tuscan\": \"five languages are spoken in Sardinia, that is Spanish, Italian, Sardinian, Algherese, and Sassarese. The former two because of the past and today's domination, and they are understood and spoken through schooling by all the educated people residing in the cities, as well as villages. Sardinian is common to all the Kingdom, and is divided into two main dialects, Campidanese Sardinian and Sardinian from the Upper Half (\"\"). Algherese is a Catalan dialect, for a Catalan colony is Alghero; and finally Sassarese, which is spoken in Sassari, Tempio and Castel sardo (\"sic\"), is a dialect of Tuscan, a relic of their Pisan overlords. Spanish is losing ground to Italian, which has taken over the former in the fields of education and jurisdiction\".\nThe first systematic study on the Sardinian language was written in 1782 by the philologist Matteo Madau, with the title of . The intention that motivated Madau was to trace the ideal path through which Sardinian could be elevated to the island's proper national language; nevertheless, according to Amos Cardia, the Savoyard climate of repression on Sardinian culture would induce Matteo Madau to veil its radical proposals with some literary devices, and the author was eventually unable to ever translate them into reality. The first volume of comparative Sardinian dialectology was produced in 1786 by the Catalan Jesuit Andres Febres, known in Italy and Sardinia by the pseudonym of , who returned from Lima where he had first published a book of Mapuche grammar in 1764. After he moved to Cagliari, he became fascinated with the Sardinian language as well and conducted some research on three specific dialects; the aim of his work, entitled , was to \"write down the rules of the Sardinian language\" and spur the Sardinians to \"cherish the language of their Homeland, as well as Italian\". The government in Turin, which had been monitoring Febres' activity, decided that his work would not be allowed to be published: Victor Amadeus III had supposedly not appreciated the fact that the book had a bilingual dedication to him in Italian and Sardinian, a mistake that his successors, while still echoing back to a general concept of \"Sardinian ancestral homeland\", would from then on avoid, and making exclusive use of Italian to produce their works.\nAt the end of the 18th century, following the trail of the French Revolution, a group of the Sardinian middle class planned to break away from Savoyard rule and institute an independent Sardinian Republic under French protection; all over the island, a number of political pamphlets printed in Sardinian were illegally distributed, calling for a mass revolt against the \"Piedmontese\" rule and the barons' abuse. The most famous literary product born out of such political unrest was the poem , noted as a testament of the French-inspired democratic and patriotic values, as well as Sardinia's situation under feudalism. As for the reactions that the three-year Sardinian revolutionary period aroused in the island's ruling class, who were now in the process of Italianisation, for Sotgiu \"its failure was complete: undecided between a breathless municipalism and a dead-end attachment to the Crown, it did not have the courage to lead the revolutionary wave coming from the countryside\". In fact, although pamphlets such as \"the Achilles of Sardinian Liberation\" circulated, denouncing the backwardness of an oppressive feudal system and a Ministry that was said to have \"always been the enemy of the Sardinian Nation\", and the \"social pact between the Sovereign and the Nation\" was declared to have been broken, there was no radical change in the form of government: therefore, it is not surprising, according to Sotgiu, that although \"the call for the Sardinian nation, its traditions and identity became stronger and stronger, even to the point of requesting the creation of a stable military force of \"Sardinian nationals only\"\", the concrete hypothesis of abolishing the monarchical and feudal regimes did not \"make its way into the consciousness of many\". The only result was therefore \"the defeat of the peasant class emerging from the very core of feudal society, urged on by the masses of peasants and led by the most advanced forces of the Sardinian bourgeoisie\" and, conversely, the victory of the feudal barons and \"of large strata of the town bourgeoisie that had developed within the framework of the feudal order and feared that the abolition of feudalism and the proclamation of the Republic might simultaneously destroy the very basis of their own wealth and prestige\".\nIn the climate of monarchic restoration that followed Giovanni Maria Angioy's rebellion, whose substantial failure marked therefrom a historic watershed in Sardinia's future, other Sardinian intellectuals, all characterized by an attitude of general devotion to their island as well as proven loyalty to the House of Savoy, posed in fact the question of the Sardinian language, while being careful enough to use only Italian as a language to get their point across. During the 19th century in particular, the Sardinian intellectuality and ruling class found itself divided over the adherence to the Sardinian national values and the allegiance to the new Italian nationality, toward which they eventually leaned in the wake of the abortive Sardinian revolution. The identity crisis of the Sardinian ruling class, and their strive for acceptance into the new citizenship of the Italian identity, would manifest itself with the publication of the so-called by the unionist Pietro Martini in 1863.\nA few years after the major anti-Piedmontese revolt, in 1811, the priest Vincenzo Raimondo Porru published a timid essay of Sardinian grammar, which, however, referred expressively to the Southern dialect (hence the title of ) and, out of prudence towards the king, was made with the declared intention of easing the acquisition of Italian among his fellow Sardinians, instead of protecting their language. The more ambitious work of the professor and senator Giovanni Spano, the \"Ortographia sarda nationale\" (\"Sardinian National Orthography\"), although it was officially meant for the same purpose as Porru's, attempted in reality to establish a unified Sardinian orthography based on Logudorese, just like Florentine had become the basis for Italian.\nThe jurist Carlo Baudi di Vesme claimed that the suppression of Sardinian and the imposition of Italian was desirable to make the islanders into \"civilized Italians\". Since Sardinia was, in the words of Di Vesme, \"not Spanish, but neither Italian: it is and has been for centuries just Sardinian\", it was necessary, at the turn of the circumstances that \"inflamed it with ambition, desire and love of all things Italian\", to promote these tendencies even more in order \"to profit from them in the common interest\", for which it proved \"almost necessary\" to spread the Italian language in Sardinia \"presently so little known in the interior\" with a view to better enable the Perfect Fusion: \"Sardinia will be Piedmont, it will be Italy; it will receive and give us lustre, wealth and power!\".\nThe primary and tertiary education was thus offered exclusively through Italian, and Piedmontese cartographers went on to replace many Sardinian place names with Italian ones. The Italian education, being imparted in a language the Sardinians were not familiar with, spread Italian for the first time in history to Sardinian villages, marking the troubled transition to the new dominant language; the school environment, which employed Italian as the sole means of communication, grew to become a microcosm around the then-monolingual Sardinian villages. In 1811, the canon Salvatore Carboni published in Bologna the polemic book (\"Holy Discourses in Sardinian language\"), wherein the author lamented the fact that Sardinia, \"\" (\"Being an Italian province nowadays, [Sardinia] cannot have laws and public acts made in its own language\"), and while claiming that \"\" (\"the Sardinian language, however unofficial, will last as long as Sardinia among the Sardinians\"), he also asked himself \"\" (\"Why should we show neglect and contempt for Sardinian, which is a language as ancient and noble as Italian, French and Spanish?\").\nIn 1827, the historical legal code serving as the \"consuetud de la naci\u00f3 sardesca\" in the days of the Iberian rule, the \"Carta de Logu\", was abolished and replaced by the more advanced Savoyard code of Charles Felix \"Leggi civili e criminali del Regno di Sardegna\", written in Italian. The Perfect Fusion with the Mainland States, enacted under the auspices of a \"transplant, without any reserves and obstacles, [of] the culture and civilization of the Italian Mainland to Sardinia\", would result in the loss of the island's residual autonomy and marked the moment when \"the language of the \"Sardinian nation\" lost its value as an instrument with which to ethnically identify a particular people and its culture, to be codified and cherished, and became instead one of the many regional dialects subordinated to the national language\".\nDespite the long-term assimilation policy, the anthem of the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia would be \"S'hymnu sardu nationale\" (\"the Sardinian National Anthem\"), also known as \"Cunservet Deus su Re\" (\"God save the King\"), before it was \"de facto\" replaced by the Italian \"Marcia Reale\" as well, in 1861. However, even when the island became part of the Kingdom of Italy under Victor Emmanuel II in 1861, Sardinia's distinct culture from the now unified Mainland made it an overall neglected province within the newly proclaimed unitary nation state. Between 1848 and 1861, the island was plunged into a social and economic crisis that was to last until the post-war period. Eventually, Sardinian came to be perceived as / , literally translating into English as \"the language of hunger\" (i.e. the language of the poor), and Sardinian parents strongly supported the teaching of the Italian tongue to their children, since they saw it as the portal to escaping from a poverty-stricken, rural, isolated and underprivileged life.\nLate modern period.\nAt the dawn of the 20th century, Sardinian had remained an object of research almost only among the island's scholars, struggling to garner international interest and even more suffering from a certain marginalization in the strictly Italian sphere: one observes in fact \"the prevalence of foreign scholars over Italian ones and/or the existence of fundamental and still irreplaceable contributions by non-Italian linguists\". Previously, Sardinian had been mentioned in a book by August Fuchs on irregular verbs in Romance languages (, Berlin, 1840) and, later, in the second edition of (1856\u20131860) written by Friedrich Christian Diez, credited as one of the founders of Romance philology. The pioneering research of German authors spurred a certain interest in the Sardinian language on the part of some Italian scholars, such as Graziadio Isaia Ascoli and, above all, his disciple Pier Enea Guarnerio, who was the first in Italy to classify Sardinian as a separate member of the Romance language family without subordinating it to the group of \"Italian dialects\", as was previously the custom in Italy. Wilhelm Meyer-L\u00fcbke, an undisputed authority on Romance linguistics, published in 1902 an essay on Logudorese Sardinian from the survey of the condaghe of San Pietro di Silki (, in , Phil. Hist. Kl., 145), the study of which led to the initiation into Sardinian linguistics of the then university student Max Leopold Wagner: it is to the latter's activity that much of the twentieth-century knowledge and research of Sardinian in the phonetic, morphological and, in part, syntactic fields was generated.\nDuring the mobilization for World War I, the Italian Army compelled all people on the island that were \"of Sardinian stock\" () to enlist as Italian subjects and established the Sassari Infantry Brigade on 1 March 1915 at Tempio Pausania and Sinnai. Unlike the other infantry brigades of Italy, Sassari's conscripts were only Sardinians (including many officers). It is currently the only unit in Italy with an anthem in a language other than Italian: \"Dimonios\" (\"Devils\"), which would be written in 1994 by Luciano Sechi; its title derives from the German-language \"Rote Teufel\" (\"red devils\"), by which they were popularly known among the troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Compulsory military service around this period played a role in language shift and is referred to by historian Manlio Brigaglia as \"the first great mass \"nationalization\"\" of the Sardinians. Nevertheless, similarly to Navajo-speaking service members in the United States during World War II, as well as Quechua speakers during the Falklands War, native Sardinians were offered the opportunity to be recruited as code talkers to transmit tactical information in Sardinian over radio communications which might have otherwise run the risk of being gained by Austrian troops, since some of them hailed from Italian-speaking areas to which, therefore, the Sardinian language was utterly alien: Alfredo Graziani writes in his war diary that \"having learned that many of our phonograms were being intercepted, we adopted the system of communicating on the phone only in Sardinian, certain that in this way they would never be able to understand what one was saying\". To avoid infiltration attempts by said Italophone troops, positions were guarded by Sardinian recruits from the Sassari Brigade who required anyone who came to them that they identify themselves first by proving they spoke Sardinian: \"\".\nThe Sardinian-born philosopher Antonio Gramsci commented on the Sardinian linguistic question while writing a letter to his sister Teresina; Gramsci was aware of the long-term ramifications of language shift, and suggested that Teresa let her son acquire Sardinian with no restriction, because doing otherwise would result in \"putting his imagination into a straitjacket\" as well as him ending up eventually \"learning two jargons, and no language at all\".\nCoinciding with the year of the Irish War of Independence, Sardinian autonomism re-emerged as an expression of the fighters' movement, coagulating into the Sardinian Action Party (PsdAz) which, before long, would become one of the most important players in the island's political life. At the beginning, the party would not have had strictly ethnic claims though, being the Sardinian language and culture widely perceived, in the words of Fiorenzo Toso, as \"symbols of the region's underdevelopment\".\nThe policy of forced assimilation culminated in the twenty years of the Fascist regime, which launched a campaign of violent repression of autonomist demands and finally determined the island's definitive entry into the \"national cultural system\" through the combined work of the educational system and the one-party system. Local cultural expressions were thus repressed, including Sardinia's festivals and improvised poetry competitions, and a large number of Sardinian surnames were changed to sound more Italian. An argument broke out between the Sardinian poet Antioco Casula (popularly known as \"Montanaru\") and the fascist journalist Gino Anchisi, who stated that \"once the region is moribund or dead\", which the regime declared to be, \"so will the dialect \"(sic)\"\", which was interpreted as \"the region's revealing spiritual element\"; in the wake of this debate, Anchisi managed to have Sardinian banned from the printing press, as well. The significance of the Sardinian language as it was posed by Casula, in fact, lent itself to potentially subversive themes, being tied to the practices of cultural resistance of an indigenous ethnic group, whose linguistic repertoire had to be introduced in school to preserve a \"Sardinian personality\" and regain \"a dignity\" perceived to have been lost in the process. Another famed poet from the island, Salvatore (\"Bore\") Poddighe, fell into a severe depression and took his own life a few years after his masterwork (\"Sa Mundana Cummedia\") had been seized by Cagliari's police commissioner. When the use of Sardinian in school was banned in 1934 as part of a nation-wide educational plan against the alloglot \"dialects\", the then Sardinian-speaking children were confronted with another means of communication that was supposed to be their own from then onwards.\nOn a whole, this period saw the most aggressive cultural assimilation effort by the central government, which led to an even further sociolinguistic degradation of Sardinian. While the interior managed to at least partially resist this intrusion at first, everywhere else the regime had succeeded in thoroughly supplanting the local cultural models with new ones hitherto foreign to the community and compress the former into a \"pure matter of folklore\", marking a severance from the island's heritage that engendered, according to Guido Melis, \"an identity crisis with worrying social repercussions\", as well as \"a rift that could no longer be healed through the generations\". This period is identified by Manlio Brigaglia as the second mass \"nationalization\" of the Sardinians, which was characterized by \"a policy deliberately aiming at \"Italianisation\"\" by means of, in his words, \"a declared war\" against the usage of the Sardinian language by fascism and the Catholic Church alike.\nIn 1945, following the restoration of political freedoms, the Sardinian Action Party called for autonomy as a federal state within the \"new Italy\" that had emerged from the Resistance: it was in the context of the second post-war period that, as consensus for autonomy kept growing, the party began to distinguish itself by policies based on Sardinia's linguistic and cultural specificity.\nPresent situation.\nAfter World War II, awareness around the Sardinian language and the danger of its slipping away did not seem to concern the Sardinian elites and entered the political spaces later than in other European peripheries marked by the presence of local ethno-linguistic minorities; Sardinian was in fact dismissed by the middle class, as both the Sardinian language and culture were still being held responsible for the island's underdevelopment. The Sardinian ruling class, drawn to the Italian modernisation stance on how to steer the islanders to \"social development\", believed in fact that the Sardinians had been held back by their own \"traditional practices\" vis-\u00e0-vis the mainlanders, and that, in order to catch up with the latter, social and cultural progress could only be brought about through the rejection of said practices. As the language bore an increasing amount of stigmatisation and came to be perceived as an undesirable identity marker, the Sardinians were consequently encouraged to part with it by way of linguistic and cultural assimilation.\nAt the time of drafting of the statute in 1948, the national legislator in Rome eventually decided to specify the \"Sardinian specialty\" as a criterion for political autonomy uniquely on the grounds of local socio-economic issues; further considerations were discarded which were centred on the ascertainment of a distinct cultural, historical and geographical identity, although they had been hitherto the primary local justifications arguing for home rule, as they were looked down upon as a potential prelude to more autonomist or even more radical separatist claims; this view would be exemplified by a report of the Italian Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into Banditry, which warned against a looming threat posed by \"isolationist tendencies injurious to the development of Sardinian society and recently manifesting themselves in the proposal to regard Sardinian as the language of an ethnic minority\". Eventually, the special statute of 1948 settled instead to concentrate on the arrangement of state-funded plans (baptised with the Italian name of ) for the heavy industrial development of the island.\nTherefore, far from generating a Statute grounded on the acknowledgment of a particular cultural identity like, for example, in the Aosta Valley and South Tyrol, what ended up resulting in Sardinia was, in the words of Mariarosa Cardia, an outcome \"solely based on economic considerations, because there was not either the will or the ability to devise a strong and culturally motivated autonomy, a \"Sardinian specificity\" that was not defined in terms of social backwardness and economic deprivation\". Emilio Lussu, who admitted that he had only voted in favour of the final draft \"to prevent the Statute from being rejected altogether by a single vote, even in such a reduced form\", was the only member, at the session of 30 December 1946, to call in vain for the mandatory teaching of the Sardinian language, arguing that it was \"a millenary heritage that must be preserved\".\nIn the meantime, the emphasis on Italian continued, with historical sites and ordinary objects being henceforth popularised in Italian for mass consumption (e.g. the various kinds of \"traditional\" cheese, instead of , instead of , instead of / , etc.). The Ministry of Public Education once requested that the teachers willing to teach Sardinian be put under surveillance. The rejection of the indigenous language and culture, along with a rigid model of Italian-language education which induced a denigration of Sardinian through corporal punishment and shaming, has led to poor schooling for the Sardinians. Roberto Bolognesi stated that in his school years in Sardinia, he had \"witnessed both physical and psychological abuse against monolingual Sardinian-speaking children. The psychological violence consisted usually in calling the children \"donkeys\" and in inviting the whole class to join the mockery\". Early school leaving and high school failure rates in Sardinia prompted a debate in the early Nineties on the efficaciousness of strictly monolingual education, with proposals for a focus on a comparative approach.\nClaims for an autonomous solution to the Sardinian economic, social and cultural problems, which the 1948 Statute proved unable to resolve, came to the fore once again in the Sixties, with campaigns, often expressed in the form of political demands by Sardinian nationalists, to give Sardinian equal status with Italian as a means to promote cultural identity. Antonio Simon Mossa had drawn from his past experiences across the world, including the newly independent country of Algeria, that Sardinians were one of the many ethnic and national minorities facing the danger of cultural assimilation, and his fervor reverberated across the Sardinian society, pushing even some non-nationalist groups to take an interest in matters relating to minorities. Although a law was passed as early as 1955 for the establishment of five professorships of Sardinian linguistics, one of the first demands for bilingualism was in fact formulated in a resolution adopted by the University of Cagliari in 1971, calling upon the national and regional authorities to recognize the Sardinians as an ethnic and linguistic minority and Sardinian as the islanders' co-official language. At a time when the Italian \"modernisation plans\" in Sardinia were in full swing, the Italian government was apprehensive about this deliberation by the University of Cagliari as providing the timber for further ethnic unrest in the state's peripheries. Sergio Salvi's description of the Sardinians as a \"forbidden nation\" in Italy further contributed to the linguistic question gaining more notoriety at the national level. A first legal draft concerning Sardinian as a language to be legally put on an equal position with Italian was developed by the Sardinian Action Party in 1975. Critical acclaim in Sardinian cultural circles followed the patriotic poem \"No sias isciau\" (\"Don't be a slave\") by Raimondo () Piras some months before his death in 1977, urging bilingual education to reverse the ongoing trend of cultural De-Sardization.\nIndeed, during the late 70s reports were released that Sardinian was on course of being abandoned in favour of Italian in the towns and among the younger generation. By then, a significant shift to Italian had been noted in rural Sardinia not only in the Campidanese plain, but even in some inner areas that had been previously considered Sardinian-speaking bastions, manifesting a parallel shift of the values upon which the ethnic and cultural identity of the Sardinians was traditionally grounded. From then onwards, the use of Sardinian would continue to recede because of the strongly negative view the Sardinian community developed toward it, assuming a self-belittling attitude which has been described as the emergence of a \"minority complex\" fairly typical of linguistic minorities. However, by the Eighties the language had become a point of ethnic pride: it also became a tool through which long held grievances towards the central government's failure at delivering better economic and social conditions could be channeled. A contradicting tendency has been noted by observing that, while Sardinian is held in a much more positive light than before, its actual use has notably decreased and keeps doing so.\nA law by popular initiative for Sardinian-Italian bilingualism garnered considerable success as it kept gathering thousands of signatures, but was promptly blocked by the Italian Communist Party and thus never implemented. The same Italian Communist Party would later propose, however, another bill of its own initiative \"for the protection of the language and culture of the Sardinian people\" in 1980. In the end, following tensions and claims of the Sardinian nationalist movement for concrete cultural and political autonomy, including the recognition of the Sardinians as an ethnic and linguistic minority, three separate bills were eventually presented to the Regional Council in the Eighties. In 1981, the Regional Council debated and voted for the introduction of bilingualism in Sardinia for the first time. As pressure by a resolution of the Council of Europe continued to bear on Italian policy-makers for the protection of minorities, a Commission was appointed in 1982 to investigate the issue; the following year, a bill was presented to the Italian Parliament, but without success. One of the first laws approved by the Sardinian legislator with respect to the protection and promotion of the Sardinian language and culture was soon rejected by the Constitutional Court in 1994, which deemed it \"exorbitant in a multitude of ways with regard to the supplementary and implementing powers enjoyed by the Region in matters of education\"; it was not until 1997 that Sardinian was finally recognized by the regional law (n. 26 of 15 October 1997 \"Promotion and enhancement of the culture and language of Sardinia\") without there being any recourse from the Italian central government; this law too, however, would prove to be more focused on the traditions and history of the Sardinian people than their language in itself.\nA survey conducted by MAKNO in 1984 showed that three-quarters of the Sardinians had a positive attitude towards bilingual education (22% of the interviewees, especially in the Province of Nuoro and Oristano, wanted Sardinian to be compulsory in Sardinian schools, while 54.7% would prefer to see teaching in Sardinian as optional) and official bilingualism like in the Aosta Valley and South Tyrol (62.7% of the population were in favour, 25.9% said no and 11.4% were unsure). Such consensus remains relatively stable to this day; another survey, conducted in 2008, reported that more than half of the interviewees, 57.3%, were in favour of the introduction of Sardinian into schools alongside Italian. More research carried out in 2010 confirmed warm reception among the students' parents to introducing Sardinian at school, even though skepticism circulated around having it taught as the vehicular language of education.\nIn the 1990s, there had been a resurgence of Sardinian-language music, ranging from the more traditional genres (, , etc.) to rock (, , , etc.) and even hip hop and rap (\"Dr. Drer e CRC Posse\", \"Quilo\", , \"Malam\", , \"Menhir\", \"Stranos Elementos\", \"Malos Cantores\", \"Randagiu Sardu\", \"Futta\" etc.), and with artists who used the language as a means to promote the island and address its long-standing issues and the new challenges. A few films (like \"Su Re\", \"Bellas Mariposas\", \"Treulababbu\", \"Sonetaula\" etc.) have also been dubbed in Sardinian, and some others were provided with subtitles in the language. The first scientific work in Sardinian (), delving into the question of modern energy supplies, was written by Paolo Giuseppe Mura, Physics Professor at the University of Cagliari, in 1995.\nEventually, sustained activism made possible the ratification by Italy of the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 1998, which would be followed in 1999 by the formal recognition of twelve minority languages (Sardinian, Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovenian, Croatian, French, Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Friulian, Ladin and Occitan) through the framework law no. 482, in keeping with the spirit of Art. 6 of the Italian Constitution (\"The Republic safeguards linguistic minorities by means of appropriate measures\"). While the first section of said law states that Italian is the official language of the Republic, a number of provisions are included to normalize the use of such languages and let them become part of the national fabric. However, Italy (along with France and Malta) has never ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Nevertheless, the law proved to be a positive step towards the legalization of Sardinian as it put at least an end to the ban on the language which had been in effect since the Italian Unification, and was deemed as a starting point, albeit timid, to pursue a more decentralized school curriculum for the island.\nStill, some national school books (education has never fallen under the region's remits and is managed by the state at the central level) have not stopped to squeeze the language into the Italian acceptation of \"dialetto\" (\"Italian dialect\") in spite of its actual recognition by the state. Sardinian is yet to be taught at school, with the exception of a few experimental occasions; Mauro Maxia noticed a lack of interest on the part of school managers, some request for Sardinian language classes notwithstanding. Furthermore, its use has not ceased to be disincentivized as antiquated or even indicative of a lack of education, leading many locals to associate it with negative feelings of shame, backwardness, and provincialism. Similar issues of identity have been observed in regard to the community's attitude toward what they positively perceive to be part of \"modernity\", generally associated with the Italian cultural sphere, as opposed to the Sardinian one, whose aspects have long been stigmatized as \"primitive\" and \"barbarous\" by the political and social institutions that ruled the island. Roberto Bolognesi believes that the enduring stigmatisation of Sardinian as the language of the \"socially and culturally disadvantaged\" classes leads to the nurturing of a vicious circle that further promotes the language's regression, reinforcing its negative judgement among those who perceive themselves as \"most competitive\": \"a perverse mechanism that has condemned and still condemns Sardinian speakers to social marginalisation, systematically excluding them from those linguistic and cultural interactions in which the prestigious registers and high style of language are developed, first and foremost in schools\".\nA number of other factors like a considerable immigration flow from mainland Italy, the interior rural exodus to urban areas, where Sardinian is spoken by a much lower percentage of the population, and the use of Italian as a prerequisite for jobs and social advancement actually hinder any policy set up to promote the language. Therefore, following the model proposed by a UNESCO panel of experts in 2003, Sardinian is classified by UNESCO as a \"definitely endangered\" language (\"children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home\"), on the way to become \"severely endangered\" (\"the language is used mostly by the grandparental generation and up\").\nLanguage use is far from stable; following the Expanded GIDS (\"Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale\") model, Sardinian would position between 7 (\"Shifting: the child-bearing generation knows the language well enough to use it among themselves but none are transmitting it to their children\") and 8a (\"Moribund: the only remaining active speakers of the language are members of the grandparent generation\"). While an estimated 68 percent of the islanders had in fact a good oral command of Sardinian, language ability among the children has plummeted to less than 13 percent; some linguists, like Mauro Maxia, cite the low number of Sardinian-speaking children (with the notable case of a number of villages where Sardinian has ceased to be spoken altogether since 1993) as indicative of language decline, calling Sardinia a case of \"linguistic suicide\". The depth of the Sardophone networks' increasing assimilation into Italian is illustrated by the latest ISTAT data published in 2017, which confirm Italian as the language that has largely taken root as the means of socialization within Sardinian families (52.1%), relegating the practice of code-switching to 31.5% and the actual use of languages other than Italian to only 15.6%; outside the social circle of family and friends, the numbers define Italian as by far the most prevalent language (87.2%), as opposed to the usage of Sardinian and other languages which has dropped to 2.8%. Today, most people who use Sardinian as part of day-to-day life reside mainly in the sparsely populated areas in the countryside, like the mountainous region of Barbagia.\nA bill proposed by the cabinet of the former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti would have further lowered the protection level of Sardinian, distinguishing between the so-called \"national minorities\", speaking languages protected by international agreements (German, Slovenian, French) and the \"linguistic minorities\" whose language is not spoken in any state other than Italy (all the other ethno-linguistic groups, including Sardinian). This bill, which was eventually implemented but later deemed unconstitutional by the Court, triggered a reaction on the island. Students expressed an interest in taking all (or part) of their exit examinations in Sardinian. In response to a 2013 Italian initiative to remove bilingual signs on the island, a group of Sardinians began a virtual campaign on Google Maps to replace Italian place names with the original Sardinian names. After about one month, Google changed the place names back to Italian.\nAfter a signature campaign, it has been made possible to change the language setting on Facebook from any language to Sardinian. It is also possible to switch to Sardinian even in Telegram and a number of other programs, like F-Droid, Diaspora, OsmAnd, Notepad++, QGIS, Swiftkey, Stellarium, Skype, VLC media player for Android and iOS, Linux Mint Debian Edition 2 \"Betsy\", Firefox etc. The DuckDuckGo search engine is available in Sardinian as well. In 2016, the first automatic translation software from Italian to Sardinian was developed.\nIn 2015, all the political parties in the Sardinian regional council reached an agreement concerning a series of amendments to the old 1997 law to be able to introduce the optional teaching of the language in Sardinia's schools. The Unified Text on the Discipline of the Regional linguistic policy was eventually approved on 27 June 2018, with the aim of setting in motion a path towards bilingual administration, contributions to bilingual mass media, publishing, IT schools and websites; it also allowed for the foundation of a Sardinian board (\"Consulta de su Sardu\") with thirty experts that would propose a linguistic standard based on the main historical varieties, and would also have advisory duties towards the Regional body. However, said law has yet to be followed up by the respective implementing decrees, the lack of which prevents it from being legally applicable. Some Sardinian language activists and activist groups have also contested the law itself, considering it a political attack on Sardinian made to try to negate its uniformity and to relegate it to folklore, and also noted how its text contains a few parts that could bring the Italian government to challenge it.\nIn 2021 the Prosecutor of Oristano opened a Sardinian linguistic desk, both to support citizens and to provide advice and translations to magistrates and the police. It has been the first time in Italy in which such a service has been offered to a minority language.\nAlthough there is still not an option to teach Sardinian on the island itself, let alone in Italy, some language courses are instead sometimes available in Germany (Universities of Stuttgart, Munich, T\u00fcbingen, Mannheim etc.), Spain (University of Girona), Iceland and Czech Republic (Brno university). Shigeaki Sugeta also taught Sardinian to his students of Romance languages at the Waseda University in Tokyo (Japan), and would even release a Sardinian\u2013Japanese dictionary out of it.\nAt present, the Sardinian-speaking community is the least protected one in Italy, despite being the largest minority language group officially recognized by the state. In fact the language, which is receding in all domains of use, is still not given access to any field of public life, such as education (Italian\u2013Sardinian bilingualism is still frowned upon, while the local public universities play little, if any, role whatsoever in supporting the language), politics (with the exception of some nationalist groups), justice, administrative authorities and public services, media, and cultural, ecclesiastical, economic and social activities, as well as facilities. In a case presented to the European Commission by the then MEP Renato Soru in 2017, in which he complained of national negligence with regard to the state's own legislation in comparison to other linguistic minorities, the Commission's response pointed out to the Honourable Member that matters of language policy pursued by individual member states do not fall within its competences.\nAccording to a 2017 report on the digital language diversity in Europe, Sardinian appears to be particularly vital on social media as part of many people's everyday life for private use, but such vitality does not still translate into a strong and wide availability of Internet media for the language. In 2017, a 60-hour Sardinian language course was introduced for the first time in Sardinia and Italy at the University of Cagliari, although such a course had been already available in other universities abroad.\nIn 2015, the Council of Europe commented on the status of national minorities in Italy, noting the approach of the Italian government towards them with the exception of the German, French and Slovenian languages, where Italy has applied full bilingualism due to international agreements; despite the formal recognition from the Italian state, Italy does not in fact collect any information on the ethnic and linguistic composition of the population, apart from South Tyrol. There is also virtually no print and broadcasting media exposure in politically or numerically weaker minorities like Sardinian. Moreover, the resources allocated to cultural projects like bilingual education, which lacks a consistent approach and offers no guarantee of continuity throughout the years, are largely insufficient to meet \"even the most basic expectations\".\nA solution to the Sardinian question being unlikely to be found anytime soon, the language has become highly endangered: even though the endogamy rate among group members seems to be very high, less than 15 per cent of the Sardinian children use the language to communicate with each other. it appears that the late recognition of Sardinian as a minority language on the part of the state, as well as the gradual but pervasive Italianisation promoted by the latter's education system, the administration system and the media, followed by the intergenerational language replacement, made it so that the vitality of Sardinian has been heavily compromised. The 1995 Euromosaic project, which conducted a research study on the current situation of the ethno-linguistic minorities across Europe under the auspices of the European Commission, concludes their report on Sardinian as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This would appear to be yet another minority language group under threat. The agencies of production and reproduction are not serving the role they did a generation ago. The education system plays no role whatsoever in supporting the language and its production and reproduction. The language has no prestige and is used in work only as a natural as opposed to a systematic process. It seems to be a language relegated to a highly localised function of interaction between friends and relatives. Its institutional base is extremely weak and declining. Yet there is concern among its speakers who have an emotive link to the language and its relationship to Sardinian identity.\nAs Matteo Valdes explains, \"the island's population sees, day after day, the decline of their original languages. They are complicit in this decline, passing on to their children the language of prestige and power, but at the same time they feel that the loss of local languages is also a loss of themselves, of their history, of their own specific identity or distinctiveness\".\nWith cultural assimilation having already occurred, most of the younger generation of islanders, although they do understand some basic Sardinian, is now in fact Italian monolingual and monocultural as they are not able to speak Sardinian anymore, but simply regional Italian (known amongst Italian linguists as or \"IrS\") which in its lowest diastratic forms is, oftentimes derisively, nicknamed \"itali\u00e0nu porchedd\u00ecnu\" (literally \"swinish Italian\") by native Sardinian speakers. Roberto Bolognesi argues that, in the face of the persistent denial and rejection of the Sardinian language, it is as if the latter \"had taken revenge\" on its original community of speakers \"and continues to do so by \"polluting\" the hegemonic linguistic system\", recalling Gramsci's prophetic warning uttered at the dawn of the previous century. In fact, compared to a now prevalent regional Italian that, according to Bolognesi, \"is in fact a hybrid language that has arisen from the contact between two different linguistic systems\", \"the (little) Sardinian which is used by young people often constitutes an ungrammatical jargon filled with obscenities and constructions belonging to Italian\": in other words, the population would therefore only master \"two crippled languages\" () whose manifestations do not arise from a recognisable norm, nor do they constitute a clear source of linguistic security. Bolognesi believes therefore that the Sardinians' utter \"rejection of their original linguistic identity has not entailed the hoped-for and automatic homologation to a more socially prestigious identity, but the acquisition of a second-class identity (neither truly Sardinian nor truly Italian), no longer self-centred but rather peripheral with respect to the sources of linguistic and cultural norms, which still remain beyond their reach: on the other side of the Tyrrhenian Sea\".\nBy contrast, Eduardo Blasco Ferrer has been noted how the Sardinian-speaking community engages only in code-switching and usually takes care in refraining from code-mixing between the two different languages.\nNegative attitudes among native speakers have been observed towards second-language learners for speaking \"poor Sardinian\", an attitude considered to be ethnically grounded on the interaction of in-group and out-group dynamics.\nIn conclusion, the Sardinian language, while still being described as \"viable\" in 2003, continues to be adversely affected by pervasive and all-encompassing Italianisation through language shift, and is thus nowadays moribund, albeit its replacement continues at a slower pace than before thanks to the commitment of those who, in various contexts, promote its revaluation in a process that has been defined by some scholars as \"linguistic re-Sardization\". Still, arrangements for bilingualism exist only on paper and factors such as the intergenerational transmission, which remain essential in the reproduction of the ethnolinguistic group, are severely compromised because of Italianisation; many young speakers, who have been raised in Italian rather than Sardinian, have a command of their ethnic language which does not extend beyond a few stereotyped formulas.\nPhonology.\n\u2020 Not present in Nuorese.\n\u2021 Mainly in Nuorese.\n\u2020 Allophonic except in Campidanese.\nGrammar.\nSome distinctive features typical of Sardinian include:\nNouns.\nNoun Table.\nExceptions:\nVerbs.\nSardinian verbs are divided into three main classes, each distinguished by a different infinitive ending (\"-are\", \"-ere\", or \"-ire\"). The conjugations of regular verbs in the three main dialects (Nuorese, Logudorese, and Campidanese) are as follows:\nSyntax.\nDistinctive syntax features include:\nVarieties.\nHistorically, the Sardinians have always been a small-numbered population scattered across isolated cantons, sharing demographic patterns similar to the neighbouring Corsica; as a result, Sardinian developed a broad spectrum of dialects over the time. Starting from Francesco Cetti's description in the 18th century, Sardinian has been presented as a pluricentric language, being traditionally subdivided into two standardized varieties spoken by roughly half of the entire community: the dialects spoken in North-Central Sardinia, centered on the orthography known as Logudorese (\"su sardu logudoresu\"), and the dialects spoken in South-Central Sardinia, centered on another orthography called Campidanese (\"su sardu campidanesu\").\nAll the Sardinian dialects differ primarily in phonetics, which does not considerably hamper intelligibility; the view of there being a dialectal boundary rigidly separating the two varieties of High Sardinian has been in fact subjected to more recent research, which shows a fluid dialect continuum from the northern to the southern ends of the island. The dualist perception of the Sardinian dialects, rather than pointing to an actual isogloss, is in fact the result of a psychological adherence to the way Sardinia was administratively subvidided into a \"Caput Logudori\" (\"Cabu de Susu\") and a \"Caput Calaris\" (\"Cabu de Jossu\") by the Spanish.\nThe dialects centered on the \"Logudorese Sardinian model\" are generally considered more conservative, with the Nuorese dialect of Sardinian (\"su sardu nugoresu\") being deemed the most conservative of all. They have all retained the classical Latin pronunciation of the stop velars (\"chena\" versus \"cena\", \"supper\"), the front middle vowels (compare Campidanese iotacism, probably from Byzantine Greek) and assimilation of close-mid vowels (\"cane\" versus \"cani\", \"dog\" and \"gatos\" versus \"gatus\", \"cats\"). Labio-velars become plain labials (\"limba\" versus \"l\u00ecngua\", \"language\" and \"abba\" versus \"acua\", \"water\"). \"I\" is prosthesized before consonant clusters beginning in \"s\" (\"iscala\" versus Campidanese Sardinian \"scala\", \"stairway\" and \"iscola\" versus \"scola\", \"school\"). An east-west strip of villages in central Sardinia, mainly in the central part of the Province of Oristano, and central part of the Province of Nuoro, speaks a transitional group of dialects (\"su sardu de mesania\"). Examples include \"is limbas\" (the languages) and \"is abbas\" (the waters). The dialects centered on the Campidanese model, spreading from Cagliari (once the metropolis of the Roman province), show relatively more influences from Carthage, Rome, Constantinople and Late Latin. Examples include \"is fr\u00f9minis\" (the rivers) and \"is domus\" (the houses).\nSome dialects of Sardinian from the extreme ends of the aforementioned continuum have been estimated in another research to have 88% of matches in 110-item wordlist, similarly to the 85\u201388% number of matches between Proven\u00e7al Occitan and some Catalan dialects which by some standards is usually (even though arbitrarily) considered characteristic for two different, albeit very closely related, languages. ISO 639 counts four Sardinian languages (Campidanese, Gallurese, Logudorese and Sassarese), each with its own language code.\nSardinian is the indigenous and historical language of most Sardinian communities. However, Sardinian is not spoken as the native and primary language in a significant number of other ones, roughly amounting to 20% of the Sardinian population; Sassari, the second-largest city on Sardinia and the main center of the northern half of the island, is amongst the latter. The aforementioned Gallurese and Sassarese, despite being often colloquially considered part of Sardinian, are two Corso-Sardinian transitional languages; they are spoken in the northernmost part of Sardinia, although some Sardinian is also understood by the majority of people living therein (73.6% in Gallura and 67.8% in the Sassarese-speaking subregion).\nFrancesco Cetti, responsible for the dialectal partition of the Sardinian language in his early dissertation, went on to deem these Corso-Sardinian varieties spoken in the island \"foreign\" (i.e. not indigenous to Sardinia) and therefore \"not national\" (i.e. non-Sardinian) in that he averred they would be \"an Italian dialect, much more Tuscan in fact than the vast majority of Italy's dialects themselves\".\nThere are also two language islands, the Catalan Algherese-speaking community from the inner city of Alghero (northwest Sardinia) and the Ligurian-speaking towns of Carloforte, in San Pietro Island, and Calasetta in Sant'Antioco island (south-west Sardinia).\nStandardization.\nUntil 2001, there was not a unifying orthographic standard available for all the dialects of Sardinian, neither in the literary nor in the oral domain (one designed for the latter does not exist to this day).\nAfter the Middle Ages, where a certain orthographic uniformity can be observed, the only steps to provide the language with a single standard, called \"illustrious Sardinian\", were undertaken by such writers as Hieronimu Araolla, Ioan Mattheu Garipa and Matteo Madau, who had based their works on the model of medieval Sardinian. However, attempts to formalise and spread this orthography would be hindered by the Iberian and later Savoyard authorities.\nThe dialectally fragmented nature of the language is such that it is popularly contended that Sardinian is divided into two or more groups, which have provided themselves with a series of traditional orthographies already, albeit with many changes over the time. While this belief is not grounded on linguistic considerations, it is however motivated by political and social reasons.\nIn addition to the orthographies commonly referred to as \"Logudorese\" and \"Campidanese\", the Nuorese orthography, the Arborense one and even those restricted to individual towns were also developed, sometimes finding common ground with some general rules, such as those required by the Ozieri Award. It is often the case, however, that speakers who are not commonly taught the Sardinian language and are thus literate only in Italian, for lack of a bilingual education, transcribe their local spelling following rules pertaining to the latter rather than the former.\nHowever, some attempts have been made to introduce a single orthographic form for administrative purposes over the recent decades; said form does not aim to refer to morphology and syntax, which is already fairly homogeneous, but concerns itself primarily with spelling.\nTo allow for an effective implementation of the provisions on the language, as per the regional law no. 26/1997 and the national law no. 482/1999, the Sardinian Autonomous Region arranged for a commission of experts to elaborate a standard capable of overcoming the hurdle posed by the dialectal differences and thereby providing a unified writing system. A first proposal (the LSU: \"Limba Sarda Unificada\", published on 28 February 2001) was tabled, which identified a model language of reference (based on the analysis of local varieties of Sardinian and on the selection of the most representative and compatible models) so as to guarantee the necessary characteristics of certainty, coherence, univocity, and supra-local diffusion. The people appointed for the task were Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, Roberto Bolognesi, Diego Salvatore Corraine, Ignazio Delogu, Antonietta Dettori, Giulio Paulis, Massimo Pittau, Tonino Rubattu, Leonardo Sole, Heinz J\u00fcrgen Wolf, and Matteo Porru acting as the Committee's secretary. This study, although scientifically valid, has never been adopted at an institutional level: critics argued that it was an \"artificial\" system \"imposed\" on Sardinian speakers.\nNevertheless, the LSU would act as a springboard for a subsequent drafting proposal, this time drawn by a new Committee composed of Giulio Angioni, Roberto Bolognesi, Manlio Brigaglia, Michel Contini, Diego Corraine, Giovanni Lupinu, Anna Oppo, Giulio Paulis, Maria Teresa Pinna Catte and Mario Puddu. The new project continued to be worked on, going by the name of LSC (\"Limba Sarda Comuna\"). The new experimental standard proposal, published in 2006, was characterised by taking the \"mesania\" (transitional) varieties as reference, and welcoming elements of the spoken language so as to be perceived as a more \"natural\" mediation; it also ensured that the common orthography would be provided with the characteristics of over-dialectality and supra-municipality, while being open to integrating the phonetic peculiarities of the local variants. Despite this, there was some criticism for this norm as well, both by those who proposed amendments to improve it, and by those who preferred to insist with the idea of dividing Sardinian into two macro-variants with their own separate orthographies.\nThe Sardinian Regional Government, with the resolution of the Regional Council n. 16/14 of 18 April 2006 \"Limba Sarda Comuna. Adoption of the reference standards of an experimental nature for the written language output of the Regional Administration\", has experimentally adopted the LSC as the official orthography for the acts and documents issued by the Region of Sardinia (even if, as per Article 8 of the national Law no. 482/99, only the text written in Italian has legal value), giving citizens the right to write to the Public Administration in their own variety and establishing the regional language desk \"Ufitziu de sa Limba Sarda\". The resolution does not aim to impose the guide and further notes that it is \"open to integrations\" and that \"all solutions are of equal linguistic value\".\nIn the following years, the Region has abided by the LSC standard in the translation of many documents and resolutions and in many other areas. In addition, the LSC standard has been adopted on a voluntary basis by many other institutions, schools and media, often in a complementary manner with orthographic norms closer to the local spelling. Regarding these uses, a percentage estimate was made, considering only the projects financed or co-financed by the Region for the diffusion of the Sardinian language in the municipal and supra-municipal language offices, for the teaching in schools and the media from 2007 to 2013.\nThe monitoring, by the Sardinian Language and Culture Service of the Department of Public Education, was published on the website of the Sardinian Autonomous Region in April 2014. Regarding the school projects financed in 2013, for example, it appears that there was a clear preference, in schools, for the use of the LSC orthographic standard together with a local spelling (51%), compared to the exclusive use of the LSC (11%) or the exclusive use of a local spelling (33%).\nOn the other hand, regarding the editorial projects in Sardinian language in the regional media, financed by the Region in 2012, we find a greater presence of the LSC (which could derive from a reward of 2 points in the formation of the rankings to take funding, a reward that was not present in the notice for schools). According to those data, it appears that 35% of textual production in media projects was in LSC, 35% in LSC and in local spellings and 25% in local spellings only.\nThe local language offices, co-financed by the Regional Government, in 2012 used LSC in 50% of their writing, LSC together with local spelling for 9% and local spellings for 41%.\nA recent research on the use of the LSC orthography in schools, carried out in the municipality of Orosei, showed that the students of the local middle school had no problem using that standard despite the fact that the Sardinian they spoke was partly different. No pupil rejected it or considered it \"artificial\", a thing that proved its validity as a didactic tool. The results were first presented in 2016 and published in an article in 2021.\nSurnames, given names, and toponyms.\nFrom the Sardinian language stem both the historical , which the natives used to confer on each other until contemporary times, as well as most of the traditional surnames still common on the island. Sardinian place names have a very ancient history and, in some cases, have originated a significant debate about their origins.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27036", "revid": "28708516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27036", "title": "Stop motion", "text": "Animation technique\nStop motion (also known as stop frame animation or object animation) is an animated filmmaking and special effects technique in which objects are physically manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames so that they will appear to exhibit independent motion or change when the series of frames is played back. Any kind of object can thus be animated, but puppets with movable joints (puppet animation) or clay figures (claymation) are most commonly used. Puppets, models or clay figures built around an armature are used in model animation. Stop motion with live actors is often referred to as pixilation. Stop motion of flat materials such as paper, fabrics or photographs is usually called cutout animation.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"stop motion\", relating to the animation technique, is often spelled with a hyphen as \"stop-motion\"\u2014either standalone or as a compound modifier. Both orthographic variants, with and without the hyphen, are correct, but the hyphenated one has a second meaning that is unrelated to animation or cinema: \"a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong\".\nHistory.\nThe use of animated objects in film has been present since the early days of cinema.\n1849 to 1895: Before film.\nBefore the advent of chronophotography in 1878, a small number of photograph series depicted subjects in successive positions. These can now be regarded as a form of stop motion or pixilation, although very few results were meant to be animated. Until celluloid film base was established in 1888 and set the standard for the moving image, animation could only be presented via mechanisms such as the zoetrope.\nIn 1849, Joseph Plateau published a note about improvements for his Fantascope (a.k.a. ph\u00e9nakisticope). A new translucent variation had improved picture quality and could be viewed with both eyes, by several people at the same time. Plateau stated that the illusion could be advanced even further with an idea communicated to him by Charles Wheatstone: a combination of the fantascope and Wheatstone's stereoscope. Plateau thought the construction of a sequential set of stereoscopic image pairs would be the more difficult part of the plan than adapting two copies of his improved fantascope to be fitted with a stereoscope. Wheatstone had suggested using photographs on paper of a solid object, for instance a statuette. Plateau concluded that for this purpose 16 plaster models could be made with 16 regular modifications. He believed such a project would take much time and careful effort, but would be quite worth it because of the expected marvelous results. The plan was never executed, possibly because Plateau was almost completely blind by this time.\nIn 1852, Jules Duboscq patented a \"St\u00e9r\u00e9oscope-fantascope ou B\u00efoscope\" (or abbreviated as st\u00e9r\u00e9ofantascope) stroboscopic disc. The only known extant disc contains stereoscopic photograph pairs of different phases of the motion of a machine. Due to the long exposure times necessary to capture an image with the photographic emulsions of the period, the sequence could not be recorded live and must have been assembled from separate photographs of the various positions of the machinery.\nIn 1855, Johann Nepomuk Czermak published an article about his Stereophoroskop and other experiments aimed at stereoscopic moving images. He mentioned a method of sticking needles in a stroboscopic disc so that it looked like one needle was being pushed in and out of the cardboard when animated. He realized that this method provided basically endless possibilities to make different 3D animations. He then introduced two methods to animate stereoscopic pairs of images, one was basically a stereo viewer using two stroboscopic discs and the other was more or less similar to the later zoetrope. Czermak explained how suitable stereoscopic photographs could be made by recording a series of models, for instance to animate a growing pyramid.\nOn 27 February 1860, Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices (much like the later zoetrope). Desvignes' \"Mimoscope\", received an Honourable Mention \"for ingenuity of construction\" at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Desvignes \"employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success\".\nIn 1874, Jules Janssen made several practice discs for the recording of the passage of Venus with his series \"Passage de V\u00e9nus\" with his photographic revolver. He used a model of the planet and a light source standing in for the sun. While actual recordings of the passage of Venus have not been located, some practice discs survived and the images of one were turned into a short animated film decades after the development of cinematography.\nIn 1887, \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey created a large zoetrope with a series of plaster models based on his chronophotographs of birds in flight.\n1895\u20131928: The silent film era.\nIt is estimated that 80 to 90 percent of all silent films are lost. Extant contemporary movie catalogs, reviews and other documentation can provide some details on lost films, but this kind of written documentation is also incomplete and often insufficient to properly date all extant films or even identify them if original titles are missing. Whether any scene was created with stop-motion techniques often remains unclear in extant descriptions. The principles of animation and other special effects were mostly kept a secret, not only to prevent use of such techniques by competitors, but also to keep audiences interested in the mystery of the magic tricks.\nStop motion is closely related to the stop trick, in which the camera is temporarily stopped during the recording of a scene to create a change before filming is continued (or for which the cause of the change is edited out of the film). In the resulting film, the change will be sudden and a logical cause of the change will be mysteriously absent or replaced with a fake cause that is suggested in the scene. The oldest known example is used for the beheading in Edison Manufacturing Company's 1895 film \"The Execution of Mary Stuart\". The technique of stop motion can be interpreted as repeatedly applying the stop trick. In 1917, clay animation pioneer Helena Smith-Dayton referred to the principle behind her work as \"stop action\", a synonym of \"stop motion\".\nFrench trick film pioneer Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s claimed to have invented the stop-trick and popularized it by using it in many of his short films. He reportedly used stop-motion animation in 1899 to produce moving letterforms.\nSegundo de Chom\u00f3n.\nSpanish filmmaker Segundo de Chom\u00f3n (1871\u20131929) made many trick films in France for Path\u00e9. He has often been compared to Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s as he also made many fantasy films with stop tricks and other illusions (helped by his wife, Julienne Mathieu).\n\"Le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bob\" (April 1906) features stop motion with dolls and objects to represent a fictional automated theatre owned by Bob, played by a live-action child actor. The film used to be credited to Chom\u00f3n, but he didn't come to Paris (to work for Path\u00e9) until later. Direction and special effects have been attributed to Gaston Velle.\nDe Chom\u00f3n's \"La maison ensorcel\u00e9e\" (December 1907, or 1906) features stop-motion-animated cutlery and food, among other special effects that depict paranormal activity.\nDe Chom\u00f3n's \"Sculpteur moderne\" was released on 31 January 1908 and features heaps of clay molding itself into detailed sculptures that are capable of minor movements. The final sculpture depicts an old woman and walks around before it's picked up, squashed and molded back into a sitting old lady.\nEdwin S. Porter and Wallace McCutcheon Sr..\nAmerican film pioneer Edwin S. Porter filmed a single-shot \"lightning sculpting\" film with a baker molding faces from a patch of dough in \"Fun in a Bakery Shop\" (1902), considered as foreshadowing of clay animation.\nIn 1905, Porter showed animated letters and very simple cutout animation of two hands in the intertitles in \"How Jones Lost His Roll\".\nPorter experimented with a small bit of crude stop-motion animation in his trick film \"Dream of a Rarebit Fiend\" (1906).\n\"The \"Teddy\" Bears\" (2 March 1907), made in collaboration with Wallace McCutcheon Sr., mainly shows people in bear costumes, but the short film also features a short stop motion segment with small teddy bears.\nOn 15 February 1908, Porter released the trick film \"A Sculptor's Welsh Rabbit Dream\" that featured clay molding itself into three complete busts. No copy of the film has yet been located. It was soon followed by the similar extant film \"The Sculptor's Nightmare\" (6 May 1908) by Wallace McCutcheon Sr.\nJ. Stuart Blackton.\nJ. Stuart Blackton's \"The Haunted Hotel\" (23 February 1907) featured a combination of live-action with practical special effects and stop-motion animation of several objects, a puppet and a model of the haunted hotel. It was the first stop-motion film to receive wide scale appreciation. Especially a large close-up view of a table being set by itself baffled viewers; there were no visible wires or other noticeable well-known tricks. This inspired other filmmakers, including French animator \u00c9mile Cohl and Segundo de Chom\u00f3n. De Chom\u00f3n would release the similar \"The House of Ghosts\" (\"La maison ensorcel\u00e9e\") and \"H\u00f4tel \u00e9lectrique\" in 1908, with the latter also containing some very early pixilation.\n\"The Humpty Dumpty Circus\" (1908, considered lost) by Blackton and his British-American Vitagraph partner Albert E. Smith showed an animated performance of figures from a popular wooden toy set. Smith would later claim that this was \"the first stop motion picture in America\". The inspiration would have come from seeing how puffs of smoke behaved in the interrupted recordings for a stop trick film they were making. Smith would have suggested to get a patent for the technique, but Blackton thought it wasn't that important. Smith's recollections are not considered to be very reliable.\n\u00c9mile Cohl.\nBlackton's \"The Haunted Hotel\" made a big impression in Paris, where it was released as \"L'h\u00f4tel hant\u00e9: fantasmagorie \u00e9pouvantable\". When Gaumont bought a copy to further distribute the film, it was carefully studied by some of their filmmakers to find out how it was made. Reportedly it was newcomer \u00c9mile Cohl who unraveled the mystery. Not long after, Cohl released his first film, \"Japon de fantaisie\" (June 1907), featuring his own imaginative use of the stop motion technique.\nIt was followed by the revolutionary hand-drawn \"Fantasmagorie\" (17 August 1908) and many more animated films by Cohl.\nOther notable stop-motion films by Cohl include \"Les allumettes anim\u00e9es (Animated Matches)\" (1908), and \"Mobilier fid\u00e8le\" (1910, in collaboration with Romeo Bosetti). \"Mobilier fid\u00e8le\" is often confused with Bosetti's object animation tour de force \"Le garde-meubles automatique (The Automatic Moving Company)\" (1912). Both films feature furniture moving by itself.\nArthur Melbourne-Cooper.\nOf the more than 300 short films produced between 1896 and 1915 by British film pioneer Arthur Melbourne-Cooper, an estimated 36 contained forms of animation. Based on later reports by Melbourne-Cooper and by his daughter Audrey Wadowska, some believe that Cooper's \"Matches: an Appeal\" was produced in 1899 and therefore the first stop-motion animation. The extant black-and-white film shows a matchstick figure writing an appeal to donate a Guinea for which Bryant &amp; May would supply soldiers with sufficient matches. No archival records are known that could prove that the film was indeed created in 1899 during the beginning of the Second Boer War. Others place it at 1914, during the beginning of World War I. Cooper created more \"Animated Matches\" scenes in the same setting. These are believed to also have been produced in 1899, while a release date of 1908 has also been given. The 1908 \"Animated Matches\" film by \u00c9mile Cohl may have caused more confusion about the release dates of Cooper's matchstick animations. It also raises the question whether Cohl may have been inspired by Melbourne-Cooper or vice versa.\nMelbourne-Cooper's lost films \"Dolly\u2019s Toys\" (1901) and \"The Enchanted Toymaker\" (1904) may have included stop-motion animation. \"Dreams of Toyland\" (1908) features a scene with many animated toys that lasts approximately three and a half minutes.\nAlexander Shiryaev.\nAs a means to plan his performances, ballet dancer and choreographer Alexander Shiryaev started making approximately 20- to 25-centimeter-tall puppets out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 on poseable wire frames. He then sketched all the sequential movements on paper. When he arranged these vertically on a long strip, it was possible to give a presentation of the complete dance with a home cinema projector. Later on, he bought a movie camera and between 1906 and 1909 he made many short films, including puppet animations. As a dancer and choreographer, Shiryaev had a special talent to create motion in his animated films. According to animator Peter Lord his work was decades ahead of its time. Part of Shiryaev's animation work is featured in Viktor Bocharov's documentary \"Alexander Shiryaev: A Belated Premiere\" (2003).\nLadislas Starevich (Russian period).\nPolish-Russian Ladislas Starevich (1882\u20131965), started his film career around 1909 in Kaunas filming live insects. He wanted to document rutting stag beetles, but the creatures wouldn't cooperate or would even die under the bright lamps needed for filming. He solved the problem by using wire for the limbs of dried beetles and then animating them in stop-motion. The resulting short film, presumably 1 minute long, was probably titled by the Latin name for the species: \"Lucanus Cervus\" (\u0416\u0443\u043a-\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c, 1910, considered lost). \nAfter moving to Moscow, Starevich continued animating dead insects, but now as characters in imaginative stories with much dramatic complexity. He garnered much attention and international acclaim with these short films, including the 10-minute \"The Beautiful Leukanida\" (\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041b\u044e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043c\u0438) (March 1912), the two-minute \"Happy Scenes from Animal Life\" (\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445), the 12-minute \"The Cameraman's Revenge\" (\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041b\u044e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043c\u0438, October 1912) and the 5-minute \"The Grasshopper and the Ant\" (\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0439, 1913). Reportedly many viewers were impressed with how much could be achieved with trained insects, or at least wondered what tricks could have been used, since few people were familiar with the secrets of stop-motion animation. \"The Insects' Christmas\" (\u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0430, 1913) featured other animated puppets, including Father Christmas and a frog. Starevich made several other stop-motion films in the next two years, but mainly went on to direct live-action short and feature films before he fled from Russia in 1918.\nWillis O'Brien's early films.\nWillis O' Brien's first stop-motion film was \"\" (1915). Apart from the titular dinosaur and \"missing link\" ape, it featured several cavemen and an ostrich-like \"desert quail\", all relatively lifelike models made with clay. This led to a series of short animated comedies with a prehistoric theme for Edison Company, including \"Prehistoric Poultry\" (1916), \"R.F.D. 10,000 B.C.\" (1917), \"The Birth of a Flivver\" (1917) and \"Curious Pets of Our Ancestors\" (1917). O'Brien was then hired by producer Herbert M. Dawley to direct, create effects, co-write and co-star with him for \"The Ghost of Slumber Mountain\" (1918). The collaborative film combined live-action with animated dinosaur models in a 45-minute film, but after the premiere it was cut down to approximately 12 minutes. Dawley did not give O'Brien credits for the visual effects, and instead claimed the animation process as his own invention and even applied for patents. O'Brien's stop motion work was recognized as a technique to create lifelike creatures for adventure films. O' Brien further pioneered the technique with animated dinosaur sequences for the live-action feature \"The Lost World\" (1925).\nHelena Smith Dayton.\nNew York artist Helena Smith Dayton, possibly the first female animator, had much success with her \"Caricatypes\" clay statuettes before she began experimenting with clay animation. Some of her first resulting short films were screened on 25 March 1917. She released an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" approximately half a year later. Although the films and her technique received much attention of the press, it seems she did not continue making films after she returned to New York from managing a YMCA in Paris around 1918. None of her films have yet surfaced, but the extant magazine articles have provided several stills and approximately 20 poorly printed frames from two film strips.\nStarewicz in Paris.\nBy 1920 Starewicz had settled in Paris, and started making new stop-motion films. \"Dans les Griffes de L'araign\u00e9e\" (finished 1920, released 1924) featured detailed hand-made insect puppets that could convey facial expressions with moving lips and eyelids.\nOther silent stop motion.\nOne of the earliest clay animation films was \"Modelling Extraordinary\", which impressed audiences in 1912.\nThe early Italian feature film \"Cabiria\" (1914) featured some stop motion techniques.\n1930s and 1940s.\nStarewicz finished the first feature stop-motion film \"Le Roman de Renard (The Tale of the Fox)\" in 1930, but problems with its soundtrack delayed its release. In 1937 it was released with a German soundtrack and in 1941 with its French soundtrack.\nHungarian-American filmmaker George Pal developed his own stop motion technique of replacing wooden dolls (or parts of them) with similar figures displaying changed poses and/or expressions. He called it Pal-Doll and used it for his Puppetoons films since 1932. The particular replacement animation method itself also became better known as puppetoon. In Europe he mainly worked on promotional films for companies such as Philips. Later Pal gained much success in Hollywood with a string of Academy Award for Best Animated Short Films, including \"Rhythm in the Ranks\" (1941), \"Tulips Shall Grow\" (1942), \"Jasper and the Haunted House\" (1942), the Dr. Seuss penned \"The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins\" (1943) and \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\" (1944), \"Jasper and the Beanstalk\" (1945), \"John Henry and the Inky-Poo\" (1946), \"Jasper in a Jam\" (1946), and \"Tubby the Tuba\" (1947). Many of his puppetoon films were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nWillis O' Brien's expressive and emotionally convincing animation of the big ape in \"King Kong\" (1933) is widely regarded as a milestone in stop-motion animation and a highlight of Hollywood cinema in general.\n\"In 1935, The New Gulliver\", a Soviet stop motion-animated cartoon, made an extensive use of puppet animation, running almost all the way through the film (it begins and ends with short live-action sequences). The film was released to widespread acclaim and earned director Aleksandr Ptushko a special prize at the International Cinema Festival in Milan.\nA 1940 promotional film for Autolite, an automotive parts supplier, featured stop-motion animation of its products marching past Autolite factories to the tune of Franz Schubert's \"Military March\". An abbreviated version of this sequence was later used in television ads for Autolite, especially those on the 1950s CBS program \"Suspense\", which Autolite sponsored.\nThe first British animated feature was the stop motion instruction film \"Handling Ships\" (1945) by Halas and Batchelor for the British Admiralty. It was not meant for general cinemas, but did become part of the official selection of the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe first Belgian animated feature was an adaptation of the Tintin comic \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" (1947) with animated puppets.\nThe first Czech animated feature was the package film \"The Czech Year\" (1947) with animated puppets by Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka. The film won several awards at the Venice Film Festival and other international festivals. Trnka would make several more award-winning stop motion features including \"The Emperor's Nightingale\" (1949), \"Prince Bayaya\" (1950), \"Old Czech Legends\" (1953), or \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1959). He also directed many short films and experimented with other forms of animation.\n1950s.\nRay Harryhausen learned under O'Brien on the film \"Mighty Joe Young\" (1949). Harryhausen would go on to create many memorable stop motion effects for a string of successful fantasy films over the next three decades. These included \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953), \"It Came from Beneath the Sea\" (1955), \"Jason and the Argonauts\" (1963), \"The Golden Voyage of Sinbad\" (1973), and \"Clash of the Titans\" (1981).\nIt wasn't until 1954 before a feature animated film with a technique other than cel animation was produced in the US. The first was the stop motion adaptation of 19th century composer Engelbert Humperdinck's opera \"H\u00e4nsel und Gretel\" as \"\".\nIn 1955, Karel Zeman made his first feature film \"Journey to the Beginning of Time\" inspired by Jules Verne, featuring stop-motion animation of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures.\nArt Clokey started his adventures in clay with a freeform clay short film called \"Gumbasia\" (1955), which shortly thereafter propelled him into the production of his more structured TV series \"Gumby\" (1955\u20131989), with the iconic titular character. In partnership with the United Lutheran Church in America, he also produced \"Davey and Goliath\" (1960\u20132004). The theatrical feature \"\" (1992, released in 1995) was a box-office bomb.\nIn Hungary, Hungarian\u2013French puppet designer and animated film director, \u00c9va Balla\u2011Falus, began her series of 6 animated films with various collaborators (with the sculptor Zolt\u00e1n Olcsai-Kiss, \"Megy a juh\u00e1sz szam\u00e1ron\" in 1948, and \"Vitamin ABC\" in 1950, \"Kacsa\" in 1951, \"Balk\u00e9z T\u00f3bi\u00e1s\" in 1953, \"Mese a mihaszna k\u00f6cs\u00f6gr\u0151l\" in 1956, and \"A diderg\u0151 kir\u00e1ly\" in 1957.\nOn 22 November 1959, the first episode of \"Unser Sandm\u00e4nchen (Our Little Sandman)\" was broadcast on DFF (East German television). The 10-minute daily bedtime show for young children features the title character as an animated puppet, and other puppets in different segments. A very similar \"Sandm\u00e4nchen\" series, possibly conceived earlier, ran on West German television from 1 December 1959 until the German reunification in 1989. The East German show was continued on other German networks when DFF ended in 1991, and is one of the longest running animated series in the world. The theatrical feature \"Das Sandm\u00e4nnchen \u2013 Abenteuer im Traumland\" (2010) was fully animated with stop-motion puppets.\n1960s and 1970s.\nJapanese puppet animator Tadahito Mochinaga started out as assistant animator in short anime (propaganda) films \"Arichan\" (1941) and \"Momotar\u014d no Umiwashi\" (1943). He fled to Manchukuo during the war and stayed in China afterwards. Due to the scarcity of paint and film stock shortly after the war, Mochinaga decided to work with puppets and stop motion. His work helped popularize puppet animation in China, before he returned to Japan around 1953 where he continued working as animation director. In the 1960s, Mochinaga supervised the \"Animagic\" puppet animation for productions by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass' Videocraft International, Ltd. (later called Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc.) and Dentsu, starting with the syndicated television series \"The New Adventures of Pinocchio\" (1960-1961). The Christmas TV special \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" has been telecasted annually since 1964 and has become one of the most beloved holiday specials in the United States. They made three theatrical feature films \"Willy McBean and His Magic Machine\" (1965), \"The Daydreamer\" (1966, stop motion / live-action) and \"Mad Monster Party?\" (1966, released in 1967), and the television special \"Ballad of Smokey the Bear\" (1966) before the collaboration ended. Rankin/Bass worked with other animators for more TV specials, with titles such as \"The Little Drummer Boy\" (1968), \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" (1970) and \"Here Comes Peter Cottontail\" (1971).\nBritish television has shown many stop motion series for young children since the 1960s. An early example is \"Snip and Snap\" (1960-1961) by John Halas in collaboration with Danish paper sculptor Thok S\u00f8ndergaard (Thoki Yenn), featuring dog Snap, cut from a sheet of paper by pair of scissors Snip.\nApart from their cutout animation series, British studio Smallfilms (Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate) produced several stop motion series with puppets, beginning with \"Pingwings\" (1961-1965) featuring penguin-like birds knitted by Peter's wife Joan and filmed on their farm (where most of their productions were filmed in an unused barn). It was followed by \"Pogles' Wood\" (1965-1967), \"Clangers\" (1969-1972, 1974, revived in 2015), \"Bagpuss\" (1974) and \"\" (1984).\nCzech surrealist filmmaker Jan \u0160vankmajer's released his short artistic films since 1964, which usually contain much experimental stop motion. He started to gain much international recognition in the 1980s. Since 1988 he has mostly been directing feature films which feature much more live action than stop motion. These include \"Alice\", an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", and \"Faust\", a rendition of the legend of the German scholar. \u0160vankmajer's work has been highly influential on other artists, such as Terry Gilliam and the Quay brothers (although the latter claim to have only discovered \u0160vankmajer's films after having developed their own similar style).\nFrench animator Serge Danot created \"The Magic Roundabout\" (1965) which played for many years on the BBC.\nPolish studio Se-ma-for produced popular TV series with animated puppets in adaptations of \"Colargol\" (\"Barnaby the Bear\" in the UK, \"Jeremy\" in Canada) (1967-1974) and \"The Moomins\" (1977-1982).\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, independent clay animator Eliot Noyes Jr. refined the technique of \"free-form\" clay animation with his Oscar-nominated 1965 film \"Clay (or the Origin of Species)\". Noyes also used stop motion to animate sand lying on glass for his musical animated film \"Sandman\" (1975).\nItalian director Francesco Misseri created the clay animation TV series \"Mio Mao\" (1970-1976, 2002\u20132007), \"The Red and the Blue\" (\"Il Rosso e il Blu\", 1976), and a TV series with an animated origami duck \"Quaq Quao\" (1978-1979).\nThe British artists Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall (Cosgrove Hall Films) produced two stop-motion animated adaptions of Enid Blyton's \"Noddy\" book series, including the original series of the same name (1975\u20131982) and \"Noddy's Toyland Adventures\" (1992\u20132001), a full-length film \"The Wind in the Willows\" (1983) and later a multi-season TV series, both based on Kenneth Grahame's classic children's book of the same title. They also produced a documentary of their production techniques, \"Making Frog and Toad\".\nIn 1975, filmmaker and clay animation experimenter Will Vinton joined with sculptor Bob Gardiner to create an experimental film called \"Closed Mondays\" which became the first stop-motion film to win an Oscar. Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including \"The Great Cognito\", \"The Creation\", and \"Rip Van Winkle\" which were each nominated for Academy Awards. In 1977, Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed \"claymation\"; he titled the documentary \"Claymation\". Soon after this documentary, the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team's work from others who had been, or were beginning to do, \"clay animation\". While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion, it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment, Inc. Twenty clay-animation episodes featuring the clown Mr. Bill were a feature of \"Saturday Night Live\", starting from a first appearance in February 1976.\nAt very much the same time in the UK, Peter Lord and David Sproxton formed Aardman Animations that would produce many commercials, TV series, short films and eventually also feature films. In 1976 they created the character Morph who appeared as an animated side-kick to the TV presenter Tony Hart on his BBC TV programme Take Hart. The five-inch-high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called Plasticine. In 1977 they started on a series of animated films, again using modelling clay, but this time made for a more adult audience. The soundtrack for \"Down and Out\" was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue. A second film, also for the BBC followed in 1978. A TV series The Amazing Adventures of Morph was aired in 1980.\nSand-coated puppet animation was used in the Oscar-winning 1977 film \"The Sand Castle\", produced by Dutch-Canadian animator Co Hoedeman. Hoedeman was one of dozens of animators sheltered by the National Film Board of Canada, a Canadian government film arts agency that had supported animators for decades. A pioneer of refined multiple stop-motion films under the NFB banner was Norman McLaren, who brought in many other animators to create their own creatively controlled films. Notable among these are the pinscreen animation films of Jacques Drouin, made with the original pinscreen donated by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker.\nCzech filmmakers Lubom\u00edr Bene\u0161 and Vladim\u00edr Jir\u00e1nek debuted their animated puppet characters \"Pat &amp; Mat\", two inventive but clumsy neighbors, in the 7-minute short \"Ku\u0165\u00e1ci\" in 1976. Since 1979, over 100 episodes have been broadcast irregularly. Since 2014, new episodes were presented in theatrically released package films. The series became very popular in several countries, especially in The Netherlands, the only country where the characters are voiced.\nOne of the main British animation teams, John Hardwick and Bob Bura, were the main animators in many early British TV shows, and are famous for their work on the \"Trumptonshire\" trilogy (\"Camberwick Green\", \"Trumpton\" and \"Chigley\"). Their company was named Stop Motion Limited, the term having been their trademark until it became generic.\nDisney experimented with several stop-motion techniques by hiring independent animator-director Mike Jittlov to make the first stop-motion animation of Mickey Mouse toys ever produced, in a short sequence called \"Mouse Mania\", part of a TV special, \"Mickey's 50\", which commemorated Mickey's 50th anniversary in 1978. Jittlov again produced some impressive multi-technique stop-motion animation a year later for a 1979 Disney special promoting their release of the feature film \"The Black Hole\". Titled \"Major Effects\", Jittlov's work stood out as the best part of the special. Jittlov released his footage the following year to 16mm film collectors as a short film titled \"The Wizard of Speed and Time\", along with four of his other short multi-technique animated films, most of which eventually evolved into his own feature-length film of the same title. Effectively demonstrating almost all animation techniques, as well as how he produced them, the film was released to theaters in 1987 and to video in 1989.\n1980s.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Industrial Light &amp; Magic often used stop-motion model animation in such films as the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy: the holochess sequence in \"Star Wars\", the Tauntauns and AT-AT walkers in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", and the AT-ST walkers in \"Return of the Jedi\" were all filmed using stop-motion animation, with the latter two films utilising go motion: an invention from renowned visual effects veteran Phil Tippett. The many shots including the ghosts in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" , the Dragon in \"Dragonslayer\", and the first two feature films in the \"RoboCop\" series use Tippett's go motion.\nIn the UK, Aardman Animations continued to grow. Channel 4 funded a new series of clay animated films, \"Conversation Pieces\", using recorded soundtracks of real people talking. A further series in 1986, called \"Lip Sync\", premiered the work of Richard Goleszowski (\"Ident\"), Barry Purves (\"Next\"), and Nick Park (\"Creature Comforts\"), as well as further films by Sproxton and Lord. \"Creature Comforts\" won the Oscar for Best Animated Short in 1990. In 1986, they also produced a notable music video for \"Sledgehammer\", a song by Peter Gabriel.\nIn 1980, Marc Paul Chinoy directed the 1st feature-length clay animated film, based on the famous \"Pogo\" comic strip. Titled \"I go Pogo\". It was aired a few times on American cable channels but has yet to be commercially released. Primarily clay, some characters required armatures, and walk cycles used pre-sculpted hard bases legs.\nStop motion was also used for some shots of the final sequence of the first \"Terminator\" movie, also for the scenes of the small alien ships in Spielberg's \"Batteries Not Included\" in 1987, animated by David W. Allen. Allen's stop motion work can also be seen in such feature films as \"The Crater Lake Monster\" (1977), \"Q - The Winged Serpent\" (1982), \"The Gate\" (1987) and \"Freaked\" (1993). Allen's King Kong Volkswagen commercial from the 1970s is now legendary among model animation enthusiasts.\nIn 1985, Will Vinton and his team released an ambitious feature film in stop motion called \"The Adventures Of Mark Twain\" based on the life and works of the famous American author. While the film may have been a little sophisticated for young audiences at the time, it got rave reviews from critics and adults in general. Vinton's team also created the Nomes and the Nome King for Disney's \"Return to Oz\" feature, for which they received an Academy Award Nomination for Special Visual Effects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Will Vinton became very well known for his commercial work as well with stop motion campaigns including The California Raisins and The Noid.\nJi\u0159\u00ed Barta released his award-winning fantasy film The Pied Piper (1986).\nFrom 1986 to 1991, Churchill Films produced \"The Mouse and the Motorcycle\", \"Runaway Ralph\", and \"Ralph S. Mouse\" for ABC television. The shows featured stop-motion characters combined with live action, based on the books of Beverly Cleary. John Clark Matthews was the animation director, with Justin Kohn, Joel Fletcher, and Gail Van Der Merwe providing character animation. The company also produced other films based on children's books.\nFrom 1986 to 2000, over 150 five-minute episodes of \"Pingu\", a Swiss children's comedy, were produced by Trickfilmstudio.\nAardman Animations' Nick Park became very successful with his short claymation \"Creature Comforts\" in 1989, which had talking animals voicing vox pop interviews. Park then used the same format to produce a series of commercials between 1990 and 1992. The commercials have been credited as having introduced a more \"caring\" way of advertising in the UK. Richard Goleszowski later directed two 13-episode \"Creature Comforts\" TV series (2003, 2005\u20132006) and a Christmas special (2005). \nAlso in 1989, Park introduced his very popular clay characters Wallace and Gromit in \"A Grand Day Out\". Three more short films and two feature films, and multiple spin-offs would follow. Among many other awards, Park won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for the feature-length outing \"\". Park also worked on the \"Chicken Run\" movie, which was another film from Aardman Animations.\n1990s.\nIn 1992, Trey Parker and Matt Stone made \"The Spirit of Christmas\", a short cutout animated student film made with construction paper. In 1995 they made a second short with the same titled, commissioned as a Christmas greeting by Fox Broadcasting Company executive Brian Graden. The concepts and characters were further developed into the TV hit series \"South Park\" (since 1997). Except for the pilot, all animation has been created on computers in the same style.\n\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" (1993), directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton, was one of the more widely released stop-motion features and became the highest grossing stop-motion animated movie of its time, grossing over $50 million domestic. Henry Selick also went on to direct \"James and the Giant Peach\" and \"Coraline\", and Tim Burton went on to direct \"Corpse Bride\" and \"Frankenweenie\".\nThe stop-motion feature \"The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb\" was released in 1993.\nIn November 1998, the first episode of Bob the Builder released on BBC. Bob the Builder was a popular British stop-motion television series created by Keith Chapman &amp; produced and owned by HIT Entertainment.\nIn 1999, Will Vinton launched the first US prime-time stop-motion television series called \"The PJs\", co-created by actor-comedian Eddie Murphy. The Emmy-winning sitcom aired on Fox for two seasons, then moved to the WB for an additional season. Vinton launched another series, \"Gary &amp; Mike\", for UPN in 2001.\nIn 1999, Tsuneo G\u014dda directed 30-second sketches of the character Domo. The shorts, animated by stop-motion studio Dwarf, are currently still produced in Japan and have received universal critical acclaim from fans and critics. G\u014dda also directed the stop-motion movie series \"Komaneko\" in 2004.\n21st century.\nThe BBC commissioned thirteen episodes of stop frame animated \"Summerton Mill\" in 2004 as inserts into their flagship pre-school program, \"Tikkabilla\". Created and produced by Pete Bryden and Ed Cookson, the series was then given its own slot on BBC1 and BBC2 and has been broadcast extensively around the world.\nOther notable stop-motion feature films released since 2000 include \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (2009), \"$9.99\" (2009), \"Hell and Back\" (2015), \"Anomalisa\" (2015), \"Isle of Dogs \" (2018), \"Alien Xmas\" (2020), Henry Selick's \"Wendell &amp; Wild\" (2022) and \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" (2022).\nIn 2003, the pilot film for the series \"Curucuru and Friends\", produced by Korean studio Ffango Entertoyment is greenlighted into a children's animated series in 2004 after an approval with the Gyeonggi Digital Contents Agency. It was aired in KBS1 on November 24, 2006, and won the 13th Korean Animation Awards in 2007 for Best Animation. Ffango Entertoyment also worked with Frontier Works in Japan to produce the 2010 film remake of \"Cheburashka\".\nSince 2005, \"Robot Chicken\" has mostly utilized stop-motion animation, using custom made action figures and other toys as principal characters.\nSince 2009, Laika, the stop motion successor to Will Vinton Studios, has released six feature films, which have collectively grossed over $400 million: \"Coraline\" (2009), \"ParaNorman\" (2012), \"The Boxtrolls\" (2014), \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" (2016), \"Missing Link\" (2019) and \"Wildwood\" (2026).\nDirectors like Tim Burton and Wes Anderson are still using stop-motion animation in some of their live action films.\nIn 2019 and 2020, cinematographer Jeffrey Gardner won back-to-back Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for Outstanding Cinematography on the stop-motion series \"Tumble Leaf\" (Amazon Studios), marking one of the rare instances where a director of photography has been recognized for work in stop-motion television. While stop-motion histories often highlight animators and directors, Gardner\u2019s awards underscore the vital role of cinematography in the medium, where lighting, lenses, and miniature set design create the show\u2019s distinctive visual storytelling.\nIn November 2024, Disney released \"Mickey &amp; Minnie's Christmas Carols\", a series of five stop motion shorts featuring Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy and Pluto.\nVariations of stop motion.\nStereoscopic.\nStop motion has very rarely been shot in stereoscopic 3D throughout film history. The first 3D stop motion short was \"In Tune With Tomorrow\" (also known as \"Motor Rhythm\"), made in 1939 by John Norling. The second stereoscopic stop motion release was \"The Adventures of Sam Space\" in 1955 by Paul Sprunck. The third and latest stop motion short in stereo 3D was \"The Incredible Invasion of the 20,000 Giant Robots from Outer Space\" in 2000 by Elmer Kaan and Alexander Lentjes. This is also the first ever 3D stereoscopic stop motion and CGI short in the history of film. The first all stop-motion 3D feature is \"Coraline\" (2009), based on Neil Gaiman's best-selling novel and directed by Henry Selick. Another recent example is the Nintendo 3DS video software which comes with the option for Stop-Motion videos. This has been released December 8, 2011 as a 3DS system update. Also, the film \"ParaNorman\" is in 3D stop motion.\nGo motion.\nAnother more complicated variation on stop motion is go motion, co-developed by Phil Tippett and first used on the films \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), and the \"RoboCop\" films. Go motion involved programming a computer to move parts of a model slightly during each exposure of each frame of film, combined with traditional hand manipulation of the model in between frames, to produce a more realistic motion blurring effect. Tippett also used the process extensively in his 1984 short film \"Prehistoric Beast\", a 10 minutes long sequence depicting a herbivorous dinosaur (\"Monoclonius\"), being chased by a carnivorous one (\"Tyrannosaurus\"). With new footage \"Prehistoric Beast\" became \"Dinosaur!\" in 1985, a full-length dinosaurs documentary hosted by Christopher Reeve. Those Phil Tippett's go motion tests acted as motion models for his first photo-realistic use of computers to depict dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" in 1993. A low-tech, manual version of this blurring technique was originally pioneered by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Starewicz in the silent era, and was used in his feature film \"The Tale of the Fox\" (1931).\nComparison to computer-generated imagery.\nThe reasons for using stop motion instead of the more advanced computer-generated imagery (CGI) include the appeal of its distinct look and the notion that it accurately displays real-life textures, while CGI texturing can look more artificial and isn't always quite as close to realism. This is appreciated by a number of animation directors, such as Guillermo del Toro, Henry Selick, Tim Burton and Travis Knight.\nGuillermo del Toro aimed to praise the benefits of stop motion in his movie Pinocchio, saying that he wanted \"the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation \u2014 an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting\".\nStop motion in other media.\nMany young people begin their experiments in movie making with stop-motion, thanks to the ease of modern stop-motion software and online video publishing.\nSinger-songwriter Oren Lavie's music video for the song Her Morning Elegance was posted on YouTube on January 19, 2009. The video, directed by Lavie and Yuval and Merav Nathan, uses stop motion and has achieved great success with over 25.4 million views, also earning a 2010 Grammy Award nomination for \"Best Short Form Music Video\".\nStop motion has occasionally been used to create the characters for computer games, as an alternative to CGI. The Virgin Interactive Entertainment Mythos game \"Magic and Mayhem\" (1998) featured creatures built by stop-motion specialist Alan Friswell, who made the miniature figures from modelling clay and latex rubber, over armatures of wire and ball-and-socket joints. The models were then animated one frame at a time, and incorporated into the CGI elements of the game through digital photography.\"ClayFighter\" for the Super NES and \"The Neverhood\" and \"Hylics 2\" for the PC are other examples.\nScientists at IBM used a scanning tunneling microscope to single out and move individual atoms which were used to make characters in \"A Boy and His Atom\". This was the tiniest scale stop-motion video made at that time.\nReplicating the distinct tactile look of traditional stop motion has gained popularity in contemporary media through the use of CGI. This approach can often provide a more cost-effective and accessible means of achieving the stop motion aesthetic. Noteworthy among such endeavors is the work of Blender animator Ian Worthington, exemplified by his 2021 short film \"Captain Yajima\". Another prominent example of this trend includes \"The LEGO Movie\", which uses CGI to replicate the visual style and imperfections of stop motion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
