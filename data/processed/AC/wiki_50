{"id": "25215", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25215", "title": "Quake III Arena", "text": "1999 Video Game\nQuake III Arena is a 1999 first-person shooter game developed by id Software. The third installment of the \"Quake\" series, \"Arena\" differs from previous games by excluding a story-based single-player mode and focusing primarily on multiplayer gameplay. The single-player mode is played against computer-controlled bots. It features music composed by Sonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly founder Bill Leeb.\nNotable features of \"Quake III Arena\" include a minimalist design, very extensively customizable settings such as field of view, texture detail and enemy model; and advanced movement features such as strafe-jumping and rocket-jumping.\nThe game was praised by reviewers who, for the most part, described the gameplay as fun and engaging. Many liked the crisp graphics and focus on multiplayer. \"Quake III Arena\", often being considered one of the greatest video games ever made, has also been used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments such as QuakeCon, Cyberathlete Professional League, DreamHack, and the Electronic Sports World Cup.\nGameplay.\nUnlike its predecessors, \"Quake III Arena\" does not have a single-player campaign. Instead, it simulates the multiplayer experience with computer-controlled players. The game's story is brief: \"the greatest warriors of all time fight for the amusement of a race called the Vadrigar in the Arena Eternal.\" The introduction video shows the abduction of such a warrior, Sarge, while making a last stand. Continuity with prior games in the \"Quake\" series and even \"Doom\" is maintained by the inclusion of player models and biographical information. A familiar mixture of gothic and technological map architecture as well as specific equipment is included, such as the Quad Damage power-up, the rocket launcher, and the BFG.\nIn \"Quake III Arena\", the player progresses through tiers of maps, combating different bot characters that increase in difficulty, from Crash (at Tier 0) to Xaero (at Tier 7). As the game progresses, the fights take place in more complex arenas and against tougher opponents. While deathmatch maps are designed for up to 16 players, tournament maps are designed for duels between 2 players and in the single-player game could be considered 'boss battles'.\nThe weapons are balanced by role, with each weapon having advantages in certain situations, such as the railgun at long-range and the lightning gun at close quarters. The BFG super-weapon is an exception to this; compared to other similarly named weapons in the \"Doom\"/\"Quake\" series, \"Quake III Arena\"'s incarnation of this weapon is basically a fast-firing rocket launcher and it is found in hard-to-reach locations. Weapons appear as level items, spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map. If a player dies, all of their weapons are lost and they receive the spawn weapons for the current map, usually the gauntlet and machine gun. Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed, which other players can then pick up.\n\"Quake III Arena\" comes with several gameplay modes: Free for All (FFA), a classic deathmatch, where each player competes against the rest for the highest score, Team Deathmatch (TDM), where usually two teams of four compete for the highest team frag (kill) total, Tournament (1v1), a deathmatch between two players, usually ending after a set time and Capture the Flag, which is played on symmetrical maps where teams have to recover the enemy flag from the opponents' base while retaining their own.\n\"Quake III Arena\" was specifically designed for multiplayer. The game allows players whose computers are connected by a network or to the internet to play against each other in real time, and incorporates a handicap system. It employs a client\u2013server model, requiring all players' clients to connect to a server. \"Quake III Arena\"'s focus on multiplayer gameplay spawned a lively community, similar to QuakeWorld, that is still active as of 2021.\nCharacters.\n\"Quake III Arena\" features several characters from previous entries in the \"Quake\" series including \"Bitterman\" from \"Quake II\", the \"Ranger\" character from \"Quake\" as well as Doomguy from id Software's sister franchise \"Doom\".\nDevelopment.\nDuring early March 1999, ATI leaked the internal hardware vendor (IHV) copy of the game, which unveiled to the public in Macworld Conference &amp; Expo at Moscone Center in January and Makuhari Messe in February by Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple Inc. at the time when it unveiled). This was a functional version of the engine with a textured level and working guns. The IHV contained most of the weapons (excepting the Gauntlet) that would make it into the final game although most were not fully modeled; a chainsaw and grappling hook were also in the IHV but did not make it into the final release. Many of the sounds that would make it into the final release were also included. The game was developed by nine people in 18 months.\nAfter the IHV leak, id Software released a beta of the game called \"Quake III Arena Test\" on April 24, 1999, initially only for Mac OS before expanding to Windows at a later date. The Q3Test started with version 1.05 and included three levels that would be included in the final release: dm7, dm17, and q3tourney2. Id Software continued to update Q3Test up until version 1.09.\nid co-founder and former technical director John Carmack has stated that \"Quake III Arena\" is his favorite game he has worked on.\n\"Quake III Arena\" was shipped to retailers on December 2, 1999; the official street date for the game was December 5, although id Software chief executive officer Todd Hollenshead expected the game to be available as early as December 3 from retailers like Babbage's and EB Games. The game supported the A3D 2.0 HRTF technology by Aureal Semiconductor out of the box.\nGame engine.\nThe \"id Tech 3\" engine is the name given to the engine that was developed for \"Quake III Arena\". Unlike most other games released at the time, \"Quake III Arena\" requires an OpenGL-compliant graphics accelerator to run. The game does not include a software or Direct3D renderer.\nThe graphic technology of the game is based tightly around a \"shader\" system where the appearance of many surfaces can be defined in text files referred to as \"shader scripts\". \"Quake 3\" also introduced spline-based curved surfaces in addition to planar volumes, which are responsible for many of the surfaces present within the game. \"Quake 3\" also provided support for models animated using vertex animation with attachment tags (known as the .md3 format), allowing models to maintain separate torso and leg animations and hold weapons. \"Quake 3\" is one of the first games where the third-person model is able to look up and down and around as the head, torso and legs are separate. Other visual features include volumetric fog, mirrors, portals, decals, and wave-form vertex distortion.\nFor networking, id Tech 3 uses a \"snapshot\" system to relay information about game \"frames\" to the client over UDP. The server attempts to omit as much information as possible about each frame, relaying only differences from the last frame the client confirmed as received (Delta encoding). \"id Tech 3\" uses a virtual machine to control object behavior on the server, effects and prediction on the client and the user interface. This presents many advantages as mod authors do not need to worry about crashing the entire game with bad code, clients could show more advanced effects and game menus than was possible in \"Quake II\" and the user interface for mods was entirely customizable. Unless operations which require a specific endianness are used, a QVM file will run the same on any platform supported by \"Quake III Arena.\" The engine also contains bytecode compilers for the x86 and PowerPC architectures, executing QVM instructions via an interpreter.\n\"Quake III Arena\" features an advanced AI with five difficulty levels which can accommodate both a beginner and an advanced player, though they usually do not pose a challenge to high-tier or competitive players. Each bot has its own, often humorous, 'personality', expressed as scripted lines that are triggered to simulate real player chat. If the player types certain phrases, the bots may respond: for example, typing \"You bore me\" might cause a bot to reply \"You should have been here 3 hours ago!\". Each bot has a number of alternative lines to reduce the repetition of bot chatter. The Gladiator bots from \"Quake II\" were ported to \"Quake III Arena\" and incorporated into the game by their creator - Jan Paul van Waveren, aka Mr. Elusive. Bot chat lines were written by R. A. Salvatore, Seven Swords and Steve Winter. Xaero, the hardest opponent in the game, was based on the Gladiator bot Zero. The bot Hunter appears on magazine covers in the later id game \"Doom 3\".\nOn August 19, 2005, id Software released the complete source code for \"Quake III Arena\" under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later, as they have for most of their prior engines. As before, the \"engine\", but not the content such as textures and models, was released, so that anyone who wishes to build the game from source will still need an original copy of the game to play it as intended.\nFast inverse square root.\nFast inverse square root, sometimes referred to as Fast InvSqrt() or by the hexadecimal constant 0x5F3759DF, is an algorithm that estimates formula_1, the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number formula_2\u00a0in . The algorithm is best known for its implementation in the source code of \"Quake III Arena.\"\nAt the time, it was generally computationally expensive to compute the reciprocal of a floating-point number, especially on a large scale. However, the fast inverse square root bypassed this step.\nAround 2002, initial speculation pointed to John Carmack as the probable author of the code, but he demurred and suggested it was written by Terje Mathisen, an accomplished assembly programmer who had previously helped id Software with \"Quake\" optimization. Mathisen had written an implementation of a similar bit of code in the late 1990s, but the original authors proved to be much further back in the history of 3D computer graphics with Gary Tarolli's implementation for the SGI Indigo as a possible earliest known use.\nSource ports.\n\"Quake III Arena\" has been unofficially ported to several consoles, including the PlayStation Portable handheld and Xbox console. These versions require a modified console or handheld and the assets to the original game to go along with the source port.\nCarmack has said that Quake Trilogy (including Arena) will be ported on the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. An unofficial version for iOS was released through Cydia for jailbroken iOS devices in April 2008; it is a demo version similar to the original except that it integrates the iPhone and iPod Touch's accelerometer and touch controls to make gameplay possible. A high-definition version for iPad was released in November 2010, featuring re-created controls, sharper graphics, better gameplay, and better framerate; this improved version was also integrated into the iPhone and iPod touch version of the port.\nA Moorestown prototype version was demonstrated on a reference design that demonstrated performance of up to 90 frames per second. An unofficial port of Quake III for Symbian mobile devices was made. It requires PAK files from original game to run. An unofficial port of the game to Android was created based on the released source code. This means the game can be run on several Android powered devices, most notably the Motorola Milestone, Motorola Droid, and the Nexus One, as well as other high-end devices.\nIn August 2011, the ARM-based Raspberry Pi credit card-sized computer was shown running a specially-compiled ARM version of \"Quake III\" on Debian.\nIn February 2019, an unofficial port of \"Quake III\" called ioQuake3DS was released for the Nintendo 3DS by masterfeizz. The console must be homebrewed in order to be run.\nIn May 2022, an unofficial VR port was released for Meta Quest and Pico virtual reality headsets by a group of modders around Team Beef. To run the port, players must use sideloading. The port is based on the IoQuake3 source port.\nRelease.\nAs a result of the disappointing sales of \"Blue Stinger\", Activision was discouraged from publishing further titles for the Dreamcast and relinquished the distribution of the Dreamcast version of \"Quake III Arena\" (ported by Raster Productions) to Sega. First announced on January 29, 2000. and released on October 23, 2000, the Dreamcast version of \"Quake III\" featured 4 player cross-platform play between Dreamcast and PC players. It is often considered one of the best PC-to-console ports of its time thanks to its smooth frame rate and online play. There are still communities that play this version online on the remaining dedicated servers running patch version 1.16n and the required map pack. The Dreamcast version of \"Quake III\" also included VMU Maze mini-games.\n\"Quake III Revolution\" (ported by Bullfrog Productions, published by Electronic Arts in North America and Electronic Arts Square in Japan) was released for the PlayStation 2 in March 2001, featuring several elements adopted from \"Team Arena\", along with a more mission-based single-player mode. It features split-screen multiplayer for up to 4 players with the PS2 Multitap. As the game was an early PS2 title, it lacked online play - Sony would not launch their network functionality in North America until August 2002. GameRankings rated the release at 83%. \"Quake III Revolution\" was widely criticized for having long loading times compared to the Dreamcast and PC versions, poor game balance, and for not including USB mouse and keyboard support out of the box (unlike the PlayStation 2's version of Unreal Tournament).\n\"Quake Arena Arcade\" for the Xbox 360 was officially announced by id at QuakeCon 2007. The title, jointly developed by id and Pi Studios, was released on Xbox Live Arcade on December 15, 2010. The retail price of the game was set at 1200 Microsoft Points, or $15 USD. \"Quake Arena DS\" for the Nintendo DS was announced at QuakeCon on August 4, 2007. John Carmack stated touch screen controls would not be implemented, as he preferred the game be played with the D-pad instead. This version was silently cancelled. \"Quake Zero\" was announced at QuakeCon on August 3, 2007, and was an updated version of \"Quake 3 Arena\", distributed by free download, run in a browser window and supported by built-in advertising content. \"Quake Zero\" was launched as \"Quake Live\", released in 2010.\nOn November 15, 2021, Microsoft made the x86-64-based Xbox One/Series X/S consoles backward compatible with \"Quake Arena Arcade\", one of 76 titles published in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original Xbox console's launch.\nAdditional content.\nOfficial expansion.\nAn expansion pack titled \"Quake III: Team Arena\" was released on December 15, 2000, in North America, January 15, 2001, in Japan and January 26, in Europe. It was developed by id Software and published by Activision. The expansion focused on team-based gameplay through new game modes, as well as the addition of three new weapons (the Chaingun, Nailgun, and Prox Launcher), and new items and player models. \"Quake III: Team Arena\" was criticized, as its additions were long overdue and had already been implemented by fan modifications. \"Quake III: Gold\" was later released on September 26, 2001, in North America, March 29, 2002, in Japan and August 9 in Europe. \"Quake III: Gold\" included the full version of \"Quake III Arena\" and the \"Quake III: Team Arena\" expansion pack bundled together in a Hybrid Disc CD-ROM. Canadian electro-industrial band Front Line Assembly made the soundtrack for the expansion, the counterpart to Sonic Mayhem's \"Quake III Arena: Noize\".\nMods.\nLike its predecessors, \"Quake\" and \"Quake II\", \"Quake III Arena\" can be heavily modified, allowing the engine to be used for many different games. Mods range from small gameplay adjustments like \"Rocket Arena 3\" and \"Orange Smoothie Productions\" to total conversions such as \"Smokin' Guns\", \"DeFRaG\", and \"Loki's Revenge\". The source code's release has allowed total conversion mods such as \"Tremulous\", \"World of Padman\", \"OpenArena\", and \"Urban Terror\" to evolve into free standalone games. Other mods like \"Weapons Factory Arena\" have moved to more modern commercial engines. \"Challenge ProMode Arena\" became the primary competitive mod for \"Quake III Arena\" since the Cyberathlete Professional League announced CPMA as its basis for competition. CPMA includes alternative gameplays, including air-control, rebalanced weapons, instant weapon switching, and additional jumping techniques. Another mod that underwent several open beta versions and was very popular in 1999\u20132001 was \"Quake 3 Fortress\" (Q3F). The initial version of this game was an indirect port of the \"Quakeworld\" \"Team Fortress\" mod with many clans and leagues competing in both games simultaneously. Q3F was eventually ported to another Quake 3 mod \"Enemy Territory Fortress\" which had limited success. The developers of Q3F eventually abandoned the mod but used it to create the standalone 2003 game \"\", which uses the \"Quake III\" engine and is still popular with approximately 9,400 active players in 2018.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"If you\u2019re looking to buy Quake III Arena for an awesome single-player experience, this game isn\u2019t for you. If you\u2019re yearning for silky-smooth online deathmatches, and crave to push your top-of-the-line PC to the threshold of its performance, then perhaps Quake III Arena is the only game you'll ever need\u2026\".\n\u2014Robert Howarth of Diehard GameFan in 1999\nMetacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0\u2013100 range, calculated an average score of 93 out of 100 (\"Universal acclaim/Must-Play\") for the Dreamcast version, 84 out of 100 (\"Generally favorable reviews\") for the PlayStation 2 version's \"Revolution\" edition. while the Xbox Live Arcade version's \"Arena Arcade\" edition received a lowest score with the average score of 69 out of 100 (\"Mixed or Average\").\nReviews for the game were very positive, with many describing the game as fast and addictive. Curved surfaces were a welcome addition to the series. Most reviewers felt the game was best when played with others online. A \"Diehard GameFan\" review by Robert Howarth described the game as the best \"pure deathmatch\" experience around, but criticised the game's frame rate, which didn't run very well on low-end systems and required either a RIVA TNT2 or GeForce 256 GPU to run the game at an acceptable frame rate. \"GameSpot\" reviewer Jeff Gerstmann described the game as outstanding. He noted the fun level designs, great-looking textures, impressive special effects and weapons sounds. Gerstmann however criticised the narrator's voice and thought that some levels could become too crowded when playing multiplayer. An \"IGN\" review felt the game lacked originality but enjoyed the detailed wall textures and outer space jump levels. The high number of character skins and the artificial intelligence of opponent bots were praised but the weapons were said to be \"bland and predictable\". A \"Eurogamer\" review described the game as \"polished\" and \"stunning\" and thought that it \"was extremely well balanced and plays very well\". The reviewer was especially pleased with the customisable 3D engine and looked forward to new maps and mods.\nBlake Fischer reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it five stars out of five, describing it as \"the best deathmatch yet. Period. End of story. If you want single-player or a storyline, buy \"Half-Life\". If you want great DM and near-infinite expandability, \"Quake III\" is the best in the business\".\nFrank O'Connor reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that it was \"a brilliant, if flawed, conversion of arguably the best online game ever made \u2013 it's sure a hell of a lot more interesting use of the Dreamcast modem than \"Chu Chu Rocket\"\". The Dreamcast version won GameSpot's annual \"Best Multiplayer Game\" award among console games, and was a runner-up in the \"Best Shooting Game\" category, which went to \"Perfect Dark\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\"Quake III: Revolution\" proves that the PS2 can certainly do great first-person action, and while the single-player game gets monotonous after a while, the split-screen multiplayer action makes this a must-have for fans of group gaming. Great graphics, intelligent control, and fast-paced gameplay add up to a topnotch piece of action and one of the best games on the system\".\n\u2014Jason D'Aprile of X-Play in 2001\nGarrett Kenyon reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"all in all, this is a fast and beautiful game \u2013 easily the best shooter available for PS2\". Japanese gaming magazine \"Sh\u016bkan Famicom Ts\u016bshin\" scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 25 out of 40 (63 out of 100 for online version), while a User Reviewer average scored at the website are scored 62 out of 100. The PlayStation 2 version was a nominee for \"The Electric Playground\"'s 2001 Blister Awards for \"Best Console Shooter Game\", but lost to \"\" for Xbox.\n\"Quake III Arena\" won \"PC Gamer US\"'s 1999 \"Special Achievement in Graphics\" award, and wrote that it \"set a new high-water mark in 3D graphics this year\". During the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the game was nominated for \"Computer Action Game of the Year\", which was ultimately awarded to \"\".\nIn January 2016, Red Bull labeled Q3DM17 (The Longest Yard) one of the 10 greatest FPS multiplayer levels of all time.\nSales.\n\"Quake III\"'s sales surpassed 50,000 copies during its first three days of release, by which time 1 million copies had been printed. It debuted at #5 on PC Data's weekly computer game sales chart for the December 5\u201311 period. The game rose to fourth place in the weekly top 10 the following week. Domestically, it sold 222,840 copies and earned revenues of $10.1 million (~$ in 2024) by early 2000.\nIn North America, \"Quake III\" sold 168,309 copies and earned $7.65 million (~$ in 2024) from January through October 2000, according to PC Data. Its overall sales in the region, including its launch in 1999, totaled 319,970 units by November 2000. Its sales for 2000 alone ultimately reached 190,950 units and $8.4 million (~$ in 2024) by the end of the year. The game later received a \"Silver\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\nCompetitive play.\n\"Quake III Arena\"'s multiplayer-focused development led to it developing a large community of competitive players and like its predecessors it was used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments. In competitive \"Quake III Arena\" there are two distinct gameplays, often referred to as 'rulesets', the out-of-the-box \"Quake III Arena\" game, also known as vanilla \"Quake 3\" (VQ3), and the CPM ruleset of the \"Challenge Pro Mode Arena\" mod. On July 26, 2006, \"Challenge Pro Mode Arena\" with VQ3 gameplay was chosen by Cyberathlete Professional League as the mod of choice for their tournament, making it the standard competitive mod for \"Quake III Arena\". Previously, \"Orange Smoothie Productions\" was the most widely used tournament mod.\nThe following competitions have held \"Quake III\" events:\nThese competitions have now moved on to more recent games or have transitioned to its variant successor, \"Quake Live\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25216", "revid": "19921271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25216", "title": "Quake II", "text": "1997 video game\nQuake II is a 1997 first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by Activision. It is the second installment of the \"Quake\" series, following \"Quake\".\nDeveloped over the course of a year, \"Quake II\" was released on December 9, 1997. In contrast to the first game, which featured a combination of science fiction and fantasy elements, \"Quake II\" entirely drops the latter elements and is set during humankind's war against a rogue alien race known as the Strogg, half-mutant half-machine creatures whose homeplanet, Stroggos, is the target of the humans' invasion force. The player takes the role of a space marine (referred to as Bitterman) as he crash-lands on the planet and, being the last survivor of his squad, is tasked with completing a series of missions to cripple the Strogg and end their plans to conquer Earth. The game's storyline is continued in its expansions, including one tying in \"Quake II\" and the first game, and \"Quake 4\". The game's heavy metal soundtrack was provided by Sascha Dikiciyan.\nBesides its single player component, \"Quake II\" also uses a client/server network system similar to that of \"Quake\" for multiplayer. Unlike \"Quake\", where hardware acceleration was only implemented through later patches, \"Quake II\" was released with native OpenGL support. \"Quake II\" was also the first id Software game not to be released for the then-deprecated MS-DOS operating system, rather running natively on Windows 95, with several ports to other systems following afterwards. The source code for \"Quake II\" was released by id Software under the GPL license on December 21, 2001.\n\"Quake II\" received critical acclaim on its release, and similarly to its predecessor is generally considered to be one of the best video games ever made. An \"enhanced\" version of \"Quake II\" developed by Nightdive Studios was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S on August 10, 2023. It includes the original game and its two expansion packs, an episode consisting of the levels from the Nintendo 64 version of the game, and a brand new episode designed by MachineGames.\nGameplay.\n\"Quake II\" is a first-person shooter, in which the player shoots enemies from the perspective of the main character. The gameplay is very similar to that featured in \"Quake\", in terms of movement and controls, although the player's movement speed has been slowed down, and the player now has the ability to crouch. The game retains four of the eight weapons from \"Quake\" (the Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher), although they have been redesigned visually and made to function in slightly different ways. The remainder of \"Quake\"'s eight weapons (the Axe, Nailgun, Super Nailgun, and Thunderbolt) are not present in \"Quake II\". The six new weapons are the Blaster, Machine Gun, Chain Gun, Hyperblaster, Railgun, and BFG10K. The Quad Damage power up from \"Quake\" is present in \"Quake II\", and new power-ups include the Ammo Pack, Invulnerability, Bandolier, Enviro-Suit, Rebreather, and Silencer.\nSingle-player.\nThe single-player game features a number of changes from \"Quake\". First, the player is given mission-based objectives that correspond to the storyline, including stealing a Tank Commander's head to open a door and calling down an air-strike on a bunker. CGI cutscenes are used to illustrate the player's progress through the main objectives, although they are all essentially the same short piece of video, showing a computerized image of the player character as he moves through game's levels. Another addition is the inclusion of a non-hostile character type: the player character's captured comrades. It is not possible to interact with these characters, however, as they have all been driven insane by their Strogg captors.\nThe game features much larger levels than \"Quake\", with many more wide open areas. A hub system allows the player to travel back and forth between levels, which is necessary to complete certain objectives. Some of the textures and symbols that appear in the game are similar to some of those found in \"Quake\". Enemies demonstrate visible wounds after they have taken damage.\nMultiplayer.\nThe multiplayer portion is similar to that of \"Quake\". It can be played as a free-for-all deathmatch game mode, a cooperative version of the single-player game, or as a 1 vs 1 match that is used in official tournaments, like the Cyberathlete Professional League. It can also be played in Capture the Flag mode (CTF). The deathmatch game benefited from the release of eight specifically designed levels that id Software added after the game's initial release. They were introduced to the game via one of the early patches, that were released free of charge. Prior to the release of these maps, players were limited to playing multiplayer games on the single-player levels, which, while functional as multiplayer levels, were not designed with deathmatch gameplay specifically in mind.\nAs in \"Quake\", it is possible to customize the way in which the player appears to other people in multiplayer games. However, whereas in \"Quake\", the only option was to change the color of the player's uniform unless third party modifications were used, now the game comes with a selection of three different player models: a male marine, a female marine, and a male cyborg; choice of player model also affects the speech effects the player's character will make, such as exhaling in effort while jumping or groaning when injured. Each model can be customized from in the in-game menu via the selection of pre-drawn skins, which differ in many ways; for example, skin color, camouflage style, and application of facepaint.\nPlot.\n\"Quake II\" takes place in a science fiction environment set against the backdrop of a war between humanity and an alien race known as the Strogg, who capture and convert organic creatures into horrific cyborgs for their war machine. In the single-player game, the player assumes the role of a Marine named Bitterman taking part in \"Operation Alien Overlord\", a desperate attempt to end the war by launching a counter-offensive on the alien home planet of Stroggos. Most of the other soldiers are captured or killed as soon as they approach the planned landing zone. Bitterman survives because another Marine's personal capsule collided with his upon launch, causing him to crash far short of the landing zone. Bitterman fights his way through the highly industrial Strogg city, destroying strategic objectives along the way, and finally kills the Strogg leader, the Makron, in his orbital asteroid base.\nDevelopment.\nDesign.\nOriginally, \"Quake II\" was supposed to be a new game and intellectual property; titles like \"Strogg\", \"Lock and Load\", and just \"Load\" were toyed with in the early days of development. But after numerous failed attempts, the team at id decided to stick with \"Quake II\" and forgo the Gothic Lovecraftian horror theme from the original in favor of a more sci-fi aesthetic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was a conscious decision [to change \"Quake II\"'s direction] and controversial inside the company. We weren't happy with the [original] \"Quake\" story. [John] Romero was gone, so there was no one left to defend it. Kevin Cloud headed up \"Quake II\" and he wanted to make it story-driven.\nIn the 2023 documentary \"FPS: First Person Shooter\", designer Tim Willits revealed that \"Quake II\" was initially almost titled \"Wor.\" However, due to legal concerns, the development team ultimately decided to use the \"Quake\" name despite the sequel having no narrative connection to the original game. Willits also noted that the game's premise drew inspiration from the 1961 World War II film \"The Guns of Navarone\", particularly its depiction of a mission to destroy an apparently impregnable fortress housing a massive weapon.\nThe game was developed with a 13-person team. Activision obtained the worldwide distribution rights to the game in May 1997. Artist and co-owner Adrian Carmack had said that \"Quake II\" is his favorite game in the series because \"it was different and a cohesive project\". This is the last id Software game to feature American McGee as he was fired shortly after its release.\nTechnology.\nUnlike \"Quake\", where hardware-accelerated graphics controllers were supported only with later patches, \"Quake II\" came with OpenGL support out of the box. Later downloads from id Software added support for AMD's 3DNow! instruction set for improved performance on their K6-2 processors, and Rendition released a native renderer for their V1000 graphics chip. The latest version is 3.21. This update includes numerous bug fixes and new levels designed for multiplayer deathmatch. Version 3.21, available as source code on id Software's FTP server, has no improved functionality over version 3.20 and is simply a slight modification to make compiling for Linux easier.\n\"Quake II\" uses an improved client\u2013server model introduced in \"Quake\". The game code of \"Quake II\", which defines all the functionality for weapons, entities, and game mechanics, can be changed in any way because id Software published the source code of their own implementation that shipped with the game. \"Quake II\" uses the shared library functionality of the operating system to load the game library at run-time\u2014this is how mod authors are able to alter the game and provide different gameplay mechanics, new weapons, and much more. The full source code to \"Quake II\" version 3.19 was released under the terms of the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later on December 22, 2001. Version 3.21 followed later. An LCC-friendly version was released on January 1, 2002, by a modder going by the name of Major Bitch.\n\"Quake II\"'s game engine was a popular license and formed the basis for several commercial and free games, such as ', \"War\u00a7ow\", \"SiN\", \"Anachronox\", \"Heretic II\", \"Daikatana\", \"Soldier of Fortune\", ', and \"\". Valve's 1998 video game \"Half-Life\" used the \"Quake II\" engine during early development stages. However, the final version runs on a heavily modified version of the \"Quake\" engine, \"GoldSrc\", with a small amount of the \"Quake II\" code.\nMusic.\nThe soundtrack for \"Quake II\" was mainly provided by Sonic Mayhem, with some additional tracks by Bill Brown; the main theme was also composed by Bill Brown and Rob Zombie, and one track by Jer Sypult. The soundtrack for the Nintendo 64 version of the game was composed by Aubrey Hodges, credited as Ken \"Razor\" Richmond.\nSource ports.\nSince the release of the \"Quake II\" engine's source code, several updates from third-party projects to the game engine have been created; the most prominent of these are projects focused on graphical enhancements to the game such as most notable Yamagi Quake II, Quake2maX, EGL, Quake II Evolved, and KMQuake II. The source release also revealed numerous security flaws which can result in remote compromise of both the \"Quake II\" client and server. As id Software no longer maintains \"Quake II\", most third-party engines include fixes for these bugs. The unofficial patch 3.24 that fixes bugs and adds only meager tweaks is recommended for \"Quake II\" purists, as it is not intended to add new features or be an engine mod in its own right. The most popular server-side engine modification for multiplayer, \"R1Q2\", is generally recommended as a replacement for the 3.20 release for both clients and servers.\nIn July 2003, Vertigo Software released a source port of \"Quake II\" for the Microsoft .NET platform, using Managed C++, called Quake II .NET. It became a poster application for the language, showcasing the powerful interoperability between .NET and standard C++ code. It remains one of the top downloads on the Visual C++ website. In May 2004, Bytonic Software released a source port of \"Quake II\" (called Jake2) written in Java using JOGL. In 2010 Google ported Jake2 to HTML5, running in Safari and Chrome.\nvkQuake2.\nIn December 2018, Polish programmer Krzysztof Kondrak released the original \"Quake II\" v3.21 source code with Vulkan support added. The port, called vkQuake2, is available under the GPLv2.\nQuake II RTX.\nA new source port of the game, titled Quake II RTX, was announced by Nvidia in March 2019 and was released on June 6 for Windows and Linux on Steam. This source port requires either a Nvidia RTX or an AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPU or higher to utilize these cards' hardware ray tracing functionality, but a software fallback is available for graphics cards that are fast enough.\nThe source port, provided free of charge, includes the three levels present in the original \"Quake II\" demo, but can be used to play the full game if its data files are available. Unlike in most games, ray tracing is used extensively here for lighting, reflections, etc. This is only possible because of the otherwise low hardware demands of \"Quake II\".\nRelease.\n\"Quake II\" released on December 9, 1997, in the United States and on December 12 in Europe. Despite the title, \"Quake II\" is a sequel to the original \"Quake\" in name only. The scenario, enemies, and theme are separate and do not fall into the same continuity as \"Quake\". id initially wanted to set it separately from \"Quake\", but for legal reasons (most of their suggested names were already taken), they decided to use the working title.\"Quake II\" was adopted as a name to leverage the popularity of \"Quake\" according to Jennell Jaquays. \"Quake II\" has been released on Steam, but this version does not include the soundtrack. The game was released on a bonus disc included with \"Quake 4\" Special Edition for the PC, along with both expansion packs. This version lacks the soundtrack. \"Quake II\" is available on a bonus disc with the Xbox 360 version of \"Quake 4\". This version is a direct port featuring the original soundtrack and multiplayer maps.\nIn 2015, \"Quake II: Quad Damage\", a bundle containing the original game with the mission packs has been released at GOG.com, but unlike the previous releases, this one contains a new customizable launcher and the official soundtrack in OGG format which was made possible to play in-game, making it the only digital release at the time to include music.\nThe game has been included in the following official compilations:\nPorts.\nPorts of \"Quake II\" were released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64 (ported by Raster Productions) and PlayStation (ported by HammerHead) video game consoles. In both cases, the core gameplay was largely identical; however, changes were made to the game sequence and split-screen multiplayer replaced network or Internet play. A Macintosh port was developed by Logicware and released in July 1999. \"Quake II: Colossus\" (\"Quake II\" with both official add-ons) was ported to Linux by id Software and published by Macmillan Digital Publishing in 1999. Be Inc. ported \"Quake II: Colossus\" to BeOS to test their OpenGL acceleration in 1999, and provided the game files for free download at a later date\u2014a Windows, Macintosh, or Linux install CD was required to install the game, with the add-ons being optional.\nThe PlayStation version contains abridged versions of Units 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10 of the PC version, redesigned to meet the console's technical limitations. For example, many short airlock-like corridors were added to maps to provide loading pauses inside what were contiguous areas in the PC version. In addition, part of the first mission of the N64 port is used as a prologue. Some enemy types were removed and two new enemies was added: the Arachnid, a human-spider cyborg with twin railgun arms, and the Guardian, a bipedal boss enemy. Saving the game is only possible between levels and at mid-level checkpoints where the game loads, while in the PC version the game could be saved and loaded at any time. The game supports the PlayStation Mouse peripheral to provide a greater parity with the PC version's gameplay. The music used in this port is a combination of the \"Quake II\" original music score and tracks from the PC version's mission packs, while the opening and closing cut-scenes are taken from the Ground Zero expansion pack.\nThe PlayStation version uses an engine developed by HammerHead for their future PlayStation projects and runs at a 512x240 resolution at 30 frames per second. The developer was keen to retain a visual parity with the PC version and avoid tricks such as the use of environmental fog. Colored lights for levels and enemies, and yellow highlights for gunfire and explosions, are carried across from the PC version, with the addition of lens flare effects located around the light sources on the original lightmaps. There is no skybox; instead, a flat Gouraud-textured purple \"sky\" is drawn across the ceiling. The game uses particles to render blood, debris, and rail gun beams analogously to the PC version.\nThere is a split-screen multiplayer mode for two to four players (a four player game is possible using the PlayStation's Multi-tap). The only available player avatar is a modified version of the male player avatar from the PC version, the most noticeable difference being the addition of a helmet. Players can only customize the color of their avatar's armor and change their name. The twelve multiplayer levels featured are unique to the PlayStation version, with none of the PC multiplayer maps being carried over.\nThe Nintendo 64 version has different single-player levels and multiplayer maps, and features multiplayer support for up to four players. This version has new lighting effects, mostly seen in gunfire, and uses the Expansion Pak for extra graphical detail. This port features a new soundtrack, consisting mostly of dark ambient pieces, composed by Aubrey Hodges.\nA port of \"Quake II\" was included with \"Quake 4\" for the Xbox 360 on a bonus disc. This is a direct port of the original game, with some graphical improvements. The port allows for System Link play for up to sixteen players, split-screen for four players, and cooperative play in single-player for up to sixteen players or four players with split-screen alone.\nEnhanced version.\nAn \"enhanced\" version of \"Quake II\" developed by Nightdive Studios was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S on August 10, 2023, during QuakeCon. It collects the full single-player campaign alongside all previously released official expansions and multiplayer maps. It is the first console version of the game to be presented in native widescreen at a resolution of 1080p and 60 frames-per-second performance on the eighth-generation platforms, while the PlayStation 5, Xbox One X, Xbox Series X/S and Windows releases are able to support native 4K (3840x2160) resolution and up to 120FPS with compatible displays. The Xbox Series X/S and Windows releases also support 8-player splitscreen. This version of the game also introduces a new single-player expansion, \"Call of the Machine\", which was designed exclusively for the enhanced version by Bethesda studio MachineGames, comprising 28 additional levels and a new Deathmatch map. The Nintendo 64 version of \"Quake II\" is also bundled with the enhanced version as a bonus.\nAdditional content.\nOfficial expansions.\n\"Mission Pack: The Reckoning\".\n\"Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning\" is the first expansion pack, released on May 27, 1998. It was developed by Xatrix Entertainment. First announced in January 1998, it features eighteen single player levels, six deathmatch levels, three weapons (the Ion Ripper, Phalanx Particle Cannon, and Trap), a power-up, two enemies, seven modified versions of existing enemies, and five music tracks. The storyline follows Joker, a member of an elite squad of marines on a mission to infiltrate a Strogg base on one of Stroggos' moons and destroy the Strogg fleet, which is preparing to attack. Joker crash lands in the swamps outside of the compound where his squad is waiting. He travels through the swamps and bypasses the compounds outer defenses and enters through the main gate, finding his squad just in time to watch them get executed by Strogg forces. Next, Joker escapes on his own to the fuel refinery where he helps the Air Force destroy all fuel production, then infiltrates the Strogg spaceport, boards a cargo ship and reaches the Moon Base, destroying it and the Strogg fleet. The section of the game that takes place on the Moon Base has low gravity, something that was previously used on one secret level of the original \"Quake\".\nThe Reckoning received mixed reviews. It holds 69.50% from Gamerankings and GameSpot given a score of 7.4/10.\n\"Mission Pack: Ground Zero\".\n\"Quake II Mission Pack: Ground Zero\" is the second expansion pack, released on September 11, 1998. It was developed by Rogue Entertainment. It comes with fourteen single-player levels, ten multiplayer maps, five additional music tracks, five enemies, seven power-ups, and five weapons. In the expansion's story the Gravity Well has trapped the Earth Fleet in orbit above the planet Stroggos. One of the marines who managed to land, Stepchild, must now make his way to the Gravity Well to destroy it and free the fleet above and disable the entire defenses of the planet.\n\"Ground Zero\" received average to mixed reviews. It holds 65.40% from Gamerankings. Patrick Baggatta of IGN gave the expansion 7.5/10, describing it as similar to the original, but noting occasionally confusing map design. Elliott Chin of GameSpot gave the game 7.9/10, citing it as decent for an expansion and praising the monsters and enhanced AI. Johnny B. of Game Revolution rated the expansion D+, citing bad level design and few additions to the original game, and noted the multiplayer power-up gameplay as the only fun feature.\n\"Netpack I: Extremities\".\n\"Quake II Netpack I: Extremities\" contains, among other features, 11 game mods and 12 deathmatch maps.\n\"Call of the Machine\".\nThe fourth mission pack, \"Call of the Machine\", was released as part of the enhanced version of \"Quake II\" released on August 10, 2023.\nUnofficial expansions.\nTwo unofficial expansions were released on CDs in 1998: \"Zaero\", developed by Team Evolve and published by Macmillan Digital Publishing, and \"Juggernaut: The New Story\", developed by Canopy Games and published by HeadGames Publishing.\nCommunity content.\nAs with the original \"Quake\", \"Quake II\" was designed to allow players to easily create custom content. A large number of mods, maps, graphics such as player models and skins, and sound effects were created and distributed to others free of charge via the Internet. Popular websites such as PlanetQuake and Telefragged allowed players to gain access to custom content. Another improvement over \"Quake\" was that it was easier to select custom player models, skins, and sound effects because they could be selected from an in-game menu.\nMods for the game include \"Action Quake\" from 1999. \"PC Gaming World\"'s Simon Quirk wrote of the game, \"The \"Action Quake\" team fancied a multiplayer-only total conversion of \"Quake II\" where strategy, accuracy, and cool-looking fights would dominate.\"\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n\"Quake II\" received very positive reviews across all platforms.\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PC version of the game and stated that \"all in all, id should be commended for the advancement of its technology and improvement in its single-player level design, but it's going to be up to mod designers to provide the necessary additions to the multiplayer game in order to make it stand out from \"Quake\".\" \"GamePro\" said the game \"lives up to its impossibly high hype.\" Praising its interconnected levels, new weapons, enemy design, soundtrack, and the ability to play as a female character in multiplayer mode (which they called \"an overdue nod to the growing number of QuakeGrrls\"), they gave it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor).\nOn aggregating review website GameRankings, the PC version held 87%, the Nintendo 64 version 81%, and the PlayStation version 80%. \"AllGame\" editor Michael L. House stated, \"the beauty of Quake II is not in the single-player game, it's in the multi-player feature.\" \"GameSpot\" editor Vince Broady described \"Quake II\" as \"the only first-person shooter to render the original Quake entirely obsolete.\"\nDaniel Erickson reviewed the N64 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", and stated that \"a good first-person shooter with a great multiplayer mode; \"GoldenEye\" is no longer the only game in town.\"\nAt the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, \"Quake II\" was awarded \"PC Action Game of the Year\"; it also received nominations for \"Computer Entertainment Title of the Year\" and \"Interactive Title of the Year\". \"Quake II\" won \"Macworld\"'s 1999 \"Best Shoot-'Em-Up\" award, and the magazine's Christopher Breen wrote: \"In either single-player or multiplayer mode, for careening-through-corridor-carnage satisfaction, \"Quake II\" is a must-have.\" It also won \"Computer Gaming World\"'s 1997 \"Action Game of the Year\" award. The editors wrote that \"for pure adrenaline-pumping, visceral, instantly gratifying action, \"Quake II\" is the hands-down winner. No game gave us the rush that \"Quake II\" did\".\nIn 1998, \"PC Gamer\" declared it the 3rd-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \"id's gun-happy masterpiece is the most sensational and subtle shooter ever, and one of the best games of any type ever created.\"\nIn 1999, \"Next Generation\" listed \"Quake 2\" as number 5 on their \"Top 50 Games of All Time\", commenting that, \"\"Quake 2\" is the standard for multiplayer shooting, and we've yet to see a \"\"Quake\" killer\" that can keep us from returning to multiplayer \"Quake\" for longer than a month or so.\"\nSales.\n\"Quake II\" entered PC Data's monthly computer game sales rankings at #2 for December 1997, behind \"Riven\". The game's sales in the United States alone reached 240,913 copies by the end of 1997, after its release on December 9. According to PC Data, it was the country's 22nd-best-selling computer game of 1997. The following year, \"Quake II\" secured fifth place on PC Data's charts for January and February 1998, then dropped to #8 in March and #9 in April. It remained in PC Data's top 20 for another two months, before exiting in July 1998. \"Quake II\" surpassed 850,000 units shipped to retailers by April 1998, and 900,000 by June.\nAccording to PC Data, \"Quake II\" was the United States' 14th-best-selling computer game during the January\u2013November 1998 period. It ultimately secured 15th place for the full year, with sales of 279,536 copies and revenues of $12.6\u00a0million. GameDaily reported in January 1999 that \"Quake II\"'s sales in the United States had reached 550,000 units; this number rose to 610,000 units by December of that year. Worldwide, \"Quake II\" sold over 1\u00a0million copies by 2002.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Literally meaning 'vapor', 'air', 'gas', or 'breath', the word \"qi\" is polysemous, often translated as 'vital energy', 'vital force', 'material energy', or simply 'energy'. Qi is also a concept in traditional Chinese medicine and in Chinese martial arts. The attempt to cultivate and balance qi is called \"qigong\".\nBelievers in qi describe it as a vital force, with one's good health requiring its flow to be unimpeded. Originally prescientific, today it is a pseudoscientific concept, i.e. not corresponding to the concept of energy as used in the physical sciences.\nChinese gods and immortals, especially anthropomorphic gods, are sometimes thought to have qi and be a reflection of the microcosm of qi in humans, both having qi that can concentrate in certain body parts.\nLinguistic aspects.\nThe cultural keyword \"q\u00ec\" is analyzable in terms of Chinese and Sino-Xenic pronunciations. It is represented by the logographs , , and with various meanings ranging from \"vapor\" to \"anger\", and is the source of the English loanword qi or ch'i.\nPronunciation and etymology.\nThe logograph is read with two Chinese pronunciations: the usual \"q\u00ec\" \"air; vital energy\" and the rare archaic \"x\u00ec\" \"to present food\" (later disambiguated with ). Hackett Publishing Company, Philip J. Ivanhoe, and Bryan W. Van Norden theorize that the word qi possibly came from a term that referred to \"the mist that arose from heated sacrificial offerings\".\nPronunciations of in modern varieties of Chinese with standardized IPA equivalents include: Standard Chinese \"q\u00ec\" , Wu Chinese qi , Southern Min \"kh\u00ec\" , Eastern Min \"k\u00e9\" , Standard Cantonese \"hei3\" , and Hakka Chinese \"hi\" .\nPronunciations of in Sino-Xenic borrowings include: Japanese \"ki\", Korean \"gi\", and Vietnamese \"kh\u00ed.\"\nReconstructions of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of standardized to IPA transcription include: /k\u02b0e\u032fiH/ (Bernard Karlgren), /k\u02b0\u012d\u0259iH/ (Wang Li), /k\u02b0i\u0259iH/ (Li Rong), /k\u02b0\u0268jH/ (Edwin Pulleyblank), and /k\u02b0\u0268iH/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang).\nAxel Schuessler's reconstruction of the Later Han Chinese pronunciation of is /k\u0268s/.\nReconstructions of the Old Chinese pronunciation of standardized to IPA transcription include: */k\u02b0\u026fds/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang), */C.q\u02b0\u0259p-s/ (William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart), and */k\u0259(t)s/ (Axel Schuessler).\nThe etymology of \"q\u00ec\" interconnects with Kharia \"k\u02b0is\" \"anger\", Sora \"kissa\" \"move with great effort\", Khmer \"k\u02b0\u025bs\" \"strive after; endeavor\", and Gyalrongic \"k\u02b0\u0250s\" \"anger\".\nCharacters.\nIn the East Asian languages, \"q\u00ec\" has three logographs:\nIn addition, \"q\u00ec\" \u7081 is an uncommon character especially used in writing Daoist talismans. Historically, the word \"q\u00ec\" was generally written as until the Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE), when it was replaced by the graph clarified with \"m\u01d0\" \u7c73 \"rice\" indicating \"steam (rising from rice as it cooks.)\" and depicting the Traditional Chinese view of the transformative, changeable nature of existence and the universe.\nThis primary logograph , the earliest written character for \"q\u00ec,\" consisted of three wavy horizontal lines seen in Shang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BCE) oracle bone script, Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BCE) bronzeware script and large seal script, and Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE) small seal script. These oracle, bronze, and seal scripts logographs were used in ancient times as a phonetic loan character to write \"q\u01d0\" \"plead for; beg; ask\" which did not have an early character.\nThe vast majority of Chinese characters are classified as radical-phonetic characters. Such characters combine a semantically suggestive \"radical characters\" with a phonetic element approximating ancient pronunciation. For example, the widely known word \"d\u00e0o\" \u9053 \"the Dao; the way\" graphically combines the \"walk\" radical with a \"sh\u01d2u\" \"head\" phonetic. Although the modern \"d\u00e0o\" and \"sh\u01d2u\" pronunciations are dissimilar, the Old Chinese \"*l\u02e4u\u0294-s\" and \"*l\u0325u\u0294-s\" were alike. The regular script character \"q\u00ec\" \u6c23 is unusual because \"q\u00ec\" \u6c14 is both the \"air radical\" and the phonetic, with \"m\u01d0\" \"rice\" semantically indicating \"steam; vapor\".\nThis \"q\u00ec\" \"air/gas radical\" was only used in a few native Chinese characters like \"y\u012bny\u016bn\" \"thick mist/smoke\", but was also used to create new scientific characters for gaseous chemical elements. Some examples are based on pronunciations in European languages: \"f\u00fa\" (with a \"f\u00fa\" phonetic) \"fluorine\" and \"n\u01cei\" (with a \"n\u01cei\" phonetic) \"neon\". Others are based on semantics: \"q\u012bng\" (with a \"j\u012bng\" phonetic, abbreviating \"q\u012bng\" \"light-weight\") \"hydrogen (the lightest element)\" and \"l\u01dc\" (with a \"l\u00f9\" phonetic, abbreviating \"l\u01dc\" \"green\") \"(greenish-yellow) chlorine\".\n\"Q\u00ec\" is the phonetic element in a few characters such as \"k\u00e0i\" \"hate\" with the \"heart-mind radical\" or , \"x\u00ec\" \"set fire to weeds\" with the \"fire radical\" , and \"x\u00ec\" \"to present food\" with the \"food radical\" .\nThe first Chinese dictionary of characters, the \"Shuowen Jiezi\"(121 CE) notes that the primary \"q\u00ec\" is a pictographic character depicting \"cloudy vapors\", and that the full combines \"rice\" with the phonetic qi , meaning \"present provisions to guests\" (later disambiguated as \"x\u00ec\" ).\nMeanings.\nQi is a polysemous word. The unabridged Chinese-Chinese character dictionary \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" defines it as \"present food or provisions\" for the \"x\u00ec\" pronunciation but also lists 23 meanings for the \"q\u00ec\" pronunciation. The modern \"ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary,\" which enters \"x\u00ec\" \"grain; animal feed; make a present of food\", and a \"q\u00ec\" entry with seven translation equivalents for the noun, two for bound morphemes, and three equivalents for the verb. n. \u2460 air; gas \u2461 smell \u2462 spirit; vigor; morale \u2463 vital/material energy (in Ch[inese] metaphysics) \u2464 tone; atmosphere; attitude \u2465 anger \u2466 breath; respiration b.f. \u2460 weather \"ti\u0101nq\u00ec\" \u2461 [linguistics] aspiration \"s\u00f2ngq\u00ec\" v. \u2460 anger \u2461 get angry \u2462 bully; insult.Qi was also thought of as meaning \"'forces in nature'\" that deity could control and magicians and occultists could harness.\nEnglish borrowing.\nQi was an early Chinese loanword in English. It was romanized as \"k'i\" in Church Romanization in the early-19th century, as ch'i in Wade\u2013Giles in the mid-19th century (sometimes misspelled \"chi\" omitting the apostrophe), and as qi in Pinyin in the mid-20th century. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" entry for qi gives the pronunciation as , the etymology from Chinese \"q\u00ec\" \"air; breath\", and a definition of \"The physical life-force postulated by certain Chinese philosophers; the material principle.\" It also gives eight usage examples, with the first recorded example of \"k'\u00ed\" in 1850 (\"The Chinese Repository\"), of ch'i in 1917 (\"The Encyclopaedia Sinica\"), and qi in 1971 (Felix Mann's \"Acupuncture\")\nThe word qi is very frequently used in word games\u2014such as \"Scrabble\"\u2014due to containing a letter Q without a letter U.\nConcept.\nReferences to concepts analogous to qi are found in many Asian belief systems. Philosophical conceptions of qi from the earliest records of Chinese philosophy (5th century BCE) correspond to Western notions of humours and to the ancient Hindu yogic concept of \"prana.\" An early form of qi comes from the writings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius (4th century BCE).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Within the framework of Chinese thought, no notion may attain such a degree of abstraction from empirical data as to correspond perfectly to one of our modern universal concepts. Nevertheless, the term qi comes as close as possible to constituting a generic designation equivalent to our word \"energy\". When Chinese thinkers are unwilling or unable to fix the quality of an energetic phenomenon, the character qi () inevitably flows from their brushes.\nThe ancient Chinese described qi as \"life force\". They believed it permeated everything and linked their surroundings together. Qi was also linked to the flow of energy around and through the body, forming a cohesive functioning unit. By understanding the rhythm and flow of qi, they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.\nAlthough the concept has been important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries the descriptions of qi have varied and have sometimes been in conflict. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas, the Chinese had not categorized all things in terms of matter and energy. Qi and \"li\" (: \"pattern\") were 'fundamental' categories similar to matter and energy.\n\"In later Chinese philosophy, qi was thought of as the fundamental 'stuff' out of which everything in the universe condenses and into which it eventually dissipates.\"\nFairly early on, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there were different fractions of qi\u2014the coarsest and heaviest fractions formed solids, lighter fractions formed liquids, and the most ethereal fractions were the \"lifebreath\" that animated living beings. \"Yuanqi\" is a notion of innate or prenatal qi which is distinguished from acquired qi that a person may develop over their lifetime.\nPhilosophical roots.\nThe earliest texts that speak of qi give some indications of how the concept developed. In the Analects of Confucius, qi could mean \"breath\". Combining it with the Chinese word for blood (making \u8840\u6c23, \"xue\"\u2013qi, blood and breath), the concept could be used to account for motivational characteristics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The [morally] noble man guards himself against three things. When he is young, his \"xue\"\u2013qi has not yet stabilized, so he guards himself against sexual passion. When he reaches his prime, his \"xue\"\u2013qi is not easily subdued, so he guards himself against combativeness. When he reaches old age, his \"xue\"\u2013qi is already depleted, so he guards himself against acquisitiveness.\u2014\u200a\nThe philosopher Mozi used the word qi to refer to noxious vapors that would eventually arise from a corpse were it not buried at a sufficient depth. He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their qi from the moisture that troubled them when they lived in caves. He also associated maintaining one's qi with providing oneself with adequate nutrition. In regard to another kind of qi, he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing qi (clouds) in the sky.\nMencius described a kind of qi that might be characterized as an individual's vital energies. This qi was necessary to activity and it could be controlled by a well-integrated willpower. When properly nurtured, this qi was said to be capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the universe. It could also be augmented by means of careful exercise of one's moral capacities. On the other hand, the qi of an individual could be degraded by adverse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.\nLiving things were not the only things believed to have qi. Zhuangzi indicated that wind is the qi of the Earth. Moreover, cosmic yin and yang \"are the greatest of qi\". He described qi as \"issuing forth\" and creating profound effects. He also said \"Human beings are born [because of] the accumulation of qi. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death... There is one qi that connects and pervades everything in the world.\"\nThe Guanzi essay \"Neiye\" (Inward Training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of vapor \"[qi]\" and meditation techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.\nXun Zi, another Confucian scholar of the Jixia Academy, followed in later years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says, \"Fire and water have qi but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have \"yi\" (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have qi, life, perceptivity, and \"yi\".\" Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of radiant energy, but they were aware that one can be heated by a campfire from a distance away from the fire. They accounted for this phenomenon by claiming \"qi\" radiated from fire. At 18:62/122, he also uses \"qi\" to refer to the vital forces of the body that decline with advanced age.\nAmong the animals, the gibbon and the crane were considered experts at inhaling the qi. The Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (ca. 150 BC) wrote in Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals: \"The gibbon resembles a macaque, but he is larger, and his color is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing.\" (\"\")\nLater, the syncretic text assembled under the direction of Liu An, the Huai Nan Zi, or \"Masters of Huainan\", has a passage that presages most of what is given greater detail by the Neo-Confucians:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Heaven (seen here as the ultimate source of all being) falls (\"duo\" , i.e., descends into proto-immanence) as the formless. Fleeting, fluttering, penetrating, amorphous it is, and so it is called the Supreme Luminary. The \"dao\" begins in the Void Brightening. The Void Brightening produces the universe (\"yu\"\u2013\"zhou\"). The universe produces qi. Qi has bounds. The clear, yang \"[qi]\" was ethereal and so formed heaven. The heavy, turbid \"[qi]\" was congealed and impeded and so formed earth. The conjunction of the clear, yang \"[qi]\" was fluid and easy. The conjunction of the heavy, turbid \"[qi]\" was strained and difficult. So heaven was formed first and earth was made fast later. The pervading essence (\"xi\"\u2013\"jing\") of heaven and earth becomes yin and yang. The concentrated (\"zhuan\") essences of yin and yang become the four seasons. The dispersed (\"san\") essences of the four seasons become the myriad creatures. The hot qi of yang in accumulating produces fire. The essence (\"jing\") of the fire-qi becomes the sun. The cold qi of yin in accumulating produces water. The essence of the water-qi becomes the moon. The essences produced by coitus (yin) of the sun and moon become the stars and celestial markpoints (\"chen\", planets).\u2014\u200aQi is linked to East Asian thought on magic, and certain body parts were important to magic traditions such as some Taoist sects.\nRole in traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe \"Huangdi Neijing\" \"(\"\"The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine\", circa 2nd century BCE) is historically credited with first establishing the pathways, called meridians, through which qi allegedly circulates in the human body.\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, symptoms of various illnesses are believed to be either the product of disrupted, blocked, and unbalanced qi movement through meridians or deficiencies and imbalances of qi in the \"Zang Fu\" organs. Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of qi using a variety of techniques including herbology, food therapy, physical training regimens (qigong, tai chi, and other martial arts training), moxibustion, \"tui na\", or acupuncture.The cultivation of Heavenly and Earthly qi allow for the maintenance of psychological actions\nThe nomenclature of Qi in the human body is different depending on its sources, roles, and locations. For sources there is a difference between so-called \"Primordial Qi\" (acquired at birth from one's parents) and Qi acquired throughout one's life. Or again Chinese medicine differentiates between Qi acquired from the air we breathe (so called \"Clean Air\") and Qi acquired from food and drinks (so-called \"Grain Qi\"). Looking at roles Qi is divided into \"Defensive Qi\" and \"Nutritive Qi\". Defensive Qi's role is to defend the body against invasions while Nutritive Qi's role is to provide sustenance for the body. To protect against said invasions, medicines have four types of qi; cold, hot, warm, and cool. Cold qi medicines are used to treat invasions hot in nature, while hot qi medicines are used to treat invasions cold in nature. looking at locations, Qi is also named after the Zang-Fu organ or the Meridian in which it resides: \"Liver Qi\", \"Spleen Qi\", etc. Lastly, prolonged exposure to the three evil qi (wind, cold, and wetness) can result in the penetration of evil qi through surface body parts, eventually reaching Zang-Fu organs. \nA qi field (\"chu-chong\") refers to the cultivation of an energy field by a group, typically for healing or other benevolent purposes. A qi field is believed to be produced by visualization and affirmation. They are an important component of Wisdom Healing Qigong (\"Zhineng Qigong\"), founded by Grandmaster Ming Pang.\nScientific view.\nThe existence of Qi has not been proven scientifically. A 1998 consensus statement on acupuncture by the United States National Institutes of Health noted that concepts such as qi \"are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information\".\nPractices involving qi.\nFeng shui.\nThe traditional Chinese art of geomancy, the placement and arrangement of space called feng shui, is based on calculating the balance of qi, interactions between the five elements, yin and yang, and other factors. The retention or dissipation of qi is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck, and many other aspects of the occupants. Attributes of each item in a space affect the flow of qi by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it. This is said to influence the energy level of the occupants. Positive qi flows in curved lines, whereas negative qi travels in straight lines. In order for qi to be nourishing and positive, it must continue to flow not too quickly or too slowly. In addition, qi should not be blocked abruptly, because it would become stagnant and turn destructive.\nOne use for a \"luopan\" is to detect the flow of qi. The quality of qi may rise and fall over time. Feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of divination that assesses the quality of the local environment.\nThere are three kinds of qi, known as heaven qi (\"tian qi\" ), Earth qi (\"di qi\" ), and human qi (\"ren qi\" ). Heaven qi is composed of natural forces including the sun and rain. Earth qi is affected by heaven qi. For example, too much sun would lead to drought, and a lack of sun would cause plants to die off. Human qi is affected by earth qi, because the environment has effects on human beings. Feng shui is the balancing of heaven, Earth, and human qi.\nReiki.\nReiki is a form of alternative medicine called energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a technique called \"palm healing\" or \"hands-on healing\" through which a \"universal energy\" is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing. Reiki is a pseudoscience, and is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. It is based on qi (\"chi\"), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists. Clinical research has not shown reiki to be effective as a treatment for any medical condition. There has been no proof of the effectiveness of reiki therapy compared to the placebo effect. An overview of reiki investigations found that studies reporting positive effects had methodological flaws. The American Cancer Society stated that reiki should not replace conventional cancer treatment, a sentiment echoed by Cancer Research UK and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Developed in Japan in 1922 by Mikao Usui, it has been adapted into varying cultural traditions across the world.\nAccording to its believers, Reiki healing occurs by laying hands over or on an individual's area of pain and controlling the universal Qi flow of the nearby space, sending into the area of malaise and purifying it. There is no regulation of the practicing of Reiki in the United States and generally no central world organization that has authority over it.\nQigong.\nQ\u00ecg\u014dng (\u6c14\u529f or \u6c23\u529f) involves coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness. It is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi. With roots in traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy and martial arts, \"qigong\" is now practiced worldwide for exercise, healing, meditation, and training for martial arts. Typically a \"qigong\" practice involves rhythmic breathing, slow and stylized movement, practicing mindfulness, and visualization of guiding qi.\nMartial arts.\nQi is a didactic concept in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese martial arts. Martial qigong is a feature of both internal and external training systems in China and other East Asian cultures. The most notable of the qi-focused \"internal\" force (jin) martial arts are Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, tai chi, Southern Praying Mantis, Snake Kung Fu, Southern Dragon Kung Fu, Aikido, Kendo, Hapkido, Aikijujutsu, Luohanquan, and Liuhebafa.\nDemonstrations of qi or \"ki\" are popular in some martial arts and may include the unraisable body, the unbendable arm, and other feats of power. These feats can be explained using biomechanics and physics.\nAcupuncture and moxibustion.\nAcupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine that involves insertion of needles or the application of pinching/gripping into/onto superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) at acupuncture points to balance the flow of qi. This is often accompanied by moxibustion, a treatment that involves burning mugwort on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25220", "revid": "248739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25220", "title": "Quantum computing", "text": "Computer hardware technology that uses quantum mechanics\nA quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform \"some\" calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\nHistory.\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities. Modern quantum theory was developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales, and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations. Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography, and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.\nAs physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.\nWhen digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics, prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.\nIn a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.\nQuantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch's algorithm in 1985, the Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm in 1993, and Simon's algorithm in 1994.\nThese algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could obtain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as \"quantum parallelism\".\nPeter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie\u2013Hellman encryption protocols, which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover's algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem. The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations, validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture.\nOver the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.\nIn 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.\nIn 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that any classical computer would find impossible.\nThis announcement was met with a rebuttal from IBM, which contended that the calculation Google claimed would take 10,000 years could be performed in just 2.5 days on its Summit supercomputer if its architecture were optimized, sparking a debate over the precise threshold for \"quantum supremacy\".\nQuantum information processing.\nComputer engineers typically describe a modern computer's operation in terms of classical electrodynamics. In these \"classical\" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior; however, because they are not isolated from their environment, any quantum information eventually quickly decoheres. While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum-mechanical notions such as superposition and wave interference are largely irrelevant in program analysis.\nQuantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra. Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.\nAs physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A classical computer is a quantum computer\u00a0... so we shouldn't be asking about \"where do quantum speedups come from?\" We should say, \"Well, all computers are quantum.\u00a0... Where do classical slowdowns come from?\"\nQuantum information.\nJust as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the \"qubit\" is the fundamental unit of quantum information. The same term \"qubit\" is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states, often written formula_1 and formula_2, serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states formula_1 and formula_2 belong to a vector space, meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a \"superposition\" of formula_1 and formula_2.\nA two-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use bra\u2013ket notation for quantum mechanical linear algebra, writing formula_7 'ket psi' for a vector labeled formula_8. Because a qubit is a two-state system, any qubit state takes the form formula_9, where formula_1 and formula_2 are the standard \"basis states\", and formula_12 and formula_13 are the \"probability amplitudes,\" which are in general complex numbers. If either formula_12 or formula_13 is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a quantum state vector behaves similarly to a (classical) probability vector, with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability amplitudes are not necessarily positive numbers. Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference.\nWhen a qubit is measured in the standard basis, the result is a classical bit. The Born rule describes the norm-squared correspondence between amplitudes and probabilities\u2014when measuring a qubit formula_9, the state collapses to formula_1 with probability formula_18, or to formula_2 with probability formula_20.\nAny valid qubit state has coefficients formula_12 and formula_13 such that formula_23.\nAs an example, measuring the qubit formula_24 would produce either formula_1 or formula_2 with equal probability.\nEach additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space.\nAs an example, the vector represents a two-qubit state, a tensor product of the qubit |0\u27e9 with the qubit .\nThis vector inhabits a four-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors |00\u27e9, |01\u27e9, |10\u27e9, and |11\u27e9.\nThe Bell state is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits\u2014the two qubits are \"entangled\" because neither qubit has a state vector of its own.\nIn general, the vector space for an \"n\"-qubit system is 2\"n\"-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2100 classical values.\nUnitary operators.\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix\nformula_27\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modeled with matrix multiplication. Thus\n formula_28 and formula_29.\nThe mathematics of single-qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\nformula_30\nThe controlled NOT (CNOT) gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\nformula_31\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, and formula_35. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (formula_36 from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state formula_37. If the first qubit is formula_38, nothing is done to either qubit.\nIn summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\nQuantum parallelism.\n\"Quantum parallelism\" is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously. This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated. The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, enabling the simultaneous computation of multiple outputs. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, \"parallelism\" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.\nQuantum programming.\nThere are multiple models of computation for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.\nGate array.\nA quantum gate array decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit quantum gates. A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\nAny quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any unitary matrix of size formula_39 over formula_40 qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a universal gate set, since a computer that can run such circuits is a universal quantum computer. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Implementation of Boolean functions using the few-qubit quantum gates is presented here.\nMeasurement-based quantum computing.\nA measurement-based quantum computer decomposes computation into a sequence of Bell state measurements and single-qubit quantum gates applied to a highly entangled initial state (a cluster state), using a technique called quantum gate teleportation.\nAdiabatic quantum computing.\nAn adiabatic quantum computer, based on quantum annealing, decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.\nNeuromorphic quantum computing.\nNeuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated 'n.quantum computing') is an unconventional process of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the \"minimum\". Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.\nTopological quantum computing.\nA topological quantum computer decomposes computation into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice.\nQuantum Turing machine.\nA quantum Turing machine is the quantum analog of a Turing machine. All of these models of computation\u2014quantum circuits, one-way quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and topological quantum computation\u2014have been shown to be equivalent to the quantum Turing machine; given a perfect implementation of one such quantum computer, it can simulate all the others with no more than polynomial overhead. This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.\nNoisy intermediate-scale quantum computing.\nThe threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors, yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains \"a rather distant dream\". According to some researchers, \"noisy intermediate-scale quantum\" (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability.\nScientists at Harvard University successfully created \"quantum circuits\" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers. The Harvard research team was supported by MIT, QuEra Computing, Caltech, and Princeton University and funded by DARPA's Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) program.\nQuantum cryptography and cybersecurity.\nDigital cryptography enables communications to remain private, preventing unauthorized parties from accessing them. Conventional encryption, the obscuring of a message with a key through an algorithm, relies on the algorithm being difficult to reverse. Encryption is also the basis for digital signatures and authentication mechanisms. Quantum computing may be sufficiently more powerful that difficult reversals are feasible, allowing messages relying on conventional encryption to be read.\nQuantum cryptography replaces conventional algorithms with computations based on quantum computing. In principle, quantum encryption would be impossible to decode even with a quantum computer. This advantage comes at a significant cost in terms of elaborate infrastructure, while effectively preventing legitimate decoding of messages by governmental security officials.\nOngoing research in quantum and post-quantum cryptography has led to new algorithms for quantum key distribution, initial work on quantum random number generation and to some early technology demonstrations.\nCommunication.\nQuantum cryptography enables new ways to transmit data securely; for example, quantum key distribution uses entangled quantum states to establish secure cryptographic keys. When a sender and receiver exchange quantum states, they can guarantee that an adversary does not intercept the message, as any unauthorized eavesdropper would disturb the delicate quantum system and introduce a detectable change. With appropriate cryptographic protocols, the sender and receiver can thus establish shared private information resistant to eavesdropping.\nModern fiber-optic cables can transmit quantum information over relatively short distances. Ongoing experimental research aims to develop more reliable hardware (such as quantum repeaters), hoping to scale this technology to long-distance quantum networks with end-to-end entanglement. Theoretically, this could enable novel technological applications, such as distributed quantum computing and enhanced quantum sensing.\nAlgorithms.\nProgress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.\nQuantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving Pell's equation, and, more generally, solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups. These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely. Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein\u2013Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and don't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.\nOther problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that \"no quantum algorithm\" provides a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.\nIn addition to these problems, quantum algorithms are being explored for applications in cryptography, optimization, and machine learning, although most of these remain at the research stage and require significant advances in error correction and hardware scalability before practical implementation.\nSome quantum algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms. Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems. These speed-ups are, however, over the theoretical worst-case of classical algorithms, and concrete real-world speed-ups over algorithms used in practice have not been demonstrated.\nSimulation of quantum systems.\nSince chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, quantum simulation may be an important application of quantum computing. Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a collider. In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.\nAbout 2% of the annual global energy output is used for nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia for the Haber process in the agricultural fertiliser industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia). Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production. It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber\u2013Bosch process by the mid-2020s although some have predicted it will take longer.\nPost-quantum cryptography.\nA notable application of quantum computing is in attacking cryptographic systems that are currently in use. Integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible on a classical computer for large integers if they are the product of a few prime numbers (e.g., the product of two 300-digit primes). By contrast, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to factor the integer. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the RSA, Diffie\u2013Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\nIdentifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of \"post-quantum cryptography\". Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, such as the McEliece cryptosystem, which relies on a hard problem in coding theory. Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice-based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem. It has been shown that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret-key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2\"n\"/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2\"n\" in the classical case, meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have comparable security against an attack using Grover's algorithm to that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see \"Key size\").\nSearch problems.\nThe most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is \"unstructured search\", which involves finding a marked item out of a list of formula_40 items in a database. This can be solved by Grover's algorithm using formula_42 queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the formula_43 queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, H\u00f8yer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions, and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.\nProblems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which Grover's algorithm can be applied is a Boolean satisfiability problem, where the \"database\" through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers. An example and possible application of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess a password. Breaking symmetric ciphers with this algorithm is of interest to government agencies.\nQuantum annealing.\nQuantum annealing relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which slowly evolves to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough, the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process. Quantum annealing can solve Ising models and the (computationally equivalent) QUBO problem, which in turn can be used to encode a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems. Adiabatic optimization may be helpful for solving computational biology problems.\nMachine learning.\nSince quantum computers can produce outputs that classical computers cannot produce efficiently, and since quantum computation is fundamentally linear algebraic, some express hope in developing quantum algorithms that can speed up machine learning tasks.\nFor example, the HHL Algorithm, named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is believed to provide speedup over classical counterparts. Some research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks.\nDeep generative chemistry models emerge as powerful tools to expedite drug discovery. However, the immense size and complexity of the structural space of all possible drug-like molecules pose significant obstacles, which could be overcome in the future by quantum computers. Quantum computers are naturally good for solving complex quantum many-body problems and thus may be instrumental in applications involving quantum chemistry. Therefore, one can expect that quantum-enhanced generative models including quantum GANs may eventually be developed into ultimate generative chemistry algorithms.\nEngineering.\nAs of 2023,[ [update]] classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications. While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks. Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain.\nChallenges.\nThere are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer. Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer:\nSourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by Google and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.\nThe control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.\nDecoherence.\nOne of the greatest challenges involved in constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment, as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, the lattice vibrations, and the background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time \"T\"2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the \"dephasing time\"), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperatures. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator) in order to prevent significant decoherence. A 2020 study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter, and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence, any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\nAs described by the threshold theorem, if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10\u22123, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between \"L\" and \"L\"2, where \"L\" is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of \"L\". For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction. With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits. Computation time is about \"L\"2 or about 107 steps and at 1MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates show that at least 3million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger. \nOne approach to overcoming errors combines low-density parity-check code with cat qubits that have intrinsic bit-flip error suppression. Implementing 100 logical qubits with 768 cat qubits could reduce the error rate to one part in 108 per cycle per bit.\nAnother approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates. Non-Abelian anyons can, in effect, remember how they have been manipulated, making them potentially useful in quantum computing. As of 2025, Microsoft and other organizations are investing in quasi-particle research.\nQuantum supremacy.\nPhysicist John Preskill coined the term \"quantum supremacy\" to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers. The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.\nIn October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the Sycamore quantum computer more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on Summit, generally considered the world's fastest computer. This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed, and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers and even beating it.\nIn December 2020, a group at USTC implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons with a photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, to demonstrate quantum supremacy. The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.\nClaims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum computing, but they are based on contrived benchmark tasks that do not directly imply useful real-world applications.\nIn January 2024, a study published in \"Physical Review Letters\" provided direct verification of quantum supremacy experiments by computing exact amplitudes for experimentally generated bitstrings using a new-generation Sunway supercomputer, demonstrating a significant leap in simulation capability built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network contraction algorithm. This development underscores the evolving landscape of quantum computing, highlighting both the progress and the complexities involved in validating quantum supremacy claims.\nSkepticism.\nDespite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 Nature spotlight article summarized current quantum computers as being \"For now, [good for] absolutely nothing\". The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that, in the long term, such computers are likely to be useful. A 2023 Communications of the ACM article found that current quantum computing algorithms are \"insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack\". It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are \"small-data problems\", for example, in chemistry and materials science. However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, \"will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future\", and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for \"big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover's algorithm\".\nThis state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.\nIn particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain a sufficiently high degree of entanglement for a long time. When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for Quantum supremacy demonstrations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptotically improve upon those bounds.\nBill Unruh doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published in 1994. Paul Davies argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the holographic principle. Skeptics like Gil Kalai doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved. Physicist Mikhail Dyakonov has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:\n\"So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be... about 10300... Could we ever learn to control the more than 10300 continuously variable parameters defining the quantum state of such a system? My answer is simple. \"No, never.\"\"\nPhysical realizations.\nA practical quantum computer must use a physical system as a programmable quantum register. Researchers are exploring several technologies as candidates for reliable qubit implementations. Superconductors and trapped ions are some of the most developed proposals, but experimentalists are considering other hardware possibilities as well.\nFor example, topological quantum computer approaches are being explored for more fault-tolerance computing systems.\nThe first quantum logic gates were implemented with trapped ions and prototype general-purpose machines with up to 20 qubits have been realized. However, the technology behind these devices combines complex vacuum equipment, lasers, and microwave and radio frequency equipment, making full-scale processors difficult to integrate with standard computing equipment. Moreover, the trapped ion system itself has engineering challenges to overcome.\nThe largest commercial systems are based on superconductor devices and have scaled to 2000 qubits. However, the error rates for larger machines have been on the order of 5%. Technologically, these devices are all cryogenic and scaling to large numbers of qubits requires wafer-scale integration, a serious engineering challenge by itself.\nPotential applications.\nWith focus on business management's point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.\nOther applications include healthcare (i.e., drug discovery), financial modeling, and natural language processing.\nTheory.\nComputability.\nAny computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer. Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers.\nConversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a Turing machine. In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of computability. This means that quantum computers cannot solve undecidable problems like the halting problem, and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the Church\u2013Turing thesis.\nComplexity.\nWhile quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor integers, while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.\nThe class of problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called BQP, for \"bounded error, quantum, polynomial time\". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to BPP (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines with bounded error. It is known that formula_44 and is widely suspected that formula_45, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.\nThe exact relationship of BQP to P, NP, and PSPACE is not known. However, it is known that formula_46; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning that there exist problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that formula_47; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of NP-complete problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from NP-hardness that all problems in NP are in BQP).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25223", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25223", "title": "Quasigroup", "text": "Magma obeying the Latin square property\nIn mathematics, especially in abstract algebra, a quasigroup is an algebraic structure that resembles a group in the sense that \"division\" is always possible. Quasigroups differ from groups mainly in that the associative and identity element properties are optional. In fact, a nonempty associative quasigroup is a group.\nA quasigroup that has an identity element is called a loop.\nDefinitions.\nThere are at least two structurally equivalent formal definitions of a quasigroup:\nThe homomorphic image of a quasigroup that is defined with a single binary operation, however, need not be a quasigroup, in contrast to a quasigroup as having three primitive operations. We begin with the first definition.\nAlgebra.\nA quasigroup (\"Q\", \u2217) is a set Q with a binary operation \u2217 (that is, a magma, indicating that a quasigroup has to satisfy the closure property), obeying the Latin square property. This states that, for each a and b in Q, there exist unique elements x and y in Q such that both\nformula_1\nformula_2 \nhold. (In other words: Each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column of the quasigroup's multiplication table, or Cayley table. This property ensures that the Cayley table of a finite quasigroup, and, in particular, a finite group, is a Latin square.) The requirement that x and y be unique can be replaced by the requirement that the magma be cancellative.\nThe unique solutions to these equations are written \"x\" \n \"a\" \\ \"b\" and \"y\" \n \"b\" / \"a\". The operations '\\' and '/' are called, respectively, left division and right division. With regard to the Cayley table, the first equation (left division) means that the b entry in the a row is in the x column while the second equation (right division) means that the b entry in the a column is in the y row.\nThe empty set equipped with the empty binary operation satisfies this definition of a quasigroup. Some authors accept the empty quasigroup, but others explicitly exclude it.\nUniversal algebra.\nGiven some algebraic structure, an identity is an equation in which all variables are tacitly universally quantified, and in which all operations are among the primitive operations proper to the structure. Algebraic structures that satisfy axioms that are given solely by identities are called varieties. Many standard results in universal algebra hold only for varieties. Quasigroups form a variety if left and right division are taken as primitive.\nA right-quasigroup (\"Q\", \u2217, /) is a type (2, 2) algebra that satisfies the identities:\nformula_3\nformula_4\nA left-quasigroup (\"Q\", \u2217, \\) is a type (2, 2) algebra that satisfies the identities:\nformula_5\nformula_6\nA quasigroup (\"Q\", \u2217, \\, /) is a type (2, 2, 2) algebra (i.e., equipped with three binary operations) that satisfies the identities:\nformula_3\nformula_4\nformula_5\nformula_6\nIn other words: Multiplication and division in either order, one after the other, on the same side by the same element, have no net effect.\nHence if (\"Q\", \u2217) is a quasigroup according to the definition of the previous section, then (\"Q\", \u2217, \\, /) is the same quasigroup in the sense of universal algebra. And vice versa: if (\"Q\", \u2217, \\, /) is a quasigroup according to the sense of universal algebra, then (\"Q\", \u2217) is a quasigroup according to the first definition.\nLoops.\nA loop is a quasigroup with an identity element; that is, an element, \"e\", such that\n \"x\" \u2217 \"e\" = \"x\" and \"e\" \u2217 \"x\" = \"x\" for all \"x\" in \"Q\".\nIt follows that the identity element, \"e\", is unique, and that every element of \"Q\" has unique left and right inverses (which need not be the same). Since the presence of an identity element is essential, a loop cannot be empty.\nA quasigroup with an idempotent element is called a pique (\"pointed idempotent quasigroup\"); this is a weaker notion than a loop but common nonetheless because, for example, given an abelian group, (\"A\", +), taking its subtraction operation as quasigroup multiplication yields a pique (\"A\", \u2212) with the group identity (zero) turned into a \"pointed idempotent\". (That is, there is a principal isotopy (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") \u21a6 (\"x\", \u2212\"y\", \"z\").)\nA loop that is associative is a group. A group can have a strictly nonassociative pique isotope, but it cannot have a strictly nonassociative loop isotope.\nThere are weaker associativity properties that have been given special names.\nFor instance, a Bol loop is a loop that satisfies either:\n \"x\" \u2217 (\"y\" \u2217 (\"x\" \u2217 \"z\")) = (\"x\" \u2217 (\"y\" \u2217 \"x\")) \u2217 \"z\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for each \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" in \"Q\" (a \"left Bol loop\"),\nor else\n ((\"z\" \u2217 \"x\") \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 \"x\" = \"z\" \u2217 ((\"x\" \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 \"x\")\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for each \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" in \"Q\" (a \"right Bol loop\").\nA loop that is both a left and right Bol loop is a Moufang loop. This is equivalent to any one of the following single Moufang identities holding for all \"x\", \"y\", \"z\":\n \"x\" \u2217 (\"y\" \u2217 (\"x\" \u2217 \"z\")) = ((\"x\" \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 \"x\") \u2217 \"z\"\n \"z\" \u2217 (\"x\" \u2217 (\"y\" \u2217 \"x\")) = ((\"z\" \u2217 \"x\") \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 \"x\"\n (\"x\" \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 (\"z\" \u2217 \"x\") = \"x\" \u2217 ((\"y\" \u2217 \"z\") \u2217 \"x\")\n (\"x\" \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 (\"z\" \u2217 \"x\") = (\"x\" \u2217 (\"y\" \u2217 \"z\")) \u2217 \"x\".\nAccording to Jonathan D. H. Smith, \"loops\" were named after the Chicago Loop, as their originators were studying quasigroups in Chicago at the time.\nSymmetries.\n names the following important properties and subclasses:\nSemisymmetry.\nA quasigroup is semisymmetric if any of the following equivalent identities hold for all \"x\", \"y\":\n \"x\" \u2217 \"y\" = \"y\" / \"x\"\n \"y\" \u2217 \"x\" = \"x\" \\ \"y\"\n \"x\" = (\"y\" \u2217 \"x\") \u2217 \"y\"\n \"x\" = \"y\" \u2217 (\"x\" \u2217 \"y\").\nAlthough this class may seem special, every quasigroup \"Q\" induces a semisymmetric quasigroup \"Q\"\u0394 on the direct product cube \"Q\"3 via the following operation:\n (\"x\"1, \"x\"2, \"x\"3) \u22c5 (\"y\"1, \"y\"2, \"y\"3) = (\"y\"3 / \"x\"2, \"y\"1 \\ \"x\"3, \"x\"1 \u2217 \"y\"2) = (\"x\"2 // \"y\"3, \"x\"3 \\\\ \"y\"1, \"x\"1 \u2217 \"y\"2),\nwhere \"//\" and \"\\\\\" are the conjugate division operations given by \"y\" // \"x\" = \"x\" / \"y\" and \"y\" \\\\ \"x\" = \"x\" \\ \"y\".\nTriality.\nA quasigroup may exhibit semisymmetric triality.\nTotal symmetry.\nA narrower class is a totally symmetric quasigroup (sometimes abbreviated TS-quasigroup) in which all conjugates coincide as one operation: \"x\" \u2217 \"y\" = \"x\" / \"y\" = \"x\" \\ \"y\". Another way to define (the same notion of) totally symmetric quasigroup is as a semisymmetric quasigroup that is commutative, i.e. \"x\" \u2217 \"y\" = \"y\" \u2217 \"x\".\nIdempotent total symmetric quasigroups are precisely (i.e. in a bijection with) Steiner triples, so such a quasigroup is also called a Steiner quasigroup, and sometimes the latter is even abbreviated as squag. The term sloop refers to an analogue for loops, namely, totally symmetric loops that satisfy \"x\" \u2217 \"x\" = 1 instead of \"x\" \u2217 \"x\" = \"x\". Without idempotency, total symmetric quasigroups correspond to the geometric notion of extended Steiner triple, also called Generalized Elliptic Cubic Curve (GECC).\nTotal antisymmetry.\nA quasigroup (\"Q\", \u2217) is called weakly totally anti-symmetric if for all \"c\", \"x\", \"y\" \u2208 \"Q\", the following implication holds.\n (\"c\" \u2217 \"x\") \u2217 \"y\" = (\"c\" \u2217 \"y\") \u2217 \"x\" implies that \"x\" = \"y\".\nA quasigroup (\"Q\", \u2217) is called totally anti-symmetric if, in addition, for all \"x\", \"y\" \u2208 \"Q\", the following implication holds:\n \"x\" \u2217 \"y\" = \"y\" \u2217 \"x\" implies that \"x\" = \"y\".\nThis property is required, for example, in the Damm algorithm.\n Then, (F4, \u2217) is a commutative Moufang loop that is not a group.\nProperties.\nQuasigroups have the cancellation property: if \"ab\" = \"ac\", then \"b\" = \"c\". This follows from the uniqueness of left division of \"ab\" or \"ac\" by \"a\". Similarly, if \"ba\" = \"ca\", then \"b\" = \"c\".\nThe Latin square property of quasigroups implies that, given any two of the three variables in \"xy\" = \"z\", the third variable is uniquely determined.\nMultiplication operators.\nThe definition of a quasigroup can be treated as conditions on the left and right multiplication operators \"L\"x, \"R\"x : \"Q\" \u2192 \"Q\", defined by \n \"L\"\"x\"(\"y\") = \"xy\"\n \"R\"\"x\"(\"y\") = \"yx\"\nThe definition says that both mappings are bijections from \"Q\" to itself. A magma \"Q\" is a quasigroup precisely when all these operators, for every \"x\" in \"Q\", are bijective. The inverse mappings are left and right division, that is, \n \"L\"(\"y\") = \"x\" \\ \"y\"\n \"R\"(\"y\") = \"y\" / \"x\"\nIn this notation the identities among the quasigroup's multiplication and division operations (stated in the section on universal algebra) are\n \"L\"\"x\"\"L\" = id corresponding to \"x\"(\"x\" \\ \"y\") = \"y\"\n \"L\"\"L\"\"x\" = id corresponding to \"x\" \\ (\"xy\") = \"y\"\n \"R\"\"x\"\"R\" = id corresponding to (\"y\" / \"x\")\"x\" = \"y\"\n \"R\"\"R\"\"x\" = id corresponding to (\"yx\") / \"x\" = \"y\"\nwhere id denotes the identity mapping on \"Q\".\nLatin squares.\nThe multiplication table of a finite quasigroup is a Latin square: an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" table filled with \"n\" different symbols in such a way that each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\nConversely, every Latin square can be taken as the multiplication table of a quasigroup in many ways: the border row (containing the column headers) and the border column (containing the row headers) can each be any permutation of the elements. See \"Small Latin squares and quasigroups\".\nInfinite quasigroups.\nFor a countably infinite quasigroup \"Q\", it is possible to imagine an infinite array in which every row and every column corresponds to some element \"q\" of \"Q\", and where the element \"a\" \u2217 \"b\" is in the row corresponding to \"a\" and the column responding to \"b\". In this situation too, the Latin square property says that each row and each column of the infinite array will contain every possible value precisely once.\nFor an uncountably infinite quasigroup, such as the group of non-zero real numbers under multiplication, the Latin square property still holds, although the name is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it is not possible to produce the array of combinations to which the above idea of an infinite array extends since the real numbers cannot all be written in a sequence. (This is somewhat misleading however, as the reals can be written in a sequence of length &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, assuming the well-ordering theorem.)\nInverse properties.\nThe binary operation of a quasigroup is invertible in the sense that both \"L\"\"x\" and \"R\"\"x\", the left and right multiplication operators, are bijective, and hence invertible.\nEvery loop element has a unique left and right inverse given by\n \"x\"\"\u03bb\" = \"e\" / \"x\" \"x\"\"\u03bb\"\"x\" = \"e\"\n \"x\"\"\u03c1\" = \"x\" \\ \"e\" \"xx\"\"\u03c1\" = \"e\"\nA loop is said to have (\"two-sided\") \"inverses\" if \"x\"\"\u03bb\" = \"x\"\"\u03c1\" for all \"x\". In this case the inverse element is usually denoted by \"x\"\u22121.\nThere are some stronger notions of inverses in loops that are often useful:\nA loop has the \"inverse property\" if it has both the left and right inverse properties. Inverse property loops also have the antiautomorphic and weak inverse properties. In fact, any loop that satisfies any two of the above four identities has the inverse property and therefore satisfies all four.\nAny loop that satisfies the left, right, or antiautomorphic inverse properties automatically has two-sided inverses.\nMorphisms.\nA quasigroup or loop homomorphism is a map \"f\" : \"Q\" \u2192 \"P\" between two quasigroups such that \"f\"(\"xy\") = \"f\"(\"x\")\"f\"(\"y\"). Quasigroup homomorphisms necessarily preserve left and right division, as well as identity elements (if they exist).\nHomotopy and isotopy.\nLet \"Q\" and \"P\" be quasigroups. A quasigroup homotopy from \"Q\" to \"P\" is a triple (\"\u03b1\", \"\u03b2\", \"\u03b3\") of maps from \"Q\" to \"P\" such that\n \"\u03b1\"(\"x\")\"\u03b2\"(\"y\") = \"\u03b3\"(\"xy\")\nfor all \"x\", \"y\" in \"Q\". A quasigroup homomorphism is just a homotopy for which the three maps are equal.\nAn isotopy is a homotopy for which each of the three maps (\"\u03b1\", \"\u03b2\", \"\u03b3\") is a bijection. Two quasigroups are isotopic if there is an isotopy between them. In terms of Latin squares, an isotopy (\"\u03b1\", \"\u03b2\", \"\u03b3\") is given by a permutation of rows \"\u03b1\", a permutation of columns \"\u03b2\", and a permutation on the underlying element set \"\u03b3\".\nAn autotopy is an isotopy from a quasigroup to itself. The set of all autotopies of a quasigroup forms a group with the automorphism group as a subgroup.\nEvery quasigroup is isotopic to a loop. If a loop is isotopic to a group, then it is isomorphic to that group and thus is itself a group. However, a quasigroup that is isotopic to a group need not be a group. For example, the quasigroup on R with multiplication given by (\"x\", \"y\") \u21a6 (\"x\" + \"y\")/2 is isotopic to the additive group (R, +), but is not itself a group as it has no identity element. Every medial quasigroup is isotopic to an abelian group by the Bruck\u2013Toyoda theorem.\nConjugation (parastrophe).\nLeft and right division are examples of forming a quasigroup by permuting the variables in the defining equation. From the original operation\u00a0\u2217 (i.e., \"x\" \u2217 \"y\" = \"z\") we can form five new operations: \"x\" o \"y\" := \"y\" \u2217 \"x\" (the opposite operation), / and \\, and their opposites. That makes a total of six quasigroup operations, which are called the conjugates or parastrophes of\u00a0\u2217. Any two of these operations are said to be \"conjugate\" or \"parastrophic\" to each other (and to themselves).\nIsostrophe (paratopy).\nIf the set \"Q\" has two quasigroup operations, \u2217 and\u00a0\u00b7, and one of them is isotopic to a conjugate of the other, the operations are said to be isostrophic to each other. There are also many other names for this relation of \"isostrophe\", e.g., paratopy.\nGeneralizations.\nPolyadic or multiary quasigroups.\nAn \"n\"-ary quasigroup is a set with an \"n\"-ary operation, (\"Q\", \"f\") with \"f\" : \"Q\"\"n\" \u2192 \"Q\", such that the equation \"f\"(\"x\"1, ..., \"xn\") = \"y\" has a unique solution for any one variable if all the other \"n\" variables are specified arbitrarily. Polyadic or multiary means \"n\"-ary for some nonnegative integer \"n\".\nA 0-ary, or nullary, quasigroup is just a constant element of \"Q\". A 1-ary, or unary, quasigroup is a bijection of \"Q\" to itself. A binary, or 2-ary, quasigroup is an ordinary quasigroup.\nAn example of a multiary quasigroup is an iterated group operation, \"y\" = \"x\"1 \u00b7 \"x\"2 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \"x\"\"n\"; it is not necessary to use parentheses to specify the order of operations because the group is associative. One can also form a multiary quasigroup by carrying out any sequence of the same or different group or quasigroup operations, if the order of operations is specified.\nThere exist multiary quasigroups that cannot be represented in any of these ways. An \"n\"-ary quasigroup is irreducible if its operation cannot be factored into the composition of two operations in the following way:\n \"f\"(\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\") = \"g\"(\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"i\"\u22121, \"h\"(\"x\"\"i\", ..., \"x\"\"j\"), \"x\"\"j\"+1, ..., \"x\"\"n\"),\nwhere 1 \u2264 \"i\" &lt; \"j\" \u2264 \"n\" and (\"i\", \"j\") \u2260 (1, \"n\"). Finite irreducible \"n\"-ary quasigroups exist for all \"n\" &gt; 2; see for details.\nAn \"n\"-ary quasigroup with an \"n\"-ary version of associativity is called an \"n\"-ary group.\nNumber of small quasigroups and loops.\nThe number of isomorphism classes of small quasigroups (sequence in the OEIS) and loops (sequence in the OEIS) is given here:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25225", "revid": "50901130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25225", "title": "Quaestor", "text": "Public official in ancient Rome\nA quaestor ( , ; ; \"investigator\") was a public official in ancient Rome. There were various types of quaestors, with the title used to describe greatly different offices at different times.\nIn the Roman Republic, quaestors were elected officials who supervised the state treasury and conducted audits. When assigned to provincial governors, the duties were mainly administrative and logistical, but also could expand to encompass military leadership and command. It was the lowest ranking position in the \" (course of offices); by the first century\u00a0BC, one had to have been quaestor to be eligible for any other posts.\nIn the Roman Empire, the position initially remained as assistants to the magistrates with financial duties in the provinces, but over time, it faded away in the face of the expanding imperial bureaucracy. A position with a similar name (the \") emerged during the Constantinian period with judicial responsibilities.\nEtymology.\n\"Quaestor\" derives from the Latin verb ', ', meaning \"to inquire\" (probably ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root of interrogative pronouns \"*k\u02b7o-\"). The job title has traditionally been understood as deriving from the original investigative function of the \"\".\nUnder the kings.\nThe earliest quaestors were \"\", chosen to investigate capital crimes, and may have been appointed as needed rather than holding a permanent position. Under the Republic, these \"quaestores parricidii\" persisted, as prosecutors for capital cases in trials before the people. They disappear, however, by the second century BC.\nAncient authors disagree on the exact manner of selection for this office as well as on its chronology, with some dating it to the mythical reign of Romulus. This view, however, is \"not at all credible\" and there is no clear evidence for a specific date for the quaestorship's beginning.\nDuring the Republic.\nThe classical quaestors with financial responsibilities may be unconnected with the older \"questores parricidii\". However, the debate still continues, but has more recently trended against connecting the two offices, which are connected by nothing other than a name. The two general theses are that the classical quaestorship related with financial matters either was created entirely separately from the older judicial quaestorship or that it evolved from that older quaestorship to meet greater administrative needs.\nThe traditional \"cursus honorum\" (career path) was loosely regulated, but after 197\u00a0BC, became more so, with a basic progression that one first had to hold the quaestorship before being considered for higher office as praetor or consul, with quaestor as the lowest office. After Sulla's reforms, the \"cursus honorum\" was cemented, with the added requirement that to stand for the quaestorship, one first needed to have been one of the vigintiviri and have held the military tribunate. The reforms also established that the minimum age for candidates had to be 30.\nQuaestors were elected last in the electoral comitia, as they were of the lowest rank. During the late Republic, however, their terms of office started before their more senior colleagues, on 5 December rather than 1 January. This was the earliest term start of the major magistracies of the Republic, being earlier than that of the tribunes of the plebs (who came into office on 10 December).\nResponsibilities.\nAfter election, they were assigned \u2013 usually by lot on their first day in office \u2013 to their tasks. Very rarely were quaestors directly assigned to a specific task without lot (i.e., \"extra sortem\"), likely with the approval of the senate to a magistrate's request. Some quaestors were assigned to specific tasks (the management of the treasury or of the grain supply in Ostia), but most were assigned to assist a higher magistrate.\nThose assigned to the treasury were supervised by the Senate (usually with the consuls as intermediaries), while those assigned to a higher magistrate were supervised by their superior. Quaestors could be dismissed by their superiors, but this appears rare; there is only one known case thereof, when then-proconsul Marcus Aurelius Cotta dismissed his quaestor Publius Oppius in 73\u00a0BC.\nIn the early Republic, one quaestor was attached to each consul, both when the consul was in Rome for civic duties and on military campaign. By 227\u00a0BC, every magistrate with \"imperium\" (consuls and praetors) left the city accompanied by a quaestor. This close cooperation led these provincial quaestors to take a more active role in assisting their superiors with military \u2013 even assuming command at times \u2013 and administrative tasks. The expanding use of prorogation also affected quaestors, who were regularly prorogued with their superiors \"pro quaestore\"; more frustratingly, ancient sources did not always differentiate between quaestors and their proquaestorian counterparts, regularly calling both quaestors.\nQuaestors in the provinces generally remained in the same province as their superiors for the duration of the superior's term, but this was not obligatory, as the quaestorian careers of Gaius Gracchus, Julius Caesar, and the rotating names of quaestors serving under Gaius Verres attest. Terms in the provinces usually lasted one or two years. Quaestors acted militarily solely under the auspices and \"imperium\" of their commanders, except under exceptional circumstances such as the death of that commander.\nThe relationship between a governor and his quaestor was similar to that between a patron and a client, but was entirely official. While in office together, a quaestor was expected to show \"reverence, courtesy, and loyalty\" to his governor; the governor was likewise obliged to respect his subordinates. This relationship often continued past the designated terms of either individual, and the quaestor could be called upon for assistance or other needs by the consul. Also related were the need to maintain a working relationship to avoid tensions that could endanger the province, as well as a \"certain degree of complicity [needed...] to conceal anything that could compromise the magistrates' reputations\".\nDomestic duties.\nThere were usually two quaestors assigned to the city of Rome (termed urban quaestors), with both simultaneously responsible for the treasury. While some older scholars believed that the urban quaestors were forbidden from leaving the city, this is now rejected.\nThe normal main duty of the urban quaestors was to handle the \"aerarium\" (the public treasury). This involved control and management of the gold and coins stored there, safekeeping of the keys to the treasury, supervision of all public expenses and tax receipts, validation of official documents, and archival of the same. The quaestors were aided by assistants called \"apparitores\", who likely served multi-year terms to familiarise themselves with the job; their number multiplied during the later Republic to meet administrative needs. As part of administering the treasury, they also handled the receipt and auditing of war reparations and tribute from polities defeated by Rome. Collections of taxes were also handled by the urban quaestors and their staff, with overpayments reimbursed when funds became available. They also made the appropriate withdrawals from the treasury to cover various expenses \u2013 including building, army pay, temple maintenance, state visits, state funerals, road maintenance, minting of coins, etc \u2013 as directed by the Senate.\nThey were also in charge of auctions for public land (\"ager publicus\"). Such land was acquired by conquest and became the property of the Roman people. Land sales could be directed by the Senate to meet funding shortfalls, as during the Second Punic War, when the urban quaestors auctioned lands around Capua to raise funds. These quaestors were also responsible for handling public auction of war booty returned to the public treasury by victorious generals. This included objects as well as slaves, with the proceeds to be deposited in the public treasury. They were also responsible for public auction of property seized from citizens who had debts or fines owed to the state if they were unable to pay. These responsibilities over public debts also included the collection of fines in general, where a convict ordered to pay a fine would be required to make a surety to the urban quaestors and deposit the money in the \"aerarium\".\nReturning magistrates and governors also had to produce detailed account books for their handling of public money, which would then be deposited in the treasury, where the urban quaestors and their staff would audit them. These records were supposed to total a running ledger of starting balances, a line-by-line itemised accounting of all inflows and outflows, and ending balances for the province. They also included, for generals, detailed lists of all the money, gold, silver, spoils, and other assets acquired during a governorship. The scribes checked the account books, looking for transactional documentation and arithmetic errors, the results were then approved or disapproved by the quaestors. A negative audit could provide fodder for corruption charges, which was regular in the last two centuries of the Republic.\nAfter the formation of the permanent courts (), the urban quaestors were also responsible for assembling the jury pools and allocation of portions of those pools to the various courts. These quaestors also handled various tasks assigned ad hoc by the Senate, such as meeting and accompanying foreign dignitaries on state visits or leaving Rome to the provinces on special assignments.\nIn the earlier Republic, the quaestors also controlled the distribution of the legionary \"aquilae\" (eagle standards), which were kept in the treasury before distribution to generals before they were returned on the conclusion of a campaign. This likely, however, fell into disuse as Rome expanded across the Mediterranean.\nProvincial administration.\nBecause consuls, praetors, and their promagisterial counterparts were \"practically... plenipotentiary agent[s] upon [which all] aspect[s] of government associated with that \"provincia\" depended\", the quaestor's responsibilities could vary widely, including not only financial and administrative matters but also sometimes encompassing military command and judicial functions. In general, however, the core administrative duty of the quaestor was to \"[extract] whatever material assets the Roman military apparatus might need\". When quaestors were sometimes assigned to a province alone (without attachment to a superior) in the late republic, quaestorian responsibilities increased dramatically as the only Roman magistrate present. At times, quaestors were sent without superiors to peaceful acquisitions to inventory property, auction them if necessary, and transport proceeds to Rome.\nDuring normal times under a governor, the quaestor would handle administrative tasks related to supply of the armies. He would oversee the transport of public money assigned by the Senate to the province, record its uses, and use it to pay soldiers' wages or purchase supplies. He also helped manage the taxation of the province in terms of collecting food, supplies, and money from local leaders. In terms of taxation, quaestors also handled the local auction of raw goods to public contractors (\"publicani\") or merchants; at times, they also made requisitions from local provincials on orders of their superior or at times on their own accord. This remit also extended to minting coinage \u2013 usually to pay soldiers serving in the provinces \u2013 from precious metal stocks on hand.\nThe provincial quaestor also had to carefully record all the money that fell into the provincial government's hands. Other assets acquired by conquest or otherwise classed as war spoils \u2013 from gold to grain, arms, and ships \u2013 also had to be inventoried, recorded, and deposited in the public treasury at Rome. Captives captured in war were usually sold into slavery in that province, which was managed by the quaestor for funds also to be noted in the account books. They also were expected to register those provincial records in Rome upon conclusion of their terms for review by the urban quaestors, which were supposed to record all movements of funds. Loss of those records could give rise to damaging charges of corruption. After Julius Caesar's \"lex Julia\", these records had to be made in triplicate, with two copies lodged in provincial cities (not always the same cities from governor to governor) and the remaining copy returned to Rome for presentation. Then, at least according to custom, both the quaestor and the governor would return to Rome to present the provincial accounts. Upon the close of the term, the quaestor would coordinate to divide the remaining money between the incoming provincial administration and the treasury in Rome.\nThese great responsibilities with little immediate oversight gave both provincial quaestors and their governors many opportunities for corruption by misappropriating funds, demanding exorbitant taxes, getting involved in various business schemes, or taking bribes outright. Quaestors' behaviour did not always comport with their administrative and legal responsibilities.\nOn campaign.\nOn campaign, provincial quaestors acted as subordinate military officers to their attached superior, taking a role \"analogous to... that [of] other members of the governor's entourage, such as his legates\". At times, the quaestor could get into tension with the governor's legates over respective spheres of responsibility or accountability; officially, however, the quaestor was \"higher up the chain of command... [as], besides the governor, he was the only magistrate [and] representative of the Senate and the Roman people\", giving him \"greater authority than legates in all areas of provincial command\".\nQuaestors are documented at various times leading and raising troops and fleets under the command of their governors. Some quaestors were delegated significant open-ended responsibilities far exceeding administrative tasks: Lucullus, for example, during the First Mithridatic War as Sulla's proquaestor, led troops, assembled fleets, travelled the eastern Mediterranean as a diplomat, intervened to overthrow governments, commanded naval battles, captured prisoners, and levied taxes and indemnities.\nWhen a governor left the province, he normally left it to his quaestor's command (though this was at times given instead to one of his high-ranking legates). If a governor died, however, the quaestor generally assumed command of the forces until replacement, possibly with \"imperium pro praetore\". The specifics of how this \"imperium\" was delegated after the death of its actual possessor are unclear: some scholars believe that this was automatic, whereas others believed that a proconsul had to first endow his quaestor with propraetorian \"imperium\".\nA provincial quaestor also could be sent as a diplomatic representative. Two famous examples thereof are those of Tiberius Gracchus and Sulla: Gracchus negotiated a peace treaty on behalf of his proconsul allowing some twenty thousand soldiers to leave with their lives (though the treaty was later invalidated by the Senate) and Sulla negotiated the capture of Jugurtha at the end of the Jugurthine War.\nHistory.\nThere were initially two quaestors; they were initially appointed by the consuls, but according to Tacitus after 447\u00a0BC, they were elected by the \"comitia tributa\". When plebeians were permitted to stand for the quaestorship in 421\u00a0BC, two more were added, with assignments to administer the \"aerarium\" under senatorial direction. It is also around this time that Livy reports a relationship between the quaestors and the public treasury. After 267\u00a0BC, four more quaestors were added, possibly with assignments to various towns in Italy (e.g., Ostia for management of the food supply).\nThe specific number elected year-to-year is difficult to determine at any time, but before Lucius Cornelius Sulla's reforms in 81\u00a0BC, there were 19 quaestors; his reforms created one for the water supply, raising the total to 20. He also made holding the quaestorship compulsory for advancement to future offices. These reforms also established a minimum age for the office, established at 30. Additionally, the reforms granted quaestors automatic membership in the senate upon being elected, whereas previously, membership in the senate was granted only after censors revised the Senate rolls every few years.\nDuring Julius Caesar's dictatorship, he doubled the number of quaestors to forty.\nDuring the empire.\nPrincipate.\nDuring the Principate, the number was halved back to twenty by Augustus. He also removed the quaestors from government of the \"aerarium\" (with a short interlude under Claudius when this was reversed). The emperor and the two consuls each had two quaestors, with the emperor selecting his own, the \"quaestores Caesaris\", who were often up-and-coming men from noble families.\nOver time, the former duties of the quaestors were subsumed by imperial officials, but, in the senatorial provinces, they \"retained some financial functions through the Principate\".\nLate empire.\nDuring the reign of the Emperor Constantine I, a new quaestorship was established, called the \"quaestor sacri palatii\" (lit.\u2009'the quaestor of the sacred palace'). The office functioned as a spokesman for the emperor and was charged with the creation of laws and management of legal petitions, serving as de facto minister of justice. The formal judicial powers of the office were slim, but, as chief legal advisor to the emperor, holders gained substantial influence. Various famous lawyers held this quaestorship, including Antiochus Chuzon and Tribonian, who contributed greatly to the production of the Theodosian Code and Code of Justinian, respectively.\nFrom 440 onward, the office of the quaestor worked in conjunction with the praetorian prefect of the East to oversee the supreme tribunal, or supreme court, at Constantinople. There, they heard appeals from the various subordinate courts and governors.\nByzantine empire.\nEmperor Justinian I also created the offices ', a judicial and police official for Constantinople, and ' (quaestor of the army), a short-lived joint military-administrative post covering the border of the lower Danube. The ' survived long into the Byzantine Empire, although its duties were altered to match the ' by the 9th century\u00a0AD, who was a judicial officer in charge of resolving various disputes.\nThe office survived into the 14th century as a purely honorific title.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Literally, it states \"what was to be shown\". Traditionally, the abbreviation is placed at the end of mathematical proofs and philosophical arguments in print publications, to indicate that the proof or the argument is complete.\nEtymology and early use.\nThe phrase \"quod erat demonstrandum\" is a translation into Latin from the Greek (; abbreviated as \"\u039f\u0395\u0394\"). The meaning of the Latin phrase is \"that [thing] which was to be demonstrated\" (with \"demonstrandum\" in the gerundive). \nThe Greek phrase was used by many early Greek mathematicians, including Euclid and Archimedes.\nThe Latin phrase is attested in a 1501 Euclid translation of Giorgio Valla. Its abbreviation \"q.e.d.\" is used once in 1598 by Johannes Praetorius, more in 1643 by Anton Deusing, extensively in 1655 by Isaac Barrow in the form \"Q.E.D.\", and subsequently by many post-Renaissance mathematicians and philosophers.\nModern philosophy.\nDuring the European Renaissance, scholars often wrote in Latin, and phrases such as \"Q.E.D.\" were often used to conclude proofs.\nPerhaps the most famous use of \"Q.E.D.\" in a philosophical argument is found in the \"Ethics\" of Baruch Spinoza, published posthumously in 1677. Written in Latin, it is considered by many to be Spinoza's \"magnum opus\". The style and system of the book are, as Spinoza says, \"demonstrated in geometrical order\", with axioms and definitions followed by propositions. For Spinoza, this is a considerable improvement over Ren\u00e9 Descartes's writing style in the \"Meditations\", which follows the form of a diary.\nDifference from Q.E.F..\nThere is another Latin phrase with a slightly different meaning, usually shortened similarly, but being less common in use. , originating from the Greek geometers' closing (), meaning \"which had to be done\". Because of the difference in meaning, the two phrases should not be confused.\nEuclid used the Greek original of Quod Erat Faciendum (Q.E.F.) to close propositions that were not proofs of theorems, but constructions of geometric objects. For example, Euclid's first proposition showing how to construct an equilateral triangle, given one side, is concluded this way.\nEquivalent forms.\nThere is no common formal English equivalent, although the end of a proof may be announced with a simple statement such as \"thus it is proved\", \"this completes the proof\", \"as required\", \"as desired\", \"as expected\", \"hence proved\", \"ergo\", \"so correct\", or other similar phrases.\nTypographical forms used symbolically.\nDue to the paramount importance of proofs in mathematics, mathematicians since the time of Euclid have developed conventions to demarcate the beginning and end of proofs. In printed English language texts, the formal statements of theorems, lemmas, and propositions are set in italics by tradition. The beginning of a proof usually follows immediately thereafter, and is indicated by the word \"proof\" in boldface or italics. On the other hand, several symbolic conventions exist to indicate the end of a proof.\nWhile some authors still use the classical abbreviation, Q.E.D., it is relatively uncommon in modern mathematical texts. Paul Halmos claims to have pioneered the use of a solid black square (or rectangle) at the end of a proof as a Q.E.D. symbol, a practice which has become standard, although not universal. Halmos noted that he adopted this use of a symbol from magazine typography customs in which simple geometric shapes had been used to indicate the end of an article, so-called \"end marks\". This symbol was later called the \"tombstone\", the \"Halmos symbol\", or even a \"halmos\" by mathematicians. Often the Halmos symbol is drawn on chalkboard to signal the end of a proof during a lecture, although this practice is not so common as its use in printed text.\nThe tombstone symbol appears in TeX as the character formula_1 (filled square, \\blacksquare) and sometimes, as a formula_2 (hollow square, \\square or \\Box). In the AMS Theorem Environment for LaTeX, the hollow square is the default end-of-proof symbol. Unicode explicitly provides the \"end of proof\" character, U+220E (\u220e). Some authors use other Unicode symbols to note the end of a proof, including, \u25ae (U+25AE, a black vertical rectangle), and \u2023 (U+2023, a triangular bullet). Other authors have adopted two forward slashes (//, formula_3) or four forward slashes (////, formula_4). In other cases, authors have elected to segregate proofs typographically\u2014by displaying them as indented blocks.\nIn popular culture.\nIn Joseph Heller's 1961 novel \"Catch-22\", the Chaplain, having been told to examine a forged letter allegedly signed by him (which he knew he didn't sign), verified that his \"name\" was in fact there. His investigator replied, \"Then you wrote it. Q.E.D.\" The chaplain said he did not write it and that it was not his handwriting, to which the investigator replied, \"Then you signed your name in somebody else's handwriting again.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was long thought to be a distinct species, but mtDNA studies have supported it being a subspecies of plains zebra. A more recent study suggested that it was the southernmost cline or ecotype of the species.\nThe quagga is believed to have been around long and tall at the shoulders. It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and appeared more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about the quagga's behaviour, but it may have gathered into herds of 30\u201350. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than the related Burchell's zebra. They were once found in great numbers in the Karoo of Cape Province and the southern part of the Orange Free State in South Africa.\nAfter the European settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was extensively hunted, as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. Some were taken to zoos in Europe, but breeding programmes were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State; the quagga was extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12\u00a0August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive, and only 23 skins exist today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal whose DNA was analysed. The Quagga Project has attempted to breed Burchell's zebras with similar striping patterns to the quagga.\nTaxonomy.\nIt has been historically suggested that the name \"quagga\" is derived from the Khoikhoi word for \"zebra\" (cf. Tshwa 'zebra'), thereby being an onomatopoeic word, resembling the quagga's call, variously transcribed as \"kwa-ha-ha\", \"kwahaah\", or \"oug-ga\". The name is still used colloquially for the plains zebra.\nThe quagga was originally classified as a distinct species, \"Equus quagga\", in 1778 by Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert. Traditionally, the quagga and the other plains and mountain zebras were placed in the subgenus \"Hippotigris\". Much debate has occurred over the status of the quagga in relation to the plains zebra. The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in 1902 was perhaps the first to suggest that the quagga was a subspecies of the plains zebra. As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the trinomial name for the quagga becomes \"E. quagga quagga\" under this scheme, and the other subspecies of the plains zebra are placed under \"E. quagga\", as well.\nHistorically, quagga taxonomy was further complicated because the extinct southernmost population of Burchell's zebra (\"Equus quagga burchellii\", formerly \"Equus burchellii burchellii\") was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, \"E. burchellii\"). The extant northern population, the \"Damara zebra\", was later named \"Equus quagga antiquorum\", which means that it is today also referred to as \"E. q. burchellii\", after it was realised they were the same taxon. The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts. As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus \"Quagga\" in 1934. Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a cline.\nDifferent subspecies of plains zebras were recognised as members of \"Equus quagga\" by early researchers, though much confusion existed over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described on the basis of differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as \"E. q. danielli\" and \"Hippotigris isabellinus\", were based only on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. One craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (\"Equus ferus caballus\"), but early morphological studies have been noted as being erroneous. Studying skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematic, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.\nEvolution.\nThe quagga is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected at a time when the name \"quagga\" referred to all zebras. Fossil skulls of \"Equus mauritanicus\" from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, but they may be too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them.\nThe quagga was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study launched the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses, with the quagga and mountain zebra (\"Equus zebra\") sharing an ancestor 3\u20134\u00a0million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2\u00a0percent per\u00a0million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.\nLater morphological studies came to different conclusions. A 1999 analysis of cranial measurements found that the quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.\nA genetic study published in 2005 confirmed the subspecific status of the quagga. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity, and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene, and possibly the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern perhaps evolved rapidly because of geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all. Other large African ungulates diverged into separate species and subspecies during this period, as well, probably because of the same climate shift.\nThe simplified cladogram below is based on the 2005 analysis (some taxa shared haplotypes and could, therefore, not be differentiated):\nA 2018 genetic study of plains zebras populations confirmed the quagga as a member of that species. They found no evidence for subspecific differentiation based on morphological differences between southern populations of zebras, including the quagga. Modern plains zebra populations may have originated from southern Africa, and the quagga appears to be less divergent from neighbouring populations than the northernmost living population in northeastern Uganda. Instead, the study supported a north\u2013south genetic continuum for plains zebras, with the Ugandan population being the most distinct. Zebras from Namibia appear to be the closest genetically to the quagga.\nDescription.\nThe quagga is believed to have been long and tall at the shoulders. Based on measurements of skins, mares were significantly longer and slightly taller than stallions, whereas the stallions of extant zebras are the largest. Its coat pattern was unique among equids: zebra-like in the front but more like a horse in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of polymorphism, with some having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing mane with brown and white stripes.\nThe only quagga to have been photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five photographs of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. The German naturalist Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed that this is an optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark.\nLiving in the very southern end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick winter coat that moulted each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a concave diastema, and as being relatively broad with a narrow occiput. Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a dewlap on its neck as the mountain zebra does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibits limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nThe quagga was the southernmost distributed plains zebra, mainly living south of the Orange River. It was a grazer, and its habitat range was restricted to the grasslands and arid interior scrubland of the Karoo region of South Africa, today forming parts of the provinces of Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and the Free State. These areas were known for distinctive flora and fauna and high amounts of endemism. Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30\u201350, and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, and there is no evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (\"Equus zebra hartmannae\").\nLittle is known about the behaviour of quaggas in the wild, and it is sometimes unclear what exact species of zebra is referred to in old reports. The only source that unequivocally describes the quagga in the Free State is that of the British military engineer and hunter William Cornwallis Harris. His 1840 account reads as follows:\nThe geographical range of the quagga does not appear to extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.\nThe practical function of striping in zebras has been debated and it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with this is that the mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity than other zebras.\nA 2020 study suggested that the sexual dimorphism in size, with quagga mares being larger than stallions, could be due to the cold and droughts that affects the Karoo plateau, conditions that were even more severe in prehistoric times, such as during ice ages (other plains zebras live in warmer areas). Isolation, cold, and aridity could thereby have affected quagga evolution, including coat colour and size dimorphism. Since plains zebra mares are pregnant or lactate for much of their lives, larger size could have been a selective advantage for quagga mares, as they would therefore have more food reserves when food was scarce. Dimorphism and coat colour could also have evolved through genetic drift due to isolation, but these influences are not mutually exclusive, and could have worked together.\nRelationship with humans.\nQuaggas have been identified in cave art attributed to the indigenous San people of Southern Africa. As it was easy to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or exploited. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. Quaggas were said to be lively and highly strung, especially the stallions. Quaggas were brought to European zoos, and an attempt at captive breeding was made at London Zoo, but this was halted when a lone stallion killed itself by bashing itself against a wall after losing its temper. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos were said to be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra. One specimen was reported to have lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.\nThe quagga was long regarded a suitable candidate for domestication, as it counted as the most docile of the zebras. The Dutch colonists in South Africa had considered this possibility, because their imported work horses did not perform very well in the extreme climate and regularly fell prey to the feared African horse sickness. In 1843, the English naturalist Charles Hamilton Smith wrote that the quagga was 'unquestionably best calculated for domestication, both as regards strength and docility'. Some mentions have been given of tame or domesticated quaggas in South Africa. In Europe, two stallions were used to drive a phaeton by the sheriff of London in the early 19th\u00a0century.\nIn an attempt at domesticating the quagga, the British lord George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton obtained a single male which he bred with a female horse of partial Arabian ancestry. This produced a female hybrid with stripes on its back and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. It is unknown what happened to the hybrid mare itself. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pangenesis by the British naturalist Charles Darwin. At the close of the 19th\u00a0century, the Scottish zoologist James Cossar Ewart argued against these ideas and proved, with several cross-breeding experiments, that zebra stripes could appear as an atavistic trait at any time.\nThere are 23 known stuffed and mounted quagga specimens throughout the world, including a juvenile, two foals, and a foetus. In addition, a mounted head and neck, a foot, seven complete skeletons, and samples of various tissues remain. A 24th mounted specimen was destroyed in K\u00f6nigsberg, Germany, during World War\u00a0II, and various skeletons and bones have also been lost.\nExtinction.\nThe quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild quagga died in 1878. The specimen in London died in 1872 and the one in Berlin in 1875. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam's Natura Artis Magistra zoo, lived there from 9\u00a0May 1867 until it died on 12\u00a0August 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear. Its death was not recognised as signifying the extinction of its kind at the time, and the zoo requested another specimen; hunters believed it could still be found \"closer to the interior\" in the Cape Colony. Since locals used the term quagga to refer to all zebras, this may have led to the confusion. The extinction of the quagga was internationally accepted by the 1900 Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa. The last specimen was featured on a Dutch stamp in 1988. The specimen itself was mounted and is kept in the collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. It has been on display for special occasions.\nIn 1889, the naturalist Henry Bryden wrote: \"That an animal so beautiful, so capable of domestication and use, and to be found not long since in so great abundance, should have been allowed to be swept from the face of the earth, is surely a disgrace to our latter-day civilization.\"\nBreeding back project.\nAfter the very close relationship between the quagga and extant plains zebras was discovered, Rau started the Quagga Project in 1987 in South Africa to create a quagga-like zebra population by selectively breeding for a reduced stripe pattern from plains zebra stock, with the eventual aim of introducing them to the quagga's former range. To differentiate between the quagga and the zebras of the project, they refer to it as \"Rau quaggas\". The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, participants in the project plan to release them in the Western Cape.\nIntroduction of these quagga-like zebras could be part of a comprehensive restoration programme, including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third- and fourth-generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning has not yet been developed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"QuickTime\" also refers to the QuickTime Player front-end media player application, which is built-into macOS, and was formerly available for Windows.\nQuickTime was created in 1991, when the concept of playing digital video directly on computers was \"groundbreaking.\" QuickTime could embed a number of advanced media types, including panoramic images (called QuickTime VR) and Adobe Flash. Over the 1990s, QuickTime became a dominant standard for digital multimedia, as it was integrated into many websites, applications, and video games, and adopted by professional filmmakers. The QuickTime File Format became the basis for the MPEG-4 standard. During its heyday, QuickTime was notably used to create the innovative \"Myst\" and \"\" video games, and to exclusively distribute movie trailers for several \"Star Wars\" movies. QuickTime could support additional codecs through plug-ins, for example with Perian.\nAs operating systems and browsers gained support for MPEG-4 and subsequent standards like H.264, the need for a cross-platform version of QuickTime diminished, and Apple discontinued the Windows version of QuickTime in 2016. In Mac OS X Snow Leopard, QuickTime 7 was discontinued in favor of QuickTime Player X, which abandoned the aging QuickTime framework in favor of the AVFoundation framework. QuickTime Player X does not support video editing (beyond trimming clips) or plug-ins for additional codec support. macOS Catalina dropped support for all 32-bit applications, including the QTKit framework and the old QuickTime 7.\nOverview.\nQuickTime is bundled with macOS. QuickTime for Microsoft Windows was downloadable as a standalone installation, and was bundled with Apple's iTunes before iTunes 10.5, but is no longer supported and therefore security vulnerabilities will no longer be patched. Already, at the time of the Windows version's discontinuation, two such zero-day vulnerabilities (both of which permitted arbitrary code execution) were identified and publicly disclosed by Trend Micro; consequently, Trend Micro strongly advised users to uninstall the product from Windows systems.\nSoftware development kits (SDK) for QuickTime are available to the public with an Apple Developer Connection (ADC) subscription.\nIt is available free of charge for both macOS operating systems. There are some other free player applications that rely on the QuickTime framework, providing features not available in the basic QuickTime Player. For example, iTunes can export audio in WAV, AIFF, MP3, AAC, and Apple Lossless. In addition, macOS has a simple AppleScript that can be used to play a movie in full-screen mode, but since version 7.2 full-screen viewing is now supported in the non-Pro version.\nQuickTime framework.\nThe QuickTime framework provides the following:\nAs of early 2008, the framework hides many older codecs listed below from the user although the option to \"Show legacy encoders\" exists in QuickTime Preferences to use them. The framework supports the following file types and codecs natively:\nDue to macOS Mojave being the last version to include support for 32-bit APIs and Apple's plans to drop 32-bit application support in future macOS releases, many codecs will no longer be supported in newer macOS releases, starting with macOS Catalina, which was released on October 7, 2019.\nAs of Mac OS X Lion, the underlying media framework for QuickTime, QTKit, was deprecated in favor of a newer graphics framework, AVFoundation, and completely discontinued as of macOS Catalina.\nWindows.\nPictureViewer is a component of QuickTime for Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 operating systems. It is used to view picture files from the still image formats that QuickTime supports. In macOS, it is replaced by Preview.\nIrix.\nA version of QuickTime for the Irix operating system running on SGI hardware with MIPS processors was developed in the mid-1990s but never released.\nQuickTime Player.\nQuickTime 7 Pro.\nQuickTime Player 7 is limited to only basic playback operations unless a QuickTime Pro license key is purchased from Apple. Until Catalina, Apple's professional applications (e.g. Final Cut Studio, Logic Studio) included a QuickTime Pro license. Pro keys are specific to the major version of QuickTime for which they are purchased and unlock additional features of the QuickTime Player application on macOS or Windows. The Pro key does not require any additional downloads; entering the registration code immediately unlocks the hidden features.\nQuickTime 7 is still available for download from Apple, but as of mid-2016, Apple stopped selling registration keys for the Pro version.\nFeatures enabled by the Pro license include, but are not limited to:\nQuickTime Player X.\nMac OS X Snow Leopard includes QuickTime X. QuickTime Player X lacks cut, copy and paste and will only export to four formats, but its limited export feature is free. Users do not have an option to upgrade to a Pro version of QuickTime X, but those who have already purchased QuickTime 7 Pro and are upgrading to Snow Leopard from a previous version of Mac OS X will have QuickTime 7 stored in the Utilities or user defined folder. Otherwise, users will have to install QuickTime 7 from the \"Optional Installs\" directory of the Snow Leopard DVD after installing the OS.\nMac OS X Lion and later also include QuickTime X. No installer for QuickTime 7 is included with these software packages, but users can download the QuickTime 7 installer from the http:// site. QuickTime X on later versions of macOS support cut, copy and paste functions similarly to the way QuickTime 7 Pro did; the interface has been significantly modified to simplify these operations, however.\nOn September 24, 2018, Apple ended support for QuickTime 7 and QuickTime Pro, and updated many download and support pages on their website to state that QuickTime 7 \"will not be compatible with future macOS releases.\"\nFile formats.\nThe native file format for QuickTime video, QuickTime File Format, specifies a multimedia container file that contains one or more tracks, each of which stores a particular type of data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles). Each track either contains a digitally encoded media stream (using a specific format) or a data reference to the media stream located in another file. The ability to contain abstract data references for the media data, and the separation of the media data from the media offsets and the track edit lists means that QuickTime is particularly suited for editing, as it is capable of importing and editing in place (without data copying).\nOther file formats that QuickTime supports natively (to varying degrees) include AIFF, WAV, DV-DIF, MP3, and MPEG program stream. With additional QuickTime Components, it can also support ASF, DivX Media Format, Flash Video, Matroska, Ogg, and many others.\nQuickTime and MPEG-4.\nOn February 11, 1998, the ISO approved the QuickTime file format as the basis of the MPEG\u20114 file format. The MPEG-4 file format specification was created on the basis of the QuickTime format specification published in 2001. The MP4 (codice_1) file format was published in 2001 as the revision of the MPEG-4 Part 1: Systems specification published in 1999 (ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001). In 2003, the first version of MP4 format was revised and replaced by MPEG-4 Part 14: MP4 file format (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003). The MP4 file format was generalized into the ISO Base Media File Format ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004, which defines a general structure for time-based media files. It in turn is used as the basis for other multimedia file formats (for example 3GP, Motion JPEG 2000).\n A list of all registered extensions for ISO Base Media File Format is published on the official registration authority website http://. This registration authority for code-points in \"MP4 Family\" files is Apple Computer Inc. and it is named in Annex D (informative) in MPEG-4 Part 12.\nBy 2000, MPEG-4 formats became industry standards, first appearing with support in QuickTime 6 in 2002. Accordingly, the MPEG-4 container is designed to capture, edit, archive, and distribute media, unlike the simple file-as-stream approach of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2.\nProfile support.\nQuickTime 6 added limited support for MPEG-4, specifically encoding and decoding using Simple Profile (SP). Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) features, like B-frames, were unsupported (in contrast with, for example, encoders such as XviD or 3ivx). QuickTime 7 supports the H.264 encoder and decoder.\nContainer benefits.\nBecause both MOV and MP4 containers can use the same MPEG-4 codecs, they are mostly interchangeable in a QuickTime-only environment. MP4, being an international standard, has more support. This is especially true on hardware devices, such as the Sony PSP and various DVD players, on the software side, most DirectShow / Video for Windows codec packs include a MP4 parser, but not one for MOV.\nIn QuickTime Pro's MPEG-4 Export dialog, an option called \"Passthrough\" allows a clean export to MP4 without affecting the audio or video streams. QuickTime 7 now supports multichannel AAC-LC and HE-AAC audio (used, for example, in the high-definition trailers on Apple's site), for both .MOV and .MP4 containers.\nHistory.\nApple released the first version of QuickTime on December 2, 1991, as a multimedia add-on for System 6 and later. The lead developer of QuickTime, Bruce Leak, ran the first public demonstration at the May 1991 Worldwide Developers Conference, where he played Apple's famous 1984 advertisement in a window at 320\u00d7240 pixels resolution.\nQuickTime 1.x.\nThe original video codecs included:\nThe first commercial project produced using QuickTime 1.0 was the CD-ROM https://. The first publicly visible use of QuickTime was Ben &amp; Jerry's interactive factory tour (dubbed \"The Rik &amp; Joe Show\" after its in-house developers). \"The Rik and Joe Show\" was demonstrated onstage at MacWorld in San Francisco when John Sculley announced QuickTime.\nApple released QuickTime 1.5 for Mac OS in the latter part of 1992. This added the SuperMac-developed Cinepak vector-quantization video codec (initially known as Compact Video). It could play video at 320\u00d7240 resolution at 30 frames per second on a 25 MHz Motorola 68040 CPU. It also added \"text\" tracks, which allowed for captioning, lyrics and other potential uses.\nApple contracted San Francisco Canyon Company to port QuickTime to the Windows platform. Version 1.0 of QuickTime for Windows provided only a subset of the full QuickTime API, including only movie playback functions driven through the standard movie controller.\nQuickTime 1.6 came out the following year. Version 1.6.2 first incorporated the \"QuickTime PowerPlug\" which replaced some components with PowerPC-native code when running on PowerPC Macs.\nQuickTime 2.x.\nApple released QuickTime 2.0 for System Software 7 in June 1994\u2014the only version never released for free. It added support for music tracks, which contained the equivalent of MIDI data and which could drive a sound-synthesis engine built into QuickTime itself (using a limited set of instrument sounds licensed from Roland), or any external MIDI-compatible hardware, thereby producing sounds using only small amounts of movie data.\nFollowing Bruce Leak's departure to Web TV, the leadership of the QuickTime team was taken over by Peter Hoddie.\nQuickTime 2.0 for Windows appeared in November 1994 under the leadership of Paul Charlton. As part of the development effort for cross-platform QuickTime, Charlton (as architect and technical lead), along with ace individual contributor Michael Kellner and a small highly effective team including Keith Gurganus, ported a subset of the Macintosh Toolbox to Intel and other platforms (notably, MIPS and SGI Unix variants) as the enabling infrastructure for the QuickTime Media Layer (QTML) which was first demonstrated at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in May 1996. The QTML later became the foundation for the Carbon API which allowed legacy Macintosh applications to run on the Darwin kernel in Mac OS X.\nThe next versions, 2.1 and 2.5, reverted to the previous model of giving QuickTime away for free. They improved the music support and added sprite tracks which allowed the creation of complex animations with the addition of little more than the static sprite images to the size of the movie. QuickTime 2.5 also fully integrated QuickTime VR 2.0.1 into QuickTime as a QuickTime extension. On January 16, 1997, Apple released the QuickTime MPEG Extension (PPC only) as an add-on to QuickTime 2.5, which added software MPEG-1 playback capabilities to QuickTime.\nLawsuit against San Francisco Canyon.\nIn 1994, Apple filed suit against software developer San Francisco Canyon for intellectual property infringement and breach of contract. Apple alleged that San Francisco Canyon had helped develop Video for Windows using several hundred lines of unlicensed QuickTime source code. They were contracted by Intel to help make Video for Windows better use system resources on Intel processors, which was subsequently unilaterally removed. Microsoft and Intel were added to the lawsuit in 1995. The suit ended in a settlement in 1997.\nQuickTime 3.x.\nThe release of QuickTime 3.0 for Mac OS on March 30, 1998, introduced the now-standard revenue model of releasing the software for free, but with additional features of the Apple-provided MoviePlayer application that end-users could only unlock by buying a QuickTime Pro license code. Since the \"Pro\" features were the same as the existing features in QuickTime 2.5, any previous user of QuickTime could continue to use an older version of the central MoviePlayer application for the remaining lifespan of Mac OS to 2002, indeed, since these additional features were limited to MoviePlayer, any other QuickTime-compatible application remained unaffected.\nQuickTime 3.0 added support for graphics importer components that could read images from GIF, JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats, and video output components which served primarily to export movie data via FireWire. Apple also licensed several third-party technologies for inclusion in QuickTime 3.0, including the Sorenson Video codec for advanced video compression, the QDesign Music codec for substantial audio compression, and the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files. It also added video \"effects\" which programmers could apply in real-time to video tracks. Some of these effects would even respond to mouse clicks by the user, as part of the new movie interaction support (known as wired movies).\nQuickTime interactive.\nDuring the development cycle for QuickTime 3.0, part of the engineering team was working on a more advanced version of QuickTime to be known as QuickTime interactive or QTi. Although similar in concept to the wired movies feature released as part of QuickTime 3.0, QuickTime interactive was much more ambitious. It allowed any QuickTime movie to be a fully interactive and programmable container for media. A special track type was added that contained an interpreter for a custom programming language based on 68000 assembly language. This supported a comprehensive user interaction model for mouse and keyboard event handling based in part on the AML language from the Apple Media Tool.\nThe QuickTime interactive movie was to have been the playback format for the next generation of HyperCard authoring tool. Both the QuickTime interactive and the HyperCard 3.0 projects were canceled in order to concentrate engineering resources on streaming support for QuickTime 4.0, and the projects were never released to the public.\nQuickTime 4.x.\nApple released QuickTime 4.0 on June 8, 1999 for Mac OS 7.5.5 through 8.6 (later Mac OS 9) and Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Three minor updates (versions 4.0.1, 4.0.2, and 4.0.3) followed.\nIt introduced features that most users now consider basic:\nOn December 17, 1999, Apple provided QuickTime 4.1, this version's first major update. Two minor versions (4.1.1 and 4.1.2) followed. The most notable improvements in the 4.1.x family were:\nQuickTime 5.x.\nQuickTime 5 was one of the shortest-lived versions of QuickTime, released in April 2001 and superseded by QuickTime 6 a little over a year later. This version was the last to have greater capabilities under Mac OS 9 than under Mac OS X, and the last version of QuickTime to support Mac OS versions 7.5.5 through 8.5.1 on a PowerPC Mac and Windows 95. Version 5.0 was initially only released for Mac OS and Mac OS X on April 14, 2001, and version 5.0.1 followed shortly thereafter on April 23, 2001, supporting the classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, and Windows. Three more updates to QuickTime 5 (versions 5.0.2, 5.0.4, and 5.0.5) were released over its short lifespan.\nQuickTime 5 delivered the following enhancements:\nQuickTime 6.x.\nOn July 15, 2002, Apple released QuickTime 6.0, providing the following features:\nQuickTime 6 was initially available for Mac OS 8.6\u00a0\u2013 9.x, Mac OS X (10.1.5 minimum), and Windows 98, Me, 2000, and XP. Development of QuickTime 6 for Mac OS slowed considerably in early 2003, after the release of Mac OS X v10.2 in August 2002. QuickTime 6 for Mac OS continued on the 6.0.x path, eventually stopping with version 6.0.3.\nQuickTime 6.1 &amp; 6.1.1 for Mac OS X v10.1 and Mac OS X v10.2 (released October 22, 2002) and QuickTime 6.1 for Windows (released March 31, 2003) offered ISO-Compliant MPEG-4 file creation and fixed the https:// vulnerability.\nApple released QuickTime 6.2 exclusively for Mac OS X on April 29, 2003, to provide support for iTunes 4, which allowed AAC encoding for songs in the iTunes library. (iTunes was not available for Windows until October 2003.)\nOn June 3, 2003, Apple released QuickTime 6.3, delivering the following:\nQuickTime 6.4, released on October 16, 2003, for Mac OS X v10.2, Mac OS X v10.3, and Windows, added the following:\nOn December 18, 2003, Apple released QuickTime 6.5, supporting the same systems as version 6.4. Versions 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 followed on April 28, 2004, and October 27, 2004. These versions would be the last to support Windows 98 and Me. The 6.5 family added the following features:\nQuickTime 6.5.3 was released on October 12, 2005, for Mac OS X v10.2.8 after the release of QuickTime 7.0, fixing a number of security issues.\nQuickTime 7.x.\nInitially released on April 29, 2005, in conjunction with Mac OS X v10.4 (for version 10.3.9 and 10.4.x), QuickTime 7.0 featured the following:\nAfter a couple of preview Windows releases, Apple released 7.0.2 as the first stable release on September 7, 2005, for Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Version 7.0.4, released on January 10, 2006, was the first universal binary version. But it suffered numerous bugs, including a buffer overrun, which is more problematic to most users.\nApple dropped support for Windows 2000 with the release of QuickTime 7.2 on July 11, 2007. The last version available for Windows 2000, 7.1.6, contains numerous security vulnerabilities. References to this version have been removed from the QuickTime site, but it can be downloaded from Apple's support section. Apple has not indicated that they will be providing any further security updates for older versions. QuickTime 7.2 is the first version for Windows Vista.\nApple dropped support for Flash content in QuickTime 7.3, breaking content that relied on Flash for interactivity, or animation tracks. Security concerns seem to be part of the decision. Flash flv files can still be played in QuickTime if the free Perian plugin is added.\nIn QuickTime 7.3, a processor that supports SSE is required. QuickTime 7.4 does not require SSE. Unlike versions 7.2 and 7.3, QuickTime 7.4 cannot be installed on Windows XP without service packs or with Service Pack 1/1A installed (its setup program checks if Service Pack 2 is installed).\nQuickTime 7.5 was released on June 10, 2008. QuickTime 7.5.5 was released on September 9, 2008, which requires Mac OS X v10.4 or higher, dropping 10.3 support. QuickTime 7.6 was released on January 21, 2009. QuickTime 7.7 was released on August 3, 2011.\nQuickTime 7.6.6 is available for OS X, 10.6.3 Snow Leopard until 10.14 Mojave, as 10.15 Catalina will only support 64-bit applications. There is a 7.7 release of QuickTime 7 for OS X, but it is only for Leopard 10.5.\nQuickTime 7.7.6 is the last release for Windows XP Service Pack 2 or 3.\nQuickTime 7.7.9 is the last Windows release of QuickTime. Apple stopped supporting QuickTime on Windows afterwards.\nSafari 12, released on September 17, 2018, for macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra (and the default browser included on macOS Mojave released on September 24, 2018), which drops support for NPAPI plug-ins (except for Adobe Flash) dropped its support for QuickTime 7's web plugin. On September 24, 2018, Apple dropped support for the macOS version of QuickTime 7. This effectively marked the end of the technology in Apple's codec and web development.\nStarting with macOS Catalina, QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video codecs will no longer be compatible with macOS or supported by Apple.\nQuickTime X.\nQuickTime X (pronounced \"QuickTime Ten\") was initially demonstrated at WWDC on June 8, 2009, and shipped with Mac OS X v10.6.\nIt includes visual chapters, conversion, sharing to YouTube, video editing, capture of video and audio streams, screen recording, GPU acceleration, and live streaming.\nBut it removed support for various widely used formats, in particular the omission of MIDI caused significant inconvenience and trouble to many musicians and their potential audiences.\nIn addition, a screen recorder is featured which records whatever is on the screen. However it is not possible to capture certain Digital rights management protected content. This includes iTunes/Apple TV video purchases, or any content protected by Apple's FairPlay DRM technology. While Safari uses FairPlay, Google Chrome and Firefox use Widevine for DRM, whose content is not protected from QuickTime screen capturing.\nThe reason for the jump in numbering from 7 to 10 (X) was to indicate a similar break with the previous versions of the product that Mac OS X indicated. QuickTime X is fundamentally different from previous versions, in that it is provided as a Cocoa (Objective-C) framework and breaks compatibility with the previous QuickTime 7 C-based APIs that were previously used. QuickTime X was completely rewritten to implement modern audio video codecs in 64-bit. QuickTime X is a combination of two technologies: QuickTime Kit Framework (QTKit) and QuickTime X Player. QTKit is used by QuickTime player to display media. QuickTime X does not implement all of the functionality of the previous QuickTime as well as some of the codecs. When QuickTime X attempts to operate with a 32-bit codec or perform an operation not supported by QuickTime X, it will start a 32-bit helper process to perform the requested operation. The website \"Ars Technica\" revealed that QuickTime X uses QuickTime 7.x via QTKit to run older codecs that have not made the transition to 64-bit.\nQuickTime X does not support .SRT subtitle files. It has been suggested using the program Subler to interleave the MP4 and SRT files will fix this oversight, which can be downloaded at Bitbucket.\nQuickTime 7 may still be required to support older formats on Snow Leopard such as QTVR, interactive QuickTime movies, and MIDI files. In such cases, a compatible version of QuickTime 7 is included on Snow Leopard installation disc and may be installed side-by-side with QuickTime X. Users who have a Pro license for QuickTime 7 can then activate their license.\nA Snow Leopard compatible version of QuickTime 7 may also be downloaded from Apple Support website.\nThe software got an increment with the release of Mavericks, and as of August 2018, the current version is v10.5. It contains more sharing options (email, YouTube, Facebook, Flickr etc.), more export options (including web export in multiple sizes, and export for iPhone 4/iPad/Apple TV (but not Apple TV 2). It also includes a new way of fast forwarding through a video and mouse support for scrolling.\nStarting with macOS Catalina, Apple only provides QuickTime X, as QuickTime 7 was never updated to 64-bit, affecting many applications, image, audio, and video formats utilizing QuickTime 7, and compatibility with these codecs in QuickTime X.\nCreating software that uses QuickTime.\nQuickTime X.\nQuickTime X previously provided the QTKit Framework on Mac OS 10.6 until 10.14.\nSince the release of macOS 10.15, AVKit and AVFoundation are used instead (due to the removal of 32-bit audio and video codecs, as well as image formats and APIs supported by QuickTime 7).\nPrevious versions.\nQuickTime consists of two major subsystems: the Movie Toolbox and the Image Compression Manager. The Movie Toolbox consists of a general API for handling time-based data, while the Image Compression Manager provides services for dealing with compressed raster data as produced by video and photo codecs.\nDevelopers can use the QuickTime software development kit (SDK) to develop multimedia applications for Mac or Windows with the C programming language or with the Java programming language (see QuickTime for Java), or, under Windows, using COM/ActiveX from a language supporting this.\nThe COM/ActiveX option was introduced as part of QuickTime 7 for Windows and is intended for programmers who want to build standalone Windows applications using high-level QuickTime movie playback and control with some import, export, and editing capabilities. This is considerably easier than mastering the original QuickTime C API.\nQuickTime 7 for Mac introduced the QuickTime Kit (aka QTKit), a developer framework that is intended to replace previous APIs for Cocoa developers. This framework is for Mac only, and exists as Objective-C abstractions around a subset of the C interface. Mac OS X v10.5 extends QTKit to full 64-bit support. The QTKit allows multiplexing between QuickTime X and QuickTime 7 behind the scenes so that the user need not worry about which version of QuickTime they need to use.\nBugs and vulnerabilities.\nQuickTime 7.4 was found to disable Adobe's video compositing program, After Effects. This was due to the DRM built into version 7.4 since it allowed movie rentals from iTunes. QuickTime 7.4.1 resolved this issue.\nVersions 4.0 through 7.3 contained a buffer overflow bug which could compromise the security of a PC using either the QuickTime Streaming Media client, or the QuickTime player itself. The bug was fixed in version 7.3.1.\nQuickTime 7.5.5 and earlier are known to have a list of significant vulnerabilities that allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and application crash) on a targeted system. The list includes six types of buffer overflow, data conversion, signed vs. unsigned integer mismatch, and uninitialized memory pointer.\nQuickTime 7.6 has been found to disable Mac users' ability to play certain games, such as \"Civilization IV\" and \"The Sims 2\". There are fixes available from the publisher, Aspyr.\nQuickTime 7 lacks support for H.264 Sample Aspect Ratio. QuickTime X does not have this limitation, but many Apple products (such as Apple TV) still use the older QuickTime 7 engine. iTunes previously utilized QuickTime 7, but as of October 2019, iTunes no longer utilizes the older QuickTime 7 engine.\nQuickTime 7.7.x on Windows fails to encode H.264 on multi-core systems with more than approximately 20 threads, e.g. HP Z820 with 2\u00d7 8-core CPUs. A suggested solution is to disable hyper-threading/limit CPU cores. Encoding speed and stability depends on the scaling of the player window.\nOn April 14, 2016, Christopher Budd of Trend Micro announced that Apple has ceased all security patching of QuickTime for Windows, and called attention to two Zero Day Initiative advisories, ZDI-16-241 and ZDI-16-242, issued by Trend Micro's subsidiary TippingPoint on that same day. Also on that same day, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued alert TA16-105A, encapsulating Budd's announcement and the Zero Day Initiative advisories. Apple responded with a statement that QuickTime 7 for Windows is no longer supported by Apple.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25233", "revid": "2510232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25233", "title": "Quartz", "text": "Mineral made of silicon and oxygen\nQuartz is a hard mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide). Its atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon\u2013oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen atom being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2. Therefore, quartz is classified structurally as a framework silicate mineral and compositionally as an oxide mineral. Quartz is the second most common mineral or mineral group in Earth's lithosphere, comprising about 12% by mass.\nQuartz exists in two forms, the normal \u03b1-quartz and the high-temperature \u03b2-quartz, both of which are chiral. The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at . Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce microfracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold.\nThere are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are classified as gemstones. Since antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings, especially in Europe and Asia.\nQuartz is the mineral defining the value of 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness, a qualitative scratch method for determining the hardness of a material to abrasion.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"quartz\" is derived from the German word , which had the same form in the first half of the 14th century in Middle High German and in East Central German and which came from the Polish \"dialect\" term \"kwardy\", which corresponds to the Czech term (\"hard\"). Some sources, however, attribute the word's origin to the Saxon word \"Querkluftertz\", meaning \"cross-vein ore\".\nThe Ancient Greeks referred to quartz as () meaning \"crystal\", derived from the Ancient Greek () meaning \"icy cold\", because some philosophers (including Theophrastus) believed the mineral to be a form of supercooled ice. Today, the term \"rock crystal\" is sometimes used as an alternative name for transparent, coarsely crystalline quartz.\nEarly studies.\nRoman naturalist Pliny the Elder believed quartz to be ice, permanently frozen after great lengths of time. He supported this idea by saying that quartz is found near glaciers in the Alps, but in warm climates. This idea persisted until at least the 17th century. \nIn the 17th century, Nicolas Steno's study of quartz paved the way for modern crystallography. He discovered that, regardless of a quartz crystal's size or shape, its long prism faces always meet at a perfect 60\u00b0 angle, thereby establishing the law of constancy of interfacial angles.\nCrystal habit and structure.\nQuartz belongs to the trigonal crystal system at room temperature and to the hexagonal crystal system above . The former is called \u03b1-quartz; the latter is \u03b2-quartz. The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramid-like rhombohedrons at each end. In nature, quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive.202\u2013204\nWell-formed crystals typically form as a druse (a layer of crystals lining a void), of which quartz geodes are particularly fine examples. The crystals are attached at one end to the enclosing rock, and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance, within gypsum.\n\u03b1-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, space group \"P\"3121 or \"P\"3221 (space group 152 or 154 resp.) depending on the chirality. Above , \u03b1-quartz in \"P\"3121 becomes the more symmetric hexagonal \"P\"6422 (space group 181), and \u03b1-quartz in \"P\"3221 goes to space group \"P\"6222 (no. 180).\nThese space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both \u03b1-quartz and \u03b2-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO4 tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between \u03b1- and \u03b2-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without a change in the way they are linked.201 However, there is a significant change in volume during this transition, and this can result in significant microfracturing in ceramics during firing, in ornamental stone after a fire and in rocks of the Earth's crust exposed to high temperatures, thereby damaging materials containing quartz and degrading their physical and mechanical properties.\nVarieties.\nPure quartz, traditionally called rock crystal or clear quartz, is colorless and transparent or translucent. Colored varieties of quartz are common and include citrine, rose quartz, amethyst, smoky quartz, milky quartz, and others. These color differentiations arise from the presence of impurities which change the molecular orbitals, causing some electronic transitions to take place in the visible spectrum, emitting colored light.\nQuartz varieties were previously classified into three categories based on the visibility of their individual crystals. Macrocrystalline quartz varieties have individual crystals that are visible to the unaided eye (macroscopic). Microcrystalline quartz varieties are aggregates of tiny crystals that can only be seen through a microscope (microscopic). Cryptocrystalline quartz varieties are aggregates of crystals that are too small to be seen even with an optical microscope (sub-microscopic). Today, the microcrystalline and cryptocrystalline varieties are commonly grouped together and referred to as chalcedony. However, in the scientific literature, chalcedony is a specific form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz and its monoclinic polymorph, moganite. Chalcedony is commonly translucent to opaque, while the macrocrystalline varieties of quartz tend to be more transparent. Color is a secondary identifier for the cryptocrystalline varieties and a primary identifier for the macrocrystalline varieties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPiezoelectricity.\nQuartz crystals have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon the application of mechanical stress. Quartz's piezoelectric properties were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880.\nOccurrence.\nQuartz is the second most abundant mineral or mineral group in the Earth's lithosphere; by mass, the feldspar group comprises 41% of the lithosphere, followed by quartz at 12% and the pyroxene group at 11%.\nQuartz is a defining constituent of granite and other felsic igneous rocks. It is very common in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale. It is a common constituent of schist, gneiss, quartzite and other metamorphic rocks. Quartz has the lowest potential for weathering in the Goldich dissolution series and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual soils. Generally a high presence of quartz suggests a \"mature\" rock, since it indicates the rock has been heavily reworked and quartz was the primary mineral that endured heavy weathering.\nWhile the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten magma, quartz also chemically precipitates from hot hydrothermal veins as gangue, sometimes with ore minerals such as gold, silver and copper. Large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic pegmatites. Well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and weigh hundreds of kilograms.\nThe largest documented single crystal of quartz was found near Itapore, Goiaz, Brazil; it measured approximately and weighed over .\nMining.\nQuartz is extracted from open-pit mines. Miners occasionally use explosives to expose deep pockets of quartz. More frequently, bulldozers and backhoes are used to remove soil and clay and expose quartz veins, which are then worked using hand tools. Care must be taken to avoid sudden temperature changes that may damage the crystals.\nRelated silica minerals.\nTridymite and cristobalite are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 that occur in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Moganite is a monoclinic polymorph. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.\nSafety.\nAs quartz is a form of silica, it is a possible cause for concern in various workplaces. Cutting, grinding, chipping, sanding, drilling, and polishing natural and manufactured stone products can release hazardous levels of very small, crystalline silica dust particles into the air that workers breathe. Crystalline silica of respirable size is a recognized human carcinogen and may lead to other diseases of the lungs such as silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis.\nSynthetic and artificial treatments.\nNot all varieties of quartz are naturally occurring. Some clear quartz crystals can be treated using heat or gamma irradiation to induce color where it would not otherwise have occurred naturally. Susceptibility to such treatments depends on the location from which the quartz was mined.\nPrasiolite, an olive-colored material, is produced by heat treatment; natural prasiolite has also been observed in Lower Silesia in Poland. Although citrine occurs naturally, the majority is the result of heat-treating amethyst or smoky quartz. Carnelian has been heat-treated to deepen its color since prehistoric times.\nBecause natural quartz is often twinned, synthetic quartz is produced for use in industry. Large, flawless single crystals are synthesized in an autoclave via the hydrothermal process.\nLike other crystals, quartz may be coated with metal vapors to give it an attractive sheen.\nUses.\nQuartz is the most common material identified as the mystical substance maban in Australian Aboriginal mythology. It is found regularly in passage tomb cemeteries in Europe in a burial context, such as Newgrange or Carrowmore in Ireland. Quartz was also used in prehistoric Ireland, as well as many other countries, for stone tools; both vein quartz and rock crystal were knapped as part of the lithic technology of prehistoric peoples.\nWhile jade has been the most prized semi-precious stone for carving in East Asia and pre-Columbian America since earliest times, in Europe and the Middle East different varieties of quartz were the most commonly used for the various types of jewelry and hardstone carving, including engraved gems and cameo gems, rock crystal vases, and extravagant vessels. The tradition continued to produce highly valued objects until the mid-19th century, when it largely fell from fashion except in jewelry. Cameo technique exploits the bands of color in onyx and other varieties.\nEfforts to synthesize quartz began in the mid-19th century as scientists attempted to create minerals under laboratory conditions that mimicked the conditions in which the minerals formed in nature. German geologist Karl Emil von Schafh\u00e4utl (1803\u20131890) was the first person to synthesize quartz when in 1845 he created microscopic quartz crystals in a pressure cooker. However, the quality and size of the crystals that were produced by these early efforts were poor.\nElemental impurity incorporation strongly influences the ability to process and utilize quartz. Naturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity, necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing perfect large silicon boules to be sliced into silicon wafers in the semiconductor industry, are expensive and rare. These high-purity quartz are defined as containing less than 50 ppm of impurity elements. A major mining location for high-purity quartz is the Spruce Pine Mining District in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, United States. Quartz may also be found in Caldoveiro Peak in Asturias, Spain.\nBy the 1930s, the electronics industry had become dependent on quartz crystals. The only source of suitable crystals was Brazil; however, World War II disrupted supplies from Brazil, so nations attempted to synthesize quartz on a commercial scale. German mineralogist Richard Nacken (1884\u20131971) achieved some success during the 1930s and 1940s. After the war, many laboratories attempted to grow large quartz crystals. In the United States, the U.S. Army Signal Corps contracted with Bell Laboratories and with the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, Ohio to synthesize crystals following Nacken's lead. (Prior to World War II, Brush Development produced piezoelectric crystals for record players.) By 1948, Brush Development had grown crystals that were 1.5 inches (3.8\u00a0cm) in diameter, the largest at that time. By the 1950s, hydrothermal synthesis techniques were producing synthetic quartz crystals on an industrial scale, and today virtually all the quartz crystal used in the modern electronics industry is synthetic.\nAn early use of the piezoelectricity of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One of the most common piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. Also called a quartz oscillator or resonator, it was first developed by Walter Guyton Cady in 1921. George Washington Pierce designed and patented quartz crystal oscillators in 1923. The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral; it is simply a clock that uses a quartz oscillator as its time reference. Warren Marrison created the first quartz oscillator clock based on the work of Cady and Pierce in 1927. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.\nAlmost all the industrial demand for quartz crystal (used primarily in electronics) is met with synthetic quartz produced by the hydrothermal process. However, synthetic crystals are less prized for use as gemstones. The popularity of crystal healing has increased the demand for natural quartz crystals, which are now often mined in developing countries using primitive mining methods, sometimes involving child labor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together, the \" trivium\" and the \"quadrivium\" comprised the seven liberal arts, and formed the basis of a liberal arts education in Western society until gradually displaced as a curricular structure by the \"studia humanitatis\" and its later offshoots, beginning with Petrarch in the 14th century. The seven classical arts were considered \"thinking skills\" and were distinguished from practical arts, such as medicine and architecture.\nThe four mathematical arts were recognized by Pythagoreans such as Nicomachus of Gerasa, but the use of \"quadrivium\" as a term for these four subjects has been attributed to Boethius, when he affirmed that the height of philosophy can be attained only following \"a sort of fourfold path\" (\"quodam quasi quadruvio\"). It was considered the foundation for the study of philosophy (sometimes called the \"liberal art \"par excellence\"\") and theology. The \"quadrivium\" was the upper division of medieval educational provision in the liberal arts, which comprised arithmetic (absolute number), music (relative number), geometry (magnitude at rest), and astronomy (magnitude in motion).\nEducationally, the \"trivium\" and the \"quadrivium\" imparted to the student the seven essential thinking skills of classical antiquity. Altogether the Seven Liberal Arts belonged to the so-called 'lower faculty' (of Arts), whereas Medicine, Jurisprudence (Law), and Theology were established in the three so-called 'higher' faculties. It was therefore quite common in the middle ages for lecturers in the lower trivium and/or quadrivium faculty to be students themselves in one of the higher faculties. Philosophy was typically \"neither\" a subject \"nor\" a faculty in its own right, but was rather present \"implicitly\" as an 'auxiliary tool' within the discourses of the higher faculties, especially theology; the separation of philosophy from theology and its elevation to an autonomous academic discipline were post-medieval developments.\nDisplacement of the quadrivium by other curricular approaches from the time of Petrarch gained momentum with the subsequent Renaissance emphasis on what became the modern humanities, one of four liberal arts of the modern era, alongside natural science (where much of the actual subject matter of the original quadrivium now resides), social science, and the arts; though it may appear that music in the quadrivium would be a modern branch of performing arts, it was then an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice, and effectively a branch of music theory more tightly bound to arithmetic than to musical expression.\nOrigins.\nThese four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by Plato in \"The Republic\" and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music).\nThe quadrivium is implicit in early Pythagorean writings and in the \"De nuptiis\" of Martianus Capella, although the term \"quadrivium\" was not used until Boethius, early in the sixth century. As Proclus wrote:\nThe Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold. A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion. Arithmetic studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.\nMedieval usage.\nAt many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of Master of Arts (after the BA). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the B.Phil and B.Litt. degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).\nThe study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by Proclus (AD 412\u2013485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand and geometry and cosmology on the other.\nThe subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of harmonics, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a monochord. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.\nModern usage.\nIn modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of number and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic being pure number, geometry number in space, music number in time, and astronomy number in space and time. Morris Kline classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.\nThis schema is sometimes referred to as \"classical education\", but it is more accurately a development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the classical education movement and at the independent Oundle School, in the United Kingdom.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An animal or machine that usually maintains a four-legged posture and moves using all four legs is said to be a quadruped (from Latin \"quattuor\" for \"four\", and \"pes\", \"pedis\" for \"foot\"). Quadruped animals are found among both vertebrates and invertebrates.\nQuadrupeds vs. tetrapods.\nAlthough the words 'quadruped' and 'tetrapod' are both derived from terms meaning 'four-footed', they have distinct meanings. A tetrapod is any member of the taxonomic unit Tetrapoda (which is defined by descent from a specific four-limbed ancestor), whereas a quadruped actually uses four limbs for locomotion. Not all tetrapods are quadrupeds and not all quadrupedal animals are tetrapods; some arthropods are adapted for four-footed locomotion, such as the raptorial Mantodea, or mantises, and the Nymphalidae, or brush-footed butterflies\u2014the largest butterfly family, with ~6000 species, including the well-known monarch (see photo).\nThe distinction between quadrupeds and tetrapods is important in evolutionary biology, particularly in the context of tetrapods whose limbs have adapted to other roles (e.g., arms and hands in the case of humans, wings in the case of birds and bats, and fins in the case of whales). All of these animals are tetrapods, but not all are quadrupeds. Even snakes, whose limbs have become vestigial or lost entirely, are, nevertheless, tetrapods.\nIn infants and for exercise.\nQuadrupedalism is sometimes referred to as being \"on all fours\", and is observed in crawling, especially by infants.\nIn the 20th century quadrupedal movement was popularized as a form of physical exercise by Georges Hebert. Kenichi Ito is a Japanese man famous for speed running on four limbs in competitions.\nOther human quadrupedalism.\nIn July 2005, in rural Turkey, scientists discovered five Turkish siblings who habitually walked on both their hands and feet. Unlike chimpanzees, which ambulate on their knuckles, the Ulas family walked on their palms, allowing them to preserve the dexterity of their fingers.\nQuadrupedal robots.\nBigDog is a dynamically stable quadruped robot created in 2005 by Boston Dynamics with Foster-Miller, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Harvard University Concord Field Station. Its successor was Spot.\nAlso by NASA JPL, in collaboration with University of California, Santa Barbara Robotics Lab, is RoboSimian, with emphasis on stability and deliberation. It has been demonstrated at the DARPA Robotics Challenge.\nPronograde posture.\nA related concept to quadrupedalism is pronogrady, or having a horizontal posture of the trunk. Although nearly all quadrupedal animals are pronograde, bipedal animals also have that posture, including many living birds and extinct dinosaurs.\nNonhuman apes with orthograde (vertical) backs may walk quadrupedally in what is called knuckle-walking.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a communicable disease, yet do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis. It is distinct from medical isolation, in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population.\nThe concept of quarantine is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include the village of Eyam in 1665 during the bubonic plague outbreak in England; East Samoa during the 1918 flu pandemic; the Diphtheria outbreak during the 1925 serum run to Nome, the 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak, the SARS pandemic, the Ebola pandemic and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020.\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country; in some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of biosecurity; for example, Australian biosecurity is governed by the single overarching \"Biosecurity Act 2015\".\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word \"quarantine\" comes from \"quarantena\" or \"quarantaine\", meaning \"forty days\", used in the Venetian language in the 14th and 15th centuries and also in France. The word is designated in the period during which all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death plague. The \"quarantena\" followed the \"trentino\", or \"thirty-day isolation\" period, first imposed in 1377 in the Republic of Ragusa, Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia).\nMerriam-Webster gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the movement of people and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests\". The word is also used as a verb.\nQuarantine is distinct from medical isolation, in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population.\nQuarantine may be used interchangeably with \"cordon sanitaire\", and although the terms are related, \"cordon sanitaire\" refers to the restriction of movement of people into or out of a defined geographic area, such as a community, in order to prevent an infection from spreading.\nHistory.\nMedieval.\nThe mandatory quarantine of special groups of patients, including those with leprosy, started early in Islamic history. A hadith going back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad advised individuals present in a region with a plague outbreak to remain in place, and advised healthy individuals to avoid traveling there. The Persian Muslim polymath Avicenna argued for controlling \"the spread of diseases\" in his medical encyclopedia The Canon [Al-Qanun] of Medicine, published in 1025. He also recommended quarantine for patients with infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis. In the early 8th century the sixth Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I segregated lepers from the general population, with some later sources crediting the caliph with opening a hospital. The separation of lepers from the general population was also practiced in the Moroccan city of Fez, where lepers were relocated to a cave system outside of the city. Dedicated leprosariums were built in the time of the Ottoman sultan Murad II in the 15th century, with some of the facilities operating for centuries. Since the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire has isolated travellers coming from epidemic areas during the Bubonic plague. A quarantine involved isolating healthy travellers for a period of time so that it could be ascertained if they were sick or not.\nThe word \"quarantine\" originates from \"quarantena\", the Venetian language form, meaning \"forty days\". This is due to the 40-day isolation of ships and people practised as a measure of disease prevention related to the plague. Between 1348 and 1359, the Black Death wiped out an estimated 30% of Europe's population, and a significant percentage of Asia's population. Such a disaster led governments to establish measures of containment to handle recurrent epidemics. A document from 1377 states that before entering the city-state of Ragusa in Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia), newcomers had to spend 30 days (a \"trentine\") in a restricted place (originally nearby islands) waiting to see whether the symptoms of Black Death would develop. In 1448 the Venetian Senate prolonged the waiting period to 40 days, thus giving birth to the term \"quarantine\". The forty-day quarantine proved to be an effective formula for handling outbreaks of the plague. Dubrovnik was the first city in Europe to set up quarantine sites such as the Lazzarettos of Dubrovnik where arriving ship personnel were held for up to 40 days. According to current estimates, the bubonic plague had a 37-day period from infection to death; therefore, the European quarantines would have been highly successful in determining the health of crews from potential trading and supply ships.\nOther diseases lent themselves to the practice of quarantine before and after the devastation of the plague. Those affected by leprosy were historically isolated long-term from society. Quarantine systems were enacted to prevent the spread of syphilis in Zurich in the 15th and 16th centuries, the advent of yellow fever in Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and the arrival of Asiatic cholera in 1831.\nVenice took the lead in measures to check the spread of plague, having appointed three guardians of public health in the first years of the Black Death (1348). The next record of preventive measures comes from Reggio/Modena in 1374. Venice founded the first lazaret (on a small island adjoining the city) in 1403. In 1467 Genoa followed the example of Venice, and in 1476 the old leper hospital of Marseille was converted into a plague hospital. The great lazaret of Marseille, perhaps the most complete of its kind, was founded in 1526 on the island of Pom\u00e8gues. The practise at all the Mediterranean lazarets did not differ from the English procedure in the Levantine and North African trade. On the arrival of cholera in 1831 some new lazarets were set up at western ports; notably, a very extensive establishment near Bordeaux. Afterwards, they were used for other purposes.\nModern history.\nEpidemics of yellow fever ravaged urban communities in North America throughout the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, the best-known examples being the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic and outbreaks in Georgia (1856) and Florida (1888). Cholera and smallpox epidemics continued throughout the nineteenth century, and plague epidemics affected Honolulu and San Francisco from 1899 until 1901. State governments generally relied on the \"cordon sanitaire\" as a geographic quarantine measure to control the movement of people into and out of affected communities. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, some communities instituted protective sequestration (sometimes referred to as \"reverse quarantine\") to keep the infected from introducing influenza into healthy populations. Additionally, the nature of the influenza virus that caused the 1918 pandemic gave rise to a public awareness of the dichotomy between \"crowd\" and \"home\" diseases. Simply quarantining the sick in isolation was ineffective in halting the spread of the disease, and new quarantine standards that extended regulations to public spaces became increasingly more common. Most Western countries implemented a range of containment strategies, including isolation, surveillance, and the closure of schools, churches, theatres, and public events.\nPeople were prevented from entering the Ashanti Empire at border checkpoints if they exhibited symptoms of smallpox. Those who discovered symptoms of the disease after entering Ashanti were quarantined in remote villages. In the 1830s, both the Ottoman Empire and Egypt established new quarantine systems. In 1831, Mehmet Ali of Egypt founded the Quarantine Board in Alexandria. In 1838, the Ottoman government installed the Supreme Council of Health, including the Quarantine Administration, in Istanbul. These two institutions set up permanent quarantines throughout the eastern Mediterranean, based on the western Mediterranean quarantine model. For example, at the port of \u0130zmir, all ships and their cargo would be inspected and those suspected of carrying the plague would be towed to separate docks and their personnel housed in separate buildings for a determined period of time. In Thessaly, along the Greek-Turkish border, all travellers entering and exiting the Ottoman Empire would be quarantined for 9\u201315 days. Upon appearance of the plague, the quarantine stations would be militarised and the Ottoman army would be involved in border control and disease monitoring.\nInternational conventions 1852\u20131927.\nSince 1852, several conferences were held involving European powers, with a view to uniform action in keeping out infection from the East and preventing its spread within Europe. All but that of 1897 were concerned with cholera. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by the United Kingdom for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the Suez Canal route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912. This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter. It was signed by 40 countries, and consisted of 160 articles. Ratifications by 16 of the signatories were exchanged in Paris on 7 October 1920. Another multilateral convention was signed in Paris on 21 June 1926, to replace that of 1912. It was signed by 58 countries worldwide, and consisted of 172 articles.\nIn Latin America, a series of regional sanitary conventions were concluded. Such a convention was concluded in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June 1904. A sanitary convention between the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay was concluded in Montevideo on 21 April 1914. The convention covers cases of Asiatic cholera, oriental plague and yellow fever. It was ratified by the Uruguayan government on 13 October 1914, by the Paraguayan government on 27 September 1917 and by the Brazilian government on 18 January 1921.\nSanitary conventions were also concluded between European states. A Soviet-Latvian sanitary convention was signed on 24 June 1922, for which ratifications were exchanged on 18 October 1923. A bilateral sanitary convention was concluded between the governments of Latvia and Poland on 7 July 1922, for which ratifications were exchanged on 7 April 1925. Another was concluded between the governments of Germany and Poland in Dresden on 18 December 1922, and entered into effect on 15 February 1923. Another one was signed between the governments of Poland and Romania on 20 December 1922. Ratifications were exchanged on 11 July 1923. The Polish government also concluded such a convention with the Soviet government on 7 February 1923, for which ratifications were exchanged on 8 January 1924. A sanitary convention was also concluded between the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia on 5 September 1925, for which ratifications were exchanged on 22 October 1926. A convention was signed between the governments of Germany and Latvia on 9 July 1926, for which ratifications were exchanged on 6 July 1927.\nIn 1897, the incubation period for this disease was determined and this was to be adopted for administrative purposes. The incubation period was comparatively short, some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a majority. The principle of disease notification was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify other governments of the existence of plague within their jurisdictions and state the measures of prevention being carried out to prevent its spread. The area declared infected was limited to the district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no spread. It was decided during the prevalence of plague, every country had the right to close its land borders to traffic. At the Red Sea, it was decided after discussion a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the incubation period of the disease and that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal up in quarantine at Port Said by night or by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal in quarantine and subject only to the landing of those who have plague.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of Andrew Speaker (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and Kaci Hickox (Ebola, 2014). During the 1957\u201358 influenza pandemic and the 1968 flu pandemic, several countries implemented measures to control spread of the disease. In addition, the World Health Organization applied a global influenza surveillance network.\nDuring the 1994 plague in India, many people were quarantined. Vessels and aircraft carrying passengers were fumigated.\nIn the SARS epidemic, thousands of Chinese people were quarantined and checkpoints to take temperatures were set up.\nMoving infected patients to isolation wards and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was ended in 2016; members of the 8th WHO Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.\nThe People's Republic of China has employed mass quarantines \u2013 firstly of the city of Wuhan and subsequently of all of the Hubei province (population 55.5 million) \u2013 in the COVID-19 pandemic. After a few weeks, the Italian government imposed lockdowns for the entire country (more than 60 million people) in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease there. India quarantined itself from the world for a period of one month. Most governments around the world restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak. By late 2020, the virus had already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.\nSignals and flags.\nPlain yellow, green, and even black flags have been used to symbolise disease in both ships and ports, with the colour yellow having a longer historical precedent, as a colour of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking colour for disease. The former flag used for the purpose was the \"Lima\" (L) flag, which is a mixture of yellow and black flags previously used. It is sometimes called the \"yellow jack\" but this was also a name for yellow fever, which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the colour of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag). The plain yellow flag (\"Quebec\" or Q in international maritime signal flags) probably derives its letter symbol for its initial use in \"quarantine\", but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite\u2014a ship that 'requests free pratique', i.e. that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.\nShips in quarantine today would fly either the Q flag alone, meaning \"My vessel is 'healthy' and I request free pratique\", or the double Q flag (QQ), meaning \"I require health clearance\".\nEthical and practical considerations.\nThe quarantining of people often raises questions of civil rights, especially in cases of long confinement or segregation from society, such as that of Mary Mallon (also known as Typhoid Mary), a typhoid fever carrier who was arrested and quarantined in 1907 and later spent the last 23 years and 7 months of her life in medical isolation at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island.\nThe United Nations and the Siracusa Principles.\nGuidance on when and how human rights can be restricted to prevent the spread of infectious disease is found in the Siracusa Principles, a non-binding document developed by the Siracusa International Institute for Criminal Justice and Human Rights and adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 1984. The Siracusa Principles state that restrictions on human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must meet standards of legality, evidence-based necessity, proportionality, and gradualism, noting that public health can be used as grounds for limiting certain rights if the state needs to take measures 'aimed at preventing disease or injury or providing care for the sick and injured.' Limitations on rights (such as quarantine) must be 'strictly necessary,' meaning that they must:\nIn addition, when quarantine is imposed, public health ethics specify that:\nFinally, the state is ethically obligated to guarantee that:\nPsychological impact.\nQuarantine can have adverse psychological effects on the quarantined, including post-traumatic stress, confusion, and anger. According to a \"Rapid Review\" published in The Lancet in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, \"Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\" Although youngsters appear to be less vulnerable to COVID-19, the side effects of the pandemic can be devastating. Quarantine from the pandemic led to an increase the prevalence of violence in the family, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Children and adolescents may be highly exposed to biopsychosocial stressors generated by the pandemic and once population's containment measures to reduce virus spread are required, they could be potentially affected by the disruption in daily life routine as a result of social isolation and their unseasoned ability to conceive and comprehend the short- and long-term consequences of this outbreak.\nShort-term quarantines, e.g. for decontamination.\nQuarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected anthrax attack, in which people are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a decontamination shower. For example, an article entitled \"Daily News workers quarantined\" describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent.\nThe February\u2013March 2003 issue of \"HazMat Magazine\" suggests that people be \"locked in a room until proper decon could be performed\", in the event of \"suspect anthrax\".\n\"Standard-Times\" senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Civil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have \"certain powers to quarantine people\".\nThe purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a vector.\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the ambulance bus, mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.\nStandard quarantine practices in different countries.\nAustralia.\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the \"Biosecurity Act 2015\". The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods, and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from DAFF. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$444, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$444,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome\u2014including the Torres Strait\u2014is the focus for quarantine activities that protect all Australians. As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world. If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.\nCanada.\nThere are three quarantine Acts of Parliament in Canada: \"Quarantine Act\" (humans), \"Health of Animals Act\" (animals), and \"Plant Protection Act\" (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the Canada Border Services Agency after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the \"Quarantine Act\".\nUnder the \"Quarantine Act\", all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with communicable diseases or vectors, they must disclose their whereabouts to a Border Services Officer. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any peace officer may arrest without warrant.\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\nUnder the \"Health of Animals Act\" and \"Plant Protection Act\", inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\nHong Kong.\nUnder the \"Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance\" (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\nThe law allows for health officers who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected, and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the Civil Aid Service, or member of the Auxiliary Medical Service can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\nUnited Kingdom.\nTo reduce the risk of introducing rabies from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an HM Customs and Excise pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as Pet Passports, where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate vaccinations.\nBritish maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896.\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Quarantine Act 1710 (9 Ann. c. 2). The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the Baltic region. A second act of Parliament, the Quarantine Act 1721 (8 Geo. 1. c. 10), was due to the prevalence of plague at Marseille and other places in Provence, France. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in continental Europe, and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in Messina. A rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into the Levant Trade Act 1752, an act regulating trade with the Levant, and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic region. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine and Customs Act 1788 (28 Geo. 3. c. 34) was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act of Parliament making quarantine only at discretion of the privy council, which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe, despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean bill of health from the Black Sea and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.\nAfter the passing of the Quarantine Act 1710 the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an indemnity. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the lazarets of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa, or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 Stangate Creek (on the Medway) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of floating hulks were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to dews) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of Royal Customs and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic region had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a yellow flag in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four leagues of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man.\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near Chatham (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with hides from Mogador in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the Nore, the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the Public Health Act 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the Local Government Board the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the Public Health Act 1875.\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to yellow fever, plague and cholera. Officers of Her Majesty's Customs, as well as of Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Board of Trade (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the port sanitary authority. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and bilge-water and water-ballast pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments. States (and tribal governments recognised by the federal government) have primary authority to quarantine people within their boundaries. Federal jurisdiction only applies to people moving across state or national borders, or people on federal property.\nFederal rules.\nCommunicable diseases for which apprehension, detention, or conditional release of people are authorised must be specified in Executive Orders of the President. As of 2014, these include Executive Orders 13295 13375, and 13674; the latest executive order specifies the following infectious diseases: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral haemorrhagic fevers (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, South American, and others not yet isolated or named), severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS), and influenza from a novel or re-emergent source.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for quarantine decisions, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. As of 21 March 2017, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regulations specify:\nThe rules:\nUS quarantine facilities.\nThe Division of Global Migration Health (DGMH) of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) operates small quarantine facilities at a number of US ports of entry. As of 2014, these included one land crossing (in El Paso, Texas) and 19 international airports.\nBesides the port of entry where it is located, each station is also responsible for quarantining potentially infected travellers entering through any ports of entry in its assigned region. These facilities are fairly small; each one is operated by a few staff members and capable of accommodating 1\u20132 travellers for a short observation period. Cost estimates for setting up a temporary larger facility, capable of accommodating 100 to 200 travellers for several weeks, have been published by the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) in 2008 of the Transportation Research Board.\nUS quarantine of imported goods.\nThe United States puts immediate quarantines on imported products if a contagious disease is identified and can be traced back to a certain shipment or product. All imports will also be quarantined if the disease appears in other countries. According to Title http:// , these statutes provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services peacetime and wartime authority to control the movement of people into and within the United States to prevent the spread of communicable disease.\nHistory of quarantine laws in the US.\nQuarantine law began in Colonial America in 1663, when in an attempt to curb an outbreak of smallpox, the city of New York established a quarantine. In the 1730s, the city built a quarantine station on the Bedloe's Island. The Philadelphia Lazaretto was the first quarantine hospital in the United States, built in 1799, in Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. There are similar national landmarks such as the Columbia River Quarantine Station, Swinburne Island and Angel Island. The Pest House in Concord, Massachusetts was used as early as 1752 to quarantine those with cholera, tuberculosis and smallpox.\nIn early June 1832, during the cholera epidemic in New York, Governor Enos Throop called a special session of the Legislature for 21 June, to pass a Public Health Act by both Houses of the State Legislature. It included to a strict quarantine along the Upper and Lower New York-Canadian frontier. In addition, New York City Mayor Walter Browne established a quarantine against all peoples and products of Europe and Asia, which prohibited ships from approaching closer than 300 yards to the city, and all vehicles were ordered to stop 1.5 miles away.\nThe Immigrant Inspection Station on Ellis Island, built in 1892, is often mistakenly assumed to have been a quarantine station, however its marine hospital (Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital) only qualified as a contagious disease facility to handle less virulent diseases like measles, trachoma and less advanced stages of tuberculosis and diphtheria; those affected by smallpox, yellow fever, cholera, leprosy or typhoid fever, could neither be received nor treated there.\nMary Mallon was quarantined in 1907 under the Greater New York Charter, Sections 1169\u20131170, which permitted the New York City Board of Health to \"remove to a proper place...any person sick with any contagious, pestilential or infectious disease.\"\nDuring the 1918 flu pandemic, people were also quarantined. Most commonly suspect cases of infectious diseases are requested to voluntarily quarantine themselves, and Federal and local quarantine statutes only have been uncommonly invoked since then, including for a suspected smallpox case in 1963.\nThe 1944 Public Health Service Act \"to apprehend, detain, and examine certain infected persons who are peculiarly likely to cause the interstate spread of disease\" clearly established the federal government's quarantine authority for the first time. It gave the United States Public Health Service responsibility for preventing the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States, and expanded quarantine authority to include incoming aircraft. The act states that \"...any individual reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease in a qualifying stage and...if found to be infected, may be detained for such time and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary.\"\nNo federal quarantine orders were issued from 1963 until 2020, as American citizens were evacuated from China during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotable quarantines.\nEyam village, 1665 (plague).\nEyam was a village in Britain that imposed a \"cordon sanitaire\" on itself to stop the spread of the bubonic plague to other communities in 1665. The plague ran its course over 14 months and one account states that it killed at least 260 villagers. The church in Eyam has a record of 273 individuals who were victims of the plague.\nConvict ship \"Surry\", Sydney Harbour, 1814 (typhoid).\nOn 28 July 1814, the convict ship \"Surry\" arrived in Sydney Harbour from England. Forty-six people had died of typhoid during the voyage, including 36 convicts, and the ship was placed in quarantine on the North Shore. Convicts were landed, and a camp was established in the immediate vicinity of what is now Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli. This was the first site in Australia to be used for quarantine purposes.\n'Typhoid Mary' (US), 1907\u20131910 and 1915\u20131938.\nMary Mallon was a cook who was found to be a carrier of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, the cause of typhoid fever, and was forcibly isolated from 1907 to 1910. At least 53 cases of the infection were traced to her, and three deaths. Subsequently, she spent a further 23 years in isolation prior to her death in 1938. The presence of the bacteria in her gallbladder was confirmed on autopsy.\nEast Samoa, 1918 (flu pandemic).\nDuring the 1918 flu pandemic, the then Governor of American Samoa, John Martin Poyer, imposed a full protective sequestration of the islands from all incoming ships, successfully preventing influenza from infecting the population and thus achieving zero deaths within the territory. In contrast, the neighbouring New Zealand-controlled Western Samoa was among the hardest hit, with a 90% infection rate and over 20% of its adults dying from the disease. This failure by the New Zealand government to prevent and contain the Spanish Flu subsequently rekindled Samoan anti-colonial sentiments that led to its eventual independence.\nGruinard Island, 1942\u20131990 (anthrax).\nIn 1942, during World War II, British forces tested out their biological weapons program on Gruinard Island and infected it with anthrax. Subsequently, a quarantine order was placed on the island. The quarantine was lifted in 1990, when the island was declared safe, and a flock of sheep was released onto the island.\nApollo series space explorers, 1969\u20131971.\nBetween 24 July 1969 and 9 February 1971, the astronauts of Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 14, were quarantined (in each case for a total of 21 days) after returning to Earth, initially where they were recovered, and then were transferred to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory, to prevent possible interplanetary contamination by microorganisms from the Moon. All lunar samples were also held in the biosecure environment of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory for initial assay.\nYugoslavia, 1972 (smallpox).\nThe 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak was the final outbreak of smallpox in Europe. The World Health Organization fought the outbreak with extensive quarantine and a \"cordon sanitaire\", and the government instituted martial law.\nCase of Kaci Hickox' return to US, 2014 (Ebola).\nIn 2014, Kaci Hickox, a Doctors Without Borders nurse from Maine, legally battled 21-day quarantines imposed by the states of New Jersey and Maine after returning home from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. \"Hickox was sequestered in a medical tent for days because New Jersey announced new Ebola regulations the day she arrived. She eventually was allowed to travel to Maine, where the state sought to impose a 'voluntary quarantine' before trying and failing to create a buffer between her and others. A state judge rejected attempts to restrict her movements, saying she posed no threat as long as she wasn't demonstrating any symptoms of Ebola. Hickox said health care professionals like those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 not politicians like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Maine Gov. Paul LePage \u2013 should be in charge of making decisions that are grounded in science, not fear.\"\nCOVID-19 pandemic, 2020\u20132023.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple governmental actors enacted quarantines in an effort to curb the rapid spread of the virus. Quarantine-like restrictions on movement included curfews and restrictions variously described as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns or lockdowns.\nOn 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later\u2014around a third of the world's population.\nHubei.\nIn Hubei, the origin of the epidemic, a \"cordon sanitaire\" was imposed on Wuhan and other major cities in China, affecting around 500 million people, which is unprecedented in scale in human history, to limit the rate of spread of the disease. The 'lockdown' of Wuhan, and subsequently a wider-scale 'lockdown' throughout Hubei province, began on 23 January 2020. At this stage, the spread of the virus in mainland China was running at approximately 50% growth in cases per day. On 8 February, the daily rate of spread fell below 10%.\nItaly.\nAs the outbreak spread there, beginning 22 February 2020, a \"cordon sanitaire\" was imposed on a group of at least 10 different municipalities in Northern Italy, effectively quarantining more than 50,000 people. This followed a second day when the declared detected cases leapt enormously (the period from 21 to 23 February saw daily increases of 567%, 295% and 90% respectively). A week later the rate of increase of cases in Italy was significantly reduced (the period from 29 February to 4 March saw daily increases of 27%, 50%, 20%, 23%, and 23%).\nOn 8 March 2020, a much wider region of Northern Italy was placed under quarantine restrictions, involving around 16 million people. On the next day, the quarantine was extended to the whole of Italy, effective on 10 March 2020, placing roughly 60 million people under quarantine.\nA team of Chinese experts, together with some 31 tonnes of supplies, arrived in Rome on 13 March 2020 to help Italy fight the virus.\nOn 22 March 2020, Russia sent nine Ilyushin 76 planes with expert virologists, epidemiologists, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals in a humanitarian aid operation that Italian media dubbed \"From Russia With Love\".\nEventually the lockdown was extended until 3 May, although starting from 14 April stationery shops, bookshops, and children clothing's shops were allowed to open.\nOn 26 April 2020, the so-called \"Phase 2\" was announced, to start from 4 May. Movements across regions were still forbidden, while movements between municipalities were allowed only to visit relatives or for work and health reasons. Moreover, closed factories could re-open, but schools, bars, restaurants, and barbers were still closed.\nAs at 4 May 2020, when new cases were running around 0.5%, (c.\u20091600 persons) per day and consistently falling, it was expected that museums and retailers might reopen from 18 May, while hairdressers, bars and restaurants were expected to reopen fully on 1 June.\nRegional lockdowns were subsequently imposed as further waves of the virus spread through the country.\nRest of Europe.\nAs cases of the virus spread to and took hold in more European countries, many followed the earlier examples of China and Italy and began instituting policies of lockdown. Notable among these were Ireland (where schools were closed in mid March for the rest of the month, and limits were set on sizes of meetings), Spain (where a lockdown was announced on 14 March), Czech Republic, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Poland, Turkey, and France, while the United Kingdom noticeably lagged behind in adopting such measures.\nAs of 18 March 2020, more than 250 million people were in lockdown across Europe.\nRest of the world.\nIn the immediate context of the start of the pandemic in Wuhan, countries neighbouring or close to China adopted a cautious approach. For example, Sri Lanka, Macau, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea had all imposed some degree of lockdown by 19 February. As countries across the world reported escalating case numbers and deaths, more and more countries began to announce travel restrictions and lockdowns. Africa and Latin America were relatively delayed in the spread of the virus, but even on these continents, countries began to impose travel bans and lockdowns. Brazil and Mexico began lockdowns in late February and much of the rest of Latin America followed suit in early March. Much of Africa was on lockdown by the start of April. Kenya, for example, blocked certain international flights and subsequently placed a ban on 'global' meetings.\nAs of 1 April 2020[ [update]], more than 280\u00a0million people, or about 86% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, 59 million people were in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in lockdown in India.\nSelf-quarantine.\nSelf-quarantine (or \"self-isolation\") is a popular term that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which spread to most countries in 2020. Citizens able to do so were encouraged to stay home to limit the spread of the disease. Health specialists advise that self-quarantine lasts 14 days. Two weeks gives the necessary time for them to determine whether or not they will become ill and become contagious to others.\nOther uses.\nU.S. President John F. Kennedy euphemistically referred to the U.S. Navy's interdiction of shipping en route to Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis as a \"quarantine\" rather than a blockade, because a quarantine is a legal act in peacetime, whereas a blockade is defined as an act of aggression under the U.N. Charter.\nIn computer science, \"quarantining\" describes putting files infected by computer viruses into a special directory, so as to eliminate the threat they pose, without irreversibly deleting them.\nThe Spanish term for quarantine, \"(la) cuarentena\", refers also to the period of postpartum confinement in which a new mother and her baby are sheltered from the outside world.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is sometimes known as a quasi-stellar object, abbreviated QSO. The emission from an AGN is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc. Gas in the disc falling towards the black hole heats up and releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The radiant energy of quasars is enormous; the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than that of a galaxy such as the Milky Way. Quasars are usually categorized as a subclass of the more general category of AGN. The redshifts of quasars are of cosmological origin.\nThe term quasar originated as a contraction of \"quasi-stellar \"[star-like]\" radio source\"\u2014because they were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin\u2014and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths, they resembled faint, star-like points of light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the Hubble Space Telescope, have shown that quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host galaxies are strongly interacting or merging galaxies. As with other categories of AGN, the observed properties of a quasar depend on many factors, including the mass of the black hole, the rate of gas accretion, the orientation of the accretion disc relative to the observer, the presence or absence of a jet, and the degree of obscuration by gas and dust within the host galaxy.\nAbout a million quasars have been identified with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and between 2-3 million identified in photometric catalogs. The nearest known quasar is about 600 million light-years from Earth, while the record for the most distant known AGN is at a redshift of 10.1, corresponding to a comoving distance of 31.6 billion light-years, or a look-back time of 13.2 billion years.\nQuasar discovery surveys have shown that quasar activity was more common in the distant past; the peak epoch was approximately 10\u00a0billion years ago. Concentrations of multiple quasars are known as large quasar groups and may constitute some of the largest known structures in the universe if the observed groups are good tracers of mass distribution.\nNaming.\nThe term \"quasar\" was first used in an article by astrophysicist Hong-Yee Chiu in May 1964, in \"Physics Today\", to describe certain astronomically puzzling objects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So far, the clumsily long name \"quasi-stellar radio sources\" is used to describe these objects. Because the nature of these objects is entirely unknown, it is hard to prepare a short, appropriate nomenclature for them so that their essential properties are obvious from their name. For convenience, the abbreviated form \"quasar\" will be used throughout this paper.\nHistory of observation and interpretation.\nBackground.\nBetween 1917 and 1922, it became clear from work by Heber Doust Curtis, Ernst \u00d6pik and others that some objects (\"nebulae\") seen by astronomers were in fact distant galaxies like the Milky Way. But when radio astronomy began in the 1950s, astronomers detected, among the galaxies, a small number of anomalous objects with properties that defied explanation.\nThe objects emitted large amounts of radiation of many frequencies, but no source could be located optically, or in some cases only a faint and point-like object somewhat like a distant star. The spectral lines of these objects, which identify the chemical elements of which the object is composed, were also extremely strange and defied explanation. Some of them changed their luminosity very rapidly in the optical range and even more rapidly in the X-ray range, suggesting an upper limit on their size, perhaps no larger than the Solar System. This implies an extremely high power density. Considerable discussion took place over what these objects might be. They were described as \"quasi-stellar\" [meaning: star-like] \"radio sources\", or \"quasi-stellar objects\" (QSOs), a name which reflected their unknown nature, and this became shortened to \"quasar\".\nEarly observations (1960s and earlier).\nThe first quasars (3C 48 and 3C 273) were discovered in the late 1950s, as radio sources in all-sky radio surveys. They were first noted as radio sources with no corresponding visible object. Using small telescopes and the Lovell Telescope as an interferometer, they were shown to have a very small angular size. By 1960, hundreds of these objects had been recorded and published in the Third Cambridge Catalogue while astronomers scanned the skies for their optical counterparts. In 1963, a definite identification of the radio source 3C 48 with an optical object was published by Allan Sandage and Thomas A. Matthews. Astronomers had detected what appeared to be a faint blue star at the location of the radio source and obtained its spectrum, which contained many unknown broad emission lines. The anomalous spectrum defied interpretation.\nBritish-Australian astronomer John Bolton made many early observations of quasars, including a breakthrough in 1962. Another radio source, 3C 273, was predicted to undergo five occultations by the Moon. Measurements taken by Cyril Hazard and John Bolton during one of the occultations using the Parkes Radio Telescope allowed Maarten Schmidt to find a visible counterpart to the radio source and obtain an optical spectrum using the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar. This spectrum revealed the same strange emission lines. Schmidt was able to demonstrate that these were likely to be the ordinary spectral lines of hydrogen redshifted by 15.8%\u2014at the time, a high redshift, since only a handful of much fainter galaxies were known to have a higher redshift. If this was due to the physical motion of the \"star\", then 3C 273 was receding at an enormous velocity, around , far beyond the speed of any known star and defying any obvious explanation. Nor would an extreme velocity help to explain 3C 273's huge radio emissions. If the redshift was cosmological (now known to be correct), the large distance implied that 3C 273 was far more luminous than any galaxy, but much more compact. Also, 3C 273 was bright enough to detect on archival photographs dating back to the 1900s; it was found to be variable on yearly timescales, implying that a substantial fraction of the light was emitted from a region less than 1\u00a0light-year in size, tiny compared to a galaxy.\nAlthough it raised many questions, Schmidt's discovery quickly revolutionized quasar observation. The strange spectrum of 3C 48 was quickly identified by Schmidt, Greenstein and Oke as hydrogen and magnesium redshifted by 37%. Shortly afterwards, two more quasar spectra in 1964 and five more in 1965 were also confirmed as ordinary light that had been redshifted to an extreme degree. \nDevelopment of physical understanding (1960s).\nAn extreme redshift could imply great distance and velocity, but could also be due to extreme mass or some unknown laws of nature. Extreme velocity and distance would also imply immense power output, which lacked explanation. The small sizes were confirmed by interferometry and by observing how quickly the quasar as a whole varied in output, and by their inability to be seen with even the most powerful visible-light telescopes as anything more than faint, starlike points of light. However, if they were small and far away, their power output would have to be immense for their size, making them difficult to explain. Equally, if they were very small and much closer to this galaxy, it would be easy to explain their apparent power output, but less easy to explain their redshifts and lack of detectable movement against the background of the universe.\nSchmidt noted that redshift is also associated with the expansion of the universe, as codified in Hubble's law. If the measured redshift was due to relative velocity caused by inflation, then this would support an interpretation of very distant objects with extraordinarily high luminosity and power output, far beyond any object observed to date. This extreme luminosity would also explain the large radio signal. Schmidt concluded that 3C 273 could either be an individual star around 10\u00a0km wide within (or near to) this galaxy, or a distant active galactic nucleus. Schmidt stated that for quasars to be distant and extremely powerful objects seemed more likely to be correct.\nSchmidt's explanation for the high redshift was not widely accepted at the time. A major concern was the enormous amount of energy these objects would have to be radiating, if they were distant. In the 1960s no commonly accepted mechanism could account for this. The currently accepted explanation, that it is due to matter in an accretion disc falling into a supermassive black hole, was only suggested in 1964 by Edwin E. Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich, and even then it was rejected by many astronomers, as at this time the existence of black holes at all was widely seen as theoretical.\nVarious explanations were proposed during the 1960s and 1970s, each with their own problems. It was suggested that quasars were nearby objects, and that their redshift was not due to the expansion of space but rather to light escaping a deep gravitational well. This would require a massive object, which would also explain the high luminosities. However, a star of sufficient mass to produce the measured redshift would be unstable and in excess of the Hayashi limit. Quasars also show forbidden spectral emission lines, previously only seen in hot gaseous nebulae of low density, which would be too diffuse to both generate the observed power and fit within a deep gravitational well. There were also serious concerns regarding the idea of cosmologically distant quasars. One strong argument against them was that they implied energies that were far in excess of known energy conversion processes, including nuclear fusion. There were suggestions that quasars were made of some hitherto unknown stable form of antimatter in similarly unknown types of region of space, and that this might account for their brightness. Others speculated that quasars were a white hole end of a wormhole, or a chain reaction of numerous supernovae.\nEventually, starting from about the 1970s, many lines of evidence (including the first X-ray space observatories, knowledge of black holes and modern models of cosmology) gradually demonstrated that the quasar redshifts are genuine and due to the expansion of space, that quasars are in fact as powerful and as distant as Schmidt and some other astronomers had suggested, and that their energy source is matter from an accretion disc falling onto a supermassive black hole. This included crucial evidence from optical and X-ray viewing of quasar host galaxies, finding of \"intervening\" absorption lines, which explained various spectral anomalies, observations from gravitational lensing, Gunn's 1971 finding that galaxies containing quasars showed the same redshift as the quasars, and Kristian's 1973 finding that the \"fuzzy\" surrounding of many quasars was consistent with a less luminous host galaxy.\nThis model also fits well with other observations suggesting that many or even most galaxies have a massive central black hole. It would also explain why quasars are more common in the early universe: as a quasar draws matter from its accretion disc, there comes a point when there is less matter nearby, and energy production falls off or ceases, as the quasar becomes a more ordinary type of galaxy.\nThe accretion-disc energy-production mechanism was finally modeled in the 1970s, and black holes were also directly detected (including evidence showing that supermassive black holes could be found at the centers of this and many other galaxies), which resolved the concern that quasars were too luminous to be a result of very distant objects or that a suitable mechanism could not be confirmed to exist in nature. By 1987 it was \"well accepted\" that this was the correct explanation for quasars, and the cosmological distance and energy output of quasars was accepted by almost all researchers.\nModern observations (1970s and onward).\nLater it was found that not all quasars have strong radio emission; in fact only about 10% are \"radio-loud\". Hence the name \"QSO\" (quasi-stellar object) is used (in addition to \"quasar\") to refer to these objects, further categorized into the \"radio-loud\" and the \"radio-quiet\" classes. The discovery of the quasar had large implications for the field of astronomy in the 1960s, including drawing physics and astronomy closer together.\nIn 1979, the gravitational lens effect predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity was confirmed observationally for the first time with images of the double quasar 0957+561.\nA study published in February 2021 showed that there are more quasars in one direction (towards Hydra) than in the opposite direction, seemingly indicating that the Earth is moving in that direction. But the direction of this dipole is about 28\u00b0 away from the direction of the Earth's motion relative to the cosmic microwave background radiation.\nIn March 2021, a collaboration of scientists, related to the Event Horizon Telescope, presented, for the first time, a polarized-based image of a black hole, specifically the black hole at the center of Messier 87, an elliptical galaxy approximately 55 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo, revealing the forces giving rise to quasars.\nCurrent understanding.\nIt is now known that quasars are distant but extremely luminous objects, so any light that reaches the Earth is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.\nQuasars inhabit the centers of active galaxies and are among the most luminous, powerful, and energetic objects known in the universe, emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way, which contains 200\u2013400\u00a0billion stars. This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of radio emission and of gamma-rays. With high-resolution imaging from ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope, the \"host galaxies\" surrounding the quasars have been detected in some cases. These galaxies are normally too dim to be seen against the glare of the quasar, except with special techniques. Most quasars, with the exception of 3C 273, whose average apparent magnitude is 12.9, cannot be seen with small telescopes.\nQuasars are believed\u2014and in many cases confirmed\u2014to be powered by accretion of material into supermassive black holes in the nuclei of distant galaxies, as suggested in 1964 by Edwin Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich. Light and other radiation cannot escape from within the event horizon of a black hole. The energy produced by a quasar is generated outside the black hole, by gravitational stresses and immense friction within the material nearest to the black hole, as it orbits and falls inward. The huge luminosity of quasars results from the accretion discs of central supermassive black holes, which can convert between 5.7% and 32% of the mass of an object into energy, compared to just 0.7% for the p\u2013p chain nuclear fusion process that dominates the energy production in Sun-like stars. Central masses of 105 to 109 solar masses have been measured in quasars by using reverberation mapping. Several dozen nearby large galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy, that do not have an active center and do not show any activity similar to a quasar, are confirmed to contain a similar supermassive black hole in their nuclei (galactic center). Thus it is now thought that all large galaxies have a black hole of this kind, but only a small fraction have sufficient matter in the right kind of orbit at their center to become active and power radiation in such a way as to be seen as quasars.\nThis also explains why quasars were more common in the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. This means that it is possible that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy that depended on the black-hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now quiescent because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.\nThe matter accreting onto the black hole is unlikely to fall directly in, but will have some angular momentum around the black hole, which will cause the matter to collect into an accretion disc. Quasars may also be ignited or re-ignited when normal galaxies merge and the black hole is infused with a fresh source of matter. In fact, it has been suggested that a quasar could form when the Andromeda Galaxy collides with the Milky Way galaxy in approximately 3\u20135\u00a0billion years.\nIn the 1980s, unified models were developed in which quasars were classified as a particular kind of active galaxy, and a consensus emerged that in many cases it is simply the viewing angle that distinguishes them from other active galaxies, such as blazars and radio galaxies.\nThe highest-redshift quasar known (as of \u00a02024[ [update]]) is UHZ1, with a redshift of approximately 10.1, which corresponds to a comoving distance of approximately 31.7 billion light-years from Earth (these distances are much larger than the distance light could travel in the universe's 13.8-billion-year history because the universe is expanding).\nProperties.\nMore than quasars have been found (as of July 2023), most from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. All observed quasar spectra have redshifts between 0.056 and 10.1 (as of 2024), which means they range between 600 million and 30\u00a0billion light-years away from Earth. Because of the great distances to the farthest quasars and the finite velocity of light, they and their surrounding space appear as they existed in the very early universe.\nThe power of quasars originates from supermassive black holes that are believed to exist at the core of most galaxies. The Doppler shifts of stars near the cores of galaxies indicate that they are revolving around tremendous masses with very steep gravity gradients, suggesting black holes.\nAlthough quasars appear faint when viewed from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most luminous objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C 273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of \u221226.7. From a distance of about 33\u00a0light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as the Sun. This quasar's luminosity is, therefore, about 4\u00a0trillion (4\u00d71012) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the Milky Way. This assumes that the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei billions of years ago but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be pointed toward the Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases it is likely that the brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth. Such quasars are called blazars.\nThe hyperluminous quasar APM\u00a008279+5255 was, when discovered in 1998, given an absolute magnitude of \u221232.2. High-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope and the 10\u00a0m Keck Telescope revealed that this system is gravitationally lensed. A study of the gravitational lensing of this system suggests that the light emitted has been magnified by a factor of ~10. It is still substantially more luminous than nearby quasars such as 3C 273.\nQuasars were much more common in the early universe than they are today. This discovery by Maarten Schmidt in 1967 was early strong evidence against steady-state cosmology and in favor of the Big Bang cosmology. Quasars show the locations where supermassive black holes are growing rapidly (by accretion). Detailed simulations reported in 2021 showed that galaxy structures, such as spiral arms, use gravitational forces to 'put the brakes on' gas that would otherwise orbit galaxy centers forever; instead the braking mechanism enabled the gas to fall into the supermassive black holes, releasing enormous radiant energies. These black holes co-evolve with the mass of stars in their host galaxy in a way not fully understood at present. One idea is that jets, radiation and winds created by the quasars shut down the formation of new stars in the host galaxy, a process called \"feedback\". The jets that produce strong radio emission in some quasars at the centers of clusters of galaxies are known to have enough power to prevent the hot gas in those clusters from cooling and falling on to the central galaxy.\nQuasars' luminosities are variable, with time scales that range from months to hours. This means that quasars generate and emit their energy from a very small region, since each part of the quasar would have to be in contact with other parts on such a time scale as to allow the coordination of the luminosity variations. This would mean that a quasar varying on a time scale of a few weeks cannot be larger than a few light-weeks across. The emission of large amounts of power from a small region requires a power source far more efficient than the nuclear fusion that powers stars. The conversion of gravitational potential energy to radiation by infalling to a black hole converts between 6% and 32% of the mass to energy, compared to 0.7% for the conversion of mass to energy in a star like the Sun. It is the only process known that can produce such high power over a very long term. (Stellar explosions such as supernovas and gamma-ray bursts, and direct matter\u2013antimatter annihilation, can also produce very high power output, but supernovae only last for days, and the universe does not appear to have had large amounts of antimatter at the relevant times.)\nSince quasars exhibit all the properties common to other active galaxies such as Seyfert galaxies, the emission from quasars can be readily compared to those of smaller active galaxies powered by smaller supermassive black holes. To create a luminosity of 1040\u00a0watts (the typical brightness of a quasar), a supermassive black hole would have to consume the material equivalent of 10 solar masses per year. The brightest known quasars devour 1,000 solar masses of material every year (equivalent to 10 Earths per second). Quasar luminosities can vary considerably over time, depending on their surroundings. Since it is difficult to fuel quasars for many billions of years, after a quasar finishes accreting the surrounding gas and dust, it becomes an ordinary galaxy.\nRadiation from quasars is partially \"nonthermal\" (i.e., not due to black-body radiation), and approximately 10% are observed to also have jets and lobes like those of radio galaxies that also carry significant (but poorly understood) amounts of energy in the form of particles moving at relativistic speeds. Extremely high energies might be explained by several mechanisms (see Fermi acceleration and Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration). Quasars can be detected over the entire observable electromagnetic spectrum, including radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray and even gamma rays. Most quasars are brightest in their rest-frame ultraviolet wavelength of 121.6\u00a0nm Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen, but due to the tremendous redshifts of these sources, that peak luminosity has been observed as far to the red as 900.0\u00a0nm, in the near infrared. A minority of quasars show strong radio emission, which is generated by jets of matter moving close to the speed of light. When viewed downward, these appear as blazars and often have regions that seem to move away from the center faster than the speed of light (superluminal expansion).This is an optical illusion due to the properties of special relativity.\nQuasar redshifts are measured from the strong spectral lines that dominate their visible and ultraviolet emission spectra. These lines are brighter than the continuous spectrum. They exhibit Doppler broadening corresponding to a mean speed of several percent of the speed of light. Fast motions strongly indicate a large mass. Emission lines of hydrogen (mainly of the Lyman series and Balmer series), helium, carbon, magnesium, iron and oxygen are the brightest lines. The atoms emitting these lines range from neutral to highly ionized, leaving it highly charged. This wide range of ionization shows that the gas is highly irradiated by the quasar, not merely hot, and not by stars, which cannot produce such a wide range of ionization.\nLike all (unobscured) active galaxies, quasars can be strong X-ray sources. Radio-loud quasars can also produce X-rays and gamma rays by inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by the radio-emitting electrons in the jet.\n\"Iron quasars\" show strong emission lines resulting from low-ionization iron (Fe\u00a0II), such as IRAS\u00a018508-7815.\nSpectral lines, reionization, and the early universe.\nQuasars also provide some clues as to the end of the Big Bang's reionization. The oldest known quasars (\"z\"\u00a0=\u00a06) display a Gunn\u2013Peterson trough and have absorption regions in front of them indicating that the intergalactic medium at that time was neutral gas. More recent quasars show no absorption region, but rather their spectra contain a spiky area known as the Lyman-alpha forest; this indicates that the intergalactic medium has undergone reionization into plasma, and that neutral gas exists only in small clouds.\nThe intense production of ionizing ultraviolet radiation is also significant, as it would provide a mechanism for reionization to occur as galaxies form. Despite this, current theories suggest that quasars were not the primary source of reionization; the primary causes of reionization were probably the earliest generations of stars, known as population III stars (possibly 70%), and dwarf galaxies (very early small high-energy galaxies) (possibly 30%).\nQuasars show evidence of elements heavier than helium, indicating that galaxies underwent a massive phase of star formation, creating population III stars between the time of the Big Bang and the first observed quasars. Light from these stars may have been observed in 2005 using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, although this observation remains to be confirmed.\nSubtypes.\nThe taxonomy of quasars includes various subtypes representing subsets of the quasar population having distinct properties.\nRole in celestial reference systems.\nBecause quasars are extremely distant, bright, and small in apparent size, they are useful reference points in establishing a measurement grid on the sky.\nThe International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) is based on hundreds of extra-galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 arcsecond or better, which is orders of magnitude more precise than the best optical measurements.\nMultiple quasars.\nA grouping of two or more quasars on the sky can result from a chance alignment, where the quasars are not physically associated, from actual physical proximity, or from the effects of gravity bending the light of a single quasar into two or more images by gravitational lensing. Discerning between these cases can be difficult.\nLensed multiples.\nA multiple-image quasar is a quasar whose light undergoes gravitational lensing, resulting in double, triple or quadruple images of the same quasar. The first such gravitational lens to be discovered was the double-imaged quasar Q0957+561 (or Twin Quasar) in 1979.\nAn example of a triply lensed quasar is PG1115+08.\nSeveral quadruple-image quasars are known, including the Einstein Cross and the Cloverleaf Quasar, with the first such discoveries happening in the mid-1980s.\nThe Gaia astrometric all sky survey has already discovered a dozen or so Einstein crosses, and continued work with its data releases has potential to identify many more still.\nA relatively recent topic of research called \"time delay cosmology\" uses multiple-lens quasars to probe the Hubble tension. When differing images of a single source have differing path lengths, that difference can be measured via the time delay between flickers in the images. The path length difference plus modelling the deflecting mass can be used to estimate the absolute distance of the source; that enables a cosmic distance measurement independent of the standard cosmic distance ladder. Some results from 2020, claiming precision of 2-3%, were later determined to suffer from systematic errors due to overly strong assumptions; in 2025, the TDCOSMO collaboration significantly weakened the assumptions, publishing a result of (around 5% precision).\nPhysical multiples.\nWhen two quasars appear to be very close to each other as seen from Earth (separated by a few arcseconds or less), they are commonly referred to as a \"double quasar\". If a visual pair are shown to be also close together in space (i.e. observed to have similar redshifts), they are termed a \"quasar pair\", or as a \"binary quasar\" or \"dual quasar\" if they are close enough that their host galaxies are likely to be physically interacting.\nAs quasars are overall rare objects in the universe, the probability of three or more separate quasars being found near the same physical location is very low, and determining whether the system is closely separated physically requires significant observational effort, which most quasar-like sources never receive; as a result, not many physical multiple quasars are known.\nPhysical multiple quasars can be important mechanisms to study galactic interactions and evolution, especially in the early universe, such as when star formation and galactic activity were highest (redshift z=2).\nThe Gaia astrometric all sky survey, in its first foray into multiple quasars, suggested that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-discovered quasar J0749+2255 was in fact a dual quasar. Followup observations by Hubble, Keck, Gemini, Chandra and VLA confirmed the true nature of this source, an interacting galaxy pair at redshift z=2.17. Future work with Gaia data releases can be expected to significantly expand the catalog of both lensed and physical multiple quasars, and associated galactic research.\nThe first true triple quasar was found in 2007 by observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. LBQS 1429-008 (or QQQ J1432-0106) was first observed in 1989 and at the time was found to be a double quasar. When astronomers discovered the third member, they confirmed that the sources were separate and not the result of gravitational lensing. This triple quasar has a redshift of \"z\" = 2.076. The components are separated by an estimated 30\u201350\u00a0kiloparsecs (roughly 97,000\u2013160,000 light-years), which is typical for interacting galaxies. In 2013, the second true triplet of quasars, QQQ\u00a0J1519+0627, was found with a redshift \"z\" = 1.51, the whole system fitting within a physical separation of 25\u00a0kpc (about 80,000 light-years).\nThe first true quadruple quasar system was discovered in 2015 at a redshift \"z\"\u00a0=\u00a02.0412 and has an overall physical scale of about 200\u00a0kpc (roughly 650,000 light-years).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also called Quinquagesima Sunday, Quinquagesimae, Estomihi, Shrove Sunday, Pork Sunday, or the Sunday next before Lent.\nBeing the Lord's Day before the start of the Lenten season, it is known for meat consumption as people feast before starting their fast on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent. Historically Lutheran countries such as Denmark mark Quinquagesima Sunday as the peak of the Fastelavn. After attending the Divine Service on Shrove Sunday, congregants enjoy Shrovetide buns (fastelavnsboller). Children often dress up and collect money from people while singing. Christians in these nations carry Shrovetide rods (fastelavnsris), which \"branches decorated with sweets, little presents, etc., that are used to decorate the home or give to children.\"\nIn the Revised Common Lectionary the Sunday before Lent is designated \"Transfiguration Sunday\", and the gospel reading is the story of the Transfiguration of Jesus from Matthew, Mark, or Luke. Some churches whose lectionaries derive from the Revised Common Lectionary, e.g. the Church of England, use these readings but do not designate the Sunday \"Transfiguration Sunday\".\nEtymology and date.\nThe name Quinquagesima originates from Latin \"quinquagesimus\" (fiftieth). This is in reference to the fifty days before Easter Day using inclusive counting which counts both Sundays (normal counting would count only one of these). Since the forty days of Lent do not include Sundays, the first day of Lent, Ash Wednesday, succeeds Quinquagesima Sunday by only three days.\nThe name Estomihi is derived from the incipit or opening words of the Introit for the Sunday, \"Esto mihi in Deum protectorem, et in locum refugii, ut salvum me facias\", (\"Be Thou unto me a God, a Protector, and a place of refuge, to save me\") Psalms 31:3\nThe earliest Quinquagesima Sunday can occur is February 1 and the latest is March 7.\nSignificance.\nWestern Christianity.\nRoman Catholic Church.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, the terms for this Sunday and the two immediately before it (Sexagesima and Septuagesima Sundays) were eliminated in the reforms following the Second Vatican Council, and these Sundays are part of Ordinary Time.\nAccording to the reformed Roman Rite Roman Catholic calendar, this Sunday is now known by its number within Ordinary Time \u2014 fourth through ninth, depending upon the date of Easter. The earlier form of the Roman Rite, with its references to Quinquagesima Sunday, and to the Sexagesima and Septuagesima Sundays, continues to be observed in some communities.\nIn traditional lectionaries, the Sunday concentrates on , \"Jesus took the twelve aside and said, 'Lo, we go to Jerusalem, and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man shall be fulfilled' ... The disciples, however, understood none of this,\" which from verse 35 is followed by Luke's version of Healing the blind near Jericho. The passage presages the themes of Lent and Holy Week.\nIn most churches, palms blessed on Palm Sunday of the previous year are burned on this day after the last Mass of the day, the ashes of these burned palms are used for the liturgy of Ash Wednesday.\nLutheran Churches.\nIn Lutheranism is combined with (Paul's praise of love).\nComposers writing cantatas for Estomihi Sunday include:\nLutheran countries such as Denmark mark Quinquagesima Sunday as the peak of the Fastelavn. After attending the Mass on Shrove Sunday, congregants enjoy Shrovetide buns (fastelavnsboller), \"round sweet buns that are covered with icing and filled with cream and/or jam.\" Children often dress up and collect money from people while singing. They also practice the tradition of hitting a barrel, which represents fighting Satan; after doing this, children enjoy the sweets inside the barrel. Lutheran Christians in these nations carry Shrovetide rods (fastelavnsris), which \"branches decorated with sweets, little presents, etc., that are used to decorate the home or give to children.\"\nAnglican Communion.\nThis Sunday has different names in the two different calendars used in the Church of England: in the \"Book of Common Prayer\" calendar (1662) this Sunday is known as \"Quinquagesima\", while in the \"Common Worship\" calendar (2000) it is known as the \"Next Sunday before Lent\". In this latter calendar it is part of the period of Ordinary Time that falls between the feasts of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple (the end of the Epiphany season) and Ash Wednesday.\nMethodism.\nIn the United Methodist Church and the Global Methodist Church this Sunday is known as \"Transfiguration Sunday\" and is the last of the \"Sundays after Epiphany\". The liturgical color used will typically be white, and some churches may observe the practice of burning the previous year's palms to create the ashes for \"Ash Wednesday\".\nEastern Christianity and Oriental Christianity.\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, its equivalent, the Sunday before Great Lent, is called \"Forgiveness Sunday\", \"Maslenitsa Sunday\", or \"Cheesefare Sunday\". The latter name comes because this Sunday concludes Maslenitsa, the week in which butter and cheese may be eaten, which are prohibited during Great Lent. The former name derives from the fact that this Sunday is followed by a special Vespers called \"Forgiveness Vespers\" which opens Great Lent.\nOn this day, the Eastern Orthodox Church Christians at the liturgy listen to the Gospel speaking of forgiveness of sins, fasting, and the gathering of treasures in heaven. On this day, all Orthodox Christians ask each other for forgiveness to begin the Great Lent with a good heart, to focus on the spiritual life, to purify the heart from sin in confession, and to meet Easter - the day of the Resurrection of Jesus with a pure heart.\nThis is the last day before Lent when non-lenten food is eaten.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-top: 5px solid purple;\" | Sundays of the Easter cycle"}

Its size is disputed; some botanists treat it as consisting of only one species, \"Quassia amara\" from tropical South America, while others treat it in a wide circumscription as a pantropical genus containing up to 40 species of trees and shrubs.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus was first published in Carl Linnaeus's book \"Species Plantarum\" ed. 2. on page 553 in 1762.\nThe genus was named after a former slave from Suriname, Graman Quassi in the eighteenth century. He discovered the medicinal properties of the bark of \"Quassia amara\".\nIn 1962, Dutch botanist Hans Peter Nooteboom (1934\u20132022) had taken a very broad view of the genus \"Quassia\" L. and included therein various genera including, \"Hannoa\" Planch., \"Odyendyea\" (Pierre) Engl., \"Pierreodendron\" Engl., \"Samadera\" Gaertn., \"Simaba\" Aubl. and \"Simarouba\" Aubl. . Then in 2007, DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses was carried out on members of the Simaroubaceae family. It found that genus \"Samadera\" was a sister to Clade V and that genus \"Quassia\" was also a sister to Clade V but they had separate lineages. This suggested the splitting up of genera \"Quassia\" again, with all Nooteboom's synonyms listed above being resurrected as independent genera. This includes \"Samadera indica\" Gaertn. as the accepted name for \"Quassia indica\". The ornamental \"Quassia amara\" L., which is occasionally planted in Singapore, remains in genus \"Quassia\".\nDistribution.\nMembers of the genus are found in the Tropics throughout the world.

The word originates from the surname of the Norwegian war-time leader Vidkun Quisling (1887\u20131945), who headed a domestic Nazi collaborationist regime during the Nazi occupation of Norway from 1940 to 1945, during the Second World War.\nOrigin.\nUse of Vidkun Quisling's surname as a term predates World War II. The first recorded use of the term was by Norwegian Labour Party politician Oscar Torp in a 2 January 1933 newspaper interview, where he used it as a general term for Quisling's followers. Quisling was at this point in the process of establishing the Nasjonal Samling (National Unity) party, a fascist party modelled on the German Nazi Party. Further uses of the term were made by Aksel Sandemose, in a newspaper article in in 1934, and by the newspaper \"Vestfold Arbeiderblad\", in 1936. The term with the opposite meaning, a Norwegian patriot, is .\nPopularization in World War II.\nThe use of the name as a term for collaborators or traitors in general probably came about upon Quisling's unsuccessful 1940 coup d'\u00e9tat, when he attempted to seize power and make Norway cease resisting the invading Germans. The term was widely introduced to an English-speaking audience by the British newspaper \"The Times\". It published an editorial on 19 April 1940 titled \"Quislings everywhere\", in which it was asserted that \"To writers, the word Quisling is a gift from the gods. If they had been ordered to invent a new word for traitor... they could hardly have hit upon a more brilliant combination of letters. Aurally it contrives to suggest something at once slippery and tortuous.\" The \"Daily Mail\" picked up the term four days after \"The Times\" editorial was published. \"The War Illustrated\" discussed \"potential Quislings\" among the Dutch during the German invasion of the Netherlands. Subsequently, the BBC brought the word into common use internationally.\nChips Channon described how during the Norway Debate of 7\u20138 May 1940, he and other Conservative MPs who supported Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain called those who voted against a motion of no confidence \"Quislings\". Chamberlain's successor Winston Churchill used the term while addressing a conference of Allied delegates at St. James's Palace on 12 June 1941, when he said: \"A vile race of Quislings\u2014to use a new word which will carry the scorn of mankind down the centuries\u2014is hired to fawn upon the conqueror, to collaborate in his designs and to enforce his rule upon their fellow countrymen while groveling low themselves.\" He used the term again in an address to both houses of Congress in the United States of America on 26 December 1941. Commenting upon the effect of a number of Allied victories against Axis forces, and moreover the United States' decision to enter the war, Churchill opined: \"Hope has returned to the hearts of scores of millions of men and women, and with that hope there burns the flame of anger against the brutal, corrupt invader. And still more fiercely burn the fires of hatred and contempt for the filthy Quislings whom he has suborned.\" The term subsequently entered the language and became a target for political cartoonists.\nIn his work \"The Yugoslav peoples fight to live\", Josip Broz Tito made several descriptions of his enemies as Quislings, including General Milan Nedi\u0107 (\"the Serbian Quisling\") and Dr. Ante Paveli\u0107 (\"the criminal Croatian Quisling ... a creature of Mussolini and Hitler\").\nIn the United States, it was used often. In the Warner Bros. cartoon \"Tom Turk and Daffy\" (1944), it was uttered by a Thanksgiving turkey whose presence is betrayed to Porky Pig by Daffy Duck. In the American film \"Edge of Darkness\" (1943), about the Resistance in Norway, the heroine's brother is often described as a quisling.\nVerb form.\nThe back-formed verb, \"to quisle\" () exists, and gave rise to a much less common version of the noun: \"quisler\". However, the verb form was rare even during World War\u00a0II and has entirely disappeared from contemporary usage.\nPostwar use.\n\"Quisling\" was applied to some who cooperated with communist takeovers. As an illustration, the renegade social democrat Zden\u011bk Fierlinger of Czechoslovakia was frequently derided as \"Quislinger\" for his collaboration with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\nA 1966 \"Peanuts\" comic strip shows Lucy dragging Linus out of Snoopy's doghouse yelling \"Traitor! \"Quisling!\" Squealer!\" at Snoopy for betraying him hiding there.\nIn the Doctor Who story \"Day of the Daleks\" (1972), the Doctor calls a man who collaborates with the Daleks a Quisling.\n\"The Patriot Game\", one of the best known songs to emerge from the Irish nationalist struggle, includes, in some versions, the line \"...those quislings who sold out the Patriot Game\" (the original uses \"cowards\" and other versions substitute \"rebels\" or \"traitors\").\nIn \"Edge of Darkness\", the 1943 film with Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan a clip from radio speech by Winston Churchill quotes him as saying, \"...and the filthy Quisling that is his tool.\". Errol Flynn also tells a traitorous character that, \"Soon all Norway will know he's a Quisling.\".\nIn the Norwegian television series \"Occupied\", Norwegians who are seen as collaborating with the Russian invaders and later with European Union peacekeepers are called Quislings.\nMax Brooks' 2006 novel \"World War Z\" features survivors who lose their minds due to the apocalypse and pretend to be zombies themselves, even going so far as to biting and eating other survivors. These zombie-like survivors are called Quislings.\nIn the epilogue of \"Farnham's Freehold\" by Robert A. Heinlein, a sign is posted listing available goods and services. One of the items listed is \"Jerked Quisling (by the neck)\".\n21st century.\nIn the early 21st century, the term demonstrated continued currency as it was used by some American writers to describe President Donald Trump and his associates based on the idea that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. For example, in a June 2018 \"New York Times\" column, Paul Krugman called US President Trump a \"quisling\", in reference to what Krugman described as Trump's \"serv[ing] the interests of foreign masters at his own country's expense\" and \"defend[ing] Russia while attacking our closest allies\". Other publications also applied the term. For instance, Joe Scarborough in \"The Washington Post\" (\"These are desperate times for the quislings of Trump\"), Rich Lowry in \"Politico\" (\"The GOP elite... is the quisling establishment\"), former United States Mint director Philip N. Diehl in \"The Hill\" (\"The historical reference that more aptly applies to pro-Trump Republicans is that of the Quislings\"), David Driesen in \"History News Network\" (\"Trump seeks a government of quislings\"), Dick Polman on NPR station WHYY-FM (\"Ever since last summer, most Republicans have marinated in their cowardice... The next step toward home-grown tyranny \u2013 the quisling phase \u2013 has already begun\"), and so forth.\nOn 7 July 2020, Lord Chris Patten, former governor of Hong Kong, described Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong as a \"lamentable Quisling figure in Hong Kong's history\". On 10 February 2022, Patten expanded his use of the term \"Quislings\" to describe Lam, the Hong Kong Police Force, and the Judiciary of Hong Kong, during a debate on Nationality and Borders Bill.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen/metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.\nAs with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used by modern calligraphers, however, it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who claim the quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.\nDescription.\nThe shaft of a flight feather is long and hollow, making it an obvious candidate for being crafted into a pen. The process of making a quill from a feather involves curing the shaft to harden it, then fashioning its tip into a nib using a pen knife or other small cutting tool.\nA quill pen is in effect a hollow tube which has one closed end, and has one open end at which part of the tube wall extends into a sharp point and has in it a thin slit leading to this point.\nThe hollow shaft of the feather (the \"calamus\") acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip through the slit by capillary action.\nIn a carefully prepared quill, the slit does not widen through wetting with ink and drying. It will retain its shape adequately, requiring only infrequent sharpening; it can be used repeatedly until little of it remains.\nSources.\nThe strongest quills come from the primary flight feathers discarded by birds during their annual moult. Although some have claimed that feathers from the left wing are better suited to right-handed writers because the feather curves away from the sight line, over the back of the hand, the quill barrel is cut to six or seven inches in length so no such consideration of curvature or 'sight-line' is necessary. Additionally, writing with the left hand in the era in which the quill was popular was discouraged, and quills were never sold as left- and right-handed, only by their size and species.\nGoose feathers are most commonly used; scarcer, more expensive swan feathers are used for larger lettering. Depending on availability and strength of the feather, as well as quality and characteristic of the line wanted by the writer, other feathers used for quill-pen making include those from the crow, eagle, owl, turkey, and hawk too. Crow feathers were particularly useful as quills when fine work, such as accounting books, was required. Each bird could supply only about 10 to 12 good-quality quills.\nOn a true quill, the barbs are stripped off completely on the trailing edge. (The pinion for example only has significant barbs on one side of the barrel.) Later, a fashion developed for stripping partially and leaving a decorative top of a few barbs. The fancy, fully-plumed quill is mostly a Hollywood invention and has little basis in reality. Most, if not all, manuscript illustrations of scribes show a quill devoid of decorative barbs, or at least mostly stripped.\nUses.\nQuill pens were used to write the vast majority of medieval manuscripts. Quill pens were also used to write \"Magna Carta\" and the Declaration of Independence. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson bred geese specially at Monticello to supply his tremendous need for quills.\nQuill pens are still used today mainly by professional scribes and calligraphers.\nQuills are also used as the plectrum material in string instruments, particularly the harpsichord.\nFrom the 17th to 19th centuries, the central tube of the quill was used as a priming tube (filled with gunpowder) for cannon fire.\nHistory.\nThe quill pen evolved from the reed pen, of Egyptian origin. Quills were the primary writing instrument in the barbarian kingdoms from the 6th to the 19th century. The best quills were usually made from goose, swan, and later turkey feathers. Quills went into decline after the invention of the metal pen, mass production beginning in Great Britain as early as 1822 by John Mitchell of Birmingham. In the Eastern Mediterranean and much of the Islamic world, quills were not used as writing implements. Only reed pens were used as writing implements.\nQuill pens were the instrument of choice during the medieval era due to their compatibility with parchment and vellum. Before this, the reed pen had been used, but a finer letter was achieved on animal skin using a cured quill. Other than written text, they were often used to create figures, decorations, and images on manuscripts, although many illuminators and painters preferred fine brushes for their work. The fine and flexible tip allowed for a variety of different strokes.\nQuills are denominated from the order in which they are fixed in the wing; the first is favoured by the expert calligrapher, the second and third quills also being satisfactory, together with the pinion feather. The 5th and 6th feathers are also used. No other feather on the wing would be considered suitable by a professional scribe.\nInformation can be obtained on the techniques of curing and cutting quills:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In order to harden a quill that is soft, thrust the barrel into hot ashes, stirring it till it is soft; then taking it out, press it almost flat upon your knees with the back of a penknife, and afterwards reduce it to a roundness with your fingers. If you have a number to harden, set water and alum over the fire; and while it is boiling put in a handful of quills, the barrels only, for a minute, and then lay them by.\nAn accurate account of the Victorian process by William Bishop, from research with one of the last London quill dressers, is recorded in the \"Calligrapher's Handbook\" cited on this page.\nAs a symbol.\nFrom the 19th century in radical and socialist symbolism, quills have been used to symbolize clerks and intelligentsia. Some notable examples are the Radical Civic Union, the Czech National Social Party in combination with the hammer, symbol of the labour movement, or the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro.\nQuills appear on the seals of the United States Census Bureau and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. They also appear in the coats of arms of several US Army Adjutant general units which focus on administrative duties.\nQuills are on the coats of arms of a number of municipalities such as Bargfeld-Stegen in Germany and La Canonja in Spain.\nThree books and a quill pen are the symbols of Saint Hilary of Poitiers.\nQuill and pen knives.\nA quill knife was the original primary tool used for cutting and sharpening quills, a process known as \"dressing\".\nFollowing the decline of the quill in the 1820s, after the introduction of the maintenance-free, mass-produced steel dip nib by John Mitchell, knives were still manufactured but became known as desk knives, stationery knives or latterly as the name stuck \"pen\" knives.\nThere is a small but significant difference between a pen knife and a quill knife, in that the quill knife has a blade that is flat on one side and convex on the other which facilitates the round cuts required to shape a quill.\nA \"pen\" knife by contrast has two flat sides. This distinction is not recognised by modern traders, dealers or collectors, who define a quill knife as any small knife with a fixed or hinged blade, including such items as ornamental fruit knives.\nToday.\nWhile quills are rarely used as writing instruments in the modern day, they are still being produced as specialty items, mostly for hobbyists. Such quills tend to have metal nibs or are sometimes even outfitted with a ballpoint pen inside to remove the need for a separate source of ink.\nAccording to the Supreme Court Historical Society, 20 goose-quill pens, neatly crossed, are placed at the four counsel tables each day the U.S. Supreme Court is in session; \"most lawyers appear before the Court only once, and gladly take the quills home as souvenirs.\" This has been done since the earliest sessions of the Court.\nIn the Jewish tradition quill pens, called \"kulmus\" (), are used by scribes to write Torah Scrolls, Mezuzot, and Tefillin.\nMusic.\nPlectra for psalteries and lutes can be cut similarly to writing pens. The rachis, the portion of the stem between the barbs, not the calamus, of the primary flight feathers of birds of the \"Corvidae\" was preferred for harpsichords. In modern instruments, plastic is more common, but they are often still called \"quills\". The lesiba uses a quill attached to a string to produce sound.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(, ) is a Latin phrase meaning \"\"Where are you going?\". It is commonly translated, quoting the KJV translation of John 13:36, as \"Whither goest thou?\".\nThe phrase originates from the Christian tradition regarding Saint Peter's first words to the risen Christ during their encounter along the Appian Way. According to the apocryphal Acts of Peter (Vercelli Acts XXXV; late 2nd century AD), as Peter flees from crucifixion in Rome at the hands of the government, he meets the risen Jesus along the road outside the city. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" Jesus replies, \"Romam eo iterum crucifig\u012b\"\" (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred by being crucified upside-down. The Church of Domine Quo Vadis in Rome is built where the meeting between Peter and Jesus traditionally took place.\nThe words \"quo vadis\" as a question also occur at least seven times in the Latin Vulgate.\nMeaning as used idiomatically.\nWhen used idiomatically, in ordinary day-to-day language, the phrase usually is spoken or written to inquire about someone's purpose, ambitions, or decisions in a particular situation. It may also be employed to encourage introspection or to express surprise or confusion regarding someone's actions or decisions. In general, this phrase prompts individuals to consider their direction and purpose [especially when questionable], urging them to reflect on their goals or to assess the consequences of their choices.\nThe reply of Jesus \"Romam eo iterum crucifig\u012b\" is also used idiomatically in modern language to symbolize the return to something that is harmful or hurtful to oneself. Just how Jesus in the apocryphal story is returning to Rome to be crucified again, it is used in the same way where an individual, though knowing that a certain place, person, or thing has been a cause of hurt or harm in the past, they still return to it. Thus, one might say that an individual is \"returning to Rome\" when that individual is knowingly returning to something which causes either physical or mental harm, akin to how Jesus was returning to Rome to be crucified again.\nIn culture.\nThe Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel \"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero\" (published in installments between 1895 and 1896). The book in turn has been made into motion pictures several times, including a 1951 version that was nominated for eight Academy Awards. For this and other novels, Sienkiewicz received the 1905 Nobel Prize for Literature.\nIn a season four episode of \"M*A*S*H\" entitled \"Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?\" the reference pertains to Jesus Christ. A shellshocked officer arrives at the hospital believing he is the Christ. He has numerous conversations with the characters, including Father Mulcahy. He ultimately leaves the MASH unit for an evacuation hospital, still unrecovered.\n\"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" is a film by director Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107 about the Srebrenica massacre.\nQuo Vadis has also been used as a name by many companies and groups. Quo Vadis is the name of a restaurant in London. A students' club at University of Pittsburgh, established in 1944 to give tours of the Nationality Rooms, is called Quo Vadis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance, it is the only airline in the world that flies to all seven continents, with it operating flights to Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America from its hubs in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane. It also flies to over 60 domestic destinations across Australia.\nQantas is one of the world's oldest airlines still in operation, originally founded in November 1920. \"Qantas\" is an acronym of the airline's original name, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, as it originally served Queensland and the Northern Territory. Since then, the company has undergone several changes, including nationalisation and privatisation. It is popularly nicknamed \"The Flying Kangaroo\" and has the official slogan \"Spirit of Australia\".\nQantas is based in the Sydney suburb of Mascot, adjacent to its main hub at Sydney Airport. As of \u00a02023[ [update]], Qantas Group had a 60.8% share of the Australian domestic market. Various subsidiary airlines operate to regional centres and on some trunk routes within Australia, as well as some short haul international flights under the QantasLink banner. Qantas owns Jetstar, a low-cost airline that operates both international services from Australia and domestic services within Australia and New Zealand. It holds stakes in a number of other Jetstar-branded airlines in Asia, as well as Alliance Airlines and Fiji Airways.\nHistory.\nQ.A.N.T.A.S..\nQantas was founded in Winton, Queensland on 16 November 1920 by Hudson Fysh, Paul McGinness and Fergus McMaster as Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (Q.A.N.T.A.S.), beginning its operations with the Avro 504K, the airline's first aircraft. Q.A.N.T.A.S. eventually moved its headquarters to Longreach, Queensland in 1921, then to Brisbane, Queensland in 1930.\nQEA era.\nIn 1934, QANTAS and Britain's Imperial Airways, a forerunner of British Airways, formed a new company, Qantas Empire Airways Limited (QEA). In December 1934, the new airline began operations, flying between Brisbane and Darwin. QEA flew internationally from May 1935, when the service from Darwin was extended to Singapore. Imperial Airways operated the rest of the service through to London. When World War II began, enemy action and accidents destroyed half of the fleet of ten. Most of the fleet was taken over by the Australian government for war service.\nIn 1943, flying boat services resumed, with flights between the Swan River at Crawley in Perth, Western Australia and Koggala Lake in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. This linked up with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, BOAC, the successor airline to Imperial Airways, service to London. Qantas' kangaroo logo was first used on the \"Kangaroo Route\", commencing in 1944, from Sydney to Karachi, where BOAC crews took over for the rest of the journey to the UK.\nIn 1947, QEA was nationalised by the Australian government led by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley. QANTAS Limited was then wound up. After nationalisation, Qantas' remaining domestic network, in Queensland, was transferred to the nationally owned Trans-Australia Airlines, leaving Qantas with a purely international network. Shortly after nationalisation, QEA began its first services outside the British Empire, to Tokyo. Services to Hong Kong began around the same time. In 1957, a head office, Qantas House, opened in Sydney.\nJet age.\nIn June 1959, Qantas entered the jet age when the first Boeing 707\u2013138 was delivered. The current parent company, Qantas Airways Limited, was incorporated in 1967. On 14 September 1992, Qantas merged with nationally owned domestic airline, Australian Airlines, renamed from Trans-Australia Airlines in 1986. Australian Airlines's aircraft started to be rebranded as Qantas aircraft in 1993. Qantas was gradually privatised between 1993 and 1997.\nOneworld and Jetstar.\nIn 1998, Qantas co-founded the Oneworld alliance with American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines, and Cathay Pacific, with other airlines joining subsequently.\nWith the entry of new discount airline Virgin Blue (now Virgin Australia) into the domestic market in 2000, Qantas' market share fell. Qantas created the budget Jetstar in 2001 to compete. The main domestic competitor to Qantas, Ansett Australia, collapsed in September 2001.\nQantas briefly revived the Australian Airlines name as a short-lived international budget airline between 2002 and 2006. This subsidiary was shut down in favour of expanding Jetstar internationally, including to New Zealand. In 2004, the Qantas group expanded into the Asian budget airline market with Jetstar Asia, in which Qantas owns a minority stake. In 2007, a similar model was used for an investment into Jetstar Pacific, headquartered in Vietnam, and Jetstar Japan, launched in 2012.\nIn December 2006, Qantas was the subject of a failed bid from a consortium calling itself Airline Partners Australia. In 2008, merger talks with British Airways did not proceed to an agreement. In 2011, industrial relations dispute between Qantas and the Transport Workers Union of Australia resulted in the grounding of all Qantas aircraft and a lock-out of the airline's staff for two days.\nOn 25 March 2018, a Qantas Boeing 787 flew non-stop between Australia and Europe, connecting the two continents by air for the first time, with the arrival in London of Flight 9 (QF9). QF9 was a 17-hour, 14,498\u00a0km (9,009-mile) journey from Perth Airport in Western Australia to London Heathrow.\nOn 20 October 2019, Qantas Airways flew from New York City to Sydney using a Boeing 787\u20139 Dreamliner in 19 hours and 20 minutes, the longest commercial flight at the time.\nCOVID-19.\nOn 19 March 2020, Qantas suspended about 60% of domestic flights, put two thirds of its employees on leave, suspended all international flights, and grounded more than 150 of its aircraft from the end of March until at least 31 May 2020, following expanded COVID-19 pandemic government travel restrictions. To survive the pandemic, Qantas axed 6,000 jobs and announced a plan to raise A$1.9\u00a0billion in new capital. Qantas offloaded its 30% stake in Jetstar Pacific to Vietnam Airlines, retiring the Jetstar brand in Vietnam.\nIn July 2020, Qantas retired its last Boeing 747-438ER, after almost 49 years of continuous operation of the type\u2014the first 747-238B was introduced in August 1971. All twelve Airbus A380s were placed in storage, ten at Mojave Air &amp; Space Port and two at Los Angeles International Airport, for a minimum of three years. The pilots of the last Boeing 747 flight to Mojave Desert via Los Angeles traced the shape of the iconic Qantas logo in the flight path before the jet continued on its journey.\nIn November 2020, Qantas issued a public statement expressing their intention to require passengers traveling overseas to provide proof of COVID-19 inoculation. As per the statement made by Alan Joyce, the airline's CEO, the presence of a COVID-19 vaccine would be considered indispensable for the purpose of travel. Joyce expressed their intention to potentially modify the terms and conditions, to specify that anyone traveling internationally must have a vaccination before embarking. Qantas also announced the outsourcing of 2,000 ground staff roles to reduce costs. This decision was later found to have been illegal adverse action in order to prevent industrial action, and the airline was fined $90m in addition to agreeing to pay $120m compensation to affected staff.\nIn August 2021, Qantas required all of its 22,000 employees to be fully vaccinated against the virus.\nIn May 2022, Qantas ordered twelve A350-1000 aircraft from Airbus, to be used in non-stop flights from Sydney to London in late 2025. In the same month, Qantas agreed terms to purchase Alliance Airlines. In April 2023, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) opposed the takeover.\nBy April 2024 Qantas had returned ten of its original twelve A380s to service, with all serviceable aircraft having undergone major refurbishment work to enhance the onboard soft furnishings.\nNon-stop flight routes.\nIn August 2022, Qantas Airways announced plans to compete in June 2023 with Air New Zealand on the non-stop Auckland\u2013New York route. Qantas flights would originate in Sydney, before flying in 2026 on a non-stop Sydney\u2013New York route, as part of Project Sunrise. Qantas aims to eliminate the \"\" by developing non-stop flight routes connecting Australian cities to New York City, and to London. In February 2023, Qantas announced profits of A$1.7bn for the second half of 2022, after experiencing losses due to COVID. In a development described by ABC News as a \"mammoth protest vote\", on 3 November 2023 nearly 83% of Qantas shareholders voted against the airline's remuneration report.\nDestinations, routes and codeshare agreements.\nDestinations.\nQantas operates regular services from Australia to destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Its domestic network serves all Australian states, along with the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and the external territory of Norfolk Island. In addition, Qantas also operates 'flightseeing' charters to Antarctica from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, and formerly from Adelaide, Canberra, and Hobart, in partnership with Melbourne-based company Antarctica Flights. It first flew these Antarctic flightseeing trips in 1977. They were suspended for a number of years due to the crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 on Mount Erebus in 1979. Qantas restarted the flights in 1994. Although these flights do not touch down, they require specific polar operations and crew training due to factors like sector whiteout, which contributed to the 1979 Air New Zealand disaster.\nFifth-freedom routes.\nAs of 2024, Qantas operated the following fifth-freedom flight services between the following cities:\n'International' domestic routes to and from Perth.\nQantas uses Perth as a transit point for its European services between Sydney and Paris (QF33 and QF34), as well as for a seasonal service between Sydney and Rome (QF5 and QF6). These flights depart and arrive at the international terminal at Sydney Airport despite the Sydney\u2013Perth segment of these flights being domestic. As Qantas is an Australian airline, it is permitted to carry, and sells tickets for domestic passengers intending to fly solely between Sydney and Perth. Qantas issues domestic passengers on these flights with an orange 'D' sticker that allows them to bypass customs and immigration, and passports are not necessary for these passengers.\nCodeshare agreements.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], Qantas had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFleet.\nCurrent fleet.\nAs of November\u00a02024[ [update]], the Qantas Group and its subsidiaries operate 308 aircraft, including 85 aircraft by Jetstar Airways; 90 by the various QantasLink-branded airlines and eight by Express Freighters Australia (on behalf of Qantas Freight).\nThe group also has over 150 narrow-body and 36 wide-body aircraft firm orders as of August\u00a02024[ [update]], across the Airbus A220, Airbus A320neo, Airbus A321neo, Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 families to replace the existing fleet over the following decade, with these aircraft being distributed amongst Qantas, QantasLink and Jetstar.\nCabin.\nInternational.\nFirst.\nFirst class is available on the Airbus A380 and A350.\nIt offers 14 individual suites in a 1\u20131\u20131 layout.

Each suite contains a widescreen monitor. In addition to AC power outlets, USB ports are also offered. Passengers are also able to utilise the lounge on the upper deck. Complimentary access to both the first class and business class lounges (or affiliated lounges) is offered as well.\nUpdated versions of this seat were fitted to the airline's refurbished Airbus A380 aircraft from late 2019. The seat features refreshed cushioning and larger entertainment screens compared to the older version.\nBusiness.\nBusiness Suites.\nBusiness Suites are available on all Boeing 787, Airbus A330, and selected Airbus A380 aircraft.\nThese seats are lie-flat and are in a 1\u20132\u20131 configuration. The Business Suite was introduced on the A330 in October 2014, and includes a Panasonic touchscreen eX3 system. By the end of 2016, the business class seats of Qantas' entire Airbus A330 fleet were refitted. Airbus A330 Business Suites are available on Asian routes, transcontinental routes across Australia and selected routes to New Zealand.\nUpdated versions of this seat were fitted to the airline's new Boeing 787 fleet from late 2017.\nPremium Economy.\nPremium economy class is offered on all Airbus A380 and Boeing 787\u20139 aircraft.\nOn the Airbus A380, the seat pitch ranges from , with a width of .

On the A380, the layout is 3\u20134\u20133 and there are four self-service snack bars located in between cabins.\nIn 2019, Qantas began retrofitting its Airbus A380 aircraft with new Economy seats containing new seat cushions and improved inflight entertainment, as offered on Airbus A330 and Boeing 787 aircraft. The new aircraft will have fewer economy seats compared to the previous configuration due to an increase in the number of premium seats.\nIn-flight entertainment.\nAll Qantas mainline aircraft contain some form of video and audio entertainment. Qantas has several types of in-flight entertainment (IFE) systems installed on its aircraft.\nAudio-video entertainment systems.\nThe \"Total Entertainment System\" by Rockwell Collins was available on selected domestic and international aircraft between 2000 and 2019. This AVOD system included personal LCD screens in all classes, located in the seat back for economy and business class, and in the armrest for premium economy and first class.\nThe Mainscreen System is available on selected Boeing 737\u2013800 aircraft. This entertainment system, introduced gradually between 2002 and 2011, has overhead video screens as the main form of entertainment. Movies are shown on the screens on longer flights and TV programmes on shorter flights. A news telecast will usually be shown at the start of each flight. Audio options are less varied than on Q, iQ or the Total Entertainment System.\nThe \"iQ\" inflight entertainment system by Panasonic Avionics Corporation is available on selected Airbus A380 and Boeing 737\u2013800 aircraft. This AVOD experience, introduced in 2008, is based on the Panasonic Avionics system and features expanded entertainment options, touch screens and new communications-related features such as Wi-Fi and mobile phone functionality, as well as increased support for electronics (such as USB and iPod connectivity).\nThe \"Q\" inflight entertainment system by Panasonic Avionics Corporation is available on all Airbus A330-300, A330-200, Boeing 787 and selected Airbus A380 aircraft. This audio video on demand (AVOD) experience, introduced in 2014 and updated in 2018 on selected aircraft, is based on the Panasonic eX3 system and features extensive entertainment options; enhanced touch screens; and communications-related features such as Wi-Fi and mobile phone functionality; as well as increased support for electronics (such as USB and iPod connectivity). The \"my flight\" feature offers access to maps, playlists, and a service timeline showing when drinks and meals will be served and the best time for resting on long-haul flights.\nIn 2024, Qantas selected Panasonic's OLED 4K 'Astrova' seatback screen to be equipped on its Airbus A350 fleet to be delivered from 2026. The entertainment system will feature \"high-fidelity multi-channel spatial audio technology\" and Bluetooth connectivity allowing for passengers to connect their personal wireless earbuds or headphones. The Astrova IFE system will also deliver 100 W of mobile device and laptop fast-charging via USB-C, available through all phases of flight.\nWireless entertainment systems and Wi-Fi.\nQ Streaming is an in-flight entertainment system in which entertainment is streamed to iPads or personal devices available in all classes on selected aircraft. A selection of movies, TV, music, and a kids' choice are available.\nIn 2007, Qantas conducted a trial for use of mobile telephones with AeroMobile, during domestic services for three months on a Boeing 767. During the trial, passengers were allowed to send and receive text messages and emails but were not able to make or receive calls.\nIn July 2015, Qantas signed a deal with American cable network HBO to provide over 120 hours of television programming in-flight from the network on its aircraft, as well as original lifestyle and entertainment programming from both Foxtel and the National Geographic Channel. In August 2022, it was announced that the airline had partnered with Network 10 owner Paramount to launch the Paramount+ service on its in-flight entertainment systems.\nIn 2017, Qantas began offering complimentary Wi-Fi on its domestic aircraft. The services utilises NBN Co Sky Muster satellites to deliver higher speeds than generally offered by onboard Wi-Fi. Previously, in July 2007, Qantas announced that Wi-Fi would be available on its long haul A380s and 747\u2013400s although that system ultimately did not proceed following trials.\nIn 2023, Qantas began offering complimentary Wi-Fi on select international flights. Qantas aims to have complimentary Wi-Fi on all of its international aircraft by 2026. The Wi-Fi will be available to all customers free of charge, regardless of class, ticket or frequent flyer tier, as is the case with the airline's domestic Wi-Fi.\nNews media.\nUntil 2014, the Australian Nine Network provided a news bulletin for Qantas entitled \"Nine's Qantas Inflight News\", which was the same broadcast as Nine's \"\", however Nine lost the contract to Sky News Australia in 2014. In 2022, Qantas ended its contract with Sky News and signed an agreement with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's ABC News to provide inflight digital news services for Qantas passengers.\nInflight magazine.\n\"Qantas: The Australian Way\" is the airline's in-flight magazine. In mid-2015, the magazine ended a 14-year publishing deal with Bauer Media, switching its publisher to Medium Rare.\nServices.\nQantas Frequent Flyer.\nThe Qantas frequent-flyer program is aimed at rewarding customer loyalty. It is Australia's largest loyalty program, with 16.4 million members as of June 2024. The program is long-standing, although the date of the actual inception has been a matter that has generated some commentary. Qantas state the program launched in 1987 although other sources claim what is the current program was launched in the early 1990s, with a Captain's Club program existing before that.\nLounges.\nInternational First Lounge.\nQantas operates international First Lounges in Auckland, Melbourne, Singapore, Sydney and Los Angeles.

This collaboration resulted in the introduction of the Skybed business class seat in 2003. The design won several important awards and has been described as \"the crown jewel of a $385 million modernization process\" which led to the designer being named as the first Creative Director of Qantas in 2006. Newson was later responsible for the design of the Qantas A380 fleet which first entered service in 2008, as well as the Sydney first class lounge.\nNewson prot\u00e9g\u00e9 David Caon, since 2016, has been enlisted by Qantas for product design. Caon has designed the cabins of current Qantas Boeing 787, A380 and A220 aircraft, as well as upcoming Airbus A350 and Airbus A321neo aircraft. Caon has also designed new international first and business lounges, domestic business and club lounges, regional lounges, furniture, and accessories. Furniture featured in Qantas first-class lounges and onboard has been manufactured by companies such as Poltrona Frau, Cappellini, Alessi, Tai Ping and Noritake. Qantas has also worked with Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre to conduct research to determine optimal lighting conditions to reduce jetlag on long-haul flights and improve comfort and health \"before, during and after long-haul flights\".\nQantas has received various awards for design.\nCatering.\nAustralian chef and entrepreneur Neil Perry has been responsible for the onboard and ground based culinary offerings of the airline since becoming the director of food, beverage, and service in 1997, and currently Qantas' catering operations are supplied by dnata. In 2022, to celebrate the 25-year collaboration with Perry, Qantas reintroduced a selection of his most popular inflight and lounge dishes. Qantas is currently the only airline in Australia to offer complimentary meals, snacks and beverages on all domestic flights, including regional QantasLink services.\nUniform and grooming.\nParis-based Australian designer Martin Grant is responsible for the current Qantas uniforms that were unveiled on 16 April 2013. These were to replace the previous uniforms, dubbed colloquially as \"Morrissey\" by staff after the designer, Peter Morrissey. The new outfits feature a colour palette of black, red and fuchsia pink. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce stated that the new design \"speaks of Australian style on the global stage\" at the launch event that involved employees modelling the uniforms. Grant consulted with Qantas staff members over the course of one year to finalise the 35 styles that were eventually created. Not all employees were happy with the new uniform, however, with one flight attendant saying \"The uniforms are really tight and they are simply not practical for the very physical job we have to do.\" In 2020 Grant also designed a Qantas branded athleisure-wear collection.\nQantas declared in 2023 that it had ended uniform rules based on gender. Female flight attendants are no longer required to wear high heels, male flight attendants can wear makeup, and flight attendants of any gender can wear the same type of jewelry and have long hair in a ponytail or bun. At the end of January 2025, Qantas announced plans to refresh the uniforms for its onboard crews. The airline says that they will now engage with several Australian designers to review the requirements and undertake a selection process for what will become the eleventh uniform in its history. The next uniform designer will be announced in the coming months with Qantas planning to debut the new design in 2027 alongside with Qantas\u2019 huge fleet renewal program. Additionally, Qantas will start surveying its uniformed workforce to assist in developing the new outfits.\nLiveries.\nIndigenous art liveries.\nTwo Qantas aircraft are currently painted in an Indigenous Australian art scheme. One aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 registered as VH-XZJ, wears a livery called \"Mendoowoorrji\", which was revealed in November 2013. The design was drawn from the late West Australian Aboriginal artist Paddy Bedford. The second, a Boeing 787 registered VH-ZND, is adorned in a paint scheme inspired by the late Emily Kame Kngwarreye's 1991 painting \"Yam Dreaming\". The adaptation of \"Yam Dreaming\" to the aircraft, led by Balarinji, a Sydney-based and Aboriginal-owned design firm, incorporates the red Qantas tailfin into the design, which includes white dots with red and orange tones. The design depicts the yam plant, an important and culturally significant symbol in Kngwarreye's Dreaming stories, and a staple food source in her home region of Utopia. The design was applied to the aircraft during manufacture, prior to its delivery in March 2018 to Alice Springs Airport, situated 230 kilometres southeast of Utopia, where the aircraft was met by Kngwarreye's descendants, the local community, and Qantas executives. The aircraft would later operate Qantas' inaugural nonstop services between Perth and London Heathrow, and between Melbourne and San Francisco, scheduled with Boeing 787 aircraft.\nAustralian Aboriginal art designs have previously adorned some Qantas aircraft; the first design was called \"Wunala Dreaming\", which was unveiled in 1994 and had been painted on now-retired Boeing 747\u2013400 and 747-400ER aircraft between 1994 and 2012. The \"motif\" was an overall-red design depicting ancestral spirits in the form of kangaroos travelling in the outback.\nThe second design was called \"Nalanji Dreaming\" and was depicted on a Boeing 747\u2013300 from 1995 until its retirement in 2005. \"Nalanji Dreaming\" was a bright blue design inspired by rainforest landscape and tropical seas.\nThe third design was titled \"Yananyi Dreaming,\" and featured a depiction of Uluru. The scheme was designed by Uluru-based artist Rene Kulitja, in collaboration with Balarinji. It was painted on the 737 at the Boeing factory prior to its delivery in 2002. It was repainted into the standard livery in 2014.\nRetro Roo liveries.\nIn November 2014 the airline revealed that the 75th Boeing 737\u2013800 jet to be delivered would carry a 'retro-livery' based on the airline's 1971 'ochre' colour scheme design featuring the iconic 'Flying Kangaroo' on its tail and other aspects drawn from its 1970s fleet. The aircraft was delivered on 17 November.\nQantas announced a second 737\u2013800 would receive a 'retro roo' livery in October 2015. On 16 November 2015 the airline unveiled the second 'retro roo' 737, bearing a replica livery from 1959 to celebrate the airline's 95th birthday.\nOther liveries.\nSeveral Qantas aircraft have been decorated with promotional liveries, promoting telecommunications company Optus; the Disney motion picture \"Planes\"; the Australian national association football team, the Socceroos; and the Australian national rugby union team, the Wallabies. Two aircraft \u2013 an Airbus A330\u2013200 and a Boeing 747\u2013400ER \u2013 were decorated with special liveries promoting the Oneworld airline alliance (of which Qantas is a member) in 2009. On 29 September 2014, nonstop Airbus A380 service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport was inaugurated using an A380 decorated with a commemorative cowboy hat and bandana on the kangaroo tail logo. Prior to the 2017 Sydney Mardi Gras, Qantas decorated one of its Airbus A330-300 aircraft with rainbow lettering and depicted a rainbow flag on the tail of the aircraft.\nAwards.\n'World's safest airline' awards.\nIn addition to the above awards, Qantas has consistently ranked in either first or second place in the annual \"https://\" 'World's Safest Airline' awards since their inception in 2014. The 'Operational Safety Audit' from the International Air Transport Association, along with the International Civil Aviation Organisation 'country audit' are used as benchmarks by AirlineRatings.com when determining annual rankings. Qantas was named the world's safest airline from 2014 to 2017, from 2019 to 2021, and again in 2023, second to Air New Zealand in 2018, 2022 and 2024.\nCorporate affairs.\nCompany heads.\nThe company heads of Qantas Airways Limited are only listed from 1993, when Qantas' shares once again traded on the stock exchange as a publicly listed company, following the Australian Government's move to privatise the remaining 75% of the airline. Throughout Qantas' history, since 1920, there have been many structures, branding and variations including the name 'Qantas'. Its current company structure was established in 1993, going from an unlisted public company in which the Commonwealth owned all of the shares, to a listed public company. A full list of Qantas chairpersons and managing directors can be found on the History of Qantas page.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBusiness trends.\nThe key trends for the Qantas Group (Qantas Airways Ltd and Controlled Entities, which includes Jetstar and Qantas Cargo), are shown below, as at year ending 30 June:\nHeadquarters.\nQantas' headquarters are located at the Qantas Centre in the suburb of Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales. In December 2013, a redevelopment of the headquarters was completed.\nOwnership.\nThe Australian Government has an ownership stake in Qantas through Australia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, and the airline is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Under Commonwealth legislation, Qantas must be at least 51% owned by Australian shareholders.\nAirline subsidiaries.\nQantas has operated a number of passenger airline subsidiaries since inception, including:\nQantas operates a freight service under the name Qantas Freight, which uses aircraft operated by Qantas subsidiary Express Freighters Australia and leases aircraft from Atlas Air. Qantas wholly owns the logistics-and-air-freight company Australian airExpress.\nMinority airline equity interests.\nIn addition to its wholly owned subsidiaries, Qantas also owns minority equity stakes in a number of other Australian and foreign airlines:\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders initiatives.\nQantas, through its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programme, has some links with the Aboriginal Australian community. In the Qantas Reconciliation Action Plan 2015 \u2013 2018, Qantas revealed that 1 percent of all their staff are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Qantas employs a full-time Diversity Coordinator, who is responsible for the programme.\nQantas has also bought and donated Aboriginal art. An art installation at its passenger lounge in Brisbane features a painting by Jenna Lee. Qantas has had a number of its aircraft painted with the art of Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye and others with art inspired by Rene Kulitja and Paddy Bedford.\nPromotions and sponsorships.\nAn early television campaign, starting in 1969 and running for several decades, was aimed at American audiences. It featured a live koala, voiced by Howard Morris, who complained that too many tourists were coming to Australia and concluded \"I hate Qantas.\" The koala ads have been ranked among the greatest commercials of all time. A long-running advertising campaign features renditions by children's choirs of Peter Allen's \"I Still Call Australia Home\", at various famous landmarks in Australia and foreign locations such as Venice. The song has been used in Qantas's safety videos since 2018.\nQantas was the main sponsor of the Australia national rugby union team. However, in 2020 Qantas ended its sponsorship of the Wallabies after 30 years. Qantas sponsors the Socceroos, Australia's national association football team. Qantas was the naming rights sponsor for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix from 2010 until 2012. In December 2011, Qantas signed a four-year deal with Australian cricket's governing body Cricket Australia, to be the official carrier of the Australia national cricket team.\nQantas management has expressed strong support for Marriage Equality and LGBTIQ issues, with CEO Alan Joyce said to be, \"arguably the most prominent corporate voice in the marriage equality campaign\". As official airline partner for the Sydney Mardi Gras, Qantas decorated one of its aircraft with rainbow wording and positioned a rainbow flag next to the tail's flying kangaroo. Qantas also served pride cookies to its passengers. It had a rainbow roo float in the Mardi Gras parade.\nThere has been criticism of Qantas using its corporate power to prosecute the private interests on their staff and the community. Peter Dutton has said that chief executives such as Alan Joyce at Qantas should \"stick to their knitting\" rather than using the company's brand to advocate for political causes. A senior church leader has made similar comments. Despite the criticism, Qantas will continue to advocate for marriage equality which will include offering customers specially commissioned rings with the phrase, \"until we all belong\". This phrase will appear on Qantas boarding passes and other paraphernalia. The cost of the campaign by Qantas and other participating companies is expected to be more than $5\u00a0million.\nJoyce has pledged Qantas will, \"continue social-justice campaigning\", in relation to Israel Folau, sacked by Rugby Australia, which is financially supported by Qantas, following his social media postings on homosexuality.\n2010s structural change.\nIn August 2011, the company announced that following financial losses of A$200\u00a0million ($209\u00a0million) for the year ending June 2011 and a decline in market share, major structural changes would be made. One planned change that did not come to fruition was the plan to create a new Asia-based premium airline that would operate under a different name. In addition to this plan, Qantas announced it planned to cut 1,000 jobs. The reforms included route changes, in particular the cessation of services to London via Hong Kong and Bangkok. While Qantas still operated in these cities, onward flights to London would be via its Oneworld partner British Airways under a code-share service.\nIn 2012, Qantas reported an A$245\u00a0million full-year loss to the end of June 2012, citing high fuel prices, intense competition and industrial disputes. This was the first full year loss since Qantas was fully privatised 17 years previously, in 1995, and led to the airline cancelling its order of 35 new Boeing 787 aircraft, to reduce its spending. Qantas subsequently divested itself of its 50% holding of StarTrack, Australia's largest road freight company, in part for acquiring full interest in Australian airExpress. In March 2012, Qantas set up Jetstar Hong Kong with China Eastern Airlines Corporation, which was intended to begin flights in 2013, but became embroiled in a protracted approval process.\nQantas and Emirates began an alliance on 31 March 2013, in which their combined carriers offered 98 flights per week to Dubai. In September 2013, the carrier predicted another A$250\u00a0million\u00a0(US$\u00a0million) net loss for the half-year period that ended on 31 December and the implementation of further cost-cutting measures that would see the cut of 1,000 jobs within a year. S&amp;P downgraded Qantas credit from BBB\u2212 (the lowest investment grade) to BB+. Moody's applied a similar downgrading a month later.\nLosses continued into the 2014 reporting year, with the Qantas Group reporting a half year loss of A$235\u00a0million\u00a0(US$\u00a0million) and an eventual full year loss of A$2.84\u00a0billion. In February 2014, additional cost-cutting measures to save A$2\u00a0billion, including the loss of 5,000 jobs that will see the workforce lowered from 32,000 to 27,000 by 2017 were announced. In May 2014, the company stated it expected to shed 2,200 jobs by June 2014, including those of 100 pilots. Qantas reduced the size of its fleet by retiring aircraft and deferring deliveries, and planned to sell some of its assets.\nWith 2,200 employees laid off by June 2014, another 1,800 job positions were planned to be cut by June 2015. Also during 2014, the \"Qantas Sale Act\", under which the airline was privatised, was amended to repeal parts of section 7. That act limits foreign ownership of Qantas to 49 percent, with foreign airlines subject to further restrictions, including a 35-percent limit for all foreign airline shareholdings combined. A single foreign entity can hold no more than 25 percent of the airline's shares.\nQantas returned to profit in 2015, announcing a A$557\u00a0million after tax profit in August 2015, in contrast with a A$2.84\u00a0billion loss the year earlier. In 2015, Qantas sold its lease of Terminal 3 at Sydney Airport, which was due to continue until 2019, back to Sydney Airport Corporation for $535\u00a0million. This meant Sydney Airport resumed operational responsibility of the terminal, including the lucrative retail areas.\nAccidents and incidents.\nIt is often claimed that Qantas has never had an aircraft crash. While it is true that the company has neither lost a jet airliner nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63\u00a0people. Half of these accidents and the shoot-down occurred during World War\u00a0II, when the Qantas aircraft were operating on behalf of Allied military forces. Post-war, it lost another four aircraft (one was owned by BOAC and operated by Qantas in a pooling arrangement) with a total of 21 people killed. The last fatal accidents suffered by Qantas were in 1951, with three fatal crashes in five months. Qantas' safety record allows the airline to be officially known as the world's safest airline for seven years in a row from 2012 until 2019 and again in 2021 and 2023.\nSince the end of World War\u00a0II, the following accidents and incidents have occurred:\nExtortion attempts.\nOn 26 May 1971, Qantas received a call from a \"Mr.\u00a0Brown\" claiming that there was a bomb planted on a Hong Kong-bound jet and demanding $500,000 in unmarked $20\u00a0notes. The caller and threat were taken seriously when he directed police to an airport locker where a functional bomb was found. Arrangements were made to pick up the money in front of the head office of the airline in the heart of the Sydney business district. Qantas paid the money and it was collected, after which Mr.\u00a0Brown called again, advising the \"bomb on the plane\" story was a hoax. The initial pursuit of the perpetrator was bungled by the New South Wales Police Force which, despite having been advised of the matter from the time of the first call, failed to establish adequate surveillance of the pick-up of the money. Directed not to use their radios (for fear of being \"overheard\"), the police were unable to communicate adequately.\nTipped off by a still-unidentified informer, the police arrested an Englishman, Peter Macari, finding more than $138,000 hidden in an Annandale property. Convicted and sentenced to 15\u00a0years in prison, Macari served nine years before being deported to Britain. More than $224,000 remains unaccounted for. The 1986 telemovie \"Call Me Mr. Brown\", directed by Scott Hicks and produced by Terry Jennings, relates to this incident. On 4 July 1997 a copycat extortion attempt was thwarted by police and Qantas security staff.\nControversies.\nSex discrimination controversy.\nIn November 2005, it was revealed that Qantas had a policy of not seating adult male passengers next to unaccompanied children. This led to accusations of discrimination. The policy came to light following an incident in 2004 when Mark Wolsay, who was seated next to a young boy on a Qantas flight in New Zealand, was asked to change seats with a female passenger. A steward informed him that \"it was the airline's policy that only women were allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children\". Cameron Murphy of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties president criticised the policy and stated that \"there was no basis for the ban\". He said it was wrong to assume that all adult males posed a danger to children. The policy has also been criticised for failing to take female abusers into consideration.\nIn 2010, when British Airways was successfully sued to change its child seating policy, Qantas argued again that banning men from sitting next to unaccompanied children \"reflected parents' concerns\". In August 2012, the controversy resurfaced when a male passenger had to swap seats with a female passenger after the crew noticed he was sitting next to an unrelated girl travelling alone. The man felt discriminated against and humiliated before the other passengers as a possible paedophile. A Qantas spokesman defended the policy as consistent with that of other airlines in Australia and around the globe.\nPrice fixing.\nIn 2006, a class action lawsuit, alleging price-fixing on air cargo freight, was commenced in Australia. The lawsuit was settled early in 2011 with Qantas agreeing to pay in excess of $21\u00a0million to settle the case.\nQantas has pleaded guilty to participating in a cartel that fixed the price of air cargo. Qantas Airways\u00a0Ltd. was fined CAD$155,000 after it admitted that its freight division fixed surcharges on cargo exported on certain routes from Canada between May 2002 and February 2006. In July 2007, Qantas pleaded guilty in the United States to price fixing and was fined a total of $61\u00a0million through the Department of Justice investigation. The executive in charge was jailed for six months. Other Qantas executives were granted immunity after the airline agreed to co-operate with authorities.\nIn 2008, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission fined the airline $20\u00a0million for breaches of the acts associated with protecting consumers. In November 2010 Qantas was fined 8.8\u00a0million euros for its part in an air cargo cartel involving up to 11 other airlines. Qantas was fined NZ$6.5\u00a0million in April 2011 when it pleaded guilty in the New Zealand High Court to the cartel operation.\nIndustrial disputes and 2011 grounding of fleet.\nIn response to ongoing industrial unrest over failed negotiations involving three unions (the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA), the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA) and the Transport Workers Union of Australia (TWU)), the company grounded its entire domestic and international fleet from 5\u00a0pm AEDT on 29 October 2011, and employees involved would be locked out from 8\u00a0p.m. AEDT on 31 October 2011. However, in the early hours of 31 October, Fair Work Australia ordered that all industrial action taken by Qantas and the involved trade unions be terminated immediately. The order was requested by the federal government amid fears that an extended period of grounding would do significant damage to the national economy, especially the tourism and mining sectors. It was reported that the grounding would have had a daily financial impact of A$20\u00a0million, and affected an estimated 68,000 customers worldwide.\nIn 2021, the Transport Workers Union took Qantas to court, over the dismissal of 1,685 baggage handlers and cleaners during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose roles were later outsourced. The TWU argued that the airline's actions contravened the Fair Work Act. Qantas claimed it had to make the cuts to ensure the company's survival during the pandemic. In July 2021, the Federal Court of Australia ruled in favour of the TWU. Qantas lost an appeal in May 2022. The case moved to the High Court of Australia in May 2023. In September 2023, the High Court ruled against Qantas, upholding the original Federal Court decision and leaving the airline liable for compensation. After the verdict, Qantas issued an apology to the sacked workers.\nAsylum seeker deportations.\nQantas has been subject to protests in relation to the deportation of asylum seekers, which led to disruptions of flights. In 2015 activists prevented the transfer of a Tamil man from Melbourne to Darwin (from where he was to be deported to Colombo) by refusing to take their seats on a Qantas flight. It was reported that Qantas banned the student from taking Qantas flights in the future. A nameless head of security from Qantas sent a letter to the Melbourne student's email account saying her \"actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group\".\nAlso in 2015, another Tamil man was to be sent from Melbourne to Darwin to later be deported. A protest by the man led to him not being put on the aircraft. A spokesman for Qantas said flight QF838 was delayed almost two hours. A spokesperson from Qantas stated that \"[s]afety and security is the number-one priority for all airlines and an aircraft is not the right place for people to conduct protests.\" Campaigners also asked Qantas to rule out deporting Iraqi man Saeed in 2017. Campaigners have asked Qantas not to participate in the high-profile deportation case of the Nadesalingam family. In response a Qantas spokesperson stated: \"We appreciate that this is a sensitive issue. The government and courts are best placed to make decisions on complex immigration matters, not airlines\".\nDisputes with Perth Airport.\nThe airline has been in a number of disputes with the operators of Perth Airport. In 2018, the airport sued Qantas in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for allegedly underpaying their aeronautical service fees by $11.3 million. The suit was resolved in 2022 with Qantas forced to pay the airport the owed amount plus an additional $9 million. In 2020, Perth Airport had also threatened to cancel several of the airline's leases over unpaid rent between February and May 2020; part of the rental dispute concerned Qantas alleging that Perth Airport had undervalued a Qantas-owned terminal that was sold back to the airport. Qantas had also drawn criticism from both Perth Airport and the Government of Western Australia for delaying an agreed move from their existing isolated terminals to a proposed new terminal in the airport's central precinct; in May 2024, it was confirmed that the airline had come to an agreement to complete the move by 2031, six years after the original agreed timeframe of 2025.\nComplaints.\nIn April 2022, consumer advocacy group Choice lodged a complaint with the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) concerning the airline's flight credit policy for cancelled flights during the COVID-19 pandemic, which they alleged was \"unfair\" and saw customers issued with flight vouchers with short expiration dates that became unusable due to ongoing travel restrictions. Although more than $1 billion in credit had been claimed by Qantas and Jetstar customers by August 2023, that month the airline was hit with a class action lawsuit by customers still seeking refunds and compensation for flights cancelled during the pandemic.\nIn September 2022, \"Four Corners\" broadcast an episode titled \"The Inside Story Of the Chaos at Qantas\", detailing passenger service issues and cost cutting by the company.\nDuring an August 2023 Australian Senate committee hearing concerning the rising cost of living, CEO Alan Joyce was accused of \"misleading the Australian public\" with the airline's flight credits scheme, among other issues with the carrier. On 31 August 2023, Qantas bowed to public pressure and announced the removal of expiry dates for flight credits issued up to 30 September 2021 as well as giving customers the option of a refund instead, with Joyce admitting in a statement that the airline's implementation of the scheme led to \"people [losing] faith in the process\".\nIn March 2023, a report by the ACCC found that the airline was the subject of almost 2,000 complaints over the previous year, with more than 1,300 complaints relating to flight cancellations. The report found that complaints about the airline had risen by 70% from the previous year, and that the ACCC receives more complaints about Qantas than any other business. In August 2023, the ACCC launched legal action against the airline in the Federal Court of Australia for allegedly continuing to advertise and sell tickets for more than 8,000 flights scheduled between May and July 2022 that were already cancelled, as well as delaying informing existing ticketholders of these cancellations.\nCourt filings showed that Qantas carried on selling tickets on 71,000 flights due to take off between May 2022 and May 2024 after deciding to scrap them. About 87,000 people bought tickets on the fake departures or were rebooked onto them. As many as 884,000 customers were not informed swiftly that they were down to travel on flights that had already been cancelled. The allegations led to the premature departure of Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce in 2023.\nQantas settled the lawsuit in May 2024, agreeing to pay A$120 million ($82 million) in fines and compensation for selling tickets on flights it had already decided to cancel. On 30 June 2024, Qantas began contacting customers to offer them compensation. Customers who booked Qantas flights scheduled to depart between 1 May 2022 and 10 May 2024 that had already been cancelled will receive $225 for domestic and trans-Tasman flights, and $450 for international flights, on top of any other refund or alternative flight already offered.\nSee also.\nGeneral:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The GECOS-GCOS port used I/O routines written by A. W. Winklehoff.

A University of Toronto team consisting of Tom Duff, Rob Pike, Hugh Redelmeier, and David Tilbrook implemented a version of QED that runs on UNIX; David Tilbrook later included QED as part of his QEF tool set.\nQED was also used as a character-oriented editor on the Norwegian-made Norsk Data systems, first Nord TSS, then Sintran III. It was implemented for the Nord-1 computer in 1971 by Bo Lewendal who after working with Deutsch and Lampson at Project Genie and at the Berkeley Computer Corporation, had taken a job with Norsk Data (and who developed the Nord TSS later in 1971).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was appointed as his father's heir apparent in 2000. He was deputy head of the Iraqi Special Security Organization and was also in charge of the Republican Guard, a branch of the Iraqi military.\nAlthough he had a lower public profile compared to his brother Uday, he was said to have had a key role in crushing opposition during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings. As deputy head of the Special Security Organization, he was said to have authorized the use of torture against dissidents. Qusay served as the director of the Iraqi Special Security Organization from 1992 to 1997 and was in charge of the elite Republican Guard and Special Republican Guard, which were crucial to Saddam's regime. While his older brother Uday was known for being flamboyant and erratic, Qusay maintained a lower public profile and was considered quiet, calculating, and equally ruthless.\nHe was allegedly involved in severe human rights abuses, including directing the brutal suppression of the Shia uprising in southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, which included the destruction of the southern marshes, and authorizing the torture and execution of political prisoners. Due to Uday's behavior and injuries from a 1996 assassination attempt, Qusay was increasingly groomed to succeed his father. Qusay, his son Mustafa, and his brother Uday were killed in a 2003 U.S. raid in Mosul, during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\nBiography.\nQusay was born in Baghdad in 1966 to Ba'athist revolutionary Saddam Hussein, who was in prison at the time, and his wife and cousin, Sajida Talfah. Some sources have said he was born in 1965, while others have said it was either 1967 or 1968. He was widely described to be a family man and an attorney in training. He was said to have loathed the extravagance of his brother Uday, who was said to have personally victimized him as a child. Qusay exhibited several germaphobic tendencies, often cleaning himself after being touched, even by his children.\nHe married loma Maher Abd al-Rashid; the daughter of Maher Abd al-Rashid, a top-ranking military official, and had four children: a daughter named Moj (born 1987) and sons Mustafa (1989\u20132003), Adnan (born 1991), and Saddam (born 1997).\nQusay reportedly played a role in crushing the Shia uprising in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War and is also thought to have masterminded the destruction of the southern marshes of Iraq. The wholesale destruction of these marshes ended a centuries-old way of life that prevailed among the Shia Marsh Arabs who made the wetlands their home, and ruined the habitat for dozens of species of migratory birds. The Iraqi government stated that the action was intended to produce usable farmland, though a number of outsiders believe the destruction was aimed at the Marsh Arabs as retribution for their participation in the 1991 uprising.\nUday was viewed as their father's heir apparent until he sustained serious injuries in a 1996 assassination attempt. Unlike Uday, who was known for extravagance and erratic, violent behavior, Qusay kept a low profile.\nAs the deputy head of the Iraqi Special Security Organization (, \"Al-Amn al-Khas\"), numerous torture methods were utilized.\nIraqi dissidents claimed that Qusay was responsible for the killing of many political activists. \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Qusay Hussein ordered the killing of Khalis Mohsen al-Tikriti, an engineer at the military industrialization organization, because he believed Mohsen was planning to leave Iraq. He was said to have personally killed several prisoners as he walked prisons. In 1998, Iraqi opposition groups accused Qusay of ordering the execution of thousands of political prisoners, after hundreds of inmates were similarly executed to make room for new prisoners in crowded jails.\nHussein's service in the Iraqi Republican Guard began around 2000. He had the final say in many military decisions unless Saddam intervened.\nDespite his power and cunningness, Iraq's Defense minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tai claimed that Qusay \"knew nothing [about commanding military]. He understood only simple military things like a civilian. We prepared information and advice for him, and he'd accept it or not.\" Ra'ad al-Hamdani, who was Qusay's commanding officer during the 1980s, provided a partially positive assessment of him, claiming that he saved several officers (including al-Hamdani himself) whenever they had disagreements with Saddam. After 1991, Al-Hamdani remarked to Qusay that if his favorite uncle Adnan Khairallah had been alive, the Gulf War would have never happened, to which Qusay nodded in agreement.\nQusay predominately lived in Al-Jadriya, Baghdad. He owned several farms, including in al-Dora, where he grew figs, oranges, limes, apricots, pomegranates and dates.\nHours before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Qusay withdrew approximately $1 billion from the Iraqi central bank in Baghdad, acting on personal orders from Saddam. He arrived at the bank in Baghdad at 4am on 18 March, hours before the first US strikes, seized around $900 million in $100 bills and the equivalent of $100 million in euros, loaded them into three tractor-trailers, and left. This was considered the largest bank heist in history until 2011.\nAssassination attempt.\nOn 1 August 2002, Qusay was shot by members of the Iraqi National Congress during a motorcade journey. He received injuries to his arm. He was said to have survived a previous assassination attempt in 2001.\nDeath.\nSaddam Hussein's closest aide and personal secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud, had been captured, and told his interrogators that he and Saddam's two sons had sought refuge in Syria but were turned back. According to the smuggler who took them across the border, they came again after less than 48 hours. They said to the smuggler: \"A Syrian citizen will be waiting for a call from them and my mission is limited to bring them to the borders, not inside Syria.\" The smuggler said, \"They sought refuge with some of their acquaintances near the Rabia border center, and they already reached the outskirts of the city of Aleppo, and there, after replacing the broken tires of their car, the Syrian authorities, who ordered their return to Iraq, stopped them. Abd Hammoud was not staying with them, but he visited them for four days and on the fourth day they left the house. Accompanying Abid Hamid towards Mosul, there Uday and Qusay took refuge in the house of Nawaf al-Zaidan, joined by Mustafa Qusay, who was staying with his grandfather, Maher Abdul-Rashid. On 16 July 2003, he met with Qusay again, asked if he had an intention to get out of Iraq, to which Qusay replied, 'This is no longer possible. I will stay in Iraq awaiting the instructions of the father.' During their time at the villa, the sheikh reportedly left Uday and Qusay playing video games for weeks. Seven days later, Uday, Qusay, Qusay's 14-year-old son Mustafa, and their companion Abdul-Samad were killed.\" Abdul Halim Khaddam, the former vice-president of Syria, revealed that his country handed over the half-brother of Saddam Hussein to the American forces. They also deported the sons of the ousted president to Iraq and refused to receive the former foreign minister, Tariq Aziz.\nOn the afternoon of 22 July 2003, troops of the 101st Airborne 3/327th Infantry HQ and C-Company, aided by U.S. Special Forces, killed Qusay Hussein, his 14-year-old son Mustafa, his older brother Uday Hussein and a bodyguard during a raid on a house in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Acting on a tip provided the previous day from Nawaf al-Zaidan, an alleged cousin and friend of Saddam Hussein who had been sheltering the four in his home for numerous weeks, a special forces team attempted to apprehend everyone in the house at the time. After being fired upon, the special forces moved back and called for backup. After Task Force 121 members were wounded, the 3/327th Infantry surrounded and fired on the house with a TOW missile, Mk 19 grenade launcher, M2 machine guns and small arms. After about five hours of battle (the whole operation lasted 6 hours), the soldiers entered the house and found four dead, including the two brothers and their bodyguard. There were reports that Qusay Hussein's 14-year-old son Mustafa was the fourth body found. Brigadier General Frank Helmick, the assistant commander of 101st Airborne, commented that all occupants of the house died during the gun battle before U.S. troops were able to enter.\nSoldiers, who tried to enter the house three times, encountered small arms fire and grenades in the first two attempts. Uday, Qusay, and their guard protected the street and the first floor from the bathroom at the front of the house; Qusay's son took cover from the bedroom in the back. The American forces then bombed the house many times and even fired missiles. Three adults were thought to have died due to the TOW missile fired into the front of the house. In the third attempt, the soldiers killed Qusay's son after he fired at them.\nBrigade commander Colonel Joe Anderson said an Arabic announcement was made at 10 A.M. on the day and called on people inside to come out peacefully. In response, the occupants opened fire. An experienced team of commandos tried to attack the building, but they had to retreat under fire. Four American soldiers were injured. Anderson then ordered his men to fire with 50-caliber heavy machine guns. Uday and Qusay Hussein refused to surrender even after a helicopter fired a rocket and the Strike Brigade fired 40mm grenades at them. The Colonel decided that more firepower was necessary to take down the brothers, leading to 12 TOW missiles being fired into the building.\nAfter his sons' death, Saddam Hussein recorded a tape and said, \"Beloved Iraqis, your brothers Uday and Qusay, and Mustafa, the son of Qusay, took a stand of faith, which pleases God, makes a friend happy, and makes an enemy angry. They stood in the arena of jihad in Mosul, after a valiant battle with the enemy that lasted six hours. The armies of aggression mobilised all types of weapons of the ground forces against them and succeeded to harm them only when they used planes against the house where they were. Thus, they adopted a stand with which God has honoured this Hussein family so that the present would be a continuation of the brilliant, genuine, faithful, and honourable past. We thank God for what he has ordained for us when he honoured us with their martyrdom for his sake. We ask Almighty God to satisfy them and all the righteous martyrs after they satisfied him with their faithful Jihadist stand. Had Saddam Hussein had 100 children, other than Uday and Qusay, Saddam Hussein would have sacrificed them on the same path. God honoured us by their martyrdom. If you had killed Uday, Qusay, Mustafa, and another mujahideen man with them, all the youths of our nation and the youths of Iraq are Uday, Qusay, and Mustafa in the fields of jihad.\"\nOn 23 July 2003, the American command stated that it had conclusively identified two of the dead men as Saddam Hussein's sons from dental records. Because many Iraqis were skeptical of news of the deaths, the U.S. Government released photos of the corpses and allowed Iraq's governing council to identify the bodies despite the U.S. objection to the publication of American corpses on Arab television. Both brothers had grown long beards to avoid detection. Afterwards, their bodies were reconstructed by morticians. For example, Qusay Hussein's beard was shaved and facial gashes from the battle were removed. Qusay Hussein was the ace of clubs in the coalition forces' most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. His father was the ace of spades, and his brother was the ace of hearts.\nThe U.S. government also announced that the informant (possibly the owner of the villa, Nawaf al-Zaidan, in Mosul in which the brothers were killed) would receive the combined $30 million reward previously offered for their apprehension.\nQusay Hussein's two other sons, Yahya Qusay and Yaqub Qusay, are presumed alive, but their whereabouts are unknown.\nIn 2017, his nephew Massoud claimed his body was stolen by the Iranian government although this was unproven.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Quarks are fundamental particles that make up composite hadrons such as the proton, neutron and pion. QCD is a type of quantum field theory called a non-abelian gauge theory, with symmetry group SU(3). The QCD analog of electric charge is a property called \"color\". Gluons are the force carriers of the theory, just as photons are for the electromagnetic force in quantum electrodynamics. The theory is an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics. A large body of experimental evidence for QCD has been gathered over the years.\nQCD exhibits three salient properties:\nTerminology.\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann coined the word \"quark\" in its present sense. It originally comes from the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" in \"Finnegans Wake\" by James Joyce. On June 27, 1978, Gell-Mann wrote a private letter to the editor of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", in which he related that he had been influenced by Joyce's words: \"The allusion to three quarks seemed perfect.\" (Originally, only three quarks had been discovered.)\nThe three kinds of charge in QCD (as opposed to one in quantum electrodynamics or QED) are usually referred to as \"color charge\" by loose analogy to the three kinds of color (red, green and blue) perceived by humans. Other than this nomenclature, the quantum parameter \"color\" is completely unrelated to the everyday, familiar phenomenon of color.\nThe force between quarks is known as the colour force (or color force) or strong interaction, and is responsible for the nuclear force.\nSince the theory of electric charge is dubbed \"electrodynamics\", the Greek word (, \"color\") is applied to the theory of color charge, \"chromodynamics\".\nHistory.\nWith the invention of bubble chambers and spark chambers in the 1950s, experimental particle physics discovered a large and ever-growing number of particles called hadrons. It seemed that such a large number of particles could not all be fundamental. First, the particles were classified by charge and isospin by Eugene Wigner and Werner Heisenberg; then, in 1953\u201356, according to strangeness by Murray Gell-Mann and Kazuhiko Nishijima (see Gell-Mann\u2013Nishijima formula). To gain greater insight, the hadrons were sorted into groups having similar properties and masses using the \"eightfold way\", invented in 1961 by Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne'eman. Gell-Mann and George Zweig, correcting an earlier approach of Shoichi Sakata, went on to propose in 1963 that the structure of the groups could be explained by the existence of three flavors of smaller particles inside the hadrons: the quarks. Gell-Mann also briefly discussed a field theory model in which quarks interact with gluons.\nPerhaps the first remark that quarks should possess an additional quantum number was made as a short footnote in the preprint of Boris Struminsky in connection with the \u03a9\u2212 hyperon being composed of three strange quarks with parallel spins (this situation was peculiar, because since quarks are fermions, such a combination is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Three identical quarks cannot form an antisymmetric S-state. In order to realize an antisymmetric orbital S-state, it is necessary for the quark to have an additional quantum number.\u2014\u200a\nBoris Struminsky was a PhD student of Nikolay Bogolyubov. The problem considered in this preprint was suggested by Nikolay Bogolyubov, who advised Boris Struminsky in this research. In the beginning of 1965, Nikolay Bogolyubov, Boris Struminsky and Albert Tavkhelidze wrote a preprint with a more detailed discussion of the additional quark quantum degree of freedom. This work was also presented by Albert Tavkhelidze without obtaining consent of his collaborators for doing so at an international conference in Trieste (Italy), in May 1965.\nA similar mysterious situation was with the \u0394++ baryon; in the quark model, it is composed of three up quarks with parallel spins. In 1964\u201365, Oscar W. Greenberg; and Moo-Young Han and Yoichiru Nambu independently resolved the problem by proposing that quarks possess an additional SU(3) gauge degree of freedom, later called color charge. Han and Nambu noted that quarks might interact via an octet of vector gauge bosons: the gluons.\nSince free quark searches consistently failed to turn up any evidence for the new particles, and because an elementary particle back then was \"defined\" as a particle that could be separated and isolated, Gell-Mann often said that quarks were merely convenient mathematical constructs, not real particles. The meaning of this statement was usually clear in context: He meant quarks are confined, but he also was implying that the strong interactions could probably not be fully described by quantum field theory.\nRichard Feynman argued that high energy experiments showed quarks are real particles: he called them \"partons\" (since they were parts of hadrons). By particles, Feynman meant objects that travel along paths, elementary particles in a field theory.\nThe difference between Feynman's and Gell-Mann's approaches reflected a deep split in the theoretical physics community. Feynman thought the quarks have a distribution of position or momentum, like any other particle, and he (correctly) believed that the diffusion of parton momentum explained diffractive scattering. Although Gell-Mann believed that certain quark charges could be localized, he was open to the possibility that the quarks themselves could not be localized because space and time break down. This was the more radical approach of S-matrix theory.\nJames Bjorken proposed that pointlike partons would imply certain relations in deep inelastic scattering of electrons and protons, which were verified in experiments at SLAC in 1969. This led physicists to abandon the S-matrix approach for the strong interactions.\nIn 1973 the concept of color as the source of a \"strong field\" was developed into the theory of QCD by physicists Harald Fritzsch and Heinrich Leutwyler, together with physicist Murray Gell-Mann. In particular, they employed the general field theory developed in 1954 by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills (see Yang\u2013Mills theory), in which the carrier particles of a force can themselves radiate further carrier particles. (This is different from QED, where the photons that carry the electromagnetic force do not radiate further photons.)\nThe discovery of asymptotic freedom in the strong interactions by David Gross, David Politzer and Frank Wilczek allowed physicists to make precise predictions of the results of many high energy experiments using the quantum field theory technique of perturbation theory. Evidence of gluons was discovered in three-jet events at PETRA in 1979. These experiments became more and more precise, culminating in the verification of perturbative QCD at the level of a few percent at LEP, at CERN.\nThe other side of asymptotic freedom is confinement. Since the force between color charges does not decrease with distance, it is believed that quarks and gluons can never be liberated from hadrons. This aspect of the theory is verified within lattice QCD computations, but is not mathematically proven. One of the Millennium Prize Problems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute requires a claimant to produce such a proof. Other aspects of non-perturbative QCD are the exploration of phases of quark matter, including the quark\u2013gluon plasma.\nTheory.\nSome definitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nQCD in the non-perturbative regime:\nMore unsolved problems in physics\nEvery field theory of particle physics is based on certain symmetries of nature whose existence is deduced from observations. These can be\nQCD is a non-abelian gauge theory (or Yang\u2013Mills theory) of the SU(3) gauge group obtained by taking the color charge to define a local symmetry.\nSince the strong interaction does not discriminate between different flavors of quark, QCD has approximate flavor symmetry, which is broken by the differing masses of the quarks.\nThere are additional global symmetries whose definitions require the notion of chirality, discrimination between left and right-handed. If the spin of a particle has a positive projection on its direction of motion then it is called right-handed; otherwise, it is left-handed. Chirality and handedness are not the same, but become approximately equivalent at high energies.\nAdditional remarks: duality.\nAs mentioned, \"asymptotic freedom\" means that at large energy \u2013 this corresponds also to \"short distances\" \u2013 there is practically no interaction between the particles. This is in contrast \u2013 more precisely one would say \"dual\"\u2013 to what one is used to, since usually one connects the absence of interactions with \"large\"\u00a0distances. However, as already mentioned in the original paper of Franz Wegner, a solid state theorist who introduced 1971 simple gauge invariant lattice models, the high-temperature behaviour of the \"original model\", e.g. the strong decay of correlations at large distances, corresponds to the low-temperature behaviour of the (usually ordered!) \"dual model\", namely the asymptotic decay of non-trivial correlations, e.g. short-range deviations from almost perfect arrangements, for short distances. Here, in contrast to Wegner, we have only the dual model, which is that one described in this article.\nSymmetry groups.\nThe color group SU(3) corresponds to the local symmetry whose gauging gives rise to QCD. The electric charge labels a representation of the local symmetry group U(1), which is gauged to give QED: this is an abelian group. If one considers a version of QCD with \"Nf\" flavors of massless quarks, then there is a global (chiral) flavor symmetry group SUL(\"Nf\") \u00d7 SUR(\"Nf\") \u00d7 UB(1) \u00d7 UA(1). The chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum to the vector (L+R) SUV(\"Nf\") with the formation of a chiral condensate. The vector symmetry, UB(1) corresponds to the baryon number of quarks and is an exact symmetry. The axial symmetry UA(1) is exact in the classical theory, but broken in the quantum theory, an occurrence called an anomaly. Gluon field configurations called instantons are closely related to this anomaly.\nThere are two different types of SU(3) symmetry: there is the symmetry that acts on the different colors of quarks, and this is an exact gauge symmetry mediated by the gluons, and there is also a flavor symmetry that rotates different flavors of quarks to each other, or \"flavor SU(3)\". Flavor SU(3) is an approximate symmetry of the vacuum of QCD, and is not a fundamental symmetry at all. It is an accidental consequence of the small mass of the three lightest quarks.\nIn the QCD vacuum there are vacuum condensates of all the quarks whose mass is less than the QCD scale. This includes the up and down quarks, and to a lesser extent the strange quark, but not any of the others. The vacuum is symmetric under SU(2) isospin rotations of up and down, and to a lesser extent under rotations of up, down, and strange, or full flavor group SU(3), and the observed particles make isospin and SU(3) multiplets.\nThe approximate flavor symmetries do have associated gauge bosons, observed particles like the rho and the omega, but these particles are nothing like the gluons and they are not massless. They are emergent gauge bosons in an approximate string description of QCD.\nLagrangian.\nThe dynamics of the quarks and gluons are defined by the quantum chromodynamics Lagrangian. The gauge invariant QCD Lagrangian is\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the quark field, a dynamical function of spacetime, in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) gauge group, indexed by formula_3 and formula_4 running from formula_5 to formula_6; formula_7 is the Dirac adjoint of formula_8; formula_9 is the gauge covariant derivative; the \u03b3\u03bc are Gamma matrices connecting the spinor representation to the vector representation of the Lorentz group.\nHerein, the gauge covariant derivative formula_10couples the quark field with a coupling strength formula_11to the gluon fields via the infinitesimal SU(3) generators formula_12in the fundamental representation. An explicit representation of these generators is given by formula_13, wherein the formula_14are the Gell-Mann matrices.\nThe symbol formula_15 represents the gauge invariant gluon field strength tensor, analogous to the electromagnetic field strength tensor, \"F\"\u03bc\u03bd, in quantum electrodynamics. It is given by:\nformula_16\nwhere formula_17 are the gluon fields, dynamical functions of spacetime, in the adjoint representation of the SU(3) gauge group, indexed by \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" running from formula_5 to formula_19; and \"fabc\" are the structure constants of SU(3) (the generators of the adjoint representation). Note that the rules to move-up or pull-down the \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\" indices are \"trivial\", (+, ..., +), so that \"fabc\" = \"fabc\" = \"f\"\"a\"\"bc\" whereas for the \"\u03bc\" or \"\u03bd\" indices one has the non-trivial \"relativistic\" rules corresponding to the metric signature (+ \u2212 \u2212 \u2212).\nThe variables \"m\" and \"g\" correspond to the quark mass and coupling of the theory, respectively, which are subject to renormalization.\nAn important theoretical concept is the \"Wilson loop\" (named after Kenneth G. Wilson). In lattice QCD, the final term of the above Lagrangian is discretized via Wilson loops, and more generally the behavior of Wilson loops can distinguish confined and deconfined phases.\nFields.\nQuarks are massive spin-&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 fermions that carry a color charge whose gauging is the content of QCD. Quarks are represented by Dirac fields in the fundamental representation 3 of the gauge group SU(3). They also carry electric charge (either \u2212&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 or +&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443) and participate in weak interactions as part of weak isospin doublets. They carry global quantum numbers including the baryon number, which is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 for each quark, hypercharge and one of the flavor quantum numbers.\nGluons are spin-1 bosons that also carry color charges, since they lie in the adjoint representation 8 of SU(3). They have no electric charge, do not participate in the weak interactions, and have no flavor. They lie in the singlet representation 1 of all these symmetry groups.\nEach type of quark has a corresponding antiquark, of which the charge is exactly opposite. They transform in the conjugate representation to quarks, denoted formula_20.\nDynamics.\nAccording to the rules of quantum field theory, and the associated Feynman diagrams, the above theory gives rise to three basic interactions: a quark may emit (or absorb) a gluon, a gluon may emit (or absorb) a gluon, and two gluons may directly interact. This contrasts with QED, in which only the first kind of interaction occurs, since photons have no charge. Diagrams involving Faddeev\u2013Popov ghosts must be considered too (except in the unitarity gauge).\nArea law and confinement.\nDetailed computations with the above-mentioned Lagrangian show that the effective potential between a quark and its anti-quark in a meson contains a term that increases in proportion to the distance between the quark and anti-quark (formula_21), which represents some kind of \"stiffness\" of the interaction between the particle and its anti-particle at large distances, similar to the entropic elasticity of a rubber band (see below). This leads to \"confinement\"\u00a0 of the quarks to the interior of hadrons, i.e. mesons and nucleons, with typical radii \"R\"c, corresponding to former \"Bag models\" of the hadrons The order of magnitude of the \"bag radius\" is 1\u00a0fm (=\u00a010\u221215\u00a0m). Moreover, the above-mentioned stiffness is quantitatively related to the so-called \"area law\" behavior of the expectation value of the Wilson loop product \"P\"W of the ordered coupling constants around a closed loop \"W\"; i.e. formula_22 is proportional to the \"area\" enclosed by the loop. For this behavior the non-abelian behavior of the gauge group is essential.\nMethods.\nFurther analysis of the content of the theory is complicated. Various techniques have been developed to work with QCD. Some of them are discussed briefly below.\nPerturbative QCD.\nThis approach is based on asymptotic freedom, which allows perturbation theory to be used accurately in experiments performed at very high energies. Although limited in scope, this approach has resulted in the most precise tests of QCD to date.\nLattice QCD.\nAmong non-perturbative approaches to QCD, the most well established is lattice QCD. This approach uses a discrete set of spacetime points (called the lattice) to reduce the analytically intractable path integrals of the continuum theory to a very difficult numerical computation that is then carried out on supercomputers like the QCDOC, which was constructed for precisely this purpose. While it is a slow and resource-intensive approach, it has wide applicability, giving insight into parts of the theory inaccessible by other means, in particular into the explicit forces acting between quarks and antiquarks in a meson. However, the numerical sign problem makes it difficult to use lattice methods to study QCD at high density and low temperature (e.g. nuclear matter or the interior of neutron stars).\n1/\"N\" expansion.\nA well-known approximation scheme, the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044\"N\" expansion, starts from the idea that the number of colors is infinite, and makes a series of corrections to account for the fact that it is not. Until now, it has been the source of qualitative insight rather than a method for quantitative predictions. Modern variants include the AdS/CFT approach.\nEffective theories.\nFor specific problems, effective theories may be written down that give qualitatively correct results in certain limits. In the best of cases, these may then be obtained as systematic expansions in some parameters of the QCD Lagrangian. One such effective field theory is chiral perturbation theory or ChiPT, which is the QCD effective theory at low energies. More precisely, it is a low energy expansion based on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of QCD, which is an exact symmetry when quark masses are equal to zero, but for the u, d and s quark, which have small mass, it is still a good approximate symmetry. Depending on the number of quarks that are treated as light, one uses either SU(2) ChiPT or SU(3) ChiPT. Other effective theories are heavy quark effective theory (which expands around heavy quark mass near infinity), and soft-collinear effective theory (which expands around large ratios of energy scales). In addition to effective theories, models like the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model and the chiral model are often used when discussing general features.\nQCD sum rules.\nBased on an Operator product expansion one can derive sets of relations that connect different observables with each other.\nExperimental tests.\nThe notion of quark flavors was prompted by the necessity of explaining the properties of hadrons during the development of the quark model. The notion of color was necessitated by the puzzle of the . This has been dealt with in the section on the history of QCD.\nThe first evidence for quarks as real constituent elements of hadrons was obtained in deep inelastic scattering experiments at SLAC. The first evidence for gluons came in three-jet events at PETRA.\nSeveral good quantitative tests of perturbative QCD exist:\nQuantitative tests of non-perturbative QCD are fewer, because the predictions are harder to make. The best is probably the running of the QCD coupling as probed through lattice computations of heavy-quarkonium spectra. There is a recent claim about the mass of the heavy meson Bc . Other non-perturbative tests are currently at the level of 5% at best. Continuing work on masses and form factors of hadrons and their weak matrix elements are promising candidates for future quantitative tests. The whole subject of quark matter and the quark\u2013gluon plasma is a non-perturbative test bed for QCD that still remains to be properly exploited.\nOne qualitative prediction of QCD is that there exist composite particles made solely of gluons called glueballs that have not yet been definitively observed experimentally. A definitive observation of a glueball with the properties predicted by QCD would strongly confirm the theory. In principle, if glueballs could be definitively ruled out, this would be a serious experimental blow to QCD. But, as of 2013, scientists are unable to confirm or deny the existence of glueballs definitively, despite the fact that particle accelerators have sufficient energy to generate them.\nCross-relations to condensed matter physics.\nThere are unexpected cross-relations to condensed matter physics. For example, the notion of gauge invariance forms the basis of the well-known Mattis spin glasses, which are systems with the usual spin degrees of freedom formula_23 for \"i\"\u00a0=1...,N, with the special fixed \"random\" couplings formula_24 Here the \u03b5i and \u03b5k quantities can independently and \"randomly\" take the values \u00b11, which corresponds to a most-simple gauge transformation formula_25 This means that thermodynamic expectation values of measurable quantities, e.g. of the energy formula_26 are invariant.\nHowever, here the \"coupling degrees of freedom\" formula_27, which in the QCD correspond to the \"gluons\", are \"frozen\" to fixed values (quenching). In contrast, in the QCD they \"fluctuate\" (annealing), and through the large number of gauge degrees of freedom the entropy plays an important role (see below).\nFor positive \"J\"0 the thermodynamics of the Mattis spin glass corresponds in fact simply to a \"ferromagnet in disguise\", just because these systems have no \"frustration\" at all. This term is a basic measure in spin glass theory. Quantitatively it is identical with the loop product formula_28 along a closed loop \"W\". However, for a Mattis spin glass \u2013 in contrast to \"genuine\" spin glasses \u2013 the quantity \"PW\" never becomes negative.\nThe basic notion \"frustration\" of the spin-glass is actually similar to the Wilson loop quantity of the QCD. The only difference is again that in the QCD one is dealing with SU(3) matrices, and that one is dealing with a \"fluctuating\" quantity. Energetically, perfect absence of frustration should be non-favorable and atypical for a spin glass, which means that one should add the loop product to the Hamiltonian, by some kind of term representing a \"punishment\". In the QCD the Wilson loop is essential for the Lagrangian rightaway.\nThe relation between the QCD and \"disordered magnetic systems\" (the spin glasses belong to them) were additionally stressed in a paper by Fradkin, Huberman and Shenker, which also stresses the notion of duality.\nA further analogy consists in the already mentioned similarity to polymer physics, where, analogously to Wilson loops, so-called \"entangled nets\" appear, which are important for the formation of the entropy-elasticity (force proportional to the length) of a rubber band. The non-abelian character of the SU(3) corresponds thereby to the non-trivial \"chemical links\", which glue different loop segments together, and \"asymptotic freedom\" means in the polymer analogy simply the fact that in the short-wave limit, i.e. for formula_29 (where \"Rc\" is a characteristic correlation length for the glued loops, corresponding to the above-mentioned \"bag radius\", while \u03bbw is the wavelength of an excitation) any non-trivial correlation vanishes totally, as if the system had crystallized.\nThere is also a correspondence between confinement in QCD \u2013 the fact that the color field is only different from zero in the interior of hadrons \u2013 and the behaviour of the usual magnetic field in the theory of type-II superconductors: there the magnetism is confined to the interior of the Abrikosov flux-line lattice, i.e., the London penetration depth \"\u03bb\" of that theory is analogous to the confinement radius \"Rc\" of quantum chromodynamics. Mathematically, this correspondendence is supported by the second term, formula_30 on the r.h.s. of the Lagrangian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25265", "revid": "50640182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25265", "title": "Queue (abstract data type)", "text": "Abstract data type\nIn computer science, a queue is an abstract data type that serves as an ordered collection of entities. By convention, the end of the queue where elements are added, is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue. The end of the queue where elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue. The name \"queue\" is an analogy to the words used to describe people in line to wait for goods or services. It supports two main operations. \nOther operations may also be allowed, often including a \"peek\" or \"front\" operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.\nThe operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure as the first element added to the queue is the first one removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection.\nQueues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes. A queue may be implemented as circular buffers and linked lists, or by using both the stack pointer and the base pointer.\nQueues provide services in computer science, transport, and operations research where various entities such as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be processed later. In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a buffer.\nAnother usage of queues is in the implementation of breadth-first search.\nQueue implementation.\nTheoretically, one characteristic of a queue is that it does not have a specific capacity. Regardless of how many elements are already contained, a new element can always be added. It can also be empty, at which point removing an element will be impossible until a new element has been added again.\nFixed-length arrays are limited in capacity, but it is not true that items need to be copied towards the head of the queue. The simple trick of turning the array into a closed circle and letting the head and tail drift around endlessly in that circle makes it unnecessary to ever move items stored in the array. If n is the size of the array, then computing indices modulo n will turn the array into a circle. This is still the conceptually simplest way to construct a queue in a high-level language, but it does admittedly slow things down a little, because the array indices must be compared to zero and the array size, which is comparable to the time taken to check whether an array index is out of bounds, which some languages do, but this will certainly be the method of choice for a quick and dirty implementation, or for any high-level language that does not have pointer syntax. The array size must be declared ahead of time, but some implementations simply double the declared array size when overflow occurs. Most modern languages with objects or pointers can implement or come with libraries for dynamic lists. Such data structures may have not specified a fixed capacity limit besides memory constraints. Queue \"overflow\" results from trying to add an element onto a full queue and queue \"underflow\" happens when trying to remove an element from an empty queue.\nA \"bounded queue\" is a queue limited to a fixed number of items.\nThere are several efficient implementations of FIFO queues. An efficient implementation is one that can perform the operations\u2014en-queuing and de-queuing\u2014in O(1) time.\nQueues and programming languages.\nQueues may be implemented as a separate data type, or maybe considered a special case of a double-ended queue (deque) and not implemented separately. For example, Perl and Ruby allow pushing and popping an array from both ends, so one can use push and shift functions to enqueue and dequeue a list (or, in reverse, one can use unshift and pop), although in some cases these operations are not efficient.\nC++'s Standard Template Library provides a \"codice_1\" templated class which is restricted to only push/pop operations. Since J2SE5.0, Java's library contains a interface that specifies queue operations; implementing classes include and (since J2SE 1.6) . PHP has an http:// class and third-party libraries like beanstalk'd and Gearman.\nExample.\nA simple queue implemented in TypeScript:\nclass Queue&lt;T&gt; {\n private items: T[] = [];\n enqueue(element: T): void {\n this.items.push(element);\n dequeue(): T | undefined {\n return this.items.shift();\n isEmpty(): boolean {\n return this.items.length === 0;\nPurely functional implementation.\nQueues can also be implemented as a purely functional data structure. There are two implementations. The first one only achieves formula_1 per operation \"on average\". That is, the amortized time is formula_1, but individual operations can take formula_3 where \"n\" is the number of elements in the queue. The second implementation is called a real-time queue and it allows the queue to be persistent with operations in O(1) worst-case time. It is a more complex implementation and requires lazy lists with memoization. \nAmortized queue.\nThis queue's data is stored in two singly-linked lists named formula_4 and formula_5. The list formula_4 holds the front part of the queue. The list formula_5 holds the remaining elements (a.k.a., the rear of the queue) \"in reverse order\". It is easy to insert into the front of the queue by adding a node at the head of formula_4. And, if formula_5 is not empty, it is easy to remove from the end of the queue by removing the node at the head of formula_5. When formula_5 is empty, the list formula_4 is reversed and assigned to formula_5 and then the head of formula_5 is removed. \nThe insert (\"enqueue\") always takes formula_1 time. The removal (\"dequeue\") takes formula_1 when the list formula_5 is not empty. When formula_5 is empty, the reverse takes formula_3 where formula_20 is the number of elements in formula_4. But, we can say it is formula_1 amortized time, because every element in formula_4 had to be inserted and we can assign a constant cost for each element in the reverse to when it was inserted. \nReal-time queue.\nThe real-time queue achieves formula_1 time for all operations, without amortization. This discussion will be technical, so recall that, for formula_25 a list, formula_26 denotes its length, that \"NIL\" represents an empty list and formula_27 represents the list whose head is \"h\" and whose tail is \"t\".\nThe data structure used to implement our queues consists of three singly-linked lists formula_28 where \"f\" is the front of the queue and \"r\" is the rear of the queue in reverse order. The invariant of the structure is that \"s\" is the rear of \"f\" without its formula_29 first elements, that is formula_30. The tail of the queue formula_31 is then almost formula_28 and\ninserting an element \"x\" to formula_28 is almost formula_34. It is said almost, because in both of those results, formula_35. An auxiliary function formula_36 must then be called for the invariant to be satisfied. Two cases must be considered, depending on whether formula_37 is the empty list, in which case formula_38, or not. The formal definition is formula_39 and formula_40 where formula_41 is \"f\" followed by \"r\" reversed.\nLet us call formula_42 the function which returns \"f\" followed by \"r\" reversed. Let us furthermore assume that formula_38, since it is the case when this function is called. More precisely, we define a lazy function formula_44 which takes as input three lists such that formula_38, and return the concatenation of \"f\", of \"r\" reversed and of \"a\". Then formula_46.\nThe inductive definition of rotate is formula_47 and formula_48. Its running time is formula_49, but, since lazy evaluation is used, the computation is delayed until the results are forced by the computation.\nThe list \"s\" in the data structure has two purposes. This list serves as a counter for formula_50, indeed, formula_51 if and only if \"s\" is the empty list. This counter allows us to ensure that the rear is never longer than the front list. Furthermore, using \"s\", which is a tail of \"f\", forces the computation of a part of the (lazy) list \"f\" during each \"tail\" and \"insert\" operation. Therefore, when formula_51, the list \"f\" is totally forced. If it was not the case, the internal representation of \"f\" could be some append of append of... of append, and forcing would not be a constant time operation anymore.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25266", "revid": "34640237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25266", "title": "Quake (video game)", "text": "1996 video game\nQuake is a 1996 first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by GT Interactive. The first game in the \"Quake\" series, it was originally released for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, followed by Mac OS, Linux and Sega Saturn in 1997 and Nintendo 64 in 1998.\nThe game's plot is centered around teleportation experiments, dubbed slipgates, which have resulted in an unforeseen invasion of Earth by a hostile force codenamed Quake, which commands a vast army of monsters. The player takes the role of a soldier (later dubbed Ranger), whose mission is to travel through the slipgates in order to find and destroy the source of the invasion. The game is split between futuristic military bases and medieval, gothic environments, featuring both science fiction and fantasy weaponry and enemies as the player battles possessed soldiers and demonic beasts such as ogres or armor-clad knights. \"Quake\" heavily takes inspiration from gothic fiction and in particular the works of H. P. Lovecraft. The game went through many revisions during development, and had originally been inspired by a \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" campaign held among id Software staff.\nThe successor to id Software's \"Doom\" series, \"Quake\" built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor. Unlike the \"Doom\" engine before it, the \"Quake\" engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and had early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After \"Doom\" helped popularize multiplayer deathmatches, \"Quake\" added various multiplayer options. Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the QuakeWorld update and software such as QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable. \"Quake\" featured music composed by Trent Reznor and his band Nine Inch Nails.\n\"Quake\" is often cited as one of the best video games ever made. Despite its critical acclaim, \"Quake\"'s development was controversial in the history of id Software. Due to creative differences and a lack of leadership, the majority of the team left the company after the game's release, including co-founder John Romero. An \"enhanced\" version of \"Quake\" was developed by Nightdive Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One consoles in August 2021, including the original game's first two expansions and two episodes developed by MachineGames. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions were released in October 2021.\nGameplay.\nSingle-player.\nIn \"Quake\"'s single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, \"Nightmare\", was described by the game manual to be \"so bad that the entry is hidden, so people won't wander in by accident\".\n\"Quake\"'s single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a \"low gravity\" level that challenges the player's abilities in a different way). If the player's character dies, they must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub \"START\" level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of \"Quake\") has the most traditional layout with a boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the \"END\" level which contains a final puzzle.\nMultiplayer.\nIn multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player's computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in co-op (cooperative) mode, or play against each other in multiplayer (see LAN party). When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately respawn, but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of deathmatch. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either free-for-all (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one duels, or organized teamplay with two or more players per team (or clan). Players frequently implement mods during teamplay. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\nThe gameplay in \"Quake\" was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can manoeuvre through the game. Bunnyhopping or strafe-jumping allow faster movement, while rocket jumping enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some health. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to \"Quake\"'s appeal. Multiplayer \"Quake\" was one of the first games singled out as a form of electronic sport. A notable participant was Dennis Fong, who won John Carmack's Ferrari 328 at the Microsoft-sponsored Red Annihilation tournament in 1997.\nSynopsis.\nIn the single-player game, the player takes the role of the protagonist, unnamed in \"Quake\" but referred to as Ranger in later games (voiced by Trent Reznor), who is sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy code-named \"Quake\". The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a \"Slipgate\"; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the \"Human\" dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\nThe sole surviving protagonist in \"Operation Counterstrike\" is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger's main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of \"Quake\"; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.\nThe single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or \"maps\", divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game's final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through the Slipgate or magical portals (in the case of the latter three episodes) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of gothic, medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of \"Doom\" (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game's setting is inspired by dark fantasy influences, including H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the \"Spawn\" enemies are called \"Formless Spawn of Tsathoggua\" in the manual, the boss of the first episode is named Chthon, the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath and is explicitly stated to be an Old One, and the four episodes all have Lovecraftian names.\nDevelopment.\nIn the early 1990s, the staff at id Software had a private \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game, which would go on to inspire a number of elements in their titles over the following years. With John Carmack as DM, the campaign featured a group of adventurers named the Silver Shadow Band. The group were named for the silver dragon on which they flew, and each represented one of the core stats of the game. Among them was a powerful character named Quake, representing strength, who fought with a magic hammer capable of destroying buildings. Quake was accompanied by a floating magic artefact named the Hellgate Cube which attacked his foes with lightning bolts. John Romero described fighting alongside Quake as the most fun they had playing \"D&amp;D\". The Silver Shadow Band did \"contract work for Justice, an even more powerful group\". The original campaign concluded in early 1992, after Romero's character made a deal with a demon, exchanging a book called the Demonomicron for a magic sword called the Daikatana, which resulted in a demonic invasion that wiped out the Material Plane. A preview included with id Software's first release, 1990's \"Commander Keen\", advertised a game entitled \"The Fight for Justice\" as a follow-up to the \"Commander Keen\" trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, \"the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent\", armed with thunderbolts and a \"Ring of Regeneration\". Conceived as a VGA full-color side-scrolling role-playing video game, \"The Fight for Justice\" was never released. The team briefly explored making the project in 1991 but abandoned the idea as the technology for it simply did not exist at the time. The project was only in development for about two weeks.\nA return to the \"Quake\" concept was raised by John Romero in a meeting in late 1994, when discussing the next engine and main project after the completion of \"Doom II\". Newer members of the team, including American McGee and Sandy Petersen, had not been present for the original D&amp;D campaign or game project, but were on board with the idea after it was explained to them, and the team was then in agreement about the broad direction of the title. In a December 1, 1994, post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, \"Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say \"action\"? I knew you could. Quake will be constant, hectic action throughout \u2013 probably more so than Doom\".\nThe team entered into an R&amp;D phase while Carmack was working on the engine. By 1995, the outline for the game included a medieval setting, hand-to-hand combat, thrown weapons, an area of effect attack with the hammer, and feeding souls to the Hellgate Cube. Some early information on \"Quake\" was released publicly, focusing on a Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer. A close up of Quake holding his hammer was on the cover of \"PC Gamer\" for the October 1995 issue, and screenshots showed medieval environments and a dragon. Romero revealed in 2023 that the dragon model was never actually implemented, and had simply been placed in the sky for the screenshot. The plan was for the game to have more role-playing-style elements. An \"Aztec\" style texture set was developed for the project, but the set was not used due to artistic opposition from American McGee, who preferred a more heavy metal themed look for his levels. This second texture set was used for the Vaults of Zin.\nBefore gameplay could be worked on in earnest, Carmack would need to build the game engine which was a significant undertaking, and took much longer than anticipated. Carmack was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model. Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things- the networking model first, used for a game which was otherwise in the \"Doom II\" engine, and then the 3D overhaul for a second title. The \"Quake\" engine popularized several major advances in the genre: polygonal models instead of prerendered sprites; full 3D level design instead of a 2.5D map; prerendered lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with QuakeC), which popularized fan-created modifications (mods).\nWorking with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers. Around fifty levels were developed during the R&amp;D process, but engine changes meant that the team was frequently having to redo work. Much of this needed to be scrapped by the time the engine was completed in late 1995. The team was burned out from the process, and raised the idea of using the existing demo levels for a first person shooter, as it would be faster and less risky. Romero opposed the change, but relented. The creative differences would ultimately lead to his departure from the company after completing \"Quake\".\n\"Quake\" was programmed by John Carmack, Michael Abrash, and John Cash. The levels and scenarios were designed by American McGee, Sandy Petersen, John Romero, and Tim Willits, and the graphics were designed by Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud and Paul Steed. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using Alias. Initially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with the butt of a gun. Shortly before release this was replaced with an axe. id Software released \"QTest\" on February 24, 1996, a technology demo limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions. \"QTest\" gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the \"Quake\" engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.\nMorale on the project was low, and developers were under crunch from December 1995 through to release in June 1996. Romero has described the process as one of the hardest grinds of his career. He was the only member of the team to attend the office on launch day to upload the files.\nAudio.\n\"Quake\"'s music and sound design was done by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, using ambient soundscapes and synthesized drones to create atmospheric tracks. In an interview, Reznor remarked that the \"Quake\" soundtrack \"is not music[;] it's textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing... It's been fun.\" The game includes an homage to Reznor in the form of ammo boxes for the \"Nailgun\" and \"Super Nailgun\" decorated with the Nine Inch Nails logo.\nThe idea to use Nine Inch Nails for the soundtrack was raised by American McGee, who had been listening to their album \"The Downward Spiral\" during his work on the game. Romero was initially skeptical as he had envisioned a more ambient tone, but was open to the idea of the band composing with that tone in mind. id approached the band's agents, and the group had agreed to do the soundtrack by the following day as they were \"Doom\" fans and excited by the project. McGee handled the delivery of the soundtrack from there on. A legal issue that rose late in development with the record company meant that the code to play the audio from the CD was among the final changes made before release. Some digital re-releases of the game lack the CD soundtrack that came with the original shareware release. The 2021 enhanced version includes the soundtrack.\nRelease.\nPorts.\n\"Quake\" was ported to multiple platforms. The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor using X11 on July 5, 1996, followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor. An SVGAlib port for Linux was created by programmer Greg Alexander in 1997 using leaked source code but was later mainlined by id, unlike similar unofficial ports for OS/2, Amiga, Java VMs, and Mac OS. The first commercially released port was for Mac OS, done by MacSoft and Lion Entertainment, Inc. (the latter company ceased to exist just prior to the port's release, leading to MacSoft's involvement) in late August 1997. ClickBOOM announced a version for Amiga-computers in 1998. Finally in 1999, a retail version of the Linux port was distributed by Macmillan Digital Publishing USA in a bundle with the two existing add-ons as \"Quake: The Offering\".\n\"Quake\" was also ported to home console systems. On December 2, 1997, the game was released for the Sega Saturn. Initially GT Interactive was to publish this version itself, but it later cancelled the release and the Saturn rights were picked up by Sega. Sega took the project away from the original development team, who had been encountering difficulties getting the port to run at a decent frame rate, and assigned it to Lobotomy Software. The Saturn port was developed with Softimage 3D and uses Lobotomy Software's 3D engine, \"SlaveDriver\" (also used in \"PowerSlave\" and \"Duke Nukem 3D\" for the Saturn). It is the only version of \"Quake\" rated \"T\" for Teen instead of \"M\" for Mature.\n\"Quake\" was ported to the PlayStation by Lobotomy Software, but the company was not able to find a publisher for it. A port for the Atari Jaguar was reported as 30% complete in a May 1996 issue of \"Ultimate Future Games\" magazine, but it was never released. A port of \"Quake\" was planned for Panasonic M2 prior to cancellation of the system.\nOn March 24, 1998, the game was released for the Nintendo 64 by Midway Games. This version was developed by the same programming team that worked on \"Doom 64\", at id Software's request. The Nintendo 64 version was originally slated to be released in 1997, but Midway delayed it until March 1998 to give the team time to implement the deathmatch modes.\nBoth console ports required compromises because of the limited CPU power and ROM storage space for levels. For example, the levels were rebuilt in the Saturn version in order to simplify the architecture, thereby reducing demands on the CPU. The Saturn version omits the four secret levels from the original PC version of the game, replacing them with four exclusive secret levels: Purgatorium, Hell's Aerie, The Coliseum, and Watery Grave. It also contains an exclusive unlockable, \"Dank &amp; Scuz\", which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a slide show with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Saturn version. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto, The Installation, The Ebon Fortress, The Wind Tunnels, The Sewage System, and Hell's Atrium. It also does not use the hub map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order. The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, as well as an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death.\nIn 1998, LBE Systems and Lazer-Tron released a prototype titled \"Quake: Arcade Tournament Edition\" in the arcades in limited quantities. R-Comp Interactive published the game for RISC OS as \"Quake Resurrection\" in 1999, including the total conversion \"Malice\" and expansion \"Q!Zone\", although community-made source ports such as ArcQuake were also available.\nAn unreleased Game Boy Advance port of \"Quake\" was in development from Randy Linden in 2002, and was pitched to id Software in that year. The port was rejected by the company, and Linden's work would remain unused until prototypes of his work were dumped in June 2022. Two homebrew ports of \"Quake\" for the Nintendo DS exist, \"QuakeDS\" and \"CQuake\". Both run well; however, multiplayer does not work on \"QuakeDS\". Since the source code for \"Quake\" was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones. The Rockbox project also distributes a version of \"Quake\" that runs on some MP3 players.\nIn 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of \"Quake\" for mobile phones. The game was engineered by Californian company Bear Naked Productions. Initially due to be released on only two mobile phones, the Samsung Nexus (for which it was to be an embedded game) and the LG VX360. \"Quake Mobile\" was reviewed by \"GameSpot\" on the Samsung Nexus and they cited its US release as October 2005; they also gave it a \"Best Mobile Game\" in their E3 2005 Editor's Choice Awards. It is unclear as to whether the game actually did ship with the Samsung Nexus. The game is only available for the DELL x50v and x51v, both of which are PDAs, not mobile phones. \"Quake Mobile\" does not feature the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack due to space constraints. \"Quake Mobile\" runs the most recent version of GL Quake (Quake v.1.09 GL 1.00) at 800x600 resolution and 25 fps. The most recent version of \"Quake Mobile\" is v.1.20 which has stylus support. There was an earlier version v.1.19 which lacked stylus support. The two \"Quake\" expansion packs, \"Scourge of Armagon\" and \"Dissolution of Eternity\", are also available for \"Quake Mobile\".\nA Flash-based version of the game by Michael Rennie runs \"Quake\" at full speed in any Flash-enabled web browser. Based on the shareware version of the game, it includes only the first episode and is available for free on the web.\nEnhanced version.\nAt the launch of the 2021 QuakeCon@Home on August 19, 2021, Bethesda released an \"enhanced\" version of \"Quake\" for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, developed by Nightdive Studios. In addition to support for modern systems and improved rendering techniques, the enhanced version includes both mission packs, \"Scourge of Armagon\" and \"Dissolution of Eternity\". It also includes two episodes created by MachineGames: the previously released \"Dimension of the Past\" and a new one called \"Dimension of the Machine\". A port of \"Quake 64\" was also included in its entirety via the newly implemented \"Add-On\" menu.\nAdditional content.\nOriginally, there were two official expansion packs released for \"Quake\". The expansion packs pick up where the first game left off, include all of the same weapons, power-ups, monsters, and gothic atmosphere/architecture, and continue/finish the story of the first game and its protagonist. An unofficial third expansion pack, \"Abyss of Pandemonium\", was developed by the Impel Development Team, published by Perfect Publishing, and released on April 14, 1998; an updated version, version 2.0, titled \"Abyss of Pandemonium \u2013 The Final Mission\" was released as freeware. An authorized expansion pack, \"Q!ZONE\" was developed and published by WizardWorks, and released in 1996. An authorized level editor, \"Deathmatch Maker\" was developed by Virtus Corporation and published by Macmillan Digital Publishing in 1997. It contained an exclusive Virtus' Episode. In honor of \"Quake\"'s 20th anniversary, MachineGames, an internal development studio of ZeniMax Media, who are the current owners of the \"Quake\" IP, released online a new expansion pack for free, called \"Episode 5: Dimension of the Past\".\n\"Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon\" was the first official mission pack, released on March 5, 1997. Developed by Hipnotic Interactive, it features three episodes divided into seventeen new single-player levels (three of which are secret), a new multiplayer level, a new soundtrack composed by Jeehun Hwang, and gameplay features not originally present in \"Quake\", including rotating structures and breakable walls. Unlike the main \"Quake\" game and Mission Pack No. 2, \"Scourge\" does away with the episode hub, requiring the three episodes to be played sequentially. The three new enemies include Centroids, large cybernetic scorpions with nailguns; Gremlins, small goblins that can steal weapons and multiply by feeding on enemy corpses; and Spike Mines, floating orbs that detonate when near the player. The three new weapons include the Mjolnir, a large lightning emitting hammer; the Laser Cannon, which shoots bouncing bolts of energy; and the Proximity Mine Launcher, which fires grenades that attach to surfaces and detonate when an opponent comes near. The three new power-ups include the Horn of Conjuring, which summons an enemy to protect the player; the Empathy Shield, which halves the damage taken by the player between the player and the attacking enemy; and the Wetsuit, which renders the player invulnerable to electricity and allows the player to stay underwater for a period of time. The storyline follows Armagon, a general of Quake's forces, planning to invade Earth via a portal known as the 'Rift'. Armagon resembles a giant gremlin with cybernetic legs and a combined rocket launcher/laser cannon for arms.\nTim Soete of \"GameSpot\" gave it a score 8.6 out of 10.\n\"Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity\" was the second official mission pack, released on March 19, 1997. Developed by Rogue Entertainment, it features two episodes divided into fifteen new single-player levels, a new multiplayer level, a new soundtrack, and several new enemies and bosses. Notably, the pack lacks secret levels. The eight new enemies include Electric Eels, Phantom Swordsmen, Multi-Grenade Ogres (which fire cluster grenades), Hell Spawn, Wraths (floating, robed undead), Guardians (resurrected ancient Egyptian warriors), Mummies, and statues of various enemies that can come to life. The four new types of bosses include Lava Men, Overlords, large Wraths, and a dragon guarding the \"temporal energy converter\". The two new power-ups include the Anti Grav Belt, which allows the player to jump higher; and the Power Shield, which lowers the damage the player receives. Rather than offering new weapons, the mission pack gives the player four new types of ammo for existing weapons, such as \"lava nails\" for the Nailgun, cluster grenades for the Grenade Launcher, rockets that split into four in a horizontal line for the Rocket Launcher, and plasma cells for the Thunderbolt, as well as a grappling hook to help with moving around the levels.\nTim Soete of \"GameSpot\" gave it a score of 7.7 out of 10.\nTo celebrate \"Quake\"'s 20th anniversary, a mission pack was developed by MachineGames and released on June 24, 2016. It features 10 new single-player levels and a new multiplayer level, but does not use new gameplay additions from \"Scourge of Armagon\" and \"Dissolution of Eternity\".\nThe fourth mission pack, \"Dimension of the Machine\", was released as part of the enhanced version of \"Quake\" released on August 19, 2021.\n\"Quake\" can be heavily modified by altering the graphics, audio, or scripting in QuakeC, and has been the focus of many fan-created modifications, known as mods. The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in \"Quake\" fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software's original release.\nThe first major \"Quake\" mod was \"Team Fortress\". This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter \"Soldier\" class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the \"Scout\" class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one's flag in \"Threewave CTF\" would return the flag to the base, and in \"TF\" the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to \"Threewave CTF\". \"Team Fortress\" maintained its standing as the most-played online \"Quake\" modification for many years. After the developers joined Valve, \"Team Fortress\" was ported to the GoldSrc engine as \"Team Fortress Classic\". It later received a sequel, \"Team Fortress 2\", for which content continues to be developed.\nAnother popular mod was \"Threewave Capture the Flag\" (CTF), primarily authored by Dave 'Zoid' Kirsch. \"Threewave CTF\" is a partial conversion consisting of new levels, a new weapon (a grappling hook), power-ups, new textures, and new gameplay rules. Typically, two teams (red and blue) would compete in a game of Capture the flag, though a few maps with up to four teams (red, blue, green, and yellow) were created. Capture the Flag soon became a standard game mode included in most popular multiplayer games released after \"Quake\".\n\"Rocket Arena\" provides the ability for players to face each other in small, open arenas with changes in the gameplay rules so that item collection and detailed level knowledge are no longer factors. A series of short rounds, with the surviving player in each round gaining a point, instead tests the player's aiming and dodging skills and reflexes. \"Clan Arena\" is a further modification that provides team play using \"Rocket Arena\" rules. One mod category, \"bots\", was introduced to provide surrogate players in multiplayer mode.\n\"Arcane Dimensions\" is a single-player mod. It is a partial conversion with breakable objects and walls, enhanced particle system, numerous visual improvements and new enemies and weapons. The level design is much more complex in terms of geometry and gameplay than in the original game.\nThere are a large number of custom levels that have been made by users and fans of \"Quake\". As of 2019[ [update]], new maps are still being made, over 20 years since the game's release. Custom maps are new maps that are playable by loading them into the original game. Custom levels of various gameplay types have been made, but most are in the single-player and deathmatch genres. More than 1500 single-player and a similar number of deathmatch maps have been made for \"Quake\".\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n\"Quake\" was critically acclaimed on the PC. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the original PC version 93% and 94/100, and the Nintendo 64 port 76% and 74/100. A \"Next Generation\" critic lauded the game's realistic 3D physics and genuinely unnerving sound effects. \"GamePro\" said \"Quake\" had been over-hyped but is excellent nonetheless, particularly its usage of its advanced 3D engine. The review also praised the sound effects, atmospheric music, and graphics, though it criticized that the polygons used to construct the enemies are too obvious at close range.\nLess than a month after \"Quake\" was released (and a month before they actually reviewed the game), \"Next Generation\" listed it as number 9 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", saying that it is similar to \"Doom\" but supports a maximum of eight players instead of four. In 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Quake\" the 36th-best computer game ever released, and listed \"telefragged\" as #1 on its list of \"the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming\". In 1997, the Game Developers Choice Awards gave Quake three spotlight awards for Best Sound Effects, Best Music or Soundtrack and Best On-Line/Internet Game.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game a B+ and called it \"an extended bit of subterranean mayhem that offers three major improvements over its immediate predecessor [\"Doom\"].\" He identified these as the graphics, the audio design, and the amount of violent action.\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Though replay value is limited by the lack of interactive environments or even the semblance of a plot, there's no doubt that \"Quake\" and its engine are something powerful and addictive.\"\nThe Saturn version received mostly negative reviews, as critics generally agreed that it did not bring over the elements that make the game enjoyable. In particular, critics reviled the absence of the multiplayer mode, which they felt had eclipsed the single player campaign as the reason to play \"Quake\". Kraig Kujawa wrote in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"\"Quake\" is not a great one-player game - it gained its notoriety on the Net as a multiplayer.\" and his co-reviewer Sushi-X concluded \"Without multiplayer, I'd pass.\" Most reviews also said the controls are much worse than the PC original, in particular the difficulty of aiming at enemies without the benefit of either mouse-controlled camera or a second analog stick. \"GamePro\" noted that the graphics are very pixelated and blurry, to the point where people unfamiliar with \"Quake\" would not be able to discern what they're looking at. They concluded, \"\"Quake\" may not be the worst Saturn game available, but it certainly doesn't live up to its PC heritage.\" Most critics did find the port technically impressive, particularly the added light sourcing. However, \"Next Generation\" pointed out that \"Porting \"Quake\" to a console is nothing more than an excuse for bragging rights. It's simply a way to show that the limited architecture of a 32-bit system has the power to push the same game that those mighty Pentium PCs take for granted.\" Even Rich Leadbetter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\", which gave the port a 92%, acknowledged that it was a proverbial dancing bear, noting several conspicuous compromises the port made and stating as his concluding argument, \"Look, it's \"Quake\" on the Saturn - the machine has no right to be doing this!\" \"GameSpot\" opined that the game's lack of plot makes the single-player campaign feel too shallow and lacking in motivation to appeal to most gamers. Most critics compared the port unfavorably to the Saturn version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" (which came out just a few months earlier), mainly in terms of gameplay.\nReviews for the Nintendo 64 version praised its lighting effects and smooth frame rate in single-player mode. \"IGN\" added the caveats that the environments are simplified from the PC version and the pre-rendered light sourcing is less impressive than the real-time light sourcing of the Saturn version, but judged the visuals overall to be superior to those of the unaccelerated PC version. \"GamePro\" went so far as to say the graphics are as clean as those of GLQuake, while \"Next Generation\" was more moderate, concluding that \"As a whole, \"Quake 64\" doesn't live up to the experience offered by the high-end, 3D-accelerated PC version; it is, however, an entertaining gaming experience that is worthy of a close look and a nice addition to the blossoming number of first-person shooters for Nintendo 64.\" Most reviews found fault with the multiplayer, stating that the frame rate takes a hit in this mode, some of the levels are too large with only two players present, and the game should have supported four players, as previous Nintendo 64 shooters \"\" and \"GoldenEye 007\" did. However, \"Next Generation\" pointed out that on the Nintendo 64, \"Quake\" with four players would inevitably have meant a severely compromised frame rate and small view screen. \"GameSpot\" also felt the multiplayer was fun despite its limitations, and noted that setting up a deathmatch was quicker and easier on the Nintendo 64 than on PC. Reviewers sharply differed over the controls, with \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"IGN\", and \"GamePro\" all describing them as precise, responsive, and intuitive, while \"GameSpot\" and \"Next Generation\" complained that finding the right control required fiddling with the settings and even at best felt lacking compared to a keyboard-and-mouse setup. Reviews generally concluded that while the Nintendo 64 version would not appeal to \"Quake\" veterans due to its multiplayer shortcomings and lack of exclusive content, it was a strong enough conversion for non-PC gamers to enjoy the \"Quake\" experience.\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"For those who don't have LAN or internet capabilities, check out arcade \"Quake\". It's a blast.\"\nIn 1998, \"PC Gamer\" declared it the 28th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \"one of the most addictive, adaptable, and pulse-pounding 3D shooters ever created\". In 2003, \"Quake\" was inducted into GameSpot's list of the greatest games of all time.\nEnhanced version.\n\"Nintendo Life\" gave the Switch version a rave review, saying it \"wisely avoids tinkering with the magic formula that made the game so great in the first place, instead keeping the look and feel of the original intact whilst carefully adding all manner of modern bells and whistles in a feature-packed port that's an absolute dream to spend time with.\" They particularly praised the level designs, puzzle elements, atmospheric game world, and numerous configuration options for the graphical upgrades and multiplayer sessions. They argued that the smooth performance in both docked and handheld mode and ability to play the game as portable makes the Switch version the definitive version of the game.\nSales.\nAccording to David Kushner in \"Masters of Doom\", id Software released a retail shareware version of \"Quake\" before the game's full retail distribution by GT Interactive. These shareware copies could be converted into complete versions through passwords purchased via phone. However, Kushner wrote that \"gamers wasted no time hacking the shareware to unlock the full version of the game for free.\" This problem, combined with the scale of the operation, led id Software to cancel the plan. As a result, the company was left with 150,000 unsold shareware copies in storage. The venture damaged \"Quake\"'s initial sales and caused its retail push by GT Interactive to miss the holiday shopping season. Following the game's full release, Kushner remarked that its early \"sales were good \u2014 with 250,000 units shipped \u2014 but not a phenomenon like \"Doom II\".\"\nIn the United States, \"Quake\" placed sixth on PC Data's monthly computer game sales charts for November and December 1996. Its shareware edition was the sixth-best-selling computer game of 1996 overall, while its retail SKU claimed 20th place. The shareware version sold 393,575 copies and grossed $3,005,519 (~$ in 2024) in the United States during 1996. It remained in PC Data's monthly top 10 from January to April 1997, but was absent by May. During its first 12 months, \"Quake\" sold 373,000 retail copies and earned $18 million in the United States, according to PC Data. Its final retail sales for 1997 were 273,936 copies, which made it the country's 16th-highest computer game seller for the year.\nIn 1997, id estimated that there may be as many as 5 million copies of Quake circulating. The game sold over 1.4 million copies by December 1997. Sales of \"Quake\" reached 550,000 units in the United States alone by December 1999.\nLegacy.\nThe source code of \"Quake\" was released on December 22, 1999. The id Software maps, objects, textures, sounds, and other creative works remain under their original proprietary license. The shareware distribution of \"Quake\" is still freely redistributable and usable with the GPLed engine code. One must purchase a copy of \"Quake\" in order to receive the registered version of the game which includes more single-player episodes and the deathmatch maps. Based on the success of the first \"Quake\" game, \"Quake II\", \"Quake III Arena\", and \"Quake 4\" were published, with \"Quake 4\" being developed by Raven Software using the \"Doom 3\" engine.\n\"Quake\" was the game primarily responsible for the emergence of the machinima artform of films made in game engines, thanks to edited \"Quake\" demos such as \"Ranger Gone Bad\" and \"Blahbalicious\", the in-game film \"The Devil's Covenant\", and the in-game-rendered, four-hour epic film \"The Seal of Nehahra\". On June 22, 2006, it had been ten years since the original uploading of the game to cdrom.com archives. Many Internet forums had topics about it, and it was a front-page story on Slashdot. On October 11, 2006, John Romero released the original map files for all of the levels in \"Quake\".\n\"Quake\" has four sequels: \"Quake II\", \"Quake III Arena\", \"Quake 4\", and \"\". In 2002, a version of \"Quake\" was produced for mobile phones. A copy of \"Quake\" was also released as a compilation in 2001, labeled \"Ultimate Quake\", which included the original \"Quake\", \"Quake II\", and \"Quake III Arena\" which was published by Activision. In 2008, \"Quake\" was honored at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the art form of user modifiable games. John Carmack accepted the award. Years after its original release, \"Quake\" is still regarded by many critics as one of the greatest and most influential games ever made.\nIn 2025, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted \"Quake\" into its World Video Game Hall of Fame. Co-creator of \"Quake\", John Romero, attended the induction ceremony. Lindsey Kurano of The Strong Museum said \"\"Quake\u2019s\" legacy lives on in its atmospheric single player campaign, its influence in how online games are played, its active modding community, and its creation and shaping of esports.\"\nSpeedrunning.\nAs an example of the dedication that \"Quake\" has inspired in its fan community, a group of expert players recorded speedrun demos (replayable recordings of the player's movement) of \"Quake\" levels completed in record time on the \"Nightmare\" skill level. The footage was edited into a continuous 19 minutes, 49 seconds demo called \"Quake done Quick\" and released on June 10, 1997. Owners of \"Quake\" could replay this demo in the game engine, watching the run unfold as if they were playing it themselves.\nMost full-game speedruns are a collaborative effort by a number of runners (though some have been done by single runners on their own). Although each particular level is credited to one runner, the ideas and techniques used are iterative and collaborative in nature, with each runner picking up tips and ideas from the others, so that speeds keep improving beyond what was thought possible as the runs are further optimized and new tricks or routes are discovered. Further time improvements of the continuous whole game run were achieved into the 21st century. In addition, many thousands of individual level runs are kept at Speed Demos Archive's \"Quake\" section, including many on custom maps. Speedrunning is a counterpart to multiplayer modes in making \"Quake\" one of the first games promoted as a virtual sport.\nChanges at id Software.\nThe release of \"Quake\" marks the end of the classic line-up at id Software. Due to conflicts and burnout, the majority of the staff resigned from id after the game's release including Romero, Abrash, Shawn Green, Jay Wilbur, Petersen and Mike Wilson. Petersen claimed in July 2021 that the lack of a team leader was the cause of it all. He volunteered to take lead as he had five years of experience as project manager in MicroProse, but he was turned down by Carmack. Romero has discussed their relative lack of experience at the time and failure to communicate with one another, and has stated that there is no long-lasting animosity between the staff. Even though he led the project, Romero did not receive any money from \"Quake\". In 2000, Romero released \"Daikatana\", the game that he envisioned \"Quake\" being, and despite its shaky development, and being considered one of the worst games of all time, he said \"Daikatana\" was \"more fun to make than \"Quake\"\" due to the lack of creative interference.\nSequels.\nAfter the departure of Sandy Petersen, the remaining id employees chose to change the thematic direction substantially for \"Quake II\", making the design more technological and futuristic, rather than maintaining the focus on Lovecraftian horror. \"Quake 4\" followed the design themes of \"Quake II\", whereas \"Quake III Arena\" mixed these styles; it had a parallel setting that housed several \"id all-stars\" from various games as playable characters. The mixed settings occurred because \"Quake II\" originally began as a separate product line. The id designers fell back on the project's nickname of \"Quake II\" because the game's fast-paced, tactile feel felt closer to a Quake game than a new franchise. Since any sequel to the original \"Quake\" had already been vetoed, it became a way of continuing the series without continuing the storyline or setting of the first game. In June 2011, John Carmack made an offhand comment that id Software was considering going back to the \"...mixed up Cthulhu-ish Quake 1 world and rebooting [in] that direction.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25267", "revid": "31382403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25267", "title": "Quantum field theory", "text": "Theoretical framework in physics\nIn theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines field theory, special relativity and quantum mechanics. QFT is used in particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles. The current standard model of particle physics is based on QFT.\nHistory.\nQuantum field theory emerged from the work of generations of theoretical physicists spanning much of the 20th century. Its development began in the 1920s with the description of interactions between light and electrons, culminating in the first quantum field theory\u2014quantum electrodynamics. A major theoretical obstacle soon followed with the appearance and persistence of various infinities in perturbative calculations, a problem only resolved in the 1950s with the invention of the renormalization procedure. A second major barrier came with QFT's apparent inability to describe the weak and strong interactions, to the point where some theorists called for the abandonment of the field theoretic approach. The development of gauge theory and the completion of the Standard Model in the 1970s led to a renaissance of quantum field theory.\nTheoretical background.\nQuantum field theory results from the combination of classical field theory, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. A brief overview of these theoretical precursors follows.\nThe earliest successful classical field theory is one that emerged from Newton's law of universal gravitation, despite the complete absence of the concept of fields from his 1687 treatise \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\". The force of gravity as described by Isaac Newton is an \"action at a distance\"\u2014its effects on faraway objects are instantaneous, no matter the distance. In an exchange of letters with Richard Bentley, however, Newton stated that \"it is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact\". It was not until the 18th century that mathematical physicists discovered a convenient description of gravity based on fields\u2014a numerical quantity (a vector in the case of gravitational field) assigned to every point in space indicating the action of gravity on any particle at that point. However, this was considered merely a mathematical trick.\nFields began to take on an existence of their own with the development of electromagnetism in the 19th century. Michael Faraday coined the English term \"field\" in 1845. He introduced fields as properties of space (even when it is devoid of matter) having physical effects. He argued against \"action at a distance\", and proposed that interactions between objects occur via space-filling \"lines of force\". This description of fields remains to this day.\nThe theory of classical electromagnetism was completed in 1864 with Maxwell's equations, which described the relationship between the electric field, the magnetic field, electric current, and electric charge. Maxwell's equations implied the existence of electromagnetic waves, a phenomenon whereby electric and magnetic fields propagate from one spatial point to another at a finite speed, which turns out to be the speed of light. Action-at-a-distance was thus conclusively refuted.\nDespite the enormous success of classical electromagnetism, it was unable to account for the discrete lines in atomic spectra, nor for the distribution of blackbody radiation in different wavelengths. Max Planck's study of blackbody radiation marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. He treated atoms, which absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation, as tiny oscillators with the crucial property that their energies can only take on a series of discrete, rather than continuous, values. These are known as quantum harmonic oscillators. This process of restricting energies to discrete values is called quantization. Building on this idea, Albert Einstein proposed in 1905 an explanation for the photoelectric effect, that light is composed of individual packets of energy called photons (the quanta of light). This implied that the electromagnetic radiation, while being waves in the classical electromagnetic field, also exists in the form of particles.\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model of atomic structure, wherein electrons within atoms can only take on a series of discrete, rather than continuous, energies. This is another example of quantization. The Bohr model successfully explained the discrete nature of atomic spectral lines. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed the hypothesis of wave\u2013particle duality, that microscopic particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties under different circumstances. Uniting these scattered ideas, a coherent discipline, quantum mechanics, was formulated between 1925 and 1926, with important contributions from Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Paul Dirac, and Wolfgang Pauli.22\u201323\nIn the same year as his paper on the photoelectric effect, Einstein published his theory of special relativity, built on Maxwell's electromagnetism. New rules, called Lorentz transformations, were given for the way time and space coordinates of an event change under changes in the observer's velocity, and the distinction between time and space was blurred.19 It was proposed that all physical laws must be the same for observers at different velocities, i.e. that physical laws be invariant under Lorentz transformations.\nTwo difficulties remained. Observationally, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation underlying quantum mechanics could explain the stimulated emission of radiation from atoms, where an electron emits a new photon under the action of an external electromagnetic field, but it was unable to explain spontaneous emission, where an electron spontaneously decreases in energy and emits a photon even without the action of an external electromagnetic field. Theoretically, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation could not describe photons and was inconsistent with the principles of special relativity\u2014it treats time as an ordinary number while promoting spatial coordinates to linear operators.\nQuantum electrodynamics.\nQuantum field theory naturally began with the study of electromagnetic interactions, as the electromagnetic field was the only known classical field as of the 1920s.1\nThrough the works of Born, Heisenberg, and Pascual Jordan in 1925\u20131926, a quantum theory of the free electromagnetic field (one with no interactions with matter) was developed via canonical quantization by treating the electromagnetic field as a set of quantum harmonic oscillators.1 With the exclusion of interactions, however, such a theory was yet incapable of making quantitative predictions about the real world.22\nIn his seminal 1927 paper \"The quantum theory of the emission and absorption of radiation\", Dirac coined the term quantum electrodynamics (QED), a theory that adds upon the terms describing the free electromagnetic field an additional interaction term between electric current density and the electromagnetic vector potential. Using first-order perturbation theory, he successfully explained the phenomenon of spontaneous emission. According to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, quantum harmonic oscillators cannot remain stationary, but they have a non-zero minimum energy and must always be oscillating, even in the lowest energy state (the ground state). Therefore, even in a perfect vacuum, there remains an oscillating electromagnetic field having zero-point energy. It is this quantum fluctuation of electromagnetic fields in the vacuum that \"stimulates\" the spontaneous emission of radiation by electrons in atoms. Dirac's theory was hugely successful in explaining both the emission and absorption of radiation by atoms; by applying second-order perturbation theory, it was able to account for the scattering of photons, resonance fluorescence and non-relativistic Compton scattering. Nonetheless, the application of higher-order perturbation theory was plagued with problematic infinities in calculations.\nIn 1928, Dirac wrote down a wave equation that described relativistic electrons: the Dirac equation. It had the following important consequences: the spin of an electron is 1/2; the electron \"g\"-factor is 2; it led to the correct Sommerfeld formula for the fine structure of the hydrogen atom; and it could be used to derive the Klein\u2013Nishina formula for relativistic Compton scattering. Although the results were fruitful, the theory also apparently implied the existence of negative energy states, which would cause atoms to be unstable, since they could always decay to lower energy states by the emission of radiation.\nThe prevailing view at the time was that the world was composed of two very different ingredients: material particles (such as electrons) and quantum fields (such as photons). Material particles were considered to be eternal, with their physical state described by the probabilities of finding each particle in any given region of space or range of velocities. On the other hand, photons were considered merely the excited states of the underlying quantized electromagnetic field, and could be freely created or destroyed. It was between 1928 and 1930 that Jordan, Eugene Wigner, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Enrico Fermi discovered that material particles could also be seen as excited states of quantum fields. Just as photons are excited states of the quantized electromagnetic field, so each type of particle had its corresponding quantum field: an electron field, a proton field, etc. Given enough energy, it would now be possible to create material particles. Building on this idea, Fermi proposed in 1932 an explanation for beta decay known as Fermi's interaction. Atomic nuclei do not contain electrons \"per se\", but in the process of decay, an electron is created out of the surrounding electron field, analogous to the photon created from the surrounding electromagnetic field in the radiative decay of an excited atom.22\u201323\nIt was realized in 1929 by Dirac and others that negative energy states implied by the Dirac equation could be removed by assuming the existence of particles with the same mass as electrons but opposite electric charge. This not only ensured the stability of atoms, but it was also the first proposal of the existence of antimatter. Indeed, the evidence for positrons was discovered in 1932 by Carl David Anderson in cosmic rays. With enough energy, such as by absorbing a photon, an electron-positron pair could be created, a process called pair production; the reverse process, annihilation, could also occur with the emission of a photon. This showed that particle numbers need not be fixed during an interaction. Historically, however, positrons were at first thought of as \"holes\" in an infinite electron sea, rather than a new kind of particle, and this theory was referred to as the Dirac hole theory.23 QFT naturally incorporated antiparticles in its formalism.24\nInfinities and renormalization.\nRobert Oppenheimer showed in 1930 that higher-order perturbative calculations in QED always resulted in infinite quantities, such as the electron self-energy and the vacuum zero-point energy of the electron and photon fields, suggesting that the computational methods at the time could not properly deal with interactions involving photons with extremely high momenta.25 It was not until 20 years later that a systematic approach to remove such infinities was developed.\nA series of papers was published between 1934 and 1938 by Ernst Stueckelberg that established a relativistically invariant formulation of QFT. In 1947, Stueckelberg also independently developed a complete renormalization procedure. Such achievements were not understood and recognized by the theoretical community.\nFaced with these infinities, John Archibald Wheeler and Heisenberg proposed, in 1937 and 1943 respectively, to supplant the problematic QFT with the so-called S-matrix theory. Since the specific details of microscopic interactions are inaccessible to observations, the theory should only attempt to describe the relationships between a small number of observables (\"e.g.\" the energy of an atom) in an interaction, rather than be concerned with the microscopic minutiae of the interaction. In 1945, Richard Feynman and Wheeler daringly suggested abandoning QFT altogether and proposed action-at-a-distance as the mechanism of particle interactions.26\nIn 1947, Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford measured the minute difference in the 2\"S\"1/2 and 2\"P\"1/2 energy levels of the hydrogen atom, also called the Lamb shift. By ignoring the contribution of photons whose energy exceeds the electron mass, Hans Bethe successfully estimated the numerical value of the Lamb shift.28 Subsequently, Norman Myles Kroll, Lamb, James Bruce French, and Victor Weisskopf again confirmed this value using an approach in which infinities cancelled other infinities to result in finite quantities. However, this method was clumsy and unreliable and could not be generalized to other calculations.\nThe breakthrough eventually came around 1950 when a more robust method for eliminating infinities was developed by Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, Freeman Dyson, and Shinichiro Tomonaga. The main idea is to replace the calculated values of mass and charge, infinite though they may be, by their finite measured values. This systematic computational procedure is known as renormalization and can be applied to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. As Tomonaga said in his Nobel lecture:Since those parts of the modified mass and charge due to field reactions [become infinite], it is impossible to calculate them by the theory. However, the mass and charge observed in experiments are not the original mass and charge but the mass and charge as modified by field reactions, and they are finite. On the other hand, the mass and charge appearing in the theory are\u2026 the values modified by field reactions. Since this is so, and particularly since the theory is unable to calculate the modified mass and charge, we may adopt the procedure of substituting experimental values for them phenomenologically... This procedure is called the renormalization of mass and charge\u2026 After long, laborious calculations, less skillful than Schwinger's, we obtained a result... which was in agreement with [the] Americans'.\nBy applying the renormalization procedure, calculations were finally made to explain the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (the deviation of the electron \"g\"-factor from 2) and vacuum polarization. These results agreed with experimental measurements to a remarkable degree, thus marking the end of a \"war against infinities\".\nAt the same time, Feynman introduced the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and Feynman diagrams.2 The latter can be used to visually and intuitively organize and to help compute terms in the perturbative expansion. Each diagram can be interpreted as paths of particles in an interaction, with each vertex and line having a corresponding mathematical expression, and the product of these expressions gives the scattering amplitude of the interaction represented by the diagram.5\nIt was with the invention of the renormalization procedure and Feynman diagrams that QFT finally arose as a complete theoretical framework.2\nNon-renormalizability.\nGiven the tremendous success of QED, many theorists believed, in the few years after 1949, that QFT could soon provide an understanding of all microscopic phenomena, not only the interactions between photons, electrons, and positrons. Contrary to this optimism, QFT entered yet another period of depression that lasted for almost two decades.30\nThe first obstacle was the limited applicability of the renormalization procedure. In perturbative calculations in QED, all infinite quantities could be eliminated by redefining a small (finite) number of physical quantities (namely the mass and charge of the electron). Dyson proved in 1949 that this is only possible for a small class of theories called \"renormalizable theories\", of which QED is an example. However, most theories, including the Fermi theory of the weak interaction, are \"non-renormalizable\". Any perturbative calculation in these theories beyond the first order would result in infinities that could not be removed by redefining a finite number of physical quantities.30\nThe second major problem stemmed from the limited validity of the Feynman diagram method, which is based on a series expansion in perturbation theory. In order for the series to converge and low-order calculations to be a good approximation, the coupling constant, in which the series is expanded, must be a sufficiently small number. The coupling constant in QED is the fine-structure constant \"\u03b1\" \u2248 1/137, which is small enough that only the simplest, lowest order, Feynman diagrams need to be considered in realistic calculations. In contrast, the coupling constant in the strong interaction is roughly of the order of one, making complicated, higher order, Feynman diagrams just as important as simple ones. There was thus no way of deriving reliable quantitative predictions for the strong interaction using perturbative QFT methods.31\nWith these difficulties looming, many theorists began to turn away from QFT. Some focused on symmetry principles and conservation laws, while others picked up the old S-matrix theory of Wheeler and Heisenberg. QFT was used heuristically as guiding principles, but not as a basis for quantitative calculations.31\nSource theory.\nSchwinger, however, took a different route. For more than a decade he and his students had been nearly the only exponents of field theory,454 but in 1951 he found a way around the problem of the infinities with a new method using \"external sources\" as currents coupled to gauge fields. Motivated by the former findings, Schwinger kept pursuing this approach in order to \"quantumly\" generalize the classical process of coupling external forces to the configuration space parameters known as Lagrange multipliers. He summarized his source theory in 1966 then expanded the theory's applications to quantum electrodynamics in his three volume-set titled: \"Particles, Sources, and Fields.\" Developments in pion physics, in which the new viewpoint was most successfully applied, convinced him of the great advantages of mathematical simplicity and conceptual clarity that its use bestowed.\nIn source theory there are no divergences, and no renormalization. It may be regarded as the calculational tool of field theory, but it is more general. Using source theory, Schwinger was able to calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, which he had done in 1947, but this time with no 'distracting remarks' about infinite quantities.467\nSchwinger also applied source theory to his QFT theory of gravity, and was able to reproduce all four of Einstein's classic results: gravitational red shift, deflection and slowing of light by gravity, and the perihelion precession of Mercury. The neglect of source theory by the physics community was a major disappointment for Schwinger:The lack of appreciation of these facts by others was depressing, but understandable. -J. SchwingerSee \"the shoes incident\" between J. Schwinger and S. Weinberg.\nStandard model.\nIn 1954, Yang Chen-Ning and Robert Mills generalized the local symmetry of QED, leading to non-Abelian gauge theories (also known as Yang\u2013Mills theories), which are based on more complicated local symmetry groups. In QED, (electrically) charged particles interact via the exchange of photons, while in non-Abelian gauge theory, particles carrying a new type of \"charge\" interact via the exchange of massless gauge bosons. Unlike photons, these gauge bosons themselves carry charge.32\nSheldon Glashow developed a non-Abelian gauge theory that unified the electromagnetic and weak interactions in 1960. In 1964, Abdus Salam and John Clive Ward arrived at the same theory through a different path. This theory, nevertheless, was non-renormalizable.\nPeter Higgs, Robert Brout, Fran\u00e7ois Englert, Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble proposed in their famous \"Physical Review Letters\" papers that the gauge symmetry in Yang\u2013Mills theories could be broken by a mechanism called spontaneous symmetry breaking, through which originally massless gauge bosons could acquire mass.5\u20136\nBy combining the earlier theory of Glashow, Salam, and Ward with the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking, Steven Weinberg wrote down in 1967 a theory describing electroweak interactions between all leptons and the effects of the Higgs boson. His theory was at first mostly ignored,6 until it was brought back to light in 1971 by Gerard 't Hooft's proof that non-Abelian gauge theories are renormalizable. The electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam was extended from leptons to quarks in 1970 by Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani, marking its completion.\nHarald Fritzsch, Murray Gell-Mann, and Heinrich Leutwyler discovered in 1971 that certain phenomena involving the strong interaction could also be explained by non-Abelian gauge theory. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) was born. In 1973, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, and Hugh David Politzer showed that non-Abelian gauge theories are \"asymptotically free\", meaning that under renormalization, the coupling constant of the strong interaction decreases as the interaction energy increases. (Similar discoveries had been made numerous times previously, but they had been largely ignored.) 11 Therefore, at least in high-energy interactions, the coupling constant in QCD becomes sufficiently small to warrant a perturbative series expansion, making quantitative predictions for the strong interaction possible.32\nThese theoretical breakthroughs brought about a renaissance in QFT. The full theory, which includes the electroweak theory and chromodynamics, is referred to today as the Standard Model of elementary particles. The Standard Model successfully describes all fundamental interactions except gravity, and its many predictions have been met with remarkable experimental confirmation in subsequent decades.3 The Higgs boson, central to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, was finally detected in 2012 at CERN, marking the complete verification of the existence of all constituents of the Standard Model.\nOther developments.\nThe 1970s saw the development of non-perturbative methods in non-Abelian gauge theories. The 't Hooft\u2013Polyakov monopole was discovered theoretically by 't Hooft and Alexander Polyakov, flux tubes by Holger Bech Nielsen and Poul Olesen, and instantons by Polyakov and coauthors. These objects are inaccessible through perturbation theory.4\nSupersymmetry also appeared in the same period. The first supersymmetric QFT in four dimensions was built by Yuri Golfand and Evgeny Likhtman in 1970, but their result failed to garner widespread interest due to the Iron Curtain. Supersymmetry theories only took off in the theoretical community after the work of Julius Wess and Bruno Zumino in 1973,7 but to date have not been widely accepted as part of the Standard Model due to lack of experimental evidence.\nAmong the four fundamental interactions, gravity remains the only one that lacks a consistent QFT description. Various attempts at a theory of quantum gravity led to the development of string theory,6 itself a type of two-dimensional QFT with conformal symmetry. Jo\u00ebl Scherk and John Schwarz first proposed in 1974 that string theory could be \"the\" quantum theory of gravity.\nCondensed-matter-physics.\nAlthough quantum field theory arose from the study of interactions between elementary particles, it has been successfully applied to other physical systems, particularly to many-body systems in condensed matter physics.\nHistorically, the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking was a result of Yoichiro Nambu's application of superconductor theory to elementary particles, while the concept of renormalization came out of the study of second-order phase transitions in matter.\nSoon after the introduction of photons, Einstein performed the quantization procedure on vibrations in a crystal, leading to the first quasiparticle\u2014phonons. Lev Landau claimed that low-energy excitations in many condensed matter systems could be described in terms of interactions between a set of quasiparticles. The Feynman diagram method of QFT was naturally well suited to the analysis of various phenomena in condensed matter systems.\nGauge theory is used to describe the quantization of magnetic flux in superconductors, the resistivity in the quantum Hall effect, as well as the relation between frequency and voltage in the AC Josephson effect.\nPrinciples.\nFor simplicity, natural units are used in the following sections, in which the reduced Planck constant \"\u0127\" and the speed of light \"c\" are both set to one.\nClassical fields.\nA classical field is a function of spatial and time coordinates. Examples include the gravitational field in Newtonian gravity g(x, \"t\") and the electric field E(x, \"t\") and magnetic field B(x, \"t\") in classical electromagnetism. A classical field can be thought of as a numerical quantity assigned to every point in space that changes in time. Hence, it has infinitely many degrees of freedom.\nMany phenomena exhibiting quantum mechanical properties cannot be explained by classical fields alone. Phenomena such as the photoelectric effect are best explained by discrete particles (photons), rather than a spatially continuous field. The goal of quantum field theory is to describe various quantum mechanical phenomena using a modified concept of fields.\nCanonical quantization and path integrals are two common formulations of QFT. To motivate the fundamentals of QFT, an overview of classical field theory follows.\nThe simplest classical field is a real scalar field \u2014 a real number at every point in space that changes in time. It is denoted as \"\u03d5\"(x, \"t\"), where x is the position vector, and \"t\" is the time. Suppose the Lagrangian of the field, formula_1, is\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the Lagrangian density, formula_4 is the time-derivative of the field, \u2207 is the gradient operator, and \"m\" is a real parameter (the \"mass\" of the field). Applying the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation on the Lagrangian:16\nformula_5\nwe obtain the equations of motion for the field, which describe the way it varies in time and space:\nformula_6\nThis is known as the Klein\u2013Gordon equation.17\nThe Klein\u2013Gordon equation is a wave equation, so its solutions can be expressed as a sum of normal modes (obtained via Fourier transform) as follows:\nformula_7\nwhere \"a\" is a complex number (normalized by convention), * denotes complex conjugation, and \"\u03c9\"p is the frequency of the normal mode:\nformula_8\nwhere \"g\" \n det(\"g\u03bc\u03bd\"), and \u2207\"\u03bc\" denotes the covariant derivative. The Lagrangian of a QFT, hence its calculational results and physical predictions, depends on the geometry of the spacetime background.\nTopological quantum field theory.\nThe correlation functions and physical predictions of a QFT depend on the spacetime metric \"g\u03bc\u03bd\". For a special class of QFTs called topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), all correlation functions are independent of continuous changes in the spacetime metric. QFTs in curved spacetime generally change according to the \"geometry\" (local structure) of the spacetime background, while TQFTs are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms but are sensitive to the \"topology\" (global structure) of spacetime. This means that all calculational results of TQFTs are topological invariants of the underlying spacetime. Chern\u2013Simons theory is an example of TQFT and has been used to construct models of quantum gravity. Applications of TQFT include the fractional quantum Hall effect and topological quantum computers. The world line trajectory of fractionalized particles (known as anyons) can form a link configuration in the spacetime, which relates the braiding statistics of anyons in physics to the\nlink invariants in mathematics. Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) applicable to the frontier research of topological quantum matters include Chern-Simons-Witten gauge theories in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, other new exotic TQFTs in 3+1 spacetime dimensions and beyond.\nPerturbative and non-perturbative methods.\nUsing perturbation theory, the total effect of a small interaction term can be approximated order by order by a series expansion in the number of virtual particles participating in the interaction. Every term in the expansion may be understood as one possible way for (physical) particles to interact with each other via virtual particles, expressed visually using a Feynman diagram. The electromagnetic force between two electrons in QED is represented (to first order in perturbation theory) by the propagation of a virtual photon. In a similar manner, the W and Z bosons carry the weak interaction, while gluons carry the strong interaction. The interpretation of an interaction as a sum of intermediate states involving the exchange of various virtual particles only makes sense in the framework of perturbation theory. In contrast, non-perturbative methods in QFT treat the interacting Lagrangian as a whole without any series expansion. Instead of particles that carry interactions, these methods have spawned such concepts as 't Hooft\u2013Polyakov monopole, domain wall, flux tube, and instanton. Examples of QFTs that are completely solvable non-perturbatively include minimal models of conformal field theory and the Thirring model.\nMathematical rigor.\nIn spite of its overwhelming success in particle physics and condensed matter physics, QFT itself lacks a formal mathematical foundation. For example, according to Haag's theorem, there does not exist a well-defined interaction picture for QFT, which implies that perturbation theory of QFT, which underlies the entire Feynman diagram method, is fundamentally ill-defined.\nHowever, \"perturbative\" quantum field theory, which only requires that quantities be computable as a formal power series without any convergence requirements, can be given a rigorous mathematical treatment. In particular, Kevin Costello's monograph \"Renormalization and Effective Field Theory\" provides a rigorous formulation of perturbative renormalization that combines both the effective-field theory approaches of Kadanoff, Wilson, and Polchinski, together with the Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to quantizing gauge theories. Furthermore, perturbative path-integral methods, typically understood as formal computational methods inspired from finite-dimensional integration theory, can be given a sound mathematical interpretation from their finite-dimensional analogues.\nSince the 1950s, theoretical physicists and mathematicians have attempted to organize all QFTs into a set of axioms, in order to establish the existence of concrete models of relativistic QFT in a mathematically rigorous way and to study their properties. This line of study is called constructive quantum field theory, a subfield of mathematical physics, which has led to such results as CPT theorem, spin\u2013statistics theorem, and Goldstone's theorem, and also to mathematically rigorous constructions of many interacting QFTs in two and three spacetime dimensions, e.g. two-dimensional scalar field theories with arbitrary polynomial interactions, the three-dimensional scalar field theories with a quartic interaction, etc.\nCompared to ordinary QFT, topological quantum field theory and conformal field theory are better supported mathematically \u2014 both can be classified in the framework of representations of cobordisms.\nAlgebraic quantum field theory is another approach to the axiomatization of QFT, in which the fundamental objects are local operators and the algebraic relations between them. Axiomatic systems following this approach include Wightman axioms and Haag\u2013Kastler axioms.2\u20133 One way to construct theories satisfying Wightman axioms is to use Osterwalder\u2013Schrader axioms, which give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a real time theory to be obtained from an imaginary time theory by analytic continuation (Wick rotation).10\nYang\u2013Mills existence and mass gap, one of the Millennium Prize Problems, concerns the well-defined existence of Yang\u2013Mills theories as set out by the above axioms.

{"id": "25268", "revid": "44535654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25268", "title": "Quantum electrodynamics", "text": "Quantum field theory of electromagnetism\nIn particle physics, quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.\nIn technical terms, QED can be described as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. Richard Feynman called it \"the jewel of physics\" for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen. It is the most precise and stringently tested theory in physics.\nHistory.\nThe first formulation of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to Paul Dirac, who during the 1920s computed the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom. He is credited with coining the term \"quantum electrodynamics\".\nDirac described the quantization of the electromagnetic field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the introduction of the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, Werner Heisenberg and Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, it was possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting doubt on the theory's internal consistency. This suggested that special relativity and quantum mechanics were fundamentally incompatible.\nDifficulties increased through the end of the 1940s. Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, later known as the Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron. These experiments exposed discrepancies that the theory was unable to explain.\nA first indication of a possible solution was given by Hans Bethe in 1947. He made the first non-relativistic computation of the shift of the lines of the hydrogen atom as measured by Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford. Despite limitations of the computation, agreement was excellent. The idea was simply to attach infinities to corrections of mass and charge that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments. In this way, the infinities get absorbed in those constants and yield a finite result with good experimental agreement. This procedure was named renormalization.\nBased on Bethe's intuition and fundamental papers on the subject by Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Freeman Dyson, it was finally possible to produce fully covariant formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman were jointly awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in this area. Their contributions, and Dyson's, were about covariant and gauge-invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his diagrams, initially seemed unlike the field-theoretic, operator-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Renormalization, the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals, became one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and is seen as a criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Even though renormalization works well in practice, Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity, referring to renormalization as a \"shell game\" and \"hocus pocus\".\nNeither Feynman nor Dirac were happy with that way to approach the observations made in theoretical physics, above all in quantum mechanics.\nQED is the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s, developed by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on Schwinger's pioneering work, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.\nFeynman's view of quantum electrodynamics.\nIntroduction.\nNear the end of his life, Richard Feynman gave a series of lectures on QED intended for the lay public. These lectures were transcribed and published as Feynman (1985), \"\", a classic non-mathematical exposition of QED from the point of view articulated below.\nThe key components of Feynman's presentation of QED are three basic actions.\n A photon goes from one place and time to another place and time.\n An electron goes from one place and time to another place and time.\n An electron emits or absorbs a photon at a certain place and time.\nThese actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all be seen in the adjacent diagram.\nAs well as the visual shorthand for the actions, Feynman introduces another kind of shorthand for the numerical quantities called probability amplitudes. The probability is the square of the absolute value of total probability amplitude, formula_1. If a photon moves from one place and time formula_2 to another place and time formula_3, the associated quantity is written in Feynman's shorthand as formula_4, and it depends on only the momentum and polarization of the photon. The similar quantity for an electron moving from formula_5 to formula_6 is written formula_7. It depends on the momentum and polarization of the electron, in addition to a constant Feynman calls \"n\", sometimes called the \"bare\" mass of the electron: it is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron mass. Finally, the quantity that tells us about the probability amplitude for an electron to emit or absorb a photon Feynman calls \"j\", and is sometimes called the \"bare\" charge of the electron: it is a constant, and is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron charge \"e\".\nQED is based on the assumption that complex interactions of many electrons and photons can be represented by fitting together a suitable collection of the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction. It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above (\"P\"(\"A\" to \"B\"), \"E\"(\"C\" to \"D\") and \"j\") acts just like our everyday probability (a simplification made in Feynman's book). Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.\nThe basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:\nThe indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is \"no observable feature present in the given system\" that in any way \"reveals\" which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). Whenever one \"is\" able to observe which alternative takes place, one always finds that the \"probability\" of the event is the sum of the \"probabilities\" of the alternatives. Indeed, if this were not the case, the very term \"alternatives\" to describe these processes would be inappropriate. What (a) says is that once the \"physical means\" for observing which alternative occurred is \"removed\", one cannot still say that the event is occurring through \"exactly one of the alternatives\" in the sense of adding probabilities; one must add the amplitudes instead.\nSimilarly, the independence criterion in (b) is very important: it only applies to processes which are not \"entangled\".\nBasic constructions.\nSuppose we start with one electron at a certain place and time (this place and time being given the arbitrary label \"A\") and a photon at another place and time (given the label \"B\"). A typical question from a physical standpoint is: \"What is the probability of finding an electron at \"C\" (another place and a later time) and a photon at \"D\" (yet another place and time)?\". The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from \"A\" to \"C\" (an elementary action) and for the photon to move from \"B\" to \"D\" (another elementary action). From a knowledge of the probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes \u2013 \"E\"(\"A\" to \"C\") and \"P\"(\"B\" to \"D\") \u2013 we would expect to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b) above. This gives a simple estimated overall probability amplitude, which is squared to give an estimated probability.\nBut there are other ways in which the result could come about. The electron might move to a place and time \"E\", where it absorbs the photon; then move on before emitting another photon at \"F\"; then move on to \"C\", where it is detected, while the new photon moves on to \"D\". The probability of this complex process can again be calculated by knowing the probability amplitudes of each of the individual actions: three electron actions, two photon actions and two vertexes \u2013 one emission and one absorption. We would expect to find the total probability amplitude by multiplying the probability amplitudes of each of the actions, for any chosen positions of \"E\" and \"F\". We then, using rule a) above, have to add up all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for \"E\" and \"F\". (This is not elementary in practice and involves integration.) But there is another possibility, which is that the electron first moves to \"G\", where it emits a photon, which goes on to \"D\", while the electron moves on to \"H\", where it absorbs the first photon, before moving on to \"C\". Again, we can calculate the probability amplitude of these possibilities (for all points \"G\" and \"H\"). We then have a better estimation for the total probability amplitude by adding the probability amplitudes of these two possibilities to our original simple estimate. Incidentally, the name given to this process of a photon interacting with an electron in this way is Compton scattering.\nAn \"infinite number\" of other intermediate \"virtual\" processes exist in which photons are absorbed or emitted. For each of these processes, a Feynman diagram could be drawn describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram, the less it contributes to the result, it is only a matter of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of \"any\" interactive process between electrons and photons, it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.\nThat basic scaffolding remains when one moves to a quantum description, but some conceptual changes are needed. One is that whereas we might expect in our everyday life that there would be some constraints on the points to which a particle can move, that is \"not\" true in full quantum electrodynamics. There is a nonzero probability amplitude of an electron at \"A\", or a photon at \"B\", moving as a basic action to \"any other place and time in the universe\". That includes places that could only be reached at speeds greater than that of light and also \"earlier times\". (An electron moving backwards in time can be viewed as a positron moving forward in time.)\nProbability amplitudes.\nQuantum mechanics introduces an important change in the way probabilities are computed. Probabilities are still represented by the usual real numbers we use for probabilities in our everyday world, but probabilities are computed as the square modulus of probability amplitudes, which are complex numbers.\nFeynman avoids exposing the reader to the mathematics of complex numbers by using a simple but accurate representation of them as arrows on a piece of paper or screen. (These must not be confused with the arrows of Feynman diagrams, which are simplified representations in two dimensions of a relationship between points in three dimensions of space and one of time.) The amplitude arrows are fundamental to the description of the world given by quantum theory. They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the \"square\" of the length of the corresponding amplitude arrow. So, for a given process, if two probability amplitudes, v and w, are involved, the probability of the process will be given either by\nformula_8\nor\nformula_9\nThe rules as regards adding or multiplying, however, are the same as above. But where you would expect to add or multiply probabilities, instead you add or multiply probability amplitudes that now are complex numbers.\nAddition and multiplication are common operations in the theory of complex numbers and are given in the figures. The sum is found as follows. Let the start of the second arrow be at the end of the first. The sum is then a third arrow that goes directly from the beginning of the first to the end of the second. The product of two arrows is an arrow whose length is the product of the two lengths. The direction of the product is found by adding the angles that each of the two have been turned through relative to a reference direction: that gives the angle that the product is turned relative to the reference direction.\nThat change, from probabilities to probability amplitudes, complicates the mathematics without changing the basic approach. But that change is still not quite enough because it fails to take into account the fact that both photons and electrons can be polarized, which is to say that their orientations in space and time have to be taken into account. Therefore, \"P\"(\"A\" to \"B\") consists of 16 complex numbers, or probability amplitude arrows. There are also some minor changes to do with the quantity \"j\", which may have to be rotated by a multiple of 90\u00b0 for some polarizations, which is only of interest for the detailed bookkeeping.\nAssociated with the fact that the electron can be polarized is another small necessary detail, which is connected with the fact that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that if we have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse \u2013 the negative \u2013 of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at \"A\" and \"B\" ending at \"C\" and \"D\". The amplitude would be calculated as the \"difference\", \"E\"(\"A\" to \"D\") \u00d7 \"E\"(\"B\" to \"C\") \u2212 \"E\"(\"A\" to \"C\") \u00d7 \"E\"(\"B\" to \"D\"), where we would expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.\nPropagators.\nFinally, one has to compute \"P\"(\"A\" to \"B\") and \"E\"(\"C\" to \"D\") corresponding to the probability amplitudes for the photon and the electron respectively. These are essentially the solutions of the Dirac equation, which describe the behavior of the electron's probability amplitude and the Maxwell's equations, which describes the behavior of the photon's probability amplitude. These are called Feynman propagators. The translation to a notation commonly used in the standard literature is as follows:\nformula_10\nwhere a shorthand symbol such as formula_11 stands for the four real numbers that give the time and position in three dimensions of the point labeled \"A\".\nMass renormalization.\nA problem arose historically which held up progress for twenty years: although we start with the assumption of three basic \"simple\" actions, the rules of the game say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from \"A\" to \"B\", we must take into account \"all\" the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those endpoints. Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to \"C\", emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at \"D\" before moving on to \"B\". Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short, we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line, it breaks up into a collection of \"simple\" lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of \"simple\" lines, and so on \"ad infinitum\". This is a challenging situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly, then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to \"infinite\" probability amplitudes. In time this problem was \"fixed\" by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a \"dippy process\", and Dirac also criticized this procedure, saying \"in mathematics one does not get rid of infinities when it does not please you\".\nConclusions.\nWithin the above framework physicists were then able to calculate to a high degree of accuracy some of the properties of electrons, such as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment. However, as Feynman points out, it fails to explain why particles such as the electron have the masses they do. \"There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers. We use the numbers in all our theories, but we don't understand them \u2013 what they are, or where they come from. I believe that from a fundamental point of view, this is a very interesting and serious problem.\"\nMathematical formulation.\nQED action.\nMathematically, QED is an abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group U(1), defined on Minkowski space (flat spacetime). The gauge field, which mediates the interaction between the charged spin-1/2 fields, is the electromagnetic field.\nThe QED Lagrangian for a spin-1/2 field interacting with the electromagnetic field in natural units gives rise to the action\nQED Action\nformula_12\nwhere\nExpanding the covariant derivative reveals a second useful form of the Lagrangian (external field formula_19 set to zero for simplicity)\nformula_22\nwhere formula_23 is the conserved formula_18 current arising from Noether's theorem. It is written\nformula_25\nEquations of motion.\nExpanding the covariant derivative in the Lagrangian gives\nformula_26\nformula_27\nFor simplicity, formula_19 has been set to zero, with no loss of generality. Alternatively, we can absorb formula_19 into a new gauge field formula_30 and relabel the new field as formula_31\nFrom this Lagrangian, the equations of motion for the formula_14 and formula_17 fields can be obtained.\nEquation of motion for \u03c8.\nThese arise most straightforwardly by considering the Euler-Lagrange equation for formula_34. Since the Lagrangian contains no formula_35 terms, we immediately get\nformula_36\nso the equation of motion can be written\nformula_37\nEquation of motion for A\u03bc.\nthe derivatives this time are\nformula_39\nformula_40\nSubstituting back into (3) leads to\nformula_41\nwhich can be written in terms of the formula_18 current formula_23 as\nformula_44\nNow, if we impose the Lorenz gauge condition\nformula_45\nthe equations reduce to\nformula_46\nwhich is a wave equation for the four-potential, the QED version of the classical Maxwell equations in the Lorenz gauge. (The square represents the wave operator, formula_47.)\nInteraction picture.\nThis theory can be straightforwardly quantized by treating bosonic and fermionic sectors as free. This permits us to build a set of asymptotic states that can be used to start computation of the probability amplitudes for different processes. In order to do so, we have to compute an evolution operator, which for a given initial state formula_48 will give a final state formula_49 in such a way to have\nformula_50\nThis technique is also known as the S-matrix, and formula_51 is therefore known as the S-matrix element. The evolution operator is obtained in the interaction picture, where time evolution is given by the interaction Hamiltonian, which is the integral over space of the second term in the Lagrangian density given above:\nformula_52\nWhich can also be written in terms of an integral over the interaction Hamiltonian density formula_53. Thus, one has\nformula_54\nwhere \"T\" is the time-ordering operator. This evolution operator only has meaning as a series, and what we get here is a perturbation series with the fine-structure constant as the development parameter. This series expansion of the probability amplitude formula_51 is called the Dyson series, and is given by:\nformula_56\nAs formula_51 typically contains delta functions that are not physically-measurable, it is convenient to define the invariant amplitude formula_58 with:\nformula_59\nFeynman diagrams.\nDespite the conceptual clarity of the Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow him in their presentation. When performing calculations, it is much easier to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then \"look\" the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.\nUsing Wick's theorem on the terms of the Dyson series, all the terms of the S-matrix for quantum electrodynamics can be computed through the technique of Feynman diagrams. In this case, rules for drawing are the following\nTo these rules we must add a further one for closed loops that implies an integration on momenta formula_60, since these internal (\"virtual\") particles are not constrained to any specific energy\u2013momentum, even that usually required by special relativity (see Propagator for details). The signature of the metric formula_61 is formula_62.\nFrom them, computations of probability amplitudes are straightforwardly given. An example is Compton scattering, with an electron and a photon undergoing elastic scattering. Feynman diagrams are in this case\nand so we are able to get the corresponding amplitude at the first order of a perturbation series for the S-matrix:\nformula_63\nfrom which we can compute the cross section for this scattering.\nNonperturbative phenomena.\nThe predictive success of quantum electrodynamics largely rests on the use of perturbation theory, expressed in Feynman diagrams. However, quantum electrodynamics also leads to predictions beyond perturbation theory. In the presence of very strong electric fields, it predicts that electrons and positrons will be spontaneously produced, so causing the decay of the field. This process, called the Schwinger effect, cannot be understood in terms of any finite number of Feynman diagrams and hence is described as nonperturbative. Mathematically, it can be derived by a semiclassical approximation to the path integral of quantum electrodynamics.\nRenormalizability.\nHigher-order terms can be straightforwardly computed for the evolution operator, but these terms display diagrams containing the following simpler ones\nthat, being closed loops, imply the presence of diverging integrals having no mathematical meaning. To overcome this difficulty, a technique called renormalization has been devised, producing finite results in very close agreement with experiments. A criterion for the theory being meaningful after renormalization is that the number of diverging diagrams is finite. In this case, the theory is said to be \"renormalizable\". The reason for this is that to get observables renormalized, one needs a finite number of constants to maintain the predictive value of the theory untouched. This is exactly the case of quantum electrodynamics displaying just three diverging diagrams. This procedure gives observables in very close agreement with experiment as seen e.g. for electron gyromagnetic ratio.\nRenormalizability has become an essential criterion for a quantum field theory to be considered as a viable one. All the theories describing fundamental interactions, except gravitation, whose quantum counterpart is only conjectural and presently under very active research, are renormalizable theories.\nNonconvergence of series.\nAn argument by Freeman Dyson shows that the radius of convergence of the perturbation series in QED is zero. The basic argument goes as follows: if the coupling constant were negative, this would be equivalent to the Coulomb force constant being negative. This would \"reverse\" the electromagnetic interaction so that \"like\" charges would \"attract\" and \"unlike\" charges would \"repel\". This would render the vacuum unstable against decay into a cluster of electrons on one side of the universe and a cluster of positrons on the other side of the universe. Because the theory is \"sick\" for any negative value of the coupling constant, the series does not converge but is at best an asymptotic series.\nFrom a modern perspective, we say that QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to arbitrarily high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This is one of the motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.\nElectrodynamics in curved spacetime.\nThis theory can be extended, at least as a classical field theory, to curved spacetime. This arises similarly to the flat spacetime case, from coupling a free electromagnetic theory to a free fermion theory and including an interaction which promotes the partial derivative in the fermion theory to a gauge-covariant derivative.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are \"self-replicating programs\", \"self-reproducing programs\", and \"self-copying programs\".\nA quine is a fixed point of an execution environment, when that environment is viewed as a function transforming programs into their outputs. Quines are possible in any Turing-complete programming language, as a direct consequence of Kleene's recursion theorem. For amusement, programmers sometimes attempt to develop the shortest possible quine in any given programming language.\nName.\nThe name \"quine\" was coined by Douglas Hofstadter, in his popular 1979 science book \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\", in honor of philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine (1908\u20132000), who made an extensive study of indirect self-reference, and in particular for the following paradox-producing expression, known as Quine's paradox:\n\"Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation\" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.\nHistory.\nJohn von Neumann theorized about self-reproducing automata in the 1940s. Later, Paul Bratley and Jean Millo's article \"Computer Recreations: Self-Reproducing Automata\" discussed them in 1972.\nBratley first became interested in self-reproducing programs after seeing the first known such program written in Atlas Autocode at Edinburgh in the 1960s by the University of Edinburgh lecturer and researcher Hamish Dewar.\nThe \"download source\" requirement of the GNU Affero General Public License is based on the idea of a quine.\nExamples.\nShortest proper quine.\nThe shortest non-trivial quine in a major programming language (a \"proper\" quine) known as of 2020 is the 21 character JavaScript ES6 program codice_1.\nConstructive quines.\nIn general, the method used to create a quine in any programming language is to have, within the program, two pieces: code used to do the actual printing and data that represents the textual form of the code. The code functions by using the data to print the code (which makes sense since the data represents the textual form of the code), but it also uses the data, processed in a simple way, to print the textual representation of the data itself.\nHere are three small examples in Python3:\na: str = 'a: str = {}{}{}; print(a.format(chr(39), a, chr(39)))'; print(a.format(chr(39), a, chr(39)))\nb: str = 'b: str = %s%s%s; print(b %% (chr(39), b, chr(39)))'; print(b % (chr(39), b, chr(39)))\nc: str = 'c: str = %r; print(c %% c)'; print(c % c)\nThe following classic Java code (Java 1.5) demonstrates the basic structure of a quine.\npublic class Quine {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n char q = 34; // Quotation mark character\n String[] l = { // Array of source code\n \"public class Quine {\",\n \" public static void main(String[] args) {\",\n \" char q = 34; // Quotation mark character\",\n \" String[] l = { // Array of source code\",\n \" };\",\n \" for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) { // Print opening code\",\n \" System.out.println(l[i]);\",\n \" for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++) { // Print string array\",\n \" System.out.printf(\\\"%s%c%s%c,%n\\\", l[4], q, l[i], q);\",\n \" for (int i = 5; i &lt; l.length; i++) { // Print this code\",\n \" System.out.println(l[i]);\",\n \" }\",\n };\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) { // Print opening code\n System.out.println(l[i]);\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++) { // Print string array\n System.out.printf(\"%s%c%s%c,%n\", l[4], q, l[i], q);\n for (int i = 5; i &lt; l.length; i++) { // Print this code\n System.out.println(l[i]);\nThe source code contains a string array of itself, which is output twice, once inside quotation marks.\nThis code was adapted from an original post from c2.com, where the author, Jason Wilson, posted it as a minimalistic version of a Quine, without Java comments.\nFollowing the introduction of the text blocks feature in Java 15, a more readable and simpler version is possible:\npublic class Quine {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n String textBlockQuotes = new String(new char[]{'\"', '\"', '\"'});\n char newLine = 10;\n String source = \"\"\"\npublic class Quine {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n String textBlockQuotes = new String(new char[]{'\"', '\"', '\"'});\n char newLine = 10;\n String source = \"%s%s%s%s\";\n System.out.print(source.formatted(textBlockQuotes, newLine, source, textBlockQuotes));\n System.out.print(source.formatted(textBlockQuotes, newLine, source, textBlockQuotes));\nThis is an example of a modern version of Java 25 code:\nvoid main() {\n String s = \"\"\"\n void main() {\n String s = %c%c%c\n %s%c%c%c;\n IO.print(s.formatted(34, 34, 34, s, 34, 34, 34));\n IO.print(s.formatted(34, 34, 34, s, 34, 34, 34));\nThe code above can be executed by simply dropping its content in any file with the .java extension, such as \"App.java\", and then executed with \"java App.java\".\nThe same idea is used in the following SQL quine:\nSELECT REPLACE(REPLACE('SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(\"$\",CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),\"$\") AS Quine',CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),'SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(\"$\",CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),\"$\") AS Quine') AS Quine\nEval quines.\nSome programming languages have the ability to evaluate a string as a program. Quines can take advantage of this feature. For example, this Ruby quine:\neval s=\"print 'eval s=';p s\"\nLua can do:\ns=\"print(string.format('s=%c%s%c; load(s)()',34,s,34))\"; load(s)()\nIn Python 3.8:\nexec(s:='print(\"exec(s:=%r)\"%s)')\n\"Cheating\" quines.\nSelf-evaluation.\nIn many functional languages, including Scheme and other Lisps, and interactive languages such as APL, numbers are self-evaluating. In TI-BASIC, if the last line of a program returns a value, the returned value is displayed on the screen. Therefore, in such languages a program consisting of only a single digit results in a 1-byte quine. Since such code does not \"construct\" itself, this is often considered cheating.\n1\nEmpty quines.\nIn some languages, particularly scripting languages, an empty source file is a fixed point of the language, being a valid program that produces no output. \nSuch an empty program, submitted as \"the world's smallest self reproducing program\", once won the \"worst abuse of the rules\" prize in the International Obfuscated C Code Contest. The program was not valid C (lacking a codice_2 function) and was not actually compiled, but came with a codice_3 which used codice_4 to copy the empty file into another file, which would be executed \"as a shell script\" to print nothing.\nSource code inspection.\nQuines, per definition, cannot receive \"any\" form of input, including reading a file, which means a quine is considered to be \"cheating\" if it looks at its own source code. The following shell script is not a quine:\ncat $0\nA shorter variant, exploiting the behaviour of shebang directives:\nOther questionable techniques include making use of compiler messages; for example, in the GW-BASIC environment, entering \"Syntax Error\" will cause the interpreter to respond with \"Syntax Error\".\nQuine code can also be outputted visually, for example it's used to visualize the neutral zone in Yars' Revenge, along with syntactic saccharin, to obfuscate the source code.\nOuroboros programs.\nThe quine concept can be extended to multiple levels of recursion, giving rise to \"ouroboros programs\", or quine-relays. This should not be confused with multiquines.\nExample.\nThis Java program outputs the source for a C++ program that outputs the original Java code.\nimport std;\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n char q = 34;\n std::array&lt;std::string, 36&gt; l = {\n \"=============\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab C++ Code \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb=============\",\n \"import std;\"\n \"int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\",\n \" char q = 34;\",\n \" std::array&lt;std::string&gt; l = {\",\n \" for (int i = 19; i &lt;= l.size(); ++i) {\",\n \" std::println(\\\"{}\\\", l[i]);\",\n \" for (int i = 0; i &lt;= l.size(); ++i)\",\n \" std::println(\\\"{}{}{}{},\\\", l[0], q, l[i], q);\",\n \" for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 17; ++i)\",\n \" std::println(\\\"{}\\\", l[i]);\",\n \" return 0;\",\n \"=============\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab Java Code \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb=============\",\n \"public class Quine {\",\n \" public static void main(String[] args) {\",\n \" char q = 34;\",\n \" String[] l = {\",\n \" for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 17; ++i)\",\n \" System.out.println(l[i]);\",\n \" for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; ++i) {\",\n \" System.out.printf(\\\"%s%c%s%c,%n\\\", l[0], q, l[i], q);\",\n \" for (int i = 18; i &lt;= l.length; ++i) {\",\n \" System.out.println(l[i]);\",\n \" }\",\n };\n for (int i = 19; i &lt;= l.size(); ++i)\n std::println(\"{}\", l[i]);;\n for (int i = 0; i &lt;= l.size(); ++i)\n std::println(\"{}{}{}{},\", l[0], q, l[i], q);\n for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 17; ++i)\n std::println(\"{}\", l[i]);;\n return 0;\npublic class Quine {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n char q = 34;\n String[] l = {\n \"=============\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab C++ Code \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb=============\",\n \"import std;\",\n \"int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\",\n \" char q = 34;\",\n \" std::array&lt;std::string&gt; l = {\",\n \" for (int i = 19; i &lt;= l.size(); ++i) {\",\n \" std::println(\\\"{}\\\", l[i]);\",\n \" for (int i = 0; i &lt;= l.size(); ++i) {\",\n \" std::println(\\\"{}{}{}{},\\\", l[0], q, l[i], q);\",\n \" for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 17; ++i) {\",\n \" std::println(\\\"{}\\\", l[i]);\",\n \" return 0;\",\n \"=============\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab Java Code \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb=============\",\n \"public class Quine {\",\n \" public static void main(String[] args) {\",\n \" char q = 34;\",\n \" String[] l = {\",\n \" for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 17; ++i)\",\n \" System.out.println(l[i]);\",\n \" for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; ++i)\",\n \" System.out.printf(\\\"%s%c%s%c,%n\\\", l[0], q, l[i], q);\",\n \" for (int i = 18; i &lt;= l.length; ++i) {\",\n \" System.out.println(l[i]);\",\n \" }\",\n };\n for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 17; ++i) {\n System.out.println(l[i]);\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; ++i) {\n System.out.printf(\"%s%c%s%c,%n\", l[0], q, l[i], q);\n for (int i = 18; i &lt;= l.length; ++i) {\n System.out.println(l[i]);\nSuch programs have been produced with various cycle lengths:\nMultiquines.\nDavid Madore, creator of Unlambda, describes multiquines as follows:\n\"A multiquine is a set of r different programs (in r different languages \u2013 without this condition we could take them all equal to a single quine), each of which is able to print any of the r programs (including itself) according to the command line argument it is passed. (Cheating is not allowed: the command line arguments must not be too long \u2013 passing the full text of a program is considered cheating).\"\nA multiquine consisting of 2 languages (or biquine) would be a program which:\nA biquine could then be seen as a set of two programs, both of which are able to print either of the two, depending on the command line argument supplied.\nTheoretically, there is no limit on the number of languages in a multiquine.\nA 5-part multiquine (or pentaquine) has been produced with Python, Perl, C, NewLISP, and F#\nand there is also a 25-language multiquine.\nPolyglot.\nSimilar to, but unlike a multiquine, a polyglot program is a computer program or script written in a valid form of multiple programming languages or file formats by combining their syntax. A polyglot program is not required to have a self-reproducing quality, although a polyglot program can also be a quine in one or more of its possible ways to execute.\nUnlike quines and multiquines, polyglot programs are not guaranteed to exist between arbitrary sets of languages as a result of Kleene's recursion theorem, because they rely on the interplay between the syntaxes, and not a provable property that one can always be embedded within another.\nRadiation-hardened.\nA radiation-hardened quine is a quine that can have any single character removed and still produces the original program with no missing character. Of necessity, such quines are much more convoluted than ordinary quines, as is seen by the following example in Ruby:\neval='eval$q=%q(puts %q(10210/#{1 1 if 1==21}}/.i rescue##/\n1 1\"[13,213].max_by{|s|s.size}#\"##\").gsub(/\\d/){[\"=\\47eval$q=%q(#$q)#\\47##\\47\nexit)#'##'\ninstance_eval='eval$q=%q(puts %q(10210/#{1 1 if 1==21}}/.i rescue##/\n1 1\"[13,213].max_by{|s|s.size}#\"##\").gsub(/\\d/){[\"=\\47eval$q=%q(#$q)#\\47##\\47\nexit)#'##'\n/#{eval eval if eval==instance_eval}}/.i rescue##/\neval eval\"[eval||=9,instance_eval||=9].max_by{|s|s.size}#\"##\"\nAutomatic generation.\nUsing relational programming techniques, it is possible to generate quines automatically by transforming the interpreter (or equivalently, the compiler and runtime) of a language into a relational program, and then solving for a fixed point.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "25271", "revid": "50131331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25271", "title": "Field of fractions", "text": "Abstract algebra concept\nIn abstract algebra, the field of fractions of an integral domain is the smallest field in which it can be embedded. The construction of the field of fractions is modeled on the relationship between the integral domain of integers and the field of rational numbers. Intuitively, it consists of ratios between integral domain elements.\nThe field of fractions of an integral domain formula_1 is sometimes denoted by formula_2 or formula_3, and the construction is sometimes also called the fraction field, field of quotients, or quotient field of formula_1. All four are in common usage, but are not to be confused with the quotient of a ring by an ideal, which is a quite different concept. For a commutative ring that is not an integral domain, the analogous construction is called the localization or ring of quotients.\nDefinition.\nGiven an integral domain formula_1 and letting formula_6, we define an equivalence relation on formula_7 by letting formula_8 whenever formula_9. We denote the equivalence class of formula_10 by formula_11. This notion of equivalence is motivated by the rational numbers formula_12, which have the same property with respect to the underlying ring formula_13 of integers.\nThen the field of fractions is the set formula_14 with addition given by\nformula_15 \nand multiplication given by \nformula_16\nOne may check that these operations are well-defined and that, for any integral domain formula_1, formula_18 is indeed a field. In particular, for formula_19, the multiplicative inverse of formula_11 is as expected: formula_21.\nThe embedding of formula_1 in formula_2 maps each formula_24 in formula_1 to the fraction formula_26 for any nonzero formula_27 (the equivalence class is independent of the choice formula_28). This is modeled on the identity formula_29.\nThe field of fractions of formula_1 is characterized by the following universal property:\nif formula_31 is an injective ring homomorphism from formula_1 into a field formula_33, then there exists a unique ring homomorphism formula_34 that extends formula_35.\nThere is a categorical interpretation of this construction. Let formula_36 be the category of integral domains and injective ring maps. The functor from formula_36 to the category of fields that takes every integral domain to its fraction field and every homomorphism to the induced map on fields (which exists by the universal property) is the left adjoint of the inclusion functor from the category of fields to formula_36. Thus the category of fields (which is a full subcategory) is a reflective subcategory of formula_36.\nA multiplicative identity is not required for the role of the integral domain; this construction can be applied to any nonzero commutative rng formula_1 with no nonzero zero divisors. The embedding is given by formula_41 for any nonzero formula_42.\nGeneralizations.\nLocalization.\nFor any commutative ring formula_1 and any multiplicative set formula_50 in formula_1, the localization formula_52 is the commutative ring consisting of fractions\nformula_53\nwith formula_54 and formula_55, where now formula_56 is equivalent to formula_57 if and only if there exists formula_58 such that formula_59.\nTwo special cases of this are notable:\nNote that it is permitted for formula_50 to contain 0, but in that case formula_52 will be the trivial ring.\nSemifield of fractions.\nThe semifield of fractions of a commutative semiring in which every nonzero element is (multiplicatively) cancellative is the smallest semifield in which it can be embedded. (Note that, unlike the case of rings, a semiring with no zero divisors can still have nonzero elements that are not cancellative. For example, let formula_73 denote the tropical semiring and let formula_74 be the polynomial semiring over formula_73. Then formula_1 has no zero divisors, but the element formula_77 is not cancellative because formula_78).\nThe elements of the semifield of fractions of the commutative semiring formula_1 are equivalence classes written as\nformula_80\nwith formula_81 and formula_82 in formula_1 and formula_84.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Due to its subtlety, it has many formulations, but the most standard statement is: \n.&lt;/math&gt;\nThis law, together with its supplements, allows the easy calculation of any Legendre symbol, making it possible to determine whether there is an integer solution for any quadratic equation of the form formula_1 for an odd prime formula_2; that is, to determine the \"perfect squares\" modulo formula_2. However, this is a non-constructive result: it gives no help at all for finding a \"specific\" solution; for this, other methods are required. For example, in the case formula_4 using Euler's criterion one can give an explicit formula for the \"square roots\" modulo formula_2 of a quadratic residue formula_6, namely,\nformula_7\nindeed,\nformula_8\nThis formula only works if it is known in advance that formula_6 is a quadratic residue, which can be checked using the law of quadratic reciprocity.\nThe quadratic reciprocity theorem was conjectured by Leonhard Euler and Adrien-Marie Legendre and first proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss, who referred to it as the \"fundamental theorem\" in his \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" and his papers, writing\n\"The fundamental theorem must certainly be regarded as one of the most elegant of its type.\" (Art. 151)\nPrivately, Gauss referred to it as the \"golden theorem\". He published six proofs for it, and two more were found in his posthumous papers. There are now over 240 published proofs. The shortest known proof is included below, together with short proofs of the law's supplements (the Legendre symbols of \u22121 and 2).\nGeneralizing the reciprocity law to higher powers has been a leading problem in mathematics, and has been crucial to the development of much of the machinery of modern algebra, number theory, and algebraic geometry, culminating in Artin reciprocity, class field theory, and the Langlands program.\nMotivating examples.\nQuadratic reciprocity arises from certain subtle factorization patterns involving perfect square numbers. In this section, we give examples which lead to the general case.\nFactoring \u00a0\"n\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.\nConsider the polynomial formula_10 and its values for formula_11 The prime factorizations of these values are given as follows:\nThe prime factors formula_2 dividing formula_13 are formula_14, and every prime whose final digit is formula_15 or formula_16; no primes ending in formula_17 or formula_18 ever appear. Now, formula_2 is a prime factor of some formula_20 whenever formula_21, i.e. whenever formula_22 i.e. whenever 5 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2. This happens for formula_24 and those primes with formula_25 and the latter numbers formula_26 and formula_27 are precisely the quadratic residues modulo formula_28. Therefore, except for formula_29, we have that formula_28 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2 iff formula_2 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_28.\nThe law of quadratic reciprocity gives a similar characterization of prime divisors of formula_34 for any prime \"q\", which leads to a characterization for any integer formula_35.\nPatterns among quadratic residues.\nLet \"p\" be an odd prime. A number modulo \"p\" is a quadratic residue whenever it is congruent to a square (mod \"p\"); otherwise it is a quadratic non-residue. (\"Quadratic\" can be dropped if it is clear from the context.) Here we exclude zero as a special case. Then as a consequence of the fact that the multiplicative group of a finite field of order \"p\" is cyclic of order \"p-1\", the following statements hold:\nFor the avoidance of doubt, these statements do \"not\" hold if the modulus is not prime. \nFor example, there are only 3 quadratic residues (1, 4 and 9) in the multiplicative group modulo 15. \nMoreover, although 7 and 8 are quadratic non-residues, their product 7x8 = 11 is also a quadratic non-residue, in contrast to the prime case.\nQuadratic residues appear as entries in the following table, indexed by the row number as modulus and column number as root:\nThis table is complete for odd primes less than 50. To check whether a number \"m\" is a quadratic residue mod one of these primes \"p\", find \"a\" \u2261 \"m\" (mod \"p\") and 0 \u2264 \"a\" &lt; \"p\". If \"a\" is in row \"p\", then \"m\" is a residue (mod \"p\"); if \"a\" is not in row \"p\" of the table, then \"m\" is a nonresidue (mod \"p\").\nThe quadratic reciprocity law is the statement that certain patterns found in the table are true in general.\nLegendre's version.\nAnother way to organize the data is to see which primes are quadratic residues mod which other primes, as illustrated in the following table. The entry in row \"p\" column \"q\" is R if \"q\" is a quadratic residue (mod \"p\"); if it is a nonresidue the entry is N.\nIf the row, or the column, or both, are \u2261 1 (mod 4) the entry is blue or green; if both row and column are \u2261 3 (mod 4), it is yellow or orange.\nThe blue and green entries are symmetric around the diagonal: The entry for row \"p\", column \"q\" is R (resp N) if and only if the entry at row \"q\", column \"p\", is R (resp N).\nThe yellow and orange ones, on the other hand, are antisymmetric: The entry for row \"p\", column \"q\" is R (resp N) if and only if the entry at row \"q\", column \"p\", is N (resp R).\nThe reciprocity law states that these patterns hold for all \"p\" and \"q\".\nOrdering the rows and columns mod 4 makes the pattern clearer.\nSupplements to quadratic reciprocity.\nThe supplements provide solutions to specific cases of quadratic reciprocity. They are often quoted as partial results, without having to resort to the complete theorem.\n\"q\" = \u00b11 and the first supplement.\nTrivially 1 is a quadratic residue for all primes. The question becomes more interesting for \u22121. Examining the table, we find \u22121 in rows 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43 or 47. The former set of primes are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and the latter are congruent to 3 modulo 4.\nFirst Supplement to Quadratic Reciprocity. The congruence formula_36 is solvable if and only if formula_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 4.\n\"q\" = \u00b12 and the second supplement.\nExamining the table, we find 2 in rows 7, 17, 23, 31, 41, and 47, but not in rows 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, 37, or 43. The former primes are all \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 8), and the latter are all \u2261 \u00b13 (mod 8). This leads to\nSecond Supplement to Quadratic Reciprocity. The congruence formula_38 is solvable if and only if formula_2 is congruent to \u00b11 modulo 8.\n\u22122 is in rows 3, 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, but not in rows 5, 7, 13, 23, 29, 31, 37, or 47. The former are \u2261 1 or \u2261 3 (mod 8), and the latter are \u2261 5, 7 (mod 8).\n\"q\" = \u00b13.\n3 is in rows 11, 13, 23, 37, and 47, but not in rows 5, 7, 17, 19, 29, 31, 41, or 43. The former are \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 12) and the latter are all \u2261 \u00b15 (mod 12).\n\u22123 is in rows 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, and 43 but not in rows 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, or 47. The former are \u2261 1 (mod 3) and the latter \u2261 2 (mod 3).\nSince the only residue (mod 3) is 1, we see that \u22123 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 3.\n\"q\" = \u00b15.\n5 is in rows 11, 19, 29, 31, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, or 47. The former are \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 5) and the latter are \u2261 \u00b12 (mod 5).\nSince the only residues (mod 5) are \u00b11, we see that 5 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 5.\n\u22125 is in rows 3, 7, 23, 29, 41, 43, and 47 but not in rows 11, 13, 17, 19, 31, or 37. The former are \u2261 1, 3, 7, 9 (mod 20) and the latter are \u2261 11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20).\nHigher \"q\".\nThe observations about \u22123 and 5 continue to hold: \u22127 is a residue modulo \"p\" if and only if \"p\" is a residue modulo 7, \u221211 is a residue modulo \"p\" if and only if \"p\" is a residue modulo 11, 13 is a residue (mod \"p\") if and only if \"p\" is a residue modulo 13, etc. The more complicated-looking rules for the quadratic characters of 3 and \u22125, which depend upon congruences modulo 12 and 20 respectively, are simply the ones for \u22123 and 5 working with the first supplement.\nExample. For \u22125 to be a residue (mod \"p\"), either both 5 and \u22121 have to be residues (mod \"p\") or they both have to be non-residues: i.e., \"p\" \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 5) \"and\" \"p\" \u2261 1 (mod 4) or \"p\" \u2261 \u00b12 (mod 5) \"and\" \"p\" \u2261 3 (mod 4). Using the Chinese remainder theorem these are equivalent to \"p\" \u2261 1, 9 (mod 20) or \"p\" \u2261 3, 7 (mod 20).\nThe generalization of the rules for \u22123 and 5 is Gauss's statement of quadratic reciprocity.\nStatement of the theorem.\nQuadratic Reciprocity (Gauss's statement). If formula_40, then the congruence formula_41 is solvable if and only if formula_42 is solvable. If formula_43 and formula_44, then the congruence formula_41 is solvable if and only if formula_46 is solvable.\nQuadratic Reciprocity (combined statement). Define formula_47. Then the congruence formula_41 is solvable if and only if formula_49 is solvable.\nQuadratic Reciprocity (Legendre's statement). If \"p\" or \"q\" are congruent to 1 modulo 4, then: formula_42 is solvable if and only if formula_41 is solvable. If \"p\" and \"q\" are congruent to 3 modulo 4, then: formula_42 is solvable if and only if formula_41 is not solvable.\nThe last is immediately equivalent to the modern form stated in the introduction above. It is a simple exercise to prove that Legendre's and Gauss's statements are equivalent \u2013 it requires no more than the first supplement and the facts about multiplying residues and nonresidues.\nProof.\nApparently, the shortest known proof yet was published by B. Veklych in the \"American Mathematical Monthly\".\nProofs of the supplements.\nThe value of the Legendre symbol of formula_54 (used in the proof above) follows directly from Euler's criterion:\nformula_55\nby Euler's criterion, but both sides of this congruence are numbers of the form formula_56, so they must be equal.\nWhether formula_57 is a quadratic residue can be concluded if we know the number of solutions of the equation formula_58 with formula_59 which can be solved by standard methods. Namely, all its solutions where formula_60 can be grouped into octuplets of the form formula_61, and what is left are four solutions of the form formula_62 and possibly four additional solutions where formula_63 and formula_64, which exist precisely if formula_57 is a quadratic residue. That is, formula_57 is a quadratic residue precisely if the number of solutions of this equation is divisible by formula_67. And this equation can be solved in just the same way here as over the rational numbers: substitute formula_68, where we demand that formula_69 (leaving out the two solutions formula_70), then the original equation transforms into\nformula_71\nHere formula_72 can have any value that does not make the denominator zero \u2013 for which there are formula_73 possibilities (i.e. formula_57 if formula_54 is a residue, formula_76 if not) \u2013 and also does not make formula_6 zero, which excludes one more option, formula_78. Thus there are\nformula_79\npossibilities for formula_72, and so together with the two excluded solutions there are overall formula_81 solutions of the original equation. Therefore, formula_57 is a residue modulo formula_2 if and only if formula_67 divides formula_85. This is a reformulation of the condition stated above.\nHistory and alternative statements.\nThe theorem was formulated in many ways before its modern form: Euler and Legendre did not have Gauss's congruence notation, nor did Gauss have the Legendre symbol.\nIn this article \"p\" and \"q\" always refer to distinct positive odd primes, and \"x\" and \"y\" to unspecified integers.\nFermat.\nFermat proved (or claimed to have proved) a number of theorems about expressing a prime by a quadratic form:\nformula_86\nHe did not state the law of quadratic reciprocity, although the cases \u22121, \u00b12, and \u00b13 are easy deductions from these and others of his theorems.\nHe also claimed to have a proof that if the prime number \"p\" ends with 7, (in base 10) and the prime number \"q\" ends in 3, and \"p\" \u2261 \"q\" \u2261 3 (mod 4), then\nformula_87\nEuler conjectured, and Lagrange proved, that\nformula_88\nProving these and other statements of Fermat was one of the things that led mathematicians to the reciprocity theorem.\nEuler.\nTranslated into modern notation, Euler stated that for distinct odd primes \"p\" and \"q\":\nThis is equivalent to quadratic reciprocity.\nHe could not prove it, but he did prove the second supplement.\nLegendre and his symbol.\nFermat proved that if \"p\" is a prime number and \"a\" is an integer, \nformula_89\nThus if \"p\" does not divide \"a\", using the non-obvious fact (see for example Ireland and Rosen below) that the residues modulo \"p\" form a field and therefore in particular the multiplicative group is cyclic, hence there can be at most two solutions to a quadratic equation:\nformula_90\nLegendre lets \"a\" and \"A\" represent positive primes \u2261 1 (mod 4) and \"b\" and \"B\" positive primes \u2261 3 (mod 4), and sets out a table of eight theorems that together are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity:\nHe says that since expressions of the form\nformula_91\nwill come up so often he will abbreviate them as:\nformula_92\nThis is now known as the Legendre symbol, and an equivalent definition is used today: for all integers \"a\" and all odd primes \"p\"\nformula_93\nformula_94\nLegendre's version of quadratic reciprocity.\nHe notes that these can be combined:\nformula_95\nA number of proofs, especially those based on Gauss's Lemma, explicitly calculate this formula.\nformula_96\nThe supplementary laws using Legendre symbols.\nFrom these two supplements, we can obtain a third reciprocity law for the quadratic character -2 as follows:\nFor -2 to be a quadratic residue, either -1 or 2 are both quadratic residues, or both non-residues :formula_97.\nSo either :formula_98 are both even, or they are both odd. The sum of these two expressions is\nformula_99 which is an integer. Therefore,\nformula_100\nLegendre's attempt to prove reciprocity is based on a theorem of his:\nLegendre's Theorem. Let \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" be integers where any pair of the three are relatively prime. Moreover assume that at least one of \"ab\", \"bc\" or \"ca\" is negative (i.e. they don't all have the same sign). If \nformula_101\nare solvable then the following equation has a nontrivial solution in integers:\nformula_102\nExample. Theorem I is handled by letting \"a\" \u2261 1 and \"b\" \u2261 3 (mod 4) be primes and assuming that formula_103 and, contrary the theorem, that formula_104 Then formula_105 has a solution, and taking congruences (mod 4) leads to a contradiction.\nThis technique doesn't work for Theorem VIII. Let \"b\" \u2261 \"B\" \u2261 3 (mod 4), and assume\nformula_106\nThen if there is another prime \"p\" \u2261 1 (mod 4) such that\nformula_107\nthe solvability of formula_108 leads to a contradiction (mod 4). But Legendre was unable to prove there has to be such a prime \"p\"; he was later able to show that all that is required is:\nLegendre's Lemma. If \"p\" is a prime that is congruent to 1 modulo 4 then there exists an odd prime \"q\" such that formula_109\nbut he couldn't prove that either. Hilbert symbol (below) discusses how techniques based on the existence of solutions to formula_110 can be made to work.\nGauss.\nGauss first proves the supplementary laws. He sets the basis for induction by proving the theorem for \u00b13 and \u00b15. Noting that it is easier to state for \u22123 and +5 than it is for +3 or \u22125, he states the general theorem in the form:\nIf \"p\" is a prime of the form 4\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 then \"p\", but if \"p\" is of the form 4\"n\" + 3 then \u2212\"p\", is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) of every prime, which, with a positive sign, is a residue (resp. nonresidue) of \"p\". In the next sentence, he christens it the \"fundamental theorem\" (Gauss never used the word \"reciprocity\").\nIntroducing the notation \"a\" R \"b\" (resp. \"a\" N \"b\") to mean \"a\" is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) (mod \"b\"), and letting \"a\", \"a\"\u2032, etc. represent positive primes \u2261 1 (mod 4) and \"b\", \"b\"\u2032, etc. positive primes \u2261 3 (mod 4), he breaks it out into the same 8 cases as Legendre:\nIn the next Article he generalizes this to what are basically the rules for the Jacobi symbol (below). Letting \"A\", \"A\"\u2032, etc. represent any (prime or composite) positive numbers \u2261 1 (mod 4) and \"B\", \"B\"\u2032, etc. positive numbers \u2261 3 (mod 4):\nAll of these cases take the form \"if a prime is a residue (mod a composite), then the composite is a residue or nonresidue (mod the prime), depending on the congruences (mod 4)\". He proves that these follow from cases 1) - 8).\nGauss needed, and was able to prove, a lemma similar to the one Legendre needed:\nGauss's Lemma. If \"p\" is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 8 then there exists an odd prime \"q\" such that:\nformula_111\nThe proof of quadratic reciprocity uses complete induction.\nGauss's Version in Legendre Symbols. \nformula_112\nThese can be combined:\nGauss's Combined Version in Legendre Symbols. Let\nformula_113\nIn other words:\nformula_114\nThen:\nformula_115\nA number of proofs of the theorem, especially those based on Gauss sums or the splitting of primes in algebraic number fields, derive this formula.\nOther statements.\nThe statements in this section are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity: if, for example, Euler's version is assumed, the Legendre-Gauss version can be deduced from it, and vice versa.\nEuler's Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity. If formula_116 then formula_117\nThis can be proven using Gauss's lemma.\nQuadratic Reciprocity (Gauss; Fourth Proof). Let \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", ... be unequal positive odd primes, whose product is \"n\", and let \"m\" be the number of them that are \u2261 3 (mod 4); check whether \"n\"/\"a\" is a residue of \"a\", whether \"n\"/\"b\" is a residue of \"b\", ... The number of nonresidues found will be even when \"m\" \u2261 0, 1 (mod 4), and it will be odd if \"m\" \u2261 2, 3 (mod 4).\nGauss's fourth proof consists of proving this theorem (by comparing two formulas for the value of Gauss sums) and then restricting it to two primes. He then gives an example: Let \"a\" = 3, \"b\" = 5, \"c\" = 7, and \"d\" = 11. Three of these, 3, 7, and 11 \u2261 3 (mod 4), so \"m\" \u2261 3 (mod 4). 5\u00d77\u00d711\u00a0R\u00a03;\u00a03\u00d77\u00d711\u00a0R\u00a05;\u00a03\u00d75\u00d711\u00a0R\u00a07;\u00a0 and\u00a0 3\u00d75\u00d77\u00a0N\u00a011, so there are an odd number of nonresidues.\nEisenstein's Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity. Assume\nformula_118\nThen\nformula_119\nMordell's Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity. Let \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" be integers. For every prime, \"p\", dividing \"abc\" if the congruence \nformula_120\nhas a nontrivial solution, then so does:\nformula_121\nZeta function formulation\nAs mentioned in the article on Dedekind zeta functions, quadratic reciprocity is equivalent to the zeta function of a quadratic field being the product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet L-function\nJacobi symbol.\nThe Jacobi symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol; the main difference is that the bottom number has to be positive and odd, but does not have to be prime. If it is prime, the two symbols agree. It obeys the same rules of manipulation as the Legendre symbol. In particular\nformula_122\nand if both numbers are positive and odd (this is sometimes called \"Jacobi's reciprocity law\"):\nformula_123\nHowever, if the Jacobi symbol is 1 but the denominator is not a prime, it does not necessarily follow that the numerator is a quadratic residue of the denominator. Gauss's cases 9) - 14) above can be expressed in terms of Jacobi symbols:\nformula_124\nand since \"p\" is prime the left hand side is a Legendre symbol, and we know whether \"M\" is a residue modulo \"p\" or not.\nThe formulas listed in the preceding section are true for Jacobi symbols as long as the symbols are defined. Euler's formula may be written\nformula_125\nExample.\nformula_126\n2 is a residue modulo the primes 7, 23 and 31:\nformula_127\nBut 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 5, so it can't be one modulo 15. This is related to the problem Legendre had: if formula_128 then \"a\" is a non-residue modulo every prime in the arithmetic progression \"m\" + 4\"a\", \"m\" + 8\"a\", ..., if there \"are\" any primes in this series, but that wasn't proved until decades after Legendre.\nEisenstein's formula requires relative primality conditions (which are true if the numbers are prime)\nLet formula_129 be positive odd integers such that:\nformula_130\nThen\nformula_131\nHilbert symbol.\nThe quadratic reciprocity law can be formulated in terms of the Hilbert symbol formula_132 where \"a\" and \"b\" are any two nonzero rational numbers and \"v\" runs over all the non-trivial absolute values of the rationals (the Archimedean one and the \"p\"-adic absolute values for primes \"p\"). The Hilbert symbol formula_132 is 1 or \u22121. It is defined to be 1 if and only if the equation formula_134 has a solution in the completion of the rationals at \"v\" other than formula_135. The Hilbert reciprocity law states that formula_132, for fixed \"a\" and \"b\" and varying \"v\", is 1 for all but finitely many \"v\" and the product of formula_132 over all \"v\" is 1. (This formally resembles the residue theorem from complex analysis.)\nThe proof of Hilbert reciprocity reduces to checking a few special cases, and the non-trivial cases turn out to be equivalent to the main law and the two supplementary laws of quadratic reciprocity for the Legendre symbol. There is no kind of reciprocity in the Hilbert reciprocity law; its name simply indicates the historical source of the result in quadratic reciprocity. Unlike quadratic reciprocity, which requires sign conditions (namely positivity of the primes involved) and a special treatment of the prime 2, the Hilbert reciprocity law treats all absolute values of the rationals on an equal footing. Therefore, it is a more natural way of expressing quadratic reciprocity with a view towards generalization: the Hilbert reciprocity law extends with very few changes to all global fields and this extension can rightly be considered a generalization of quadratic reciprocity to all global fields.\nConnection with cyclotomic fields.\nThe early proofs of quadratic reciprocity are relatively unilluminating. The situation changed when Gauss used Gauss sums to show that quadratic fields are subfields of cyclotomic fields, and implicitly deduced quadratic reciprocity from a reciprocity theorem for cyclotomic fields. His proof was cast in modern form by later algebraic number theorists. This proof served as a template for class field theory, which can be viewed as a vast generalization of quadratic reciprocity.\nRobert Langlands formulated the Langlands program, which gives a conjectural vast generalization of class field theory. He wrote:\n\"I confess that, as a student unaware of the history of the subject and unaware of the connection with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.\"\nOther rings.\nThere are also quadratic reciprocity laws in rings other than the integers.\nGaussian integers.\nIn his second monograph on quartic reciprocity Gauss stated quadratic reciprocity for the ring formula_138 of Gaussian integers, saying that it is a corollary of the biquadratic law in formula_139 but did not provide a proof of either theorem. Dirichlet showed that the law in formula_138 can be deduced from the law for formula_141 without using quartic reciprocity.\nFor an odd Gaussian prime formula_142 and a Gaussian integer formula_143 relatively prime to formula_144 define the quadratic character for formula_138 by:\nformula_146\nLet formula_147 be distinct Gaussian primes where \"a\" and \"c\" are odd and \"b\" and \"d\" are even. Then\nformula_148\nEisenstein integers.\nConsider the following third root of unity:\nformula_149\nThe ring of Eisenstein integers is formula_150 For an Eisenstein prime formula_151 and an Eisenstein integer formula_143 with formula_153 define the quadratic character for formula_154 by the formula\nformula_155\nLet \u03bb = \"a\" + \"b\u03c9\" and \u03bc = \"c\" + \"d\u03c9\" be distinct Eisenstein primes where \"a\" and \"c\" are not divisible by 3 and \"b\" and \"d\" are divisible by 3. Eisenstein proved\nformula_156\nImaginary quadratic fields.\nThe above laws are special cases of more general laws that hold for the ring of integers in any imaginary quadratic number field. Let \"k\" be an imaginary quadratic number field with ring of integers formula_157 For a prime ideal formula_158 with odd norm formula_159 and formula_160 define the quadratic character for formula_161 as\nformula_162\nfor an arbitrary ideal formula_163 factored into prime ideals formula_164 define\nformula_165\nand for formula_166 define\nformula_167\nLet formula_168 i.e. formula_169 is an integral basis for formula_157 For formula_171 with odd norm formula_172 define (ordinary) integers \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" by the equations,\nformula_173\nand a function\nformula_174\nIf \"m\" = \"N\u03bc\" and \"n\" = \"N\u03bd\" are both odd, Herglotz proved\nformula_175\nAlso, if\nformula_176\nThen\nformula_177\nPolynomials over a finite field.\nLet \"F\" be a finite field with \"q\" = \"pn\" elements, where \"p\" is an odd prime number and \"n\" is positive, and let \"F\"[\"x\"] be the ring of polynomials in one variable with coefficients in \"F\". If formula_178 and \"f\" is irreducible, monic, and has positive degree, define the quadratic character for \"F\"[\"x\"] in the usual manner:\nformula_179\nIf formula_180 is a product of monic irreducibles let\nformula_181\nDedekind proved that if formula_178 are monic and have positive degrees,\nformula_183\nHigher powers.\nThe attempt to generalize quadratic reciprocity for powers higher than the second was one of the main goals that led 19th century mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi, Gotthold Eisenstein, Richard Dedekind, Ernst Kummer, and David Hilbert to the study of general algebraic number fields and their rings of integers; specifically Kummer invented ideals in order to state and prove higher reciprocity laws.\nThe ninth in the list of 23 unsolved problems which David Hilbert proposed to the Congress of Mathematicians in 1900 asked for the \n\"Proof of the most general reciprocity law [f]or an arbitrary number field\". Building upon work by Philipp Furtw\u00e4ngler, Teiji Takagi, Helmut Hasse and others, Emil Artin discovered Artin reciprocity in 1923, a general theorem for which all known reciprocity laws are special cases, and proved it in 1927.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nThe \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" has been translated (from Latin) into English and German.

It is the basic entity of study in quantum information science, and can be manipulated using quantum information processing techniques. Quantum information refers to both the technical definition in terms of Von Neumann entropy and the general computational term.\nIt is an interdisciplinary field that involves quantum mechanics, computer science, information theory, philosophy and cryptography among other fields. Its study is also relevant to disciplines such as cognitive science, psychology and neuroscience. Its main focus is in extracting information from matter at the microscopic scale. Observation in science is one of the most important ways of acquiring information and measurement is required in order to quantify the observation, making this crucial to the scientific method. In quantum mechanics, due to the uncertainty principle, non-commuting observables cannot be precisely measured simultaneously, as an eigenstate in one basis is not an eigenstate in the other basis. According to the eigenstate\u2013eigenvalue link, an observable is well-defined (definite) when the state of the system is an eigenstate of the observable. Since any two non-commuting observables are not simultaneously well-defined, a quantum state can never contain definitive information about both non-commuting observables.\nData can be encoded into the quantum state of a quantum system as quantum information. While quantum mechanics deals with examining properties of matter at the microscopic level, quantum information science focuses on extracting information from those properties, and quantum computation manipulates and processes information \u2013 performs logical operations \u2013 using quantum information processing techniques.\nQuantum information, like classical information, can be processed using digital computers, transmitted from one location to another, manipulated with algorithms, and analyzed with computer science and mathematics. Just like the basic unit of classical information is the bit, quantum information deals with qubits. Quantum information can be measured using Von Neumann entropy.\nRecently, the field of quantum computing has become an active research area because of the possibility to disrupt modern computation, communication, and cryptography.\nHistory and development.\nDevelopment from fundamental quantum mechanics.\nThe history of quantum information theory began at the turn of the 20th century when classical physics was revolutionized into quantum physics. The theories of classical physics were predicting absurdities such as the ultraviolet catastrophe, or electrons spiraling into the nucleus. At first these problems were brushed aside by adding ad hoc hypotheses to classical physics. Soon, it became apparent that a new theory must be created in order to make sense of these absurdities, and the theory of quantum mechanics was born.\nQuantum mechanics was formulated by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger using wave mechanics and Werner Heisenberg using matrix mechanics. The equivalence of these methods was proven later. Their formulations described the dynamics of microscopic systems but had several unsatisfactory aspects in describing measurement processes. Von Neumann formulated quantum theory using operator algebra in a way that it described measurement as well as dynamics. These studies emphasized the philosophical aspects of measurement rather than a quantitative approach to extracting information via measurements.\nSee: Dynamical Pictures\nDevelopment from communication.\nIn the 1960s, Ruslan Stratonovich, Carl Helstrom and Gordon proposed a formulation of optical communications using quantum mechanics. This was the first historical appearance of quantum information theory. They mainly studied error probabilities and channel capacities for communication. Later, Alexander Holevo obtained an upper bound of communication speed in the transmission of a classical message via a quantum channel.\nDevelopment from atomic physics and relativity.\nIn the 1970s, techniques for manipulating single-atom quantum states, such as the atom trap and the scanning tunneling microscope, began to be developed, making it possible to isolate single atoms and arrange them in arrays. Prior to these developments, precise control over single quantum systems was not possible, and experiments used coarser, simultaneous control over a large number of quantum systems. The development of viable single-state manipulation techniques led to increased interest in the field of quantum information and computation.\nIn the 1980s, interest arose in whether it might be possible to use quantum effects to disprove Einstein's theory of relativity. If it were possible to clone an unknown quantum state, it would be possible to use entangled quantum states to transmit information faster than the speed of light, disproving Einstein's theory. However, the no-cloning theorem showed that such cloning is impossible. The theorem was one of the earliest results of quantum information theory.\nDevelopment from cryptography.\nDespite all the excitement and interest over studying isolated quantum systems and trying to find a way to circumvent the theory of relativity, research in quantum information theory became stagnant in the 1980s. However, around the same time another avenue started dabbling into quantum information and computation: Cryptography. In a general sense, \"cryptography is the problem of doing communication or computation involving two or more parties who may not trust one another.\"\nBennett and Brassard developed a communication channel on which it is impossible to eavesdrop without being detected, a way of communicating secretly at long distances using the BB84 quantum cryptographic protocol. The key idea was the use of the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that observation disturbs the observed, and the introduction of an eavesdropper in a secure communication line will immediately let the two parties trying to communicate know of the presence of the eavesdropper.\nDevelopment from computer science and mathematics.\nWith the advent of Alan Turing's revolutionary ideas of a programmable computer, or Turing machine, he showed that any real-world computation can be translated into an equivalent computation involving a Turing machine. This is known as the Church\u2013Turing thesis.\nSoon enough, the first computers were made, and computer hardware grew at such a fast pace that the growth, through experience in production, was codified into an empirical relationship called Moore's law. This 'law' is a projective trend that states that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every two years. As transistors began to become smaller and smaller in order to pack more power per surface area, quantum effects started to show up in the electronics resulting in inadvertent interference. This led to the advent of quantum computing, which uses quantum mechanics to design algorithms.\nAt this point, quantum computers showed promise of being much faster than classical computers for certain specific problems. One such example problem was developed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa, known as the Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm. This problem however held little to no practical applications. Peter Shor in 1994 came up with a very important and practical problem, one of finding the prime factors of an integer. The discrete logarithm problem as it was called, could theoretically be solved efficiently on a quantum computer but not on a classical computer hence showing that quantum computers should be more powerful than Turing machines.\nDevelopment from information theory.\nAround the time computer science was making a revolution, so was information theory and communication, through Claude Shannon. Shannon developed two fundamental theorems of information theory: noiseless channel coding theorem and noisy channel coding theorem. He also showed that error correcting codes could be used to protect information being sent.\nQuantum information theory also followed a similar trajectory, Ben Schumacher in 1995 made an analogue to Shannon's noiseless coding theorem using the qubit. A theory of error-correction also developed, which allows quantum computers to make efficient computations regardless of noise and make reliable communication over noisy quantum channels.\nQubits and information theory.\nQuantum information differs strongly from classical information, epitomized by the bit, in many striking and unfamiliar ways. While the fundamental unit of classical information is the bit, the most basic unit of quantum information is the qubit. Classical information is measured using Shannon entropy, while the quantum mechanical analogue is Von Neumann entropy. Given a statistical ensemble of quantum mechanical systems with the density matrix formula_1, it is given by formula_2 Many of the same entropy measures in classical information theory can also be generalized to the quantum case, such as Holevo entropy and the conditional quantum entropy.\nUnlike classical digital states (which are discrete), a qubit is continuous-valued, describable by a direction on the Bloch sphere. Despite being continuously valued in this way, a qubit is the \"smallest\" possible unit of quantum information, and despite the qubit state being continuous-valued, it is impossible to measure the value precisely. Five famous theorems describe the limits on manipulation of quantum information. \nThese theorems are proven from unitarity, which according to Leonard Susskind is the technical term for the statement that quantum information within the universe is conserved.94 The five theorems open possibilities in quantum information processing.\nQuantum information processing.\nThe state of a qubit contains all of its information. This state is frequently expressed as a vector on the Bloch sphere. This state can be changed by applying linear transformations or quantum gates to them. These unitary transformations are described as rotations on the Bloch sphere. While classical gates correspond to the familiar operations of Boolean logic, quantum gates are physical unitary operators.\nThe study of the above topics and differences comprises quantum information theory.\nRelation to quantum mechanics.\nQuantum mechanics is the study of how microscopic physical systems change dynamically in nature. In the field of quantum information theory, the quantum systems studied are abstracted away from any real world counterpart. A qubit might for instance physically be a photon in a linear optical quantum computer, an ion in a trapped ion quantum computer, or it might be a large collection of atoms as in a superconducting quantum computer. Regardless of the physical implementation, the limits and features of qubits implied by quantum information theory hold as all these systems are mathematically described by the same apparatus of density matrices over the complex numbers. Another important difference with quantum mechanics is that while quantum mechanics often studies infinite-dimensional systems such as a harmonic oscillator, quantum information theory is concerned with both continuous-variable systems and finite-dimensional systems.\nEntropy and information.\nEntropy measures the uncertainty in the state of a physical system. Entropy can be studied from the point of view of both the classical and quantum information theories.\nClassical information theory.\nClassical information is based on the concepts of information laid out by Claude Shannon. Classical information, in principle, can be stored in a bit of binary strings. Any system having two states is a capable bit.\nShannon entropy.\nShannon entropy is the quantification of the information gained by measuring the value of a random variable. Another way of thinking about it is by looking at the uncertainty of a system prior to measurement. As a result, entropy, as pictured by Shannon, can be seen either as a measure of the uncertainty prior to making a measurement or as a measure of information gained after making said measurement.\nShannon entropy, written as a function of a discrete probability distribution, formula_3 associated with events formula_4, can be seen as the average information associated with this set of events, in units of bits:\nformula_5\nThis definition of entropy can be used to quantify the physical resources required to store the output of an information source. The ways of interpreting Shannon entropy discussed above are usually only meaningful when the number of samples of an experiment is large.\nR\u00e9nyi entropy.\nThe R\u00e9nyi entropy is a generalization of Shannon entropy defined above. The R\u00e9nyi entropy of order r, written as a function of a discrete probability distribution, formula_6, associated with events formula_7, is defined as:\nformula_8\nfor formula_9 and formula_10.\nWe arrive at the definition of Shannon entropy from R\u00e9nyi when formula_11, of Hartley entropy (or max-entropy) when formula_12, and min-entropy when formula_13.\nQuantum information theory.\nQuantum information theory is largely an extension of classical information theory to quantum systems. Classical information is produced when measurements of quantum systems are made.\nVon Neumann entropy.\nOne interpretation of Shannon entropy was the uncertainty associated with a probability distribution. When we want to describe the information or the uncertainty of a quantum state, the probability distributions are simply replaced by density operators formula_1:\nformula_15\nwhere formula_16 are the eigenvalues of formula_1.\nVon Neumann entropy plays a role in quantum information similar to the role Shannon entropy plays in classical information.\nApplications.\nQuantum communication.\nQuantum communication is one of the applications of quantum physics and quantum information. There are some famous theorems such as the no-cloning theorem that illustrate some important properties in quantum communication. Dense coding and quantum teleportation are also applications of quantum communication. They are two opposite ways to communicate using qubits. While teleportation transfers one qubit from Alice and Bob by communicating two classical bits under the assumption that Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell state, dense coding transfers two classical bits from Alice to Bob by using one qubit, again under the same assumption, that Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell state.\nQuantum key distribution.\nOne of the best known applications of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which provide a theoretical solution to the security issue of a classical key. The advantage of quantum key distribution is that it is impossible to copy a quantum key because of the no-cloning theorem. If someone tries to read encoded data, the quantum state being transmitted will change. This could be used to detect eavesdropping.\nBB84.\nThe first quantum key distribution scheme, BB84, was developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984. It is usually explained as a method of securely communicating a private key from a third party to another for use in one-time pad encryption.\nE91.\nE91 was made by Artur Ekert in 1991. His scheme uses entangled pairs of photons. These two photons can be created by Alice, Bob, or by a third party including eavesdropper Eve. One of the photons is distributed to Alice and the other to Bob so that each one ends up with one photon from the pair.\nThis scheme relies on two properties of quantum entanglement:\nB92.\nB92 is a simpler version of BB84.\nThe main difference between B92 and BB84:\nLike the BB84, Alice transmits to Bob a string of photons encoded with randomly chosen bits but this time the bits Alice chooses the bases she must use. Bob still randomly chooses a basis by which to measure but if he chooses the wrong basis, he will not measure anything which is guaranteed by quantum mechanics theories. Bob can simply tell Alice after each bit she sends whether he measured it correctly.\nQuantum computation.\nThe most widely used model in quantum computation is the quantum circuit, which are based on the quantum bit \"qubit\". Qubit is somewhat analogous to the bit in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 quantum state, or they can be in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured, the result of the measurement is always either a 0 or a 1; the probabilities of these two outcomes depend on the quantum state that the qubits were in immediately prior to the measurement.\nAny quantum computation algorithm can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates.\nQuantum decoherence.\nIf a quantum system were perfectly isolated, it would maintain coherence perfectly, but it would be impossible to test the entire system. If it is not perfectly isolated, for example during a measurement, coherence is shared with the environment and appears to be lost with time; this process is called quantum decoherence. As a result of this process, quantum behavior is apparently lost, just as energy appears to be lost by friction in classical mechanics.\nQuantum error correction.\nQEC is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Quantum error correction is essential if one is to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation that can deal not only with noise on stored quantum information, but also with faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum preparation, and faulty measurements.\nPeter Shor first discovered this method of formulating a \"quantum error correcting code\" by storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of ancilla qubits. A quantum error correcting code protects quantum information against errors.\nJournals.\nMany journals publish research in quantum information science, although only a few are dedicated to this area.

In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offense, and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle. The quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and is almost always the offensive player that throws forward passes. When the QB is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, it is called a sack. The position is also colloquially known as the \"signal caller\" and \"field general\". The quarterback is widely considered the most important position in American football, and one of the most important positions in all team sports.\nOverview.\nIn modern American football, the starting quarterback is usually the leader of the offense, and their successes and failures can have a significant impact on the fortunes of their team. Accordingly, the quarterback is among the most glorified, scrutinized, and highest-paid positions in team sports; the majority of the highest-paid players in the NFL are quarterbacks, and teams often use their top draft picks to select a quarterback. \"Bleacher Report\" describes the signing of a starting quarterback as a catch-22, where \"NFL teams cannot maintain success without excellent quarterback play. But excellent quarterback play is usually so expensive that it prevents NFL teams from maintaining success\"; a star quarterback's high salary may prevent the signing of other expensive star players as the team has to stay under the hard salary cap. \nOne of the major contributing factors behind the success and longevity of the New England Patriots' Brady\u2013Belichick era was the willingness of starting quarterback Tom Brady to consistently take pay cuts despite his elite performance, which allowed the Patriots to spend that money elsewhere on additional skill players, with a famous example of this being the signing of Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss in 2007.\nThe quarterback touches the ball on almost every offensive play. Depending on the play calling system, prior to each play the quarterback will usually gather the rest of their team together in a huddle to tell them which play the team will run. However, when there is not much time left, or when an offense simply wants to increase the tempo of their plays, teams will forgo the huddle and the quarterback may call plays while the other offensive players get into position or at the line of scrimmage. After the team is lined up, the center will pass the ball back to the quarterback (a process called the snap). Usually on a running play, the quarterback will then hand or pitch the ball backwards to a halfback or fullback. On a passing play, the quarterback is almost always the player responsible for trying to throw the ball downfield to an eligible receiver. Additionally, the quarterback may run with the football himself, as part of a designed play like the option run or quarterback sneak, or the quarterback could make an impromptu run on their own (called a \"scramble\") to avoid being sacked by the defense. Nowadays, many quarterbacks choose to scramble or run option plays like Lamar Jackson, who is known for his rushing ability.\nDepending on the offensive scheme used by their team, the quarterback's role can vary. In systems like the triple option, the quarterback will only pass the ball a few times per game, if at all, while the pass-heavy spread offense, as run by schools like Texas Tech, requires quarterbacks to throw the ball on most plays. The passing game is emphasized heavily in the Canadian Football League (CFL), where there are only three downs (as opposed to the four downs used in American football), a larger field of play and an extra eligible receiver. Different skillsets are required of the quarterback depending upon the offensive system. Quarterbacks that perform well in a pass-heavy spread offense system, a popular offensive scheme in the NCAA and NFHS, rarely perform well in the National Football League (NFL), as the fundamentals of the pro-style offense used in the NFL are very different from those in the spread system, while quarterbacks in Canadian football need to be able to throw the ball often and accurately. In general, quarterbacks need to have physical skills such as arm strength, mobility and a quick throwing motion, in addition to intangibles such as competitiveness, leadership, intelligence and downfield vision.\nIn the NFL, quarterbacks are required to wear a uniform number between 1 and 19. In the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), quarterbacks are required to wear a uniform number between 1 and 49; in the NFHS, the quarterback can also wear a number between 80 and 89. In the CFL, the quarterback can wear any number from 0 to 49 and 70 to 99. Because of their numbering, quarterbacks are eligible receivers in the NCAA, NFHS and CFL; in the NFL, quarterbacks are eligible receivers if they are not lined up directly under center.\nLeadership.\nOften compared to captains of other team sports, before the implementation of NFL team captains in 2007, the starting quarterback was usually the \"de facto\" team leader and a well-respected player on and off the field. Since 2007, when the NFL allowed teams to designate several captains to serve as on-field leaders, the starting quarterback has usually been one of the team captains as the leader of the team's offense.\nIn the NFL, while the starting quarterback has no other responsibility or authority, they may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies, the coin toss or other events outside the game. For instance, the starting quarterback is the first player (and third person after the team owner and head coach) to be presented with the Lamar Hunt Trophy/George Halas Trophy (after winning the AFC/NFC Conference title) and the Vince Lombardi Trophy (after a Super Bowl victory). The starting quarterback of the victorious Super Bowl team is often chosen for the \"I'm going to Disney World!\" campaign (which includes a trip to Walt Disney World for them and their families), whether they are the Super Bowl MVP or not; examples include Joe Montana (XXIII), Trent Dilfer (XXXV), Peyton Manning (50) and Tom Brady (LIII). Dilfer was chosen even though teammate Ray Lewis was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXV, due to the bad publicity from Lewis' murder trial the previous year.\nBeing able to rely on a quarterback is vital to team morale. San Diego Chargers safety Rodney Harrison called the 1998 season a \"nightmare\" because of poor play by Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan and, from the rookie Leaf, obnoxious behavior toward teammates. Although their 1999 season replacements Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer were not stars, linebacker Junior Seau said, \"You can't imagine the security we feel as teammates knowing we have two quarterbacks who have performed in this league and know how to handle themselves as players and as leaders\".\nCommentators have noted the \"disproportionate importance\" of the quarterback, describing it as the \"most glorified\u2014and scrutinized\u2014position\" in team sports. It is believed that \"there is no other position in sports that 'dictates the terms' of a game the way quarterback does\", whether that impact is positive or negative, as \"Everybody feeds off of what the quarterback can and cannot do...Defensively, offensively, everybody reacts to what threats or non-threats the quarterback has. Everything else is secondary\". \"An argument can be made that quarterback is the most influential position in team sports, considering he touches the ball on virtually every offensive play of a far shorter season than baseball, basketball or hockey\u2014a season in which every game is vitally important\". Most consistently successful NFL teams (for instance, multiple Super Bowl appearances within a short period of time) have been centered around a single starting quarterback; the one exception was the Washington Redskins under head coach Joe Gibbs who won three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks from 1982 to 1991. Many of these NFL dynasties ended with the departure of their starting quarterback.\nOn a team's defense, the middle linebacker is regarded as \"quarterback of the defense\" and is often the defensive leader, since they must be as smart as they are athletic. The middle linebacker (MLB), sometimes known as the \"Mike\", is the only inside linebacker in the 4\u20133 scheme.\nBackup.\nCompared to other positions in gridiron football, the backup quarterback gets considerably less playing time than the starting quarterback. While players at many other positions may rotate in and out during a game, and even a starter at most other positions rarely plays every snap, a team's starting quarterback often remains in the game for every play, which means that a team's primary backup may go an entire season without taking a meaningful offensive snap. While their primary role may be to be available in case of injury to the starter, the backup quarterback may also have additional roles such as a holder on placekicks or as a punter, and will often play a key role in practice, serving as the upcoming opponent's quarterback during the preceding week's practices. A backup quarterback may also be put in during \"garbage time\" (when the score is so lopsided and the time left in the game is so short that the outcome cannot realistically be changed), or start a meaningless late-season game (either the team has been eliminated from the postseason, or the playoff seeding cannot be affected), in order to ensure the starting quarterback does not needlessly risk an injury. Backup quarterbacks typically have the career of a journeyman quarterback and have short stints with multiple teams, a notable exception being Frank Reich, who backed up Jim Kelly for nine years with the Buffalo Bills in the 1980s and 1990s.\nA quarterback controversy results when a team has two capable quarterbacks competing for the starting position. Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline; Morton started in Super Bowl V, which his team lost, while Staubach started in Super Bowl VI the following year and won. Although Morton played most of the 1972 season due to an injury to Staubach, Staubach took back the starting job when he rallied the Cowboys in a come-from-behind win in the playoffs and Morton was subsequently traded; Staubach and Morton faced each other in Super Bowl XII. Another notable quarterback controversy involved the San Francisco 49ers, who had three capable starters: Joe Montana, Steve Young and Steve Bono. Montana suffered a season-ending injury that cost him the 1991 NFL season and was supplanted by Young. Young was injured midway through the season, but Bono held the starting job (despite Young's recovery) until Bono's own injury let Young reclaim it. Montana also missed most of the 1992 NFL season, making only one appearance, then was traded away at his request to take over as the starter for the Kansas City Chiefs; upon retirement, he was succeeded by Bono as the Chiefs' starting quarterback.\nTeams will often bring in a capable backup quarterback via the draft or a trade, as competition or potential replacement which would certainly threaten the starting quarterback's place in the team (see Two-quarterback system below). For instance, Drew Brees began his career with the San Diego Chargers but the team also drafted Philip Rivers; despite Brees initially retaining his starting job and being the Comeback Player of the Year he was not re-signed due to an injury and joined the New Orleans Saints as a free agent. Brees and Rivers both retired in 2021, each having been a starter for the Saints and Chargers, respectively, for over a decade. Aaron Rodgers was drafted by the Green Bay Packers as the eventual successor to Brett Favre, though Rodgers served in a backup role for a few years to develop sufficiently for the team to give him the starting job; Rodgers would himself encounter a similar situation in 2020 when the Packers drafted quarterback Jordan Love. Similarly, Patrick Mahomes was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs to eventually supplant Alex Smith, with the latter willingly serving as a mentor.\nTrends and other roles.\nIn addition to their main role, quarterbacks are occasionally used in other roles. In the past, many teams utilized a backup quarterback as their holder on placekicks. A benefit of using quarterbacks as holders is that it would be easier to pull off a fake field goal attempt, but many coaches today prefer to use punters as holders because a punter will have far more time in practice sessions to work with the kicker than any quarterback would. In the Wildcat formation, where a halfback lines up behind the center and the quarterback lines up out wide, the quarterback can be used as a receiving target or a blocker. A more rare use for a quarterback is to punt the ball themself, a play known as a quick kick. Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway was known to perform quick kicks occasionally, typically when the Broncos were facing a third-and-long situation. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham, an All-America punter in college, was also known to punt the ball occasionally, and was assigned as the team's default punter for certain situations, such as when the team was backed up inside their own five-yard line.\nAs Roger Staubach's backup, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White was also the team's punter, opening strategic possibilities for coach Tom Landry. Ascending to the starting role upon Staubach's retirement, White held his position as the team's punter for several seasons\u2014a double duty he performed to All-American standard at Arizona State University. White also had two touchdown receptions as a Dallas Cowboy, both from the halfback option.\nSpecial tactics.\nIf quarterbacks are uncomfortable with the formation the defense is using, they may call an audible change to their play. For example, if a quarterback receives the call to execute a running play, but they notice that the defense is ready to blitz\u2014that is, to send additional defenders across the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle the quarterback or short their ability to pass\u2014the quarterback may want to change the play. To do this, the quarterback yells a special code, like \"Blue 42\" or \"Texas 29\", which tells the offense to switch to a specific play or formation.\nQuarterbacks can also \"spike\" (throw the football at the ground) to stop the official game clock. For example, if a team is down by a field goal with only seconds remaining, a quarterback may spike the ball to prevent the game clock from running out. This usually allows the field goal unit to come onto the field, or attempt a final \"Hail Mary pass\". However, if a team is winning, a quarterback can keep the clock running by kneeling after the snap. This is normally done when the opposing team has no timeouts and there is little time left in the game, as it allows a team to burn up the remaining time on the clock without risking a turnover or injury.\nDual-threat quarterbacks.\nA dual-threat quarterback possesses the skills and physique to run with the ball if necessary. With the rise of several blitz-heavy defensive schemes and increasingly faster defensive players, the importance of a mobile quarterback has been redefined. While arm power, accuracy, and pocket presence\u2014the ability to successfully operate from within the \"pocket\" formed by his blockers\u2014are still the most important quarterback virtues, the ability to elude or run past defenders creates an additional threat that allows greater flexibility in a team's passing and running game.\nDual-threat quarterbacks have historically been more prolific at the college level. Typically, a quarterback with exceptional quickness is used in an option offense, which allows the quarterback to hand the ball off, run it themself or pitch it to a running back shadowing them to the outside. This type of offense forces defenders to commit to the running back up the middle, the quarterback around the end or the running back trailing the quarterback. It is then that the quarterback has the \"option\" to identify which matchup is most favorable to the offense as the play unfolds and exploit that defensive weakness. In the college game, many schools employ several plays that are designed for the quarterback to run with the ball. This is much less common in professional football, except for a quarterback sneak, a play that involves the quarterback diving forward behind the offensive line to gain a small amount of yardage, but there is still an emphasis on being mobile enough to escape a heavy pass rush. Historically, high-profile dual-threat quarterbacks in the NFL were uncommon\u2014among the notable exceptions were Steve Young and John Elway, who led their teams to one and five Super Bowl appearances respectively; and Michael Vick, whose rushing ability was a rarity in the early 2000s, although he never led his team to a Super Bowl. In the 2010s, quarterbacks with dual-threat capabilities have become more popular. Current NFL quarterbacks considered to be dual-threats include Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, and Josh Allen.\nTwo-quarterback system.\nSome teams employ a strategy that involves the use of more than one quarterback during the course of a game. This is more common at lower levels of football, such as high school or small college, but rare in major college or professional football.\nThere are four circumstances in which a two-quarterback system may be used.\nThe first is when a team is in the process of determining which quarterback will eventually be the starter, and may choose to use each quarterback for part of the game in order to compare the performances. For instance, the Seattle Seahawks' Pete Carroll used the preseason games in 2012 to select Russell Wilson as the starting quarterback over Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson.\nThe second is a starter\u2013reliever system, in which the starting quarterback splits the regular season playing time with the backup quarterback, although the former will start playoff games. This strategy is rare, and was last seen in the NFL in the \"WoodStrock\" combination of Don Strock and David Woodley, which took the Miami Dolphins to the Epic in Miami in 1982 and Super Bowl XVII the following year. The starter\u2013reliever system is distinct from a one-off situation in which a starter is benched in favor of the backup because the switch is part of the game plan (usually if the starter is playing poorly for that game), and the expectation is that the two players will assume the same roles game after game.\nThe third is if a coach decides that the team has two quarterbacks who are equally effective and proceeds to rotate the quarterbacks at predetermined intervals, such as after each quarter or after each series. Southern California high school football team Corona Centennial operated this model during the 2014 football season, rotating quarterbacks after every series. In a game against the Chicago Bears in week 7 of the 1971 season, Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the playcall from the sideline.\nThe fourth, still occasionally seen in major-college football, is the use of different quarterbacks in different game or down-and-distance situations. Generally this involves a running quarterback and a passing quarterback in an option or wishbone offense. In Canadian football, quarterback sneaks or other runs in short-yardage situations tend to be successful as a result of the distance between the offensive and defensive lines being one yard. Drew Tate, a quarterback for the Calgary Stampeders, was primarily used in short-yardage situations and led the CFL in rushing touchdowns during the 2014 season with 10 scores as the backup to Bo Levi Mitchell. This strategy had all but disappeared from professional American football, but returned to some extent with the advent of the \"wildcat\" offense. There is debate within football circles as to the effectiveness of the so-called \"two-quarterback system\". Many coaches and media personnel remain skeptical of the model. Teams such as USC (Southern California), OSU (Oklahoma State), Northwestern and smaller West Georgia have utilized the two-quarterback system; West Georgia, for example, uses the system due to the skillsets of its quarterbacks. As recently as 2020, Oregon, who had two quarterbacks capable of starting (Boston College transfer Anthony Brown and sophomore Tyler Shough), utilized a similar tactic in the 2020 Pac-12 Football Championship Game, giving Shough the start but inserting the dual-threat Brown on short-yardage plays, red zone situations and the final drive of the game. Teams like these use this situation because of the advantages it gives them against defenses of the other team, so that the defense is unable to adjust to their gameplan.\nHistory.\nThe quarterback position dates to the late 1800s, when American Ivy League schools playing a form of rugby union imported from the United Kingdom began to put their own spin on the game. Walter Camp, a prominent athlete and rugby player at Yale University, pushed through a change in rules at a meeting in 1880 that established a line of scrimmage and allowed for the football to be snapped to a quarterback. The change was meant to allow for teams to strategize their play more thoroughly and retain possession more easily than was possible in the chaos of a scrummage in rugby. In Camp's formulation, the \"quarter-back\" was the person who received a ball snapped back with another player's foot. Originally he was not allowed to run forward of the line of scrimmage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A scrimmage takes place when the holder of the ball puts it on the ground before him and puts it in play while on-side either by kicking the ball or by snapping it back with his foot. The man who first receives the ball from the snap-back shall be called the quarter-back and shall not rush forward with the ball under penalty of foul.\u2014\u200a\nIn the primary formation of Camp's time, there were four \"back\" positions, with the tailback playing furthest back, followed by the fullback, the halfback, and the quarterback closest to the line. As the quarterback was not allowed to run past the line of scrimmage, and the forward pass had not yet been invented, their primary role was to receive the snap from the center, and immediately hand or toss the ball backwards to the fullback or halfback to run. By the early 1900s, their role had been further reduced, as teams began to employ longer, direct snaps to one of the other backs (who by rule \"were\" allowed to run) and the quarterback became the primary \"blocking back\", leading the way through the defense but rarely carrying the ball themselves. This was the primary strategy of the single wing offense which was popular during the early decades of the 20th century. After the growth of the forward pass, the role of the quarterback changed again. The quarterback would later be returned to his role as the primary receiver of the snap after the advent of the T-formation offense, especially under the success of former single wing tailback, and later T-formation quarterback, Sammy Baugh.\nThe requirement to stay behind the line of scrimmage was soon rescinded, but it was later reimposed in six-man football. The exchange between the person snapping the ball, typically the center, and the quarterback was initially an awkward one because it involved a kick. At first, centers gave the ball a small boot, and then picked it up and handed it to the quarterback. By 1889, Yale center Bert Hanson was bouncing the ball on the ground to the quarterback between his legs. The following year, a rule change officially made snapping the ball using the hands between the legs legal. Several years later, Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago invented the lift-up snap: the center passed the ball off the ground and between his legs to a standing quarterback. A similar set of changes were later adopted in Canadian football as part of the Burnside rules, a set of rules proposed by John Meldrum \"Thrift\" Burnside, the captain of the University of Toronto's football team.\nThe change from a scrummage to a scrimmage made it easier for teams to decide what plays they would run before the snap. At first, the captains of college teams were put in charge of play calling, indicating with shouted codes which players would run with the ball and how the men on the line were supposed to block. Yale later used visual signals, including adjustments of the captain's knit hat, to call plays. Centers could also signal plays based on the alignment of the ball before the snap. In 1888, however, Princeton University began to have its quarterback call plays using number signals. That system caught on and quarterbacks began to act as directors and organizers of offensive play.\nEarly on, quarterbacks were used in a variety of formations. Harvard's team put seven men on the line of scrimmage, with three halfbacks who alternated at quarterback and a lone fullback. Princeton put six men on the line and had one designated quarterback, while Yale used seven linemen, one quarterback and two halfbacks who lined up on either side of the fullback. This was the origin of the T-formation, an offensive set that remained in use for many decades afterward and gained popularity in professional football starting in the 1930s.\nIn 1906, the forward pass was legalized in American football; Canadian football did not adopt the forward pass until 1929. Despite the legalization of the forward pass, the most popular formations of the early 20th century focused mostly on the rushing game. The single-wing formation, a run-oriented offensive set, was invented by football coach Glenn \"Pop\" Warner around the year 1908. In the single-wing, the quarterback was positioned behind the line of scrimmage and was flanked by a tailback, fullback and wingback. He served largely as a blocking back; the tailback typically took the snap, either running forward with the ball or making a lateral pass to one of the other players in the backfield. The quarterback's job was usually to make blocks upfield to help the tailback or fullback gain yards. Passing plays were rare in the single-wing, an unbalanced power formation where four linemen lined up to one side of the center and two lined up to the other. The tailback was the focus of the offense, and was often a triple-threat man who would either pass, run or kick the ball.\nOffensive play calling continued to focus on rushing up through the 1920s, when professional leagues began to challenge the popularity of college football. In the early days of the professional National Football League (NFL), which was founded in 1920, games were largely low-scoring affairs. Two-thirds of all games in the 1920s were shutouts, and quarterbacks/tailbacks usually passed only out of desperation. In addition to a reluctance to risk turnovers by passing, various rules existed that limited the effectiveness of the forward pass: passers were required to drop back five yards behind the line of scrimmage before they could attempt a pass, and incomplete passes in the end zone resulted in a change of possession and a touchback. Additionally, the rules required the ball to be snapped from the location on the field where it was ruled dead; if a play ended with a player going out of bounds, the center had to snap the ball from the sideline, an awkward place to start a play.\nDespite these constraints, player-coach Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers, along with several other NFL figures of his era, was a consistent proponent of the forward pass. The Packers found success in the 1920s and 1930s using variations on the single-wing that emphasized the passing game. Packers quarterback Red Dunn and New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers quarterback Benny Friedman were the leading passers of their era, but passing remained a relative rarity among other teams; between 1920 and 1932, there were three times as many running plays as there were passing plays.\nEarly NFL quarterbacks typically were responsible for calling the team's offensive plays with signals before the snap. The use of the huddle to call plays originated with Stagg in 1896, but only began to be used regularly in college games in 1921. In the NFL, players were typically assigned numbers, as were the gaps between offensive linemen. One player, usually the quarterback, would call signals indicating which player was to run the ball and which gap he would run toward. Playcalling (or any other kind of coaching from the sidelines) was not permitted during this period, leaving the quarterback to devise the offensive strategy (often, the quarterback doubled as head coach during this era). Substitutions were limited and quarterbacks often played on both offense and defense.\nBetween 1933 and 1945, numerous changes for the quarterback position were applied. The rule requiring a quarterback/tailback to be five yards behind the line of scrimmage to pass was abolished, and hash marks were added to the field that established a limited zone between which the ball was placed before snaps, making offensive formations more flexible. Additionally, incomplete passes in the end zone were no longer counted as turnovers and touchbacks.\nThe single-wing continued to be in wide use throughout this, and a number of forward-passing tailbacks became stars, including Sammy Baugh of the Washington Redskins. In 1939, University of Chicago head football coach Clark Shaughnessy made modifications to the T-formation, a formation that put the quarterback behind the center and had him receive the snap directly. Shaughnessy altered the formation by having the linemen be spaced further apart, and he began having players go in motion behind the line of scrimmage before the snap to confuse defenses. These changes were picked up by Chicago Bears coach George Halas, a close friend of Shaughnessy, and they quickly caught on in the professional ranks. Utilizing the T-formation and led by quarterback Sid Luckman, the Bears reached the NFL championship game in 1940 and beat the Redskins by a score of 73\u20130. The blowout led other teams across the league to adopt variations on the T-formation, including the Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Rams and Detroit Lions. Baugh and the Redskins converted to the T-formation and continued to succeed.\nThanks in part to the emergence of the T-formation and changes in the rulebooks to liberalize the passing game, passing from the quarterback position became more common in the 1940s and as teams switched to the T-formation, passing tailbacks, such as Sammy Baugh, would line up as quarterbacks instead. Over the course of the decade, passing yards began to exceed rushing yards for the first time in the history of football. The Cleveland Browns of the late 1940s in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a professional league created to challenge the NFL, were one of the teams of that era that relied most on passing. Quarterback Otto Graham helped the Browns win four AAFC championships in the late 1940s in head coach Paul Brown's T-formation offense, which emphasized precision timing passes. Cleveland, along with several other AAFC teams, was absorbed by the NFL in 1950 after the dissolution of the AAFC that same year. By the end of the 1940s, all NFL teams aside from the Pittsburgh Steelers used the T-formation as their primary offensive formation.\nAs late as the 1960s, running plays occurred more frequently than passes. NFL quarterback Milt Plum later stated that during his career (1957\u20131969) passes typically only occurred on third downs and sometimes on first downs. Quarterbacks only increased in importance as rules changed to favor passing and higher scoring and as football gained popularity on television after the 1958 NFL Championship Game, often referred to as \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\". Early modern offenses evolved around the quarterback as a passing threat, boosted by rules changes in 1978 and 1979 that made it a penalty for defensive backs to interfere with receivers downfield and allowed offensive linemen to pass-block using their arms and open hands; the rules had limited them to blocking with their hands held to their chests. Average passing yards per game rose from 283.3 in 1977 to 408.7 in 1979.\nThe NFL continues to be a pass-heavy league, in part due to further rule changes that prescribed harsher penalties for hitting the quarterback and for hitting defenseless receivers as they awaited passes. Passing in wide-open offenses has also been an emphasis at the high school and college levels, and professional coaches have devised schemes to fit the talents of new generations of quarterbacks.\nWhile quarterbacks and team captains usually called plays in football's early years, today coaches often decide which plays the offense will run. Some teams use an offensive coordinator, an assistant coach whose duties include offensive game-planning and often play-calling. In the NFL, coaches are allowed to communicate with quarterbacks and call plays using audio equipment built into the player's helmet. Quarterbacks are allowed to hear, but not talk to, their coaches until there are fifteen seconds left on the play clock. Once the quarterback receives the call, he may relay it to other players via signals or in a huddle.\nDallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry was an early advocate of taking play calling out of the quarterback's hands. Although this remained a common practice in the NFL through the 1970s, fewer QBs were doing it by the 1980s and even Hall of Famers like Joe Montana did not call their own plays. Buffalo Bills QB Jim Kelly was one of the last to regularly call plays. Peyton Manning, formerly of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, was the best modern example of a quarterback who called his own plays, primary using an uptempo, no-huddle-based attack. Manning had almost complete control over the offense. Former Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco retained a high degree of control over the offense as well, particularly when running a no-huddle scheme, as did Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nRace.\nThroughout football history, the racial makeup of quarterbacks did not reflect the racial makeup of the sport. Black quarterbacks especially faced barriers in breaking into the starting job at the highest levels. The first black starting quarterback in the Super Bowl era was Marlin Briscoe in 1968, who started for the American Football League's Denver Broncos during part of one season; he was later converted to wide receiver. James Harris started several games for the Buffalo Bills after the AFL-NFL merger, and later started games for the Los Angeles Rams. Other early NFL black starting quarterbacks include Joe Gilliam of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who was the first black quarterback to start a season for any NFL team; though he was benched after the first six games.\nDuring the 2013 NFL season, 67 percent of NFL players were African American yet only 17 percent of quarterbacks were; 82 percent of quarterbacks were white, with just one percent of quarterbacks from other races. Since the inception of the game, only four quarterbacks with known black ancestry have led their team to a Super Bowl victory: Doug Williams in 1988, Russell Wilson, who is multiracial, in 2014, Patrick Mahomes (biracial) in 2020, 2023, and 2024 and Jalen Hurts in 2025. However, numerous quarterbacks with African ancestry did start the Super Bowl since the 2010s, including four in a row (Super Bowl XLVII, Super Bowl XLVIII, Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl 50). Quarterbacks with known black ancestry have also won the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award in recent years, including Cam Newton, Patrick Mahomes, and Lamar Jackson.\nSome black quarterbacks claim to have experienced bias towards or against them due to their race. Despite his ability to both pass and run effectively, current Cleveland Browns signal-caller Deshaun Watson despises being called a dual-threat quarterback because he believes the term is often used to stereotype black quarterbacks.\nSuper Bowl LVII was the first Super Bowl in history where each starting quarterback (Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes, who is biracial) was black.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is derived from the Latin words \"quadri\", a variant of four, and \"latus\", meaning \"side\". It is also called a tetragon, derived from Greek \"tetra\" meaning \"four\" and \"gon\" meaning \"corner\" or \"angle\", in analogy to other polygons (e.g. pentagon). Since \"gon\" means \"angle\", it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle. A quadrilateral with vertices formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 is sometimes denoted as formula_5.\nQuadrilaterals are either simple (not self-intersecting), or complex (self-intersecting, or crossed). Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave.\nThe interior angles of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral \"ABCD\" add up to 360 degrees, that is\nformula_6\nThis is a special case of the \"n\"-gon interior angle sum formula: \"S\" = (\"n\" \u2212 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 (here, n=4).\nAll non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.\nSimple quadrilaterals.\nAny quadrilateral that is not self-intersecting is a simple quadrilateral.\nConvex quadrilateral.\nIn a convex quadrilateral all interior angles are less than 180\u00b0, and the two diagonals both lie inside the quadrilateral.\nConcave quadrilaterals.\nIn a concave quadrilateral, one interior angle is bigger than 180\u00b0, and one of the two diagonals lies outside the quadrilateral.\nComplex quadrilaterals.\nA self-intersecting quadrilateral is called variously a cross-quadrilateral, crossed quadrilateral, butterfly quadrilateral or bow-tie quadrilateral. In a crossed quadrilateral, the four \"interior\" angles on either side of the crossing (two acute and two reflex, all on the left or all on the right as the figure is traced out) add up to 720\u00b0.\nSpecial line segments.\nThe two diagonals of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect opposite vertices.\nThe two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides. They intersect at the \"vertex centroid\" of the quadrilateral (see below).\nThe four maltitudes of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side\u2014through the midpoint of the opposite side.\nArea of a convex quadrilateral.\nThere are various general formulas for the area \"K\" of a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with sides \"a\" \n \"AB\", \"b\" \n \"BC\", \"c\" \n \"CD\" and \"d\" \n \"DA\".\nTrigonometric formulas.\nThe area can be expressed in trigonometric terms as\nformula_7\nwhere the lengths of the diagonals are \"p\" and \"q\" and the angle between them is \"\u03b8\". In the case of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral (e.g. rhombus, square, and kite), this formula reduces to formula_8 since \"\u03b8\" is 90\u00b0.\nThe area can be also expressed in terms of bimedians as\nformula_9\nwhere the lengths of the bimedians are \"m\" and \"n\" and the angle between them is \"\u03c6\".\nBretschneider's formula expresses the area in terms of the sides and two opposite angles:\nformula_10\nwhere the sides in sequence are \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", where \"s\" is the semiperimeter, and \"A\" and \"C\" are two (in fact, any two) opposite angles. This reduces to Brahmagupta's formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral\u2014when .\nAnother area formula in terms of the sides and angles, with angle \"C\" being between sides \"b\" and \"c\", and \"A\" being between sides \"a\" and \"d\", is\nformula_11\nIn the case of a cyclic quadrilateral, the latter formula becomes formula_12\nIn a parallelogram, where both pairs of opposite sides and angles are equal, this formula reduces to formula_13\nAlternatively, we can write the area in terms of the sides and the intersection angle \"\u03b8\" of the diagonals, as long as \"\u03b8\" is not 90\u00b0:\nformula_14\nIn the case of a parallelogram, the latter formula becomes formula_15\nAnother area formula including the sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" is\nformula_16\nwhere \"x\" is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals, and \"\u03c6\" is the angle between the bimedians.\nThe last trigonometric area formula including the sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" and the angle \"\u03b1\" (between \"a\" and \"b\") is:\nformula_17\nwhich can also be used for the area of a concave quadrilateral (having the concave part opposite to angle \"\u03b1\"), by just changing the first sign + to -.\nNon-trigonometric formulas.\nThe following two formulas express the area in terms of the sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" and \"d\", the semiperimeter \"s\", and the diagonals \"p\", \"q\":\nformula_18 \nformula_19 \nThe first reduces to Brahmagupta's formula in the cyclic quadrilateral case, since then \"pq\" = \"ac\" + \"bd\".\nThe area can also be expressed in terms of the bimedians \"m\", \"n\" and the diagonals \"p\", \"q\":\nformula_20 \nformula_21 \nIn fact, any three of the four values \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", and \"q\" suffice for determination of the area, since in any quadrilateral the four values are related by formula_22 The corresponding expressions are:\nformula_23 \nif the lengths of two bimedians and one diagonal are given, and\nformula_24 \nif the lengths of two diagonals and one bimedian are given.\nVector formulas.\nThe area of a quadrilateral \"ABCD\" can be calculated using vectors. Let vectors AC and BD form the diagonals from \"A\" to \"C\" and from \"B\" to \"D\". The area of the quadrilateral is then\nformula_25\nwhich is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AC and BD. In two-dimensional Euclidean space, expressing vector AC as a free vector in Cartesian space equal to (x\"1,\"y\"1) and BD as (x\"2,\"y\"2), this can be rewritten as:\nformula_26\nDiagonals.\nProperties of the diagonals in quadrilaterals.\nIn the following table it is listed if the diagonals in some of the most basic quadrilaterals bisect each other, if their diagonals are perpendicular, and if their diagonals have equal length. The list applies to the most general cases, and excludes named subsets.\nLengths of the diagonals.\nThe lengths of the diagonals in a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" can be calculated using the law of cosines on each triangle formed by one diagonal and two sides of the quadrilateral. Thus\nformula_27\nand\nformula_28\nOther, more symmetric formulas for the lengths of the diagonals, are\nformula_29\nand\nformula_30\nGeneralizations of the parallelogram law and Ptolemy's theorem.\nIn any convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\", the sum of the squares of the four sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the two diagonals plus four times the square of the line segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals. Thus\nformula_31\nwhere x is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is sometimes known as Euler's quadrilateral theorem and is a generalization of the parallelogram law.\nThe German mathematician Carl Anton Bretschneider derived in 1842 the following generalization of Ptolemy's theorem, regarding the product of the diagonals in a convex quadrilateral\nformula_32\nThis relation can be considered to be a law of cosines for a quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, where \"A\" + \"C\" = 180\u00b0, it reduces to \"pq\" = \"ac\" + \"bd\". Since , it also gives a proof of Ptolemy's inequality.\nOther metric relations.\nIf X and Y are the feet of the normals from B and D to the diagonal \"AC\" = \"p\" in a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with sides \"a\" = \"AB\", \"b\" = \"BC\", \"c\" = \"CD\", \"d\" = \"DA\", then\nformula_33\nIn a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with sides \"a\" = \"AB\", \"b\" = \"BC\", \"c\" = \"CD\", \"d\" = \"DA\", and where the diagonals intersect at E,\nformula_34\nwhere \"e\" = \"AE\", \"f\" = \"BE\", \"g\" = \"CE\", and \"h\" = \"DE\".\nThe shape and size of a convex quadrilateral are fully determined by the lengths of its sides in sequence and of one diagonal between two specified vertices. The two diagonals \"p\", \"q\" and the four side lengths \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" of a quadrilateral are related by the Cayley-Menger determinant, as follows:\nformula_35\nAngle bisectors.\nThe internal angle bisectors of a convex quadrilateral either form a cyclic quadrilateral (that is, the four intersection points of adjacent angle bisectors are concyclic) or they are concurrent. In the latter case the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral.\nIn quadrilateral \"ABCD\", if the angle bisectors of A and C meet on diagonal BD, then the angle bisectors of B and D meet on diagonal AC.\nBimedians.\nThe bimedians of a quadrilateral are the line segments connecting the midpoints of the opposite sides. The intersection of the bimedians is the centroid of the vertices of the quadrilateral.\nThe midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral (convex, concave or crossed) are the vertices of a parallelogram called the Varignon parallelogram. It has the following properties:\nThe two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are concurrent and are all bisected by their point of intersection.\nIn a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c and d, the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides a and c is\nformula_36\nwhere p and q are the length of the diagonals. The length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides b and d is\nformula_37\nHence\nformula_38\nThis is also a corollary to the parallelogram law applied in the Varignon parallelogram.\nThe lengths of the bimedians can also be expressed in terms of two opposite sides and the distance x between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is possible when using Euler's quadrilateral theorem in the above formulas. Whence\nformula_39\nand\nformula_40\nNote that the two opposite sides in these formulas are not the two that the bimedian connects.\nIn a convex quadrilateral, there is the following dual connection between the bimedians and the diagonals:\nTrigonometric identities.\nThe four angles of a simple quadrilateral \"ABCD\" satisfy the following identities:\nformula_41\nand\nformula_42\nAlso,\nformula_43\nIn the last two formulas, no angle is allowed to be a right angle, since tan\u00a090\u00b0 is not defined.\nLet formula_44, formula_45, formula_46, formula_47 be the sides of a convex quadrilateral, formula_48 is the semiperimeter, \nand formula_1 and formula_3 are opposite angles, then\nformula_51\nand\nformula_52.\nWe can use these identities to derive the Bretschneider's Formula.\nInequalities.\nArea.\nIf a convex quadrilateral has the consecutive sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" and the diagonals \"p\", \"q\", then its area \"K\" satisfies\nformula_53 with equality only for a rectangle.\nformula_54 with equality only for a square.\nformula_55 with equality only if the diagonals are perpendicular and equal.\nformula_56 with equality only for a rectangle.\nFrom Bretschneider's formula it directly follows that the area of a quadrilateral satisfies\nformula_57\nwith equality if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic or degenerate such that one side is equal to the sum of the other three (it has collapsed into a line segment, so the area is zero).\nAlso,\nformula_58\nwith equality for a bicentric quadrilateral or a rectangle.\nThe area of any quadrilateral also satisfies the inequality\nformula_59\nDenoting the perimeter as \"L\", we have\nformula_60\nwith equality only in the case of a square.\nThe area of a convex quadrilateral also satisfies\nformula_61\nfor diagonal lengths \"p\" and \"q\", with equality if and only if the diagonals are perpendicular.\nLet \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" be the lengths of the sides of a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with the area \"K\" and diagonals \"AC = p\", \"BD = q\". Then\nformula_62 with equality only for a square.\nLet \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" be the lengths of the sides of a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with the area \"K\", then the following inequality holds:\nformula_63 with equality only for a square.\nDiagonals and bimedians.\nA corollary to Euler's quadrilateral theorem is the inequality\nformula_64\nwhere equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\nEuler also generalized Ptolemy's theorem, which is an equality in a cyclic quadrilateral, into an inequality for a convex quadrilateral. It states that\nformula_65\nwhere there is equality if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic. This is often called Ptolemy's inequality.\nIn any convex quadrilateral the bimedians \"m, n\" and the diagonals \"p, q\" are related by the inequality\nformula_66\nwith equality holding if and only if the diagonals are equal. This follows directly from the quadrilateral identity formula_67\nSides.\nThe sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\" of any quadrilateral satisfy\nformula_68\nand\nformula_69\nMaximum and minimum properties.\nAmong all quadrilaterals with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is the square. This is called the \"isoperimetric theorem for quadrilaterals\". It is a direct consequence of the area inequality\nformula_70\nwhere \"K\" is the area of a convex quadrilateral with perimeter \"L\". Equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is a square. The dual theorem states that of all quadrilaterals with a given area, the square has the shortest perimeter.\nThe quadrilateral with given side lengths that has the maximum area is the cyclic quadrilateral.\nOf all convex quadrilaterals with given diagonals, the orthodiagonal quadrilateral has the largest area. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the area of a convex quadrilateral satisfies\nformula_71\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the angle between the diagonals \"p\" and \"q\". Equality holds if and only if \"\u03b8\" = 90\u00b0.\nIf \"P\" is an interior point in a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\", then\nformula_72\nFrom this inequality it follows that the point inside a quadrilateral that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices is the intersection of the diagonals. Hence that point is the Fermat point of a convex quadrilateral.\nRemarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral.\nThe centre of a quadrilateral can be defined in several different ways. The \"vertex centroid\" comes from considering the quadrilateral as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The \"side centroid\" comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual centre, called just centroid (centre of area) comes from considering the surface of the quadrilateral as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.\nThe \"vertex centroid\" is the intersection of the two bimedians. As with any polygon, the \"x\" and \"y\" coordinates of the vertex centroid are the arithmetic means of the \"x\" and \"y\" coordinates of the vertices.\nThe \"area centroid\" of quadrilateral \"ABCD\" can be constructed in the following way. Let \"Ga\", \"Gb\", \"Gc\", \"Gd\" be the centroids of triangles \"BCD\", \"ACD\", \"ABD\", \"ABC\" respectively. Then the \"area centroid\" is the intersection of the lines \"GaGc\" and \"GbGd\".\nIn a general convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\", there are no natural analogies to the circumcenter and orthocenter of a triangle. But two such points can be constructed in the following way. Let \"Oa\", \"Ob\", \"Oc\", \"Od\" be the circumcenters of triangles \"BCD\", \"ACD\", \"ABD\", \"ABC\" respectively; and denote by \"Ha\", \"Hb\", \"Hc\", \"Hd\" the orthocenters in the same triangles. Then the intersection of the lines \"OaOc\" and \"ObOd\" is called the quasicircumcenter, and the intersection of the lines \"HaHc\" and \"HbHd\" is called the \"quasiorthocenter\" of the convex quadrilateral. These points can be used to define an Euler line of a quadrilateral. In a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter \"H\", the \"area centroid\" \"G\", and the quasicircumcenter \"O\" are collinear in this order, and \"HG\" = 2\"GO\".\nThere can also be defined a \"quasinine-point center\" \"E\" as the intersection of the lines \"EaEc\" and \"EbEd\", where \"Ea\", \"Eb\", \"Ec\", \"Ed\" are the nine-point centers of triangles \"BCD\", \"ACD\", \"ABD\", \"ABC\" respectively. Then \"E\" is the midpoint of \"OH\".\nAnother remarkable line in a convex non-parallelogram quadrilateral is the Newton line, which connects the midpoints of the diagonals, the segment connecting these points being bisected by the vertex centroid. One more interesting line (in some sense dual to the Newton's one) is the line connecting the point of intersection of diagonals with the vertex centroid. The line is remarkable by the fact that it contains the (area) centroid. The vertex centroid divides the segment connecting the intersection of diagonals and the (area) centroid in the ratio 3:1.\nFor any quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with points \"P\" and \"Q\" the intersections of \"AD\" and \"BC\" and \"AB\" and \"CD\", respectively, the circles \"(PAB), (PCD), (QAD),\" and \"(QBC)\" pass through a common point \"M\", called a Miquel point.\nFor a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" in which \"E\" is the point of intersection of the diagonals and \"F\" is the point of intersection of the extensions of sides \"BC\" and \"AD\", let \u03c9 be a circle through \"E\" and \"F\" which meets \"CB\" internally at \"M\" and \"DA\" internally at \"N\". Let \"CA\" meet \u03c9 again at \"L\" and let \"DB\" meet \u03c9 again at \"K\". Then, applying Pascal's theorem to the hexagons \"EKNFML\" and \"EKMFNL\" inscribed in \u03c9, there holds: the straight lines \"NK\" and \"ML\" intersect at point \"P\" that is located on the side \"AB\"; the straight lines \"NL\" and \"KM\" intersect at point \"Q\" that is located on the side \"CD\". \nPoints \"P\" and \"Q\" are called \"Pascal points\" formed by circle \u03c9 on sides \"AB\" and \"CD\".\nTaxonomy.\nA hierarchical taxonomy of quadrilaterals is illustrated by the figure to the right. Lower classes are special cases of higher classes they are connected to. Note that \"trapezoid\" here is referring to the North American definition (the British equivalent is a trapezium). Inclusive definitions are used throughout.\nSkew quadrilaterals.\nA non-planar quadrilateral is called a skew quadrilateral. Formulas to compute its dihedral angles from the edge lengths and the angle between two adjacent edges were derived for work on the properties of molecules such as cyclobutane that contain a \"puckered\" ring of four atoms. Historically the term gauche quadrilateral was also used to mean a skew quadrilateral. A skew quadrilateral together with its diagonals form a (possibly non-regular) tetrahedron, and conversely every skew quadrilateral comes from a tetrahedron where a pair of opposite edges is removed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While teleportation is commonly portrayed in science fiction as a means to transfer physical objects from one location to the next, quantum teleportation only transfers quantum information. The sender does not have to know the particular quantum state being transferred. Moreover, the location of the recipient can be unknown, but to complete the quantum teleportation, classical information needs to be sent from sender to receiver. Because classical information needs to be sent, quantum teleportation cannot occur faster than the speed of light.\nOne of the first scientific articles to investigate quantum teleportation is \"Teleporting an Unknown Quantum State via Dual Classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Channels\" published by C. H. Bennett, G. Brassard, C. Cr\u00e9peau, R. Jozsa, A. Peres, and W. K. Wootters in 1993, in which they proposed using dual communication methods to send/receive quantum information. It was experimentally realized in 1997 by two research groups, led by Sandu Popescu and Anton Zeilinger, respectively.\nExperimental determinations of quantum teleportation have been made in information content\u00a0\u2013 including photons, atoms, electrons, and superconducting circuits\u00a0\u2013 as well as distance, with 1,400\u00a0km (870\u00a0mi) being the longest distance of successful teleportation by Jian-Wei Pan's team using the Micius satellite for space-based quantum teleportation.\nNon-technical summary.\nIn matters relating to quantum information theory, it is convenient to work with the simplest possible unit of information: the two-state system of the qubit. The qubit functions as the quantum analog of the classic computational part, the bit. Unlike a bit which always acts as either a 0 \"or\" a 1, a qubit can behave as a combination of both a 0 \"and\" a 1 until the computation is over. The quantum two-state system seeks to transfer quantum information from one location to another location without losing the information and preserving the quality of this information. This process involves moving the information \"between carriers\" and not movement of the \"actual carriers\", similar to the traditional process of communications, as two parties remain stationary while the information (digital media, voice, text, etc.) is being transferred, contrary to the implications of the word \"teleport\". The main components needed for teleportation include a sender, the information (a qubit), a traditional channel, a quantum channel, and a receiver. The sender does not need to know the exact contents of the information being sent. The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics\u00a0\u2013 when a measurement is made upon a quantum state, any subsequent measurements will \"collapse\" or that the observed state will be lost\u00a0\u2013 creates an imposition within teleportation: if a sender measures their information, the state could collapse when the receiver obtains the data since the state had changed from when the sender made the initial measurement and in so making it different.\nFor actual teleportation, it is required that an entangled quantum state be created for the qubit to be transferred. Entanglement imposes statistical correlations between otherwise distinct physical systems by creating or placing two or more separate particles into a single, shared quantum state. This intermediate state contains two particles whose quantum states are related to each other: measuring one particle's state provides information about the measurement of the other particle's state. These correlations hold even when measurements are chosen and performed independently, out of causal contact from one another, as verified in Bell test experiments. Thus, an observation resulting from a measurement choice made at one point in spacetime seems to instantaneously affect outcomes in another region, even though light hasn't yet had time to travel the distance, a conclusion seemingly at odds with special relativity. This is known as the EPR paradox. However, such correlations can never be used to transmit any information faster than the speed of light, a statement encapsulated in the no-communication theorem. Thus, teleportation as a whole can never be superluminal, as a qubit cannot be reconstructed until the accompanying classical information arrives.\nThe sender will combine the particle, whose information is teleported, with one of the entangled particles, causing a change of the overall entangled quantum state. Of this changed state, the particles in the receiver's possession are then sent to an analyzer that will measure the change of the entangled state. The \"change\" measurement will allow the receiver to recreate the original information that the sender had, resulting in the information being teleported or carried between two people that have different locations. Since the initial quantum information is \"destroyed\" as it becomes part of the entangled state, the no-cloning theorem is maintained as the information is recreated from the entangled state and not copied during teleportation.\nThe quantum channel is the communication mechanism that is used for all quantum information transmission and is the channel used for teleportation (relationship of quantum channel to traditional communication channel is akin to the qubit being the quantum analog of the classical bit). However, in addition to the quantum channel, a traditional channel must also be used to accompany a qubit to \"preserve\" the quantum information. When the change measurement between the original qubit and the entangled particle is made, the measurement result must be carried by a traditional channel so that the quantum information can be reconstructed and the receiver can get the original information. Because of this need for the traditional channel, the speed of teleportation can be no faster than the speed of light (hence the no-communication theorem is not violated). The main advantage with this is that Bell states can be shared using photons from lasers, making teleportation achievable through open space, as there is no need to send information through physical cables or optical fibers.\nQuantum states can be encoded in various degrees of freedom of atoms. For example, qubits can be encoded in the degrees of freedom of electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus or in the degrees of freedom of the nucleus itself. Thus, performing this kind of teleportation requires a stock of atoms at the receiving site, available for having qubits imprinted on them.\nAs of 2015,[ [update]] the quantum states of single photons, photon modes, single atoms, atomic ensembles, defect centers in solids, single electrons, and superconducting circuits have been employed as information bearers.\nUnderstanding quantum teleportation requires a good grounding in finite-dimensional linear algebra, Hilbert spaces and projection matrices. A qubit is described using a two-dimensional complex number-valued vector space (a Hilbert space), which are the primary basis for the formal manipulations given below. A working knowledge of quantum mechanics is not absolutely required to understand the mathematics of quantum teleportation, although without such acquaintance, the deeper meaning of the equations may remain quite mysterious.\nProtocol.\nThe resources required for quantum teleportation are a communication channel capable of transmitting two classical bits, a means of generating an entangled Bell state of qubits and distributing to two different locations, performing a Bell measurement on one of the Bell state qubits, and manipulating the quantum state of the other qubit from the pair. Of course, there must also be some input qubit (in the quantum state formula_1) to be teleported. The protocol is then as follows:\nIt is worth noticing that the above protocol assumes that the qubits are individually addressable, meaning that the qubits are distinguishable and physically labeled. However, there can be situations where two identical qubits are indistinguishable due to the spatial overlap of their wave functions. Under this condition, the qubits cannot be individually controlled or measured. Nevertheless, a teleportation protocol analogous to that described above can still be (conditionally) implemented by exploiting two independently prepared qubits, with no need of an initial Bell state. This can be made by addressing the internal degrees of freedom of the qubits (e.g., spins or polarisations) by spatially localized measurements performed in separated regions A and B where the two spatially overlapping, indistinguishable qubits can be found. This theoretical prediction has been then verified experimentally via polarized photons in a quantum optical setup.\nExperimental results and records.\nWork in 1998 verified the initial predictions, and the distance of teleportation was increased in August 2004 to 600 meters, using optical fiber. Subsequently, the record distance for quantum teleportation has been gradually increased to , then to , and is now , set in open air experiments in the Canary Islands, done between the two astronomical observatories of the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias. There has been a recent record set (as of September\u00a02015[ [update]]) using superconducting nanowire detectors that reached the distance of over optical fiber. For material systems, the record distance is .\nA variant of teleportation called \"open-destination\" teleportation, with receivers located at multiple locations, was demonstrated in 2004 using five-photon entanglement. Teleportation of a composite state of two single qubits has also been realized. In April 2011, experimenters reported that they had demonstrated teleportation of wave packets of light up to a bandwidth of 10\u00a0MHz while preserving strongly nonclassical superposition states. In August 2013, the achievement of \"fully deterministic\" quantum teleportation, using a hybrid technique, was reported. On 29 May 2014, scientists announced a reliable way of transferring data by quantum teleportation. Quantum teleportation of data had been done before but with highly unreliable methods. On 26 February 2015, scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, led by Chao-yang Lu and Jian-Wei Pan carried out the first experiment teleporting multiple degrees of freedom of a quantum particle. They managed to teleport the quantum information from ensemble of rubidium atoms to another ensemble of rubidium atoms over a distance of using entangled photons. In 2016, researchers demonstrated quantum teleportation with two independent sources which are separated by in Hefei optical fiber network. In September 2016, researchers at the University of Calgary demonstrated quantum teleportation over the Calgary metropolitan fiber network over a distance of . In December 2020, as part of the INQNET collaboration, researchers achieved quantum teleportation over a total distance of 44\u00a0km (27.3\u00a0mi) with fidelities exceeding 90%.\nResearchers have also successfully used quantum teleportation to transmit information between clouds of gas atoms, notable because the clouds of gas are macroscopic atomic ensembles.\nIt is also possible to teleport \"logical operations\", see quantum gate teleportation. In 2018, physicists at Yale demonstrated a deterministic teleported CNOT operation between logically encoded qubits.\nFirst proposed theoretically in 1993, quantum teleportation has since been demonstrated in many different guises. It has been carried out using two-level states of a single photon, a single atom and a trapped ion \u2013 among other quantum objects \u2013 and also using two photons. In 1997, two groups experimentally achieved quantum teleportation. The first group, led by Sandu Popescu, was based in Italy. An experimental group led by Anton Zeilinger followed a few months later.\nThe results obtained from experiments done by Popescu's group concluded that classical channels alone could not replicate the teleportation of linearly polarized state and an elliptically polarized state. The Bell state measurement distinguished between the four Bell states, which can allow for a 100% success rate of teleportation, in an ideal representation.\nZeilinger's group produced a pair of entangled photons by implementing the process of parametric down-conversion. In order to ensure that the two photons cannot be distinguished by their arrival times, the photons were generated using a pulsed pump beam. The photons were then sent through narrow-bandwidth filters to produce a coherence time that is much longer than the length of the pump pulse. They then used a two-photon interferometry for analyzing the entanglement so that the quantum property could be recognized when it is transferred from one photon to the other.\nPhoton 1 was polarized at 45\u00b0 in the first experiment conducted by Zeilinger's group. Quantum teleportation is verified when both photons are detected in the formula_5 state, which has a probability of 25%. Two detectors, f1 and f2, are placed behind the beam splitter, and recording the coincidence will identify the formula_5 state. If there is a coincidence between detectors f1 and f2, then photon 3 is predicted to be polarized at a 45\u00b0 angle. Photon 3 is passed through a polarizing beam splitter that selects +45\u00b0 and \u221245\u00b0 polarization. If quantum teleportation has happened, only detector d2, which is at the +45\u00b0 output, will register a detection. Detector d1, located at the \u221245\u00b0 output, will not detect a photon. If there is a coincidence between d2f1f2, with the 45\u00b0 analysis, and a lack of a d1f1f2 coincidence, with \u221245\u00b0 analysis, it is proof that the information from the polarized photon 1 has been teleported to photon 3 using quantum teleportation.\nQuantum teleportation over 143 km.\nZeilinger's group developed an experiment using active feed-forward in real time and two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, a distance of over 143 kilometers. The results were published in 2012. In order to achieve teleportation, a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement assisted clock synchronization were implemented. The two locations were entangled to share the auxiliary state:\nformula_7\nLa Palma and Tenerife can be compared to the quantum characters Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob share the entangled state above, with photon 2 being with Alice and photon 3 being with Bob. A third party, Charlie, provides photon 1 (the input photon) which will be teleported to Alice in the generalized polarization state:\nformula_8\nwhere the complex numbers formula_9 and formula_10 are unknown to Alice or Bob.\nAlice will perform a Bell-state measurement (BSM) that randomly projects the two photons onto one of the four Bell states with each one having a probability of 25%. Photon 3 will be projected onto formula_11, the input state. Alice transmits the outcome of the BSM to Bob, via the classical channel, where Bob is able to apply the corresponding unitary operation to obtain photon 3 in the initial state of photon 1. Bob will not have to do anything if he detects the formula_12 state. Bob will need to apply a formula_13 phase shift to photon 3 between the horizontal and vertical component if the formula_14 state is detected.\nThe results of Zeilinger's group concluded that the average fidelity (overlap of the ideal teleported state with the measured density matrix) was 0.863 with a standard deviation of 0.038. The link attenuation during their experiments varied between 28.1\u00a0dB and 39.0\u00a0dB, which was a result of strong winds and rapid temperature changes. Despite the high loss in the quantum free-space channel, the average fidelity surpassed the classical limit of 2/3. Therefore, Zeilinger's group successfully demonstrated quantum teleportation over a distance of 143\u00a0km.\nQuantum teleportation across the Danube River.\nIn 2004, a quantum teleportation experiment was conducted across the Danube River in Vienna, a total of 600 meters. An 800-meter-long optical fiber wire was installed in a public sewer system underneath the Danube River, and it was exposed to temperature changes and other environmental influences. Alice must perform a joint Bell state measurement (BSM) on photon b, the input photon, and photon c, her part of the entangled photon pair (photons c and d). Photon d, Bob's receiver photon, will contain all of the information on the input photon b, except for a phase rotation that depends on the state that Alice observed. This experiment implemented an active feed-forward system that sends Alice's measurement results via a classical microwave channel with a fast electro-optical modulator in order to exactly replicate Alice's input photon. The teleportation fidelity obtained from the linear polarization state at 45\u00b0 varied between 0.84 and 0.90, which is well above the classical fidelity limit of 0.66.\nDeterministic quantum teleportation with atoms.\nThree qubits are required for this process: the source qubit from the sender, the ancillary qubit, and the receiver's target qubit, which is maximally entangled with the ancillary qubit. For this experiment, &lt;chem&gt;^{40}Ca+&lt;/chem&gt; ions were used as the qubits. Ions 2 and 3 are prepared in the Bell state formula_15. The state of ion 1 is prepared arbitrarily. The quantum states of ions 1 and 2 are measured by illuminating them with light at a specific wavelength. The obtained fidelities for this experiment ranged between 73% and 76%. This is larger than the maximum possible average fidelity of 66.7% that can be obtained using completely classical resources.\nGround-to-satellite quantum teleportation.\nThe quantum state being teleported in this experiment is formula_16, where formula_9 and formula_10 are unknown complex numbers, formula_19 represents the horizontal polarization state, and formula_20 represents the vertical polarization state. The qubit prepared in this state is generated in a laboratory in Ngari, Tibet. The goal was to teleport the quantum information of the qubit to the Micius satellite that was launched on August 16, 2016, at an altitude of around 500\u00a0km. When a Bell state measurement is conducted on photons 1 and 2 and the resulting state is formula_21, photon 3 carries this desired state. If the Bell state detected is formula_22, then a phase shift of formula_13 is applied to the state to get the desired quantum state. The distance between the ground station and the satellite changes from as little as 500\u00a0km to as large as 1,400\u00a0km. Because of the changing distance, the channel loss of the uplink varies between 41\u00a0dB and 52\u00a0dB. The average fidelity obtained from this experiment was 0.80 with a standard deviation of 0.01. Therefore, this experiment successfully established a ground-to-satellite uplink over a distance of 500\u20131,400\u00a0km using quantum teleportation. This is an essential step towards creating a global-scale quantum internet.\nQuantum teleportation over internet cables.\nQuantum teleportation has been demonstrated over fiber optic cables simultaneously carrying regular telecommunications traffic. This eliminates the need for separate, dedicated infrastructure for quantum networking and shows that quantum teleportation and classical communications can coexist on the same fiber optic cables. A less crowded wavelength of light was used for the quantum signal and special filters were required to reduce noise from other traffic.\nQuantum teleportation with nonlinear sum frequency generation.\nIn April 2025, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign achieved quantum teleportation with 94% fidelity using a nanophotonic indium-gallium-phosphide platform to perform nonlinear sum frequency generation (SFG). This method mitigated multiphoton noise and boosted teleportation efficiency by a factor of 10,000 compared to prior SFG-based systems.\nFormal presentation.\nThere are a variety of ways in which the teleportation protocol can be written mathematically. Some are very compact but abstract, and some are verbose but straightforward and concrete. The presentation below is of the latter form: verbose, but has the benefit of showing each quantum state simply and directly. Later sections review more compact notations.\nThe teleportation protocol begins with a quantum state or qubit formula_24, in Alice's possession, that she wants to convey to Bob. This qubit can be written generally, in bra\u2013ket notation, as:\nformula_25\nThe subscript \"C\" above is used only to distinguish this state from \"A\" and \"B\", below.\nNext, the protocol requires that Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state. This state is fixed in advance, by mutual agreement between Alice and Bob, and can be any one of the four Bell states shown. It does not matter which one.\nformula_26,\nformula_27,\nformula_28.\nformula_29,\nIn the following, assume that Alice and Bob share the state formula_30\nAlice obtains one of the particles in the pair, with the other going to Bob. (This is implemented by preparing the particles together and shooting them to Alice and Bob from a common source.) The subscripts \"A\" and \"B\" in the entangled state refer to Alice's or Bob's particle.\nAt this point, Alice has two particles (\"C\", the one she wants to teleport, and \"A\", one of the entangled pair), and Bob has one particle, \"B\". In the total system, the state of these three particles is given by\nformula_31\nAlice will then make a local measurement in the Bell basis (i.e. the four Bell states) on the two particles in her possession. To make the result of her measurement clear, it is best to write the state of Alice's two qubits as superpositions of the Bell basis. This is done by using the following general identities, which are easily verified:\nformula_32\nformula_33\nformula_34\nand\nformula_35\nAfter expanding the expression for formula_36, one applies these identities to the qubits with \"A\" and \"C\" subscripts. In particular,formula_37and the other terms follow similarly. Combining similar terms, the total three particle state of \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" together becomes the following four-term superposition:\n formula_38\nNote that all three particles are still in the same total state since no operations have been performed. Rather, the above is just a change of basis on Alice's part of the system. This change has moved the entanglement from particles A and B to particles C and A. The actual teleportation occurs when Alice measures her two qubits (C and A) in the Bell basis\nformula_39\nEquivalently, the measurement may be done in the computational basis, formula_40, by mapping each Bell state uniquely to one of formula_41 with the quantum circuit in the figure to the right.\nThe result of Alice's (local) measurement is a collection of two classical bits (00, 01, 10 or 11) related to one of the following four states (with equal probability of 1/4), after the three-particle state has collapsed into one of the states:\nAlice's two particles are now entangled to each other, in one of the four Bell states, and the entanglement originally shared between Alice's and Bob's particles is now broken. Bob's particle takes on one of the four superposition states shown above. Note how Bob's qubit is now in a state that resembles the state to be teleported. The four possible states for Bob's qubit are unitary images of the state to be teleported.\nThe result of Alice's Bell measurement tells her which of the above four states the system is in. She can now send her result to Bob through a classical channel. Two classical bits can communicate which of the four results she obtained. After Bob receives the message from Alice, he will know which of the four states his particle is in. Using this information, he performs a unitary operation on his particle to transform it to the desired state formula_46:\nformula_49\nto recover the state.\nformula_51\nto his qubit.\nformula_52\nTeleportation is thus achieved. The above-mentioned three gates correspond to rotations of \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0) about appropriate axes (X, Y and Z) in the Bloch sphere picture of a qubit.\nSome remarks:\nCertifying quantum teleportation.\nWhen implementing the quantum teleportation protocol, different experimental noises may arise affecting the state transference. The usual way to benchmark a particular teleportation procedure is by using the average fidelity: Given an arbitrary teleportation protocol producing output states formula_54 with probability formula_55 for an initial state formula_56, the average fidelity is defined as:\nformula_57\nwhere the integration is performed over the Haar measure defined by assuming maximal uncertainty over the initial quantum states formula_58, and formula_59 is the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. \nThe widely known classical threshold is obtained by optimizing the average fidelity over all classical protocols (i.e. when the sender Alice and the receiver Bob can use just a classical channel to communicate with each other). When teleportation involves qubit states, the maximal classical average fidelity is formula_60. In this way, a particular protocol with average fidelity formula_61 is certified as \"useful\" if formula_62.\nHowever, using the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity as the \"unique\" distance measure for benchmarking teleportation is not justified, and one may choose different distinguishability measures. For example, there may exist reasons depending on the context in which other measures might be more suitable than fidelity. In this way, the average distance of teleportation is defined as:\nformula_63\nbeing formula_64 a well-behaved (i.e. satisfying identity of indiscernibles and unitary invariance) distinguishability measure between quantum states. Consequently, different classical thresholds exist, depending on the considered distance measure (classical thresholds for Trace distance, quantum Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence, transmission distance, Bures distance, wootters distance, and quantum Hellinger distance, among others, were obtained in Ref.). This points out a particular issue when certifying quantum teleportation: Given a teleportation protocol, its certification is not a universal fact in the sense that depends on the distance used. Then, a particular protocol might be certified as useful for a set of distance quantifiers, and non-useful for other distinguishability measures. \nAlternative notations.\nThere are a variety of different notations in use that describe the teleportation protocol. One common one is by using the notation of quantum gates.\nIn the above derivation, the unitary transformation that is the change of basis (from the standard product basis into the Bell basis) can be written using quantum gates. Direct calculation shows that this gate is given by\nformula_65\nwhere \"H\" is the one qubit Walsh-Hadamard gate and formula_66 is the Controlled NOT gate.\nEntanglement swapping.\nTeleportation can be applied not just to pure states, but also mixed states, that can be regarded as the state of a single subsystem of an entangled pair. The so-called entanglement swapping is a simple and illustrative example.\nIf Alice and Bob share an entangled pair, and Bob teleports his particle to Carol, then Alice's particle is now entangled with Carol's particle. This situation can also be viewed symmetrically as follows:\nAlice and Bob share an entangled pair, and Bob and Carol share a different entangled pair. Now let Bob perform a projective measurement on his two particles in the Bell basis and communicate the result to Carol. These actions are precisely the teleportation protocol described above with Bob's first particle, the one entangled with Alice's particle, as the state to be teleported. When Carol finishes the protocol she now has a particle with the teleported state, that is an entangled state with Alice's particle. Thus, although Alice and Carol never interacted with each other, their particles are now entangled.\nA detailed diagrammatic derivation of entanglement swapping has been given by Bob Coecke, presented in terms of categorical quantum mechanics.\nAlgorithm for swapping Bell pairs.\nAn important application of entanglement swapping is distributing Bell states for use in entanglement distributed quantum networks. A technical description of the entanglement swapping protocol is given here for pure Bell states.\nGeneralizations of the teleportation protocol.\nThe basic teleportation protocol for a qubit described above has been generalized in several directions, in particular regarding the dimension of the system teleported and the number of parties involved (either as sender, controller, or receiver).\n\"d\"-dimensional systems.\nA generalization to formula_79-level systems (so-called qudits) is straight forward and was already discussed in the original paper by Bennett \"et al.\": the maximally entangled state of two qubits has to be replaced by a maximally entangled state of two qudits and the Bell measurement by a measurement defined by a maximally entangled orthonormal basis. All possible such generalizations were discussed by Werner in 2001.\nThe generalization to infinite-dimensional so-called continuous-variable systems was proposed by Braunstein and Kimble and led to the first teleportation experiment that worked unconditionally.\nMultipartite versions.\nThe use of multipartite entangled states instead of a bipartite maximally entangled state allows for several new features: either the sender can teleport information to several receivers either sending the same state to all of them (which allows to reduce the amount of entanglement needed for the process) or teleporting multipartite states or sending a single state in such a way that the receiving parties need to cooperate to extract the information. A different way of viewing the latter setting is that some of the parties can control whether the others can teleport.\nLogic gate teleportation.\nIn general, mixed states \u03c1 may be transported, and a linear transformation \u03c9 applied during teleportation, thus allowing data processing of quantum information. This is one of the foundational building blocks of quantum information processing. This is demonstrated below.\nGeneral description.\nA general teleportation scheme can be described as follows. Three quantum systems are involved. System 1 is the (unknown) state \"\u03c1\" to be teleported by Alice. Systems 2 and 3 are in a maximally entangled state \"\u03c9\" that are distributed to Alice and Bob, respectively. The total system is then in the state\nformula_80\nA successful teleportation process is a LOCC quantum channel \u03a6 that satisfies\nformula_81\nwhere Tr12 is the partial trace operation with respect systems 1 and 2, and formula_82 denotes the composition of maps. This describes the channel in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture.\nTaking adjoint maps in the Heisenberg picture, the success condition becomes\nformula_83\nfor all observable \"O\" on Bob's system. The tensor factor in formula_84 is formula_85 while that of formula_86 is formula_87.\nFurther details.\nThe proposed channel \u03a6 can be described more explicitly. To begin teleportation, Alice performs a local measurement on the two subsystems (1 and 2) in her possession. Assume the local measurement have \"effects\"\nformula_88\nIf the measurement registers the \"i\"-th outcome, the overall state collapses to\nformula_89\nThe tensor factor in formula_90 is formula_85 while that of formula_86 is formula_87. Bob then applies a corresponding local operation \u03a8\"i\" on system 3. On the combined system, this is described by\nformula_94\nwhere \"Id\" is the identity map on the composite system formula_95.\nTherefore, the channel \u03a6 is defined by\nformula_96\nNotice \u03a6 satisfies the definition of LOCC. As stated above, the teleportation is said to be successful if, for all observable \"O\" on Bob's system, the equality\nformula_97\nholds. The left hand side of the equation is:\nformula_98\nformula_99\nwhere \u03a8\"i*\" is the adjoint of \u03a8\"i\" in the Heisenberg picture. Assuming all objects are finite dimensional, this becomes\nformula_100\nThe success criterion for teleportation has the expression\nformula_101\nLocal explanation of the phenomenon.\nA local explanation of quantum teleportation is put forward by David Deutsch and Patrick Hayden, with respect to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Their paper asserts that the two bits that Alice sends Bob contain \"locally inaccessible information\" resulting in the teleportation of the quantum state. \"The ability of quantum information to flow through a classical channel [...], surviving decoherence, is [...] the basis of quantum teleportation.\"\nRecent developments.\nWhile quantum teleportation is in an infancy stage, there are many aspects pertaining to teleportation that scientists are working to better understand or improve the process that include:\nHigher dimensions.\nQuantum teleportation can improve the errors associated with fault tolerant quantum computation via an arrangement of logic gates. Experiments by D. Gottesman and I. L. Chuang have determined that a \"Clifford hierarchy\" gate arrangement which acts to enhance protection against environmental errors. Overall, a higher threshold of error is allowed with the Clifford hierarchy as the sequence of gates requires less resources that are needed for computation. While the more gates that are used in a quantum computer create more noise, the gates arrangement and use of teleportation in logic transfer can reduce this noise as it calls for less \"traffic\" that is compiled in these quantum networks. The more qubits used for a quantum computer, the more levels are added to a gate arrangement, with the diagonalization of gate arrangement varying in degree. Higher dimension analysis involves the higher level gate arrangement of the Clifford hierarchy.\nInformation quality.\nConsidering the previously mentioned requirement of an intermediate entangled state for quantum teleportation, there needs to be consideration of the purity of this state for information quality. A protection that has been developed involves the use of continuous variable information (rather than a typical discrete variable) creating a superimposed coherent intermediate state. This involves making a phase shift in the received information and then adding a mixing step upon reception using a preferred state, which could be an odd or even coherent state, that will be \"conditioned to the classical information of the sender\", creating a two mode state that contains the originally sent information.\nThere have also been developments with teleporting information between systems that already have quantum information in them. Experiments done by Feng, Xu, Zhou et al. have demonstrated that teleportation of a qubit to a photon that already has a qubit's worth of information is possible due to using an optical qubit-ququart entangling gate. This quality can increase computation possibilities as calculations can be done based on previously stored information, allowing for improvements on past calculations.\nReferences.\nSpecific.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two spin states (left-handed and the right-handed circular polarization) can also be measured as horizontal and vertical linear polarization. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of multiple states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.\nEtymology.\nThe coining of the term \"qubit\" is attributed to Benjamin Schumacher. In the acknowledgments of his 1995 paper, Schumacher states that the term \"qubit\" was created in jest during a conversation with William Wootters.\nComparison with classical bits.\nA binary digit, characterized as 0 or 1, is used to represent information in classical computers. When averaged over both of its states (0,1), a binary digit can represent up to one bit of information content, where a bit is the basic unit of information. However, in this article, the word bit is synonymous with a binary digit.\nIn classical computer technologies, a \"processed\" bit is implemented by one of two levels of low direct current voltage, and whilst switching from one of these two levels to the other, a so-called \"forbidden zone\" between two logic levels must be passed as fast as possible, inasmuch as electrical voltage cannot change amplitude instantaneously. \nThere are two possible outcomes for the measurement of a qubit, usually taken to have the values \"0\" and \"1\", like a bit. However, whereas the state of a bit can only be binary (either 0 or 1), the general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can be an arbitrary coherent superposition of \"all\" computable states simultaneously. Moreover, whereas a measurement of a classical bit would not disturb its state, a measurement of a qubit would destroy its coherence and irrevocably disturb the superposition state. It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit. However, a qubit can hold more information, e.g., up to two bits using superdense coding.\nA bit is always completely in either one of its two states, and a set of n bits (e.g. a processor register or some bit array) can only hold a single of its 2n possible states at any time. A quantum state can be in a superposition state, which means that the qubit can have non-zero probability amplitude in both its states simultaneously (popularly expressed as \"it can be in both states simultaneously\"). A qubit requires two complex numbers to describe its two probability amplitudes, and these two complex numbers can together be viewed as a 2-dimensional complex vector, which is called a \"quantum state vector\", or \"superposition state vector.\" Alternatively and equivalently, the value stored in a qubit can be described as a single point in a 2-dimensional complex coordinate space.\nFurthermore, a set of n bits can be represented by n binary digits, simply by concatenating the representations of each of the bits, whereas a set of n qubits, which is also called a register, requires 2n complex numbers to describe its superposition state vector.\nStandard representation.\nIn quantum mechanics, the general quantum state of a qubit can be represented by a linear superposition of its two orthonormal basis states (or basis vectors). These vectors are usually denoted as formula_1 and formula_2. They are written in the conventional Dirac\u2014or \"bra\u2013ket\"\u2014notation; the formula_3 and formula_4 are pronounced \"ket 0\" and \"ket 1\", respectively. These two orthonormal basis states, &lt;math&gt;\\\nQubit storage.\nIn 2008 a team of scientists from the U.K. and U.S. reported the first relatively long (1.75 seconds) and coherent transfer of a superposition state in an electron spin \"processing\" qubit to a nuclear spin \"memory\" qubit. This event can be considered the first relatively consistent quantum data storage, a vital step towards the development of quantum computing. In 2013, a modification of similar systems (using charged rather than neutral donors) has dramatically extended this time, to 3 hours at very low temperatures and 39 minutes at room temperature. Room temperature preparation of a qubit based on electron spins instead of nuclear spin was also demonstrated by a team of scientists from Switzerland and Australia. An increased coherence of qubits is being explored by researchers who are testing the limitations of a Ge hole spin-orbit qubit structure.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Derived from a common ancestral \"Proto-Quechua\" language, it is the most widely spoken pre-Columbian language family of the Americas, with an estimated 8\u201310 million speakers in 2004, and just under 7 million from the most recent census data available up to 2011. Approximately 13.9% (3.7 million) of Peruvians speak a Quechua language.\nAlthough Quechua began expanding many centuries before the Incas, that previous expansion also meant that it was the primary language family within the Inca Empire. The Spanish tolerated its use until the Peruvian struggle for independence in the 1780s. As a result, various Quechua languages are still widely spoken, being the majority language in a number of regions of Peru, the most-spoken or co-official language in many others, and, as the \"Kichwa\" language, the second most-spoken language of Ecuador, after Spanish.\nHistory.\nThe Quechua linguistic homeland may have been Central Peru. It has been speculated that it may have been used in the Chav\u00edn and Wari civilizations. \nQuechua had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the Inca Empire. The Inca were one among many peoples in present-day Peru who already spoke a form of Quechua, which in the Cuzco region particularly has been heavily influenced by Aymara, hence some of the characteristics that still distinguish the Cuzco form of Quechua today. Diverse Quechua regional dialects and languages had already developed in different areas, influenced by local languages, before the Inca Empire expanded and further promoted Quechua as the official language of the Empire.\nAfter the Spanish conquest of Peru in the 16th century, Quechua continued to be used widely by the indigenous peoples as the \"common language\". It was officially recognized by the Spanish administration, and many Spaniards learned it in order to communicate with local peoples. The clergy of the Catholic Church adopted Quechua to use as the language of evangelization. The oldest written records of the language are by missionary Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s, who arrived in Peru in 1538 and learned the language from 1540. He published his \"Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Per\u00fa\" (Grammar or Art of the General Language of the Indians of the Kingdoms of Peru) in 1560. Given its use by the Catholic missionaries, the range of Quechua continued to expand in some areas.\nIn the late 18th century, colonial officials ended the administrative and religious use of Quechua. They banned it from public use in Peru after the T\u00fapac Amaru II rebellion of indigenous peoples. The Crown banned \"loyal\" pro-Catholic texts in Quechua, such as Garcilaso de la Vega's \"Comentarios Reales.\"\nDespite a brief revival of the language immediately after the Latin American nations achieved independence in the 19th century, the prestige of Quechua had decreased sharply. Gradually its use declined so that it was spoken mostly by indigenous people in the more isolated and conservative rural areas. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, Quechua language speakers number roughly 7 million people across South America, more than any other indigenous language family in the Americas.\nAs a result of Inca expansion into Central Chile, there were bilingual Quechua-Mapudungu Mapuche in Central Chile at the time of the Spanish arrival. It has been argued that Mapuche, Quechua, and Spanish coexisted in Central Chile, with significant bilingualism, during the 17th century. Alongside Mapudungun, Quechua is the indigenous language that has influenced Chilean Spanish the most.\nQuechua-Aymara and mixed Quechua-Aymara-Mapudungu toponymy can be found as far south as Osorno Province in Chile (latitude 41\u00b0 S).\nIn 2017 the first thesis defense done in Quechua in Europe was done by Peruvian at Pablo de Olavide University (Sevilla). The same year Pablo Landeo wrote the first novel in Quechua without a Spanish translation. A Peruvian student, of the University of San Marcos, completed and defended the first thesis in the language group in 2019; it concerned the works of poet and it was also the first non-Spanish native language thesis done at that university.\nCurrently, there are different initiatives that promote Quechua in the Andes and across the world: many universities offer Quechua classes, a community-based organization such as Elva Amb\u00eda's Quechua Collective of New York promote the language, and governments are training interpreters in Quechua to serve in healthcare, justice, and bureaucratic facilities.\nCurrent status.\nIn 1975, Peru became the first country to recognize Quechua as one of its official languages. Ecuador conferred official status on the language in its 2006 constitution, and in 2009, Bolivia adopted a new constitution that recognized Quechua and several other indigenous languages as official languages of the country.\nThe major obstacle to the usage and teaching of Quechua languages is the lack of written materials, such as books, newspapers, software, and magazines. The Bible has been translated into Quechua and is distributed by certain missionary groups. Quechua, along with Aymara and minor indigenous languages, remains essentially a spoken language.\nIn recent years, Quechua has been introduced in intercultural bilingual education (IBE) in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Even in these areas, the governments are reaching only a part of the Quechua-speaking populations. Some indigenous people in each of the countries are having their children study in Spanish for social advancement.\nRadio Nacional del Per\u00fa broadcasts news and agrarian programs in Quechua for periods in the mornings.\nQuechua and Spanish are now heavily intermixed in much of the Andean region, with many hundreds of Spanish loanwords in Quechua. Similarly, Quechua phrases and words are commonly used by Spanish speakers. In southern rural Bolivia, for instance, many Quechua words such as \"wawa\" (infant), \"misi\" (cat), \"waska\" (strap or thrashing), are as commonly used as their Spanish counterparts, even in entirely Spanish-speaking areas. Quechua has also had a significant influence on other native languages of the Americas, such as Mapuche.\nNumber of speakers.\nIt is difficult to measure the number of Quechua speakers. The number of speakers given varies widely according to the sources. The total in \"Ethnologue\" 16 is 10 million, primarily based on figures published 1987\u20132002, but with a few dating from the 1960s. The figure for Imbabura Highland Quechua in \"Ethnologue\", for example, is 300,000, an estimate from 1977.\nThe missionary organization FEDEPI, on the other hand, estimated one million Imbabura dialect speakers (published 2006). Census figures are also problematic, due to under-reporting. The 2001 Ecuador census reports only 500,000 Quechua speakers, compared to the estimate in most linguistic sources of more than 2 million. The censuses of Peru (2007) and Bolivia (2001) are thought to be more reliable.\nAdditionally, there is an unknown number of speakers in emigrant communities.\nClassification.\nThere are significant differences among the varieties of Quechua spoken in the central Peruvian highlands and the peripheral varieties of Ecuador, as well as those of southern Peru and Bolivia. They can be labeled Quechua I (or Quechua B, central) and Quechua II (or Quechua A, peripheral). Within the two groups, there are few sharp boundaries, making them dialect continua.\nHowever, there is a secondary division in Quechua II between the grammatically simplified northern varieties of Ecuador, Quechua II-B, known there as Kichwa, and the generally more conservative varieties of the southern highlands, Quechua II-C, which include the old Inca capital of Cusco. The closeness is at least in part because of the influence of Cusco Quechua on the Ecuadorean varieties in the Inca Empire. Because Northern nobles were required to educate their children in Cusco, this was maintained as the prestige dialect in the north.\nSpeakers from different points within any of the three regions can generally understand one another reasonably well. There are nonetheless significant local-level differences across each. (Wanka Quechua, in particular, has several very distinctive characteristics that make the variety more challenging to understand, even for other Central Quechua speakers.) Speakers from different major regions, particularly Central or Southern Quechua, are not able to communicate effectively.\nThe lack of mutual intelligibility among the dialects is the basic criterion that defines Quechua not as a single language, but as a language family. The complex and progressive nature of how speech varies across the dialect continua makes it nearly impossible to differentiate discrete varieties; \"Ethnologue\" lists 45 varieties which are then divided into two groups; Central and Peripheral. Due to the non-intelligibility between the two groups, they are all classified as separate languages.\nAs a reference point, the overall degree of diversity across the family is a little less than that of the Romance or Germanic families, and more of the order of Slavic or Arabic. The greatest diversity is within Central Quechua, or Quechua I, which is believed to lie close to the homeland of the ancestral Proto-Quechua language.\nFamily tree.\nAlfredo Torero devised the traditional classification, the three divisions above, plus a fourth, a northern or Peruvian branch. The latter causes complications in the classification, however, as various dialects (e.g. Cajamarca\u2013Ca\u00f1aris, Pacaraos, and Yauyos) have features of both Quechua I and Quechua II, and so are difficult to assign to either.\nTorero classifies them as the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWillem Adelaar adheres to the Quechua I / Quechua II (central/peripheral) bifurcation. But, partially following later modifications by Torero, he reassigns part of Quechua II-A to Quechua I:\nLanderman (1991) does not believe a true genetic classification is possible and divides Quechua II so that the family has four geographical\u2013typological branches: Northern, North Peruvian, Central, and Southern. He includes Chachapoyas and Lamas in North Peruvian Quechua so Ecuadorian is synonymous with Northern Quechua.\nGeographical distribution.\nQuechua I (Central Quechua, \"Waywash\") is spoken in Peru's central highlands, from the Ancash Region to Huancayo. It is the most diverse branch of Quechua, to the extent that its divisions are commonly considered different languages.\nQuechua II (Peripheral Quechua, \"Wamp'una\" \"Traveler\")\nCognates.\nThis is a sampling of words in several Quechuan languages:\nQuechua and Aymara.\nQuechua shares a large amount of vocabulary, and some striking structural parallels, with Aymara, and the two families have sometimes been grouped together as a \"Quechumaran family\". This hypothesis is generally rejected by specialists, however. The parallels are better explained by mutual influence and borrowing through intensive and long-term contact. Many Quechua\u2013Aymara cognates are close, often closer than intra-Quechua cognates, and there is a little relationship in the affixal system. The Puquina language of the Tiwanaku Empire is a possible source for some of the shared vocabulary between Quechua and Aymara.\nLanguage contact.\nJolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Kunza, Leko, Mapudungun, Mochika, Uru-Chipaya, Zaparo, Arawak, Kandoshi, Muniche, Pukina, Pano, Barbakoa, Cholon-Hibito, Jaqi, Jivaro, and Kawapana language families due to contact.\nVocabulary.\nQuechua has borrowed a large number of Spanish words, such as (from , \"but\"), (from , \"good\"), (from , \"school\"), (from , \"cow\") and (from , \"donkey\").\nA number of Quechua words have entered English and French via Spanish, including \"coca\", \"condor\", \"guano\", \"jerky\", \"llama\", \"pampa\", \"poncho\", \"puma\", \"quinine\", \"quinoa\", \"vicu\u00f1a\" ( in French), and, possibly, \"gaucho\". The word \"lagniappe\" comes from the Quechuan word \"to increase, to add\". The word first came into Spanish then Louisiana French, with the French or Spanish article \"la\" in front of it, \"la \u00f1apa\" in Louisiana French or Creole, or in Spanish. A rare instance of a Quechua word being taken into general Spanish use is given by \"carpa\" for \"tent\" (Quechua ).\nThe Quechua influence on Latin American Spanish includes such borrowings as \"papa\" \"potato\", \"chuchaqui\" \"hangover\" in Ecuador, and diverse borrowings for \"altitude sickness\": \"suruqch'i\" in Bolivia, \"sorojchi\" in Ecuador, and \"soroche\" in Peru.\nIn Bolivia, particularly, Quechua words are used extensively even by non-Quechua speakers. These include \"wawa\" \"baby, infant\", \"ch\u02bcaki\" \"hangover\", \"misi\" \"cat\", \"juk\u02bcucho\" \"mouse\", \"q\u02bcumer uchu\" \"green pepper\", \"jaku\" \"let's go\", \"chhiri\" and \"chhurco\" \"curly haired\", among many others. Quechua grammar also enters Bolivian Spanish, such as the use of the suffix \"-ri\". In Bolivian Quechua, \"-ri\" is added to verbs to signify an action is performed with affection or, in the imperative, as a rough equivalent to \"please\". In Bolivia, \"-ri\" is often included in the Spanish imperative to imply \"please\" or to soften commands. For example, the standard \"p\u00e1same\" \"pass me [something]\" becomes \"pasarime\".\nEtymology of Quechua.\nAt first, Spaniards referred to the language of the Inca empire as the \"lengua general\", the \"general tongue\". The name \"quichua\" was first used in 1560 by Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s in his \"Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Per\u00fa\". It is not known what name the native speakers gave to their language before colonial times and whether it was Spaniards who called it \"quechua\".\nThere are two possible etymologies of Quechua as the name of the language. There is a possibility that the name Quechua was derived from \"*qi\u0109wa\", the native word which originally meant the \"temperate valley\" altitude ecological zone in the Andes (suitable for maize cultivation) and to its inhabitants. Alternatively, Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the early Spanish chroniclers, mention the existence of a people called Quichua in the present Apur\u00edmac Region, and it could be inferred that their name was given to the entire language.\nThe Hispanicised spellings \"Quechua\" and \"Quichua\" have been used in Peru and Bolivia since the 17th century, especially after the Third Council of Lima. Today, the various local pronunciations of \"Quechua\" include , , , and .\nAnother name that native speakers give to their own language is \"runa simi\", \"language of man/people\"; it also seems to have emerged during the colonial period.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nVoicing is not phonemic in Cusco Quechua. Cusco Quechua, North Bolivian Quechua, and South Bolivian Quechua are the only varieties to have glottalized consonants. They, along with certain kinds of Ecuadorian Kichwa, are the only varieties which have aspirated consonants. Because reflexes of a given Proto-Quechua word may have different stops in neighboring dialects (Proto-Quechua \"*\u010daki\" 'foot' becomes \"\u010d'aki\" and Proto-Quechua \"*\u010daka\" 'bridge' becomes \"\u010daka\"), they are thought to be innovations in Quechua from Aymara, borrowed independently after branching off from Proto-Quechua.\nStress.\nStress is penultimate in most dialects of Quechua. In some varieties, factors such as the apocope of word-final vowels may cause exceptional final stress. Stress in Chachapoyas Quechua falls word-initially.\nOrthography.\nQuechua has been written using the Roman alphabet since the Spanish conquest of Peru. However, written Quechua is rarely used by Quechua speakers due to limited amounts of printed material in the language.\nUntil the 20th century, Quechua was written with a Spanish-based orthography, for example \"Inca, Huayna C\u00e1pac, Collasuyo, Mama Ocllo, Viracocha, quipu, tambo, condor\". This orthography is the most familiar to Spanish speakers, and so it has been used for most borrowings into English, which essentially always happen through Spanish.\nIn 1975, the Peruvian government of Juan Velasco Alvarado adopted a new orthography for Quechua. This is the system preferred by the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, which results in the following spellings of the examples listed above: \"Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qollasuyu, Mama Oqllo, Wiraqocha, khipu, tampu, kuntur\". This orthography has the following features:\nIn 1985, a variation of this system was adopted by the Peruvian government that uses the Quechuan three-vowel system, resulting in the following spellings: \"Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qullasuyu, Mama Uqllu, Wiraqucha, khipu, tampu, kuntur\".\nThe different orthographies are still highly controversial in Peru. Advocates of the traditional system believe that the new orthographies look too foreign and believe that it makes Quechua harder to learn for people who have first been exposed to written Spanish. Those who prefer the new system maintain that it better matches the phonology of Quechua, and they point to studies showing that teaching the five-vowel system to children later causes reading difficulties in Spanish.\nFor more on this, see Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift.\nWriters differ in the treatment of Spanish loanwords. These are sometimes adapted to modern orthography and sometimes left as in Spanish. For instance, \"I am Roberto\" could be written \"Robertom kani\" or \"Ruwirtum kani\". (The \"-m\" is not part of the name; it is an evidential suffix, showing how the information is known: firsthand, in this case.)\nIn Cusco, Peru, the ancient capital of the Incas, there is a debate where some scholars claim that Quechua has three vowels while others claim it has five.\nThe Peruvian linguist Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n Palomino has proposed an orthographic norm for all of Southern Quechua: this Standard Quechua (\"el Quechua est\u00e1ndar\" or \"Hanan Runasimi\") conservatively integrates features of the two widespread dialects Ayacucho Quechua and Cusco Quechua. For instance:\nThe Spanish-based orthography is now in conflict with Peruvian law. According to article 20 of the decree \"Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC\", which approves regulations relative to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper El Peruano on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed, with the aim of standardizing the spellings used by the National Geographic Institute \"(Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional, IGN)\" The IGN implements the necessary changes on the official maps of Peru.\nGrammar.\nMorphological type.\nQuechua is an agglutinating language, meaning that words are built up from basic roots followed by several suffixes, each of which carries one meaning. Their large number of suffixes changes both the overall meaning of words and their subtle shades of meaning. All varieties of Quechua are very regular agglutinative languages, as opposed to isolating or fusional ones [Thompson]. Their normal sentence order is SOV (subject\u2013object\u2013verb). Notable grammatical features include bipersonal conjugation (verbs agree with both subject and object), evidentiality (indication of the source and veracity of knowledge), a set of topic particles, and suffixes indicating who benefits from an action and the speaker's attitude toward it, but some varieties may lack some of the characteristics.\nPronouns.\nIn Quechua, there are seven pronouns, gender distinction does not exist. First-person plural pronouns (equivalent to \"we\") may be inclusive or exclusive; which mean, respectively, that the addressee (\"you\") is or is not part of the \"we\". Quechua also adds the suffix \"-kuna\" to the second and third person singular pronouns \"qam\" and \"pay\" to create the plural forms, \"qam-kuna\" and \"pay-kuna\". In Quechua IIB, or \"Kichwa\", the exclusive first-person plural pronoun, \"\u00f1uqayku\", is generally obsolete.\nAdjectives.\nAdjectives in Quechua are always placed before nouns and are invariable.\nNouns.\nLike pronouns, they are genderless. There are no articles either. Noun roots accept suffixes that indicate number, case, and the person of a possessor. In general, the possessive suffix precedes that of number. In the Santiago del Estero variety, however, the order is reversed. From variety to variety, suffixes may change. The use of the \"-kuna\" plural suffix is largely facultative in nouns, like in many languages where number indication is optional.\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs can be formed by adding \"-ta\" or, in some cases, \"-lla\" to an adjective: \"allin \u2013 allinta\" (\"good \u2013 well\"), \"utqay \u2013 utqaylla\" (\"quick \u2013 quickly\"). They are also formed by adding suffixes to demonstratives: \"chay\" (\"that\") \u2013 \"chaypi\" (\"there\"), \"kay\" (\"this\") \u2013 \"kayman\" (\"hither\").\nThere are several original adverbs. For Europeans, it is striking that the adverb \"qhipa\" means both \"behind\" and \"future\" and \"\u00f1awpa\" means \"ahead, in front\" and \"past\". Local and temporal concepts of adverbs in Quechua (as well as in Aymara) are associated to each other reversely, compared to European languages. For the speakers of Quechua, we are moving backwards into the future (we cannot see it: it is unknown), facing the past (we can see it: it is remembered).\nVerbs.\nThe infinitive forms have the suffix \"-y\" (e.g.\"., much'a\" 'kiss'; \"much'a-y\" 'to kiss'). These are the typical endings for the indicative in a Southern Quechua (IIC) dialect:\nThe suffixes shown in the table above usually indicate the subject; the person of the object is also indicated by a suffix, which precedes the suffixes in the table. For the second person, it is \"-su-\", and for the first person, it is \"-wa-\" in most Quechua II dialects. In such cases, the plural suffixes from the table (\"-chik\" and \"-ku\") can be used to express the number of the object rather than the subject. There is a lot of variation between the dialects in the exact rules which determine this. In Central Quechua, however, the verbal morphology differs in a number of respects: most notably, the verbal plural suffixes \"-chik\" and \"-ku\" are not used, and plurality is expressed by different suffixes that are located \"before\" rather than after the personal suffixes. Furthermore, the 1st person singular object suffix is \"-ma-\", rather than \"-wa-\".\nGrammatical particles.\nParticles are indeclinable: they do not accept suffixes. They are relatively rare, but the most common are \"ar\u00ed\" 'yes' and \"mana\" 'no', although \"mana\" can take some suffixes, such as \"-n\"/\"-m\" (\"manan\"/\"manam\"), \"-raq\" (\"manaraq\" 'not yet') and \"-chu\" (\"manachu?\" 'or not?'), to intensify the meaning. Other particles are \"yaw\" 'hey, hi', and certain loan words from Spanish, such as \"piru\" (from Spanish \"pero\" 'but') and \"sinuqa\" (from \"sino\" 'rather').\nEvidentiality.\nThe Quechuan languages have three different morphemes that mark evidentiality. Evidentiality refers to a morpheme whose primary purpose is to indicate the source of information. In Quechuan languages, evidentiality is a three-term system: there are three evidential morphemes that mark varying levels of source information. The markers can apply to first, second, and third persons. The chart below depicts an example of these morphemes from Wanka Quechua:\n&lt;section begin=\"list-of-glossing-abbreviations\"/&gt;\nDIR:direct evidence\nCONJ:conjecture\n&lt;section end=\"list-of-glossing-abbreviations\"/&gt;\nThe parentheses around the vowels indicate that the vowel can be dropped when following an open vowel. For the sake of cohesiveness, the above forms are used to discuss the evidential morphemes. There are dialectal variations to the forms. The variations will be presented in the following descriptions.\nThe following sentences provide examples of the three evidentials and further discuss the meaning behind each of them.\n\"-m(i)\" : Direct evidence and commitment.\nRegional variations: In Cusco Quechua, the direct evidential presents itself as \"\u2013mi\" and \"\u2013n\".\nThe evidential \"\u2013mi\" indicates that the speaker has a \"strong personal conviction the veracity of the circumstance expressed.\" It has the basis of direct personal experience.\nWanka Quechua\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"-chr(a)\" : Inference and attenuation.\nIn Quechuan languages, not specified by the source, the inference morpheme appears as \"-ch(i), -ch(a), -chr(a)\".\nThe \"-chr(a)\" evidential indicates that the utterance is an inference or form of conjecture. That inference relays the speaker's non-commitment to the truth-value of the statement. It also appears in cases such as acquiescence, irony, interrogative constructions, and first person inferences. These uses constitute nonprototypical use and will be discussed later in the \"changes in meaning and other uses\" section.\nWanka Quechua\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"-sh(i)\" : Hearsay.\nRegional variations: It can appear as \"\u2013sh(i)\" or \"\u2013s(i)\" depending on the dialect.\nWith the use of this morpheme, the speaker \"serves as a conduit through which information from another source passes.\" The information being related is hearsay or revelatory in nature. It also works to express the uncertainty of the speaker regarding the situation. However, it also appears in other constructions that are discussed in the \"changes in meaning\" section.\nWanka Quechua\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHintz discusses an interesting case of evidential behavior found in the Sihaus dialect of Ancash Quechua. The author postulates that instead of three single evidential markers, that Quechuan language contains three pairs of evidential markers.\nAffix or clitic.\nThe evidential morphemes have been referred to as markers or morphemes. The literature seems to differ on whether or not the evidential morphemes are acting as affixes or clitics, in some cases, such as Wanka Quechua, enclitics. Lefebvre and Muysken (1998) discuss this issue in terms of case but remark the line between affix and clitic is not clear. Both terms are used interchangeably throughout these sections.\nPosition in the sentence.\nEvidentials in the Quechuan languages are \"second position enclitics\", which usually attach to the first constituent in the sentence, as shown in this example.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThey can, however, also occur on a focused constituent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSometimes, the affix is described as attaching to the focus, particularly in the Tarma dialect of Yaru Quechua, but this does not hold true for all varieties of Quechua. In Huanuco Quechua, the evidentials may follow any number of topics, marked by the topic marker \"\u2013qa\", and the element with the evidential must precede the main verb or be the main verb.\nHowever, there are exceptions to that rule, and the more topics there are in a sentence, the more likely the sentence is to deviate from the usual pattern.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChanges in meaning and other uses.\nEvidentials can be used to relay different meanings depending on the context and perform other functions. The following examples are restricted to Wanka Quechua.\nThe direct evidential, -mi\nThe direct evidential appears in wh-questions and yes/no questions. By considering the direct evidential in terms of prototypical semantics, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to have a direct evidential, basically an evidential that confirms the speaker's certainty about a topic, in a question. However, if one focuses less on the structure and more on the situation, some sense can be made. The speaker is asking the addressee for information so the speaker assumes the speaker knows the answer. That assumption is where the direct evidential comes into play. The speaker holds a certain amount of certainty that the addressee will know the answer. The speaker interprets the addressee as being in \"direct relation\" to the proposed content; the situation is the same as when, in regular sentences, the speaker assumes direct relation to the proposed information.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe direct evidential affix is also seen in yes/no questions, similar to the situation with wh-questions. Floyd describes yes/no questions as being \"characterized as instructions to the addressee to assert one of the propositions of a disjunction.\" Once again, the burden of direct evidence is being placed on the addressee, not on the speaker. The question marker in Wanka Quechua, \"-chun\", is derived from the negative \u2013chu marker and the direct evidential (realized as \u2013n in some dialects).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInferential evidential, -chr(a).\nWhile \"\u2013chr(a)\" is usually used in an inferential context, it has some non-prototypical uses.\n\"Mild Exhortation\"\nIn these constructions the evidential works to reaffirm and encourage the addressee's actions or thoughts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis example comes from a conversation between husband and wife, discussing the reactions of their family and friends after they have been gone for a while. The husband says he plans to stretch the truth and tell them about distant places to which he has gone, and his wife (in the example above) echoes and encourages his thoughts.\n\"Acquiescence\"\nWith these, the evidential is used to highlight the speaker's assessment of inevitability of an event and acceptance of it. There is a sense of resistance, diminished enthusiasm, and disinclination in these constructions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis example comes from a discourse where a woman demands compensation from the man (the speaker in the example) whose pigs ruined her potatoes. He denies the pigs as being his but finally realizes he may be responsible and produces the above example.\n\"Interrogative\"\nSomewhat similar to the \"\u2013mi\" evidential, the inferential evidential can be found in content questions. However, the salient difference between the uses of the evidentials in questions is that in the \"\u2013m(i)\" marked questions, an answer is expected. That is not the case with \"\u2013chr(a)\" marked questions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Irony\"\nIrony in language can be a somewhat complicated topic in how it functions differently in languages, and by its semantic nature, it is already somewhat vague. For these purposes, it is suffice to say that when irony takes place in Wanka Quechua, the \"\u2013chr(a)\" marker is used.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis example comes from discourse between a father and daughter about her refusal to attend school. It can be interpreted as a genuine statement (perhaps one can learn by resisting school) or as an ironic statement (that is an absurd idea).\nHearsay evidential, -sh(i).\nAside from being used to express hearsay and revelation, this affix also has other uses.\n\"Folktales, myths, and legends\"\nBecause folktales, myths, and legends are, in essence, reported speech, it follows that the hearsay marker would be used with them. Many of these types of stories are passed down through generations, furthering this aspect of reported speech. A difference between simple hearsay and folktales can be seen in the frequency of the \"\u2013sh(i)\" marker. In normal conversation using reported speech, the marker is used less, to avoid redundancy.\n\"Riddles\"\nRiddles are somewhat similar to myths and folktales in that their nature is to be passed by word of mouth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOmission and overuse of evidential affixes.\nIn certain grammatical structures, the evidential marker does not appear at all. In all Quechuan languages the evidential will not appear in a dependent clause. No example was given to depict this omission.\nOmissions occur in Quechua. The sentence is understood to have the same evidentiality as the other sentences in the context. Quechuan speakers vary as to how much they omit evidentials, but they occur only in connected speech.\nAn interesting contrast to omission of evidentials is overuse of evidentials. If a speaker uses evidentials too much with no reason, competence is brought into question. For example, the overuse of \u2013m(i) could lead others to believe that the speaker is not a native speaker or, in some extreme cases, that one is mentally ill.\nCultural aspect.\nBy using evidentials, the Quechua culture has certain assumptions about the information being relayed. Those who do not abide by the cultural customs should not be trusted. A passage from Weber (1986) summarizes them:\nEvidentials also show that being precise and stating the source of one's information is extremely important in the language and the culture. Failure to use them correctly can lead to diminished standing in the community. Speakers are aware of the evidentials and even use proverbs to teach children the importance of being precise and truthful. Precision and information source are of the utmost importance. They are a powerful and resourceful method of human communication.\nLiterature.\nAs in the case of the pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, there are a number of Andean texts in the local language which were written down in Latin characters after the European conquest, but which express, to a great extent, the culture of pre-Conquest times. For example, Quechua poems thought to date from Inca times are preserved as quotations within some Spanish-language chronicles dealing with the pre-Conquest period. However, the most important specimen of Quechua literature of this type is the so-called Huarochir\u00ed Manuscript (1598), which describes the mythology and religion of the valley of Huarochir\u00ed and has been compared to \"an Andean Bible\" and to the Mayan Popol Vuh. From the post-conquest period (starting from the middle of the 17th century), there are a number of anonymous or signed Quechua dramas, some of which deal with the Inca era, while most are on religious topics and of European inspiration. The most famous dramas are \"Ollantay\" and the plays describing the death of Atahualpa. Juan de Espinosa Medrano wrote several dramas in the language. Poems in Quechua were also composed during the colonial period. A notable example are the works of Juan Wallparrimachi, a participant in the Bolivian War of Independence.\nAs for Christian literature, as early as 1583, the Third Provincial Church Council of Lima, which took place in 1583, published a number of texts dealing with Christian doctrine and rituals, including a trilingual catechism in Spanish, Quechua and Aymara and a number of other similar texts in the years from 1584 to 1585. More texts of this type were published until the middle of the 17th century, mostly adhering to a Quechua literary standard that had been codified by the Third Council for this purpose. There is at least one Quechuan version of the Bible.\nDramas and poems continued to be written in the 19th and especially in 20th centuries as well; in addition, in the 20th century and more recently, more prose has been published. However, few literary forms were made present in the 19th century as European influences limited literary criticism. While some of that literature consists of original compositions (poems and dramas), the bulk of 20th century Quechua literature consists of traditional folk stories and oral narratives. Johnny Payne has translated two sets of Quechua oral short stories, one into Spanish and the other into English.\nDemetrio T\u00fapac Yupanqui wrote a Quechuan version of \"Don Quixote\", under the title .\nMedia.\nA news broadcast in Quechua, \"\u00d1uqanchik\" (all of us), began in Peru in 2016.\nMany Andean musicians write and sing in their native languages, including Quechua and Aymara. Notable musical groups are Los Kjarkas, , J'acha Mallku, Savia Andina, Wayna Picchu, Wara, Alborada, Uchpa, and many others.\nThere are several Quechua and Quechua-Spanish bloggers, as well as a Quechua language podcast.\nThe 1961 Peruvian film \"Kukuli\" was the first film to be spoken in the Quechua language.\nIn the 1977 science fiction film \"Star Wars\", the alien character Greedo speaks a simplified form of Quechua.\nThe first-person shooter game \"Overwatch 2\" features a Peruvian character, Illari, with some voice lines being in Quechua.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Protein quaternary structure refers to the structure of proteins which are themselves composed of two or more smaller protein chains (also referred to as subunits). Protein quaternary structure describes the number and arrangement of multiple folded protein subunits in a multi-subunit complex. It includes organizations from simple dimers to large homooligomers and complexes with defined or variable numbers of subunits. In contrast to the first three levels of protein structure, not all proteins will have a quaternary structure since some proteins function as single units. Protein quaternary structure can also refer to biomolecular complexes of proteins with nucleic acids and other cofactors.\nDescription and examples.\nMany proteins are actually assemblies of multiple polypeptide chains. The quaternary structure refers to the number and arrangement of the protein subunits with respect to one another. Examples of proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, ribosomes, antibodies, and ion channels.\nEnzymes composed of subunits with diverse functions are sometimes called holoenzymes, in which some parts may be known as regulatory subunits and the functional core is known as the catalytic subunit. Other assemblies referred to instead as multiprotein complexes also possess quaternary structure. Examples include nucleosomes and microtubules. Changes in quaternary structure can occur through conformational changes within individual subunits or through reorientation of the subunits relative to each other. It is through such changes, which underlie cooperativity and allostery in \"multimeric\" enzymes, that many proteins undergo regulation and perform their physiological function.\nThe above definition follows a classical approach to biochemistry, established at times when the distinction between a protein and a functional, proteinaceous unit was difficult to elucidate. More recently, people refer to protein\u2013protein interaction when discussing quaternary structure of proteins and consider all assemblies of proteins as protein complexes.\nNomenclature.\nThe number of subunits in an oligomeric complex is described using names that end in -mer (Greek for \"part, subunit\"). Formal and Greco-Latinate names are generally used for the first ten types and can be used for up to twenty subunits, whereas higher order complexes are usually described by the number of subunits, followed by -meric.\n*\"No known examples\"\nThe smallest unit forming a homo-oligomer, i.e. one protein chain or subunit, is designated as a monomer, subunit or protomer. The latter term was originally devised to specify the smallest unit of hetero-oligomeric proteins, but is also applied to homo-oligomeric proteins in current literature. The subunits usually arrange in cyclic symmetry to form closed point group symmetries.\nAlthough complexes higher than octamers are rarely observed for most proteins, there are some important exceptions. Viral capsids are often composed of multiples of 60 proteins. Several molecular machines are also found in the cell, such as the proteasome (four heptameric rings = 28 subunits), the transcription complex and the spliceosome. The ribosome is probably the largest molecular machine, and is composed of many RNA and protein molecules.\nIn some cases, proteins form complexes that then assemble into even larger complexes. In such cases, one uses the nomenclature, e.g., \"dimer of dimers\" or \"trimer of dimers\". This may suggest that the complex might dissociate into smaller sub-complexes before dissociating into monomers. This usually implies that the complex consists of different oligomerisation interfaces. For example, a tetrameric protein may have one four-fold rotation axis, i.e. point group symmetry 4 or \"C\"4. In this case the four interfaces between the subunits are identical. It may also have point group symmetry 222 or \"D\"2. This tetramer has different interfaces and the tetramer can dissociate into two identical homodimers. Tetramers of 222 symmetry are \"dimer of dimers\". Hexamers of 32 point group symmetry are \"trimer of dimers\" or \"dimer of trimers\". Thus, the nomenclature \"dimer of dimers\" is used to specify the point group symmetry or arrangement of the oligomer, independent of information relating to its dissociation properties. \nAnother distinction often made when referring to oligomers is whether they are homomeric or heteromeric, referring to whether the smaller protein subunits that come together to make the protein complex are the same (homomeric) or different (heteromeric) from each other. For example, two identical protein monomers would come together to form a homo-dimer, whereas two different protein monomers would create a hetero-dimer.\nStructure determination.\nProtein quaternary structure can be determined using a variety of experimental techniques that require a sample of protein in a variety of experimental conditions. The experiments often provide an estimate of the mass of the native protein and, together with knowledge of the masses and/or stoichiometry of the subunits, allow the quaternary structure to be predicted with a given accuracy. It is not always possible to obtain a precise determination of the subunit composition for a variety of reasons.\nThe number of subunits in a protein complex can often be determined by measuring the hydrodynamic molecular volume or mass of the intact complex, which requires native solution conditions. For \"folded\" proteins, the mass can be inferred from its volume using the partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g. However, volume measurements are less certain than mass measurements, since \"unfolded\" proteins appear to have a much larger volume than folded proteins; additional experiments are required to determine whether a protein is unfolded or has formed an oligomer.\nIndirect size measurement of intact complexes.\nMethods that measure the mass or volume under unfolding conditions (such as \nMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE) are generally not useful, since non-native conditions usually cause the complex to dissociate into monomers. However, these may sometimes be applicable; for example, the experimenter may apply SDS-PAGE after first treating the intact complex with chemical cross-link reagents.\nStructure prediction.\nSome bioinformatics methods have been developed for predicting the quaternary structural attributes of proteins based on their sequence information by using various modes of pseudo amino acid composition.\nProtein folding prediction programs used to predict protein tertiary structure have also been expanding to better predict protein quaternary structure. One such development is AlphaFold-Multimer built upon the AlphaFold model for predicting protein tertiary structure.\nRole in cell signaling.\nProtein quaternary structure also plays an important role in certain cell signaling pathways. The G protein-coupled receptor pathway involves a heterotrimeric protein known as a G protein. G proteins contain three distinct subunits known as the G-alpha, G-beta, and G-gamma subunits. When the G protein is activated, it binds to the G protein-coupled receptor protein and the cell signaling pathway is initiated. Another example is the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway, which is initiated by the dimerization of two receptor tyrosine kinase monomers. When the dimer is formed, the two kinases can phosphorylate each other and initiate a cell signaling pathway.\nProtein\u2013protein interactions.\nProteins are capable of forming very tight but also only transient complexes. For example, ribonuclease inhibitor binds to ribonuclease A with a roughly 20 fM dissociation constant. Other proteins have evolved to bind specifically to unusual moieties on another protein, e.g., biotin groups (avidin), phosphorylated tyrosines (SH2 domains) or proline-rich segments (SH3 domains). Protein\u2013protein interactions can be engineered to favor certain oligomerization states.\nIntragenic complementation.\nWhen multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene form a quaternary complex, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation (also called inter-allelic complementation). Intragenic complementation appears to be common and has been studied in many different genes in a variety of organisms including the fungi \"Neurospora crassa\", \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\"; the bacterium \"Salmonella typhimurium\"; the virus bacteriophage T4, an RNA virus, and humans. The intermolecular forces likely responsible for self-recognition and multimer formation were discussed by Jehle.\nAssembly.\nDirect interaction of two nascent proteins emerging from nearby ribosomes appears to be a general mechanism for oligomer formation. Hundreds of protein oligomers were identified that assemble in human cells by such an interaction. The most prevalent form of interaction was between the N-terminal regions of the interacting proteins. Dimer formation appears to be able to occur independently of dedicated assembly machines.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25292", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25292", "title": "Quest for Glory", "text": "Video game series\nQuest for Glory is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games, which were designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The series was created in the Sierra Creative Interpreter, a toolset developed at Sierra specifically to assist with adventure game development. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a 5-part series in the Sierra stable.\nThe series was originally titled \"Hero's Quest\". However, Sierra failed to trademark the name. The Milton Bradley Company successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, \"HeroQuest\", which forced Sierra to change the series' title to \"Quest for Glory\". This decision meant that all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of \"Hero's Quest I\") used the new name.\nSeries.\nLori Cole pitched \"Quest for Glory\" to Sierra as a \"rich, narrative-driven, role-playing experience\".\nThe series consisted of five games, each of which followed directly upon the events of the last. New games frequently referred to previous entries in the series, often in the form of cameos by recurring characters. The objective of the series is to transform the player character from an average adventurer to a hero by completing non-linear quests.\nThe game also was revolutionary in its character import system. This allowed players to import their individual character, including the skills and wealth they had acquired, from one game to the next.\nHybrids by their gameplay and themes, the games feature serious stories leavened with humor throughout. There are real dangers to face, and true heroic feats to perform, but silly details and overtones creep in (when the drama of adventuring does not force them out). Cheap word play is particularly frequent, to the point that the second game's ending refers to itself as the hero's \"latest set of adventures and miserable puns.\"\nThe games have recurring story elements. For example, most installments in the series require the player to create a dispel potion.\nThe games include a number of Easter eggs, including a number of allusions to other Sierra games. For example, if a player types \"pick nose\" in the first game, (or clicks the lockpick icon on the player in the new version), if their lock-picking skill is high enough, the game responds: \"Success! You now have an open nose\". If the skill is too low, the player could insert the lock pick too far, killing himself. Another example is Dr. Cranium, an allusion to \"The Castle of Dr. Brain\", in the fourth game.\nEach game draws its inspiration from a different culture and mythology: (in order, Germanic/fairy tale; Middle Eastern/Arabian Nights; Egyptian/African; Slavic folklore; and finally Greco-Mediterranean) with the hero facing increasingly powerful opponents with help from characters who become more familiar from game to game.\nEach game varies somewhat from the tradition it is derived from; for example, Baba Yaga, a character borrowed from Slavic folklore, appears in the first game which is based on German mythology. The second game, which uses Middle Eastern folklore, introduces several Arab and African-themed characters who reappear in the third game based on African folklore and Egyptian mythology, and also features some elements inspired by American culture, including references to the film Casablanca. Characters from every game and genre in the series reappear in the fourth and fifth games. In addition to deviating from the player's expectations of the culture represented in each game, the series also includes a number of intentional anachronisms, such as the pizza-loving mad scientists in the later games.\nMany CRPG enthusiasts consider the \"Quest for Glory\" series to be among the best in the genre, and the series is lauded for its non-linearity. The games are notable for blending the mechanics of adventure video games and roleplaying video games, their unique tone which combines pathos and humour, and the game systems which were ahead of their time, such as day-night cycles, non-playable characters which adhered to their own schedules within the games, and character improvement through both skill practice and point investiture. The website Polygon and the Kotaku blog have characterised the game as a precursor to modern day RPGs. Fraser Brown of the Destructoid blog considers the games: \"one of the greatest adventure series of all time\".\nRowan Kaizer of the blog Engadget credits the games' hybrid adventure and roleplaying systems for the series' success. \"The binary succeed/fail form of adventure game puzzles tended to either make those games too easy or too hard,\" he wrote, \"But most puzzles in \"Quest For Glory\" involved some kind of skill check for your hero. This meant that you could succeed at most challenges by practicing or exploring, instead of getting stuck on bizarre item-combination puzzles\".\nGameplay.\nThe first four games are hybrid adventure/role playing video games with real-time combat, while the fifth game switches to the action RPG genre.\nThe gameplay standards established in earlier Sierra adventure games are enhanced by the player's ability to choose the character's career path from among the three traditional role-playing game backgrounds: fighter, magic-user/wizard and thief. Further variation is added by the ability to customize the Hero's abilities, including the option of selecting skills normally reserved for another character class, leading to unique combinations often referred to as \"hybrid characters\". During the second or third games, a character can be initiated as a Paladin by performing honorable actions, changing his class and abilities, and receiving a unique sword. This applies when the character is exported into later games. Any character that finishes any game in the series (except \"Dragon Fire\", the last in the series) can be exported to a more recent game (\"Shadows of Darkness\" has a glitch which allows one to import characters from the same game), keeping the character's statistics and parts of its inventory. If the character received the paladin sword, he would keep the magic sword (Soulforge or Piotyr's sword) and special paladin magic abilities (with the exception of \"Shadows of Darkness\", where the character loses all of his belongings, including the weapons, before the game begins). A character imported into a later game in the series from any other game can be assigned any character class, including Paladin.\nEach career path has its own strengths and weaknesses, and scenarios unique to the class because of the skills associated with it. Each class also has its own distinct way to solve various in-game puzzles, which encourage replay: some puzzles have up to four different solutions. For instance, if a door is closed, instead of lockpicking or casting an open spell, the fighter can simply knock down the door. The magic user and the thief are both non-confrontational characters, as they lack the close range ability of the fighter, but are better able to attack from a distance, using daggers or spells. An example of these separate paths can be seen early in the first game. A gold ring belonging to the healer rests in a nest on top of a tree; fighters might make it fall by hurling rocks, thieves may want to climb the tree, while a magic user can simply cast the fetch spell to retrieve the nest, and then, while the fighter and magic user return the ring for a reward, the thief can choose between returning or selling the same ring in the thieves' guild (which is not available for those not possessing the \"thieving\" skills). It is also possible to build, over the course of several games, a character that has points in every skill in the game, and can therefore perform nearly every task. However, certain tasks are presented only to characters of a specific class. \nEach character class features special abilities unique to that class, as well as a shared set of attributes which can be developed by performing tasks and completing quests. In general, for a particular game the maximum value which can be reached for an ability is 100*[the number of that game]. \"Quest for Glory V\" allows stat bonuses which can push an attribute over the maximum and lets certain classes raise certain attributes beyond the normal limits. \"Quest for Glory V\" also features special kinds of equipment which lower some stats while raising others. At the beginning of each game, the player may assign points to certain attributes, and certain classes only have specific attributes enabled, although skills can be added for an extra cost.\nGeneral attributes influence all characters' classes and how they interact with objects and other people in the game; high values in strength allows movement of heavier objects and communication helps with bargaining goods with sellers. These attributes are changed by performing actions related to the skill; climbing a tree eventually increases the skill value in climb, running increases vitality, and so on. There are also complementing skills which are tied to specific classes; parry (the ability to block a blow with the sword), for instance, is mainly used by fighters and paladins, lock picking and sneaking are defaults with the thief, and the ability to cast magic spells is usually associated with magic user.\nVital statistics are depleted by performing some actions. Health, (determined by strength and vitality), determines the hit points of the character, which decreases when the character is attacked or harms himself. Stamina (based on agility and vitality) limits the number of actions (exercise, fighting, running, etc.) the character is able to perform before needing rest or risking injury. Mana is only required by characters with skill in magic, and is calculated according to the character's intelligence and magic attributes.\nPuzzle and Experience points only show the development of the player and his progress in the game, though in the first game also affects the kind of random encounters a player faces, as some monsters only appear after a certain level of experience is reached.\nGames.\n\"Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero\".\nIn the valley barony of Spielburg, the evil ogress Baba Yaga has cursed the land and the baron who tried to drive her off. His children have disappeared, while the land is ravaged by monsters and brigands. The Valley of Spielburg is in need of a Hero able to solve these problems.\nThe original game was released in 1989 while a VGA remake was released in 1992.\n\"Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire\".\n\"Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire\" takes place in the land of Shapeir, in the world of Gloriana. Directly following from the events of the first game, the newly proclaimed Hero of Spielburg travels by flying carpet with his friends Abdulla Doo, Shameen and Shema to the desert city of Shapeir. The city is threatened by magical elementals, while the Emir Arus al-Din of Shapeir's sister city Raseir is missing and his city fallen under tyranny.\n\"Quest for Glory II\" is the only game in the series not to have originated or have been remade beyond the EGA graphics engine by Sierra, but AGD Interactive released a VGA fan remake of the game using the Adventure Game Studio engine on August 24th, 2008.\n\"Quest for Glory III: Wages of War\".\nRakeesh the Paladin brings the Hero (and Prince of Shapeir) along with Uhura and her son Simba to his homeland, the town of Tarna in a jungle and savannah country called Fricana that resembles central African ecosystems.\nTarna is on the brink of war; the Simbani, the tribe of Uhura, are ready to do battle with the Leopardmen. Each tribe has stolen a sacred relic from the other, and both refuse to return it until the other side does. The Hero must prevent the war then thwart a demon who may be loosed upon the world.\n\"Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness\".\nDrawn without warning from his victory in Fricana, the Hero arrives without equipment or explanation in the middle of the hazardous Dark One Caves in the distant land of Mordavia. While struggling to survive in this land plagued with undead, the Hero must prevent a dark power from summoning eternal darkness into the world.\n\"Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire\".\nErasmus introduces the player character, the Hero, to the Greece-like kingdom of Silmaria, whose king was recently assassinated. Thus, the traditional Rites of Rulership are due to commence, and the victor will be crowned king. The Hero enters the contest with the assistance of Erasmus, Rakeesh, and many old friends from previous entries in the series. The Hero competes against competitors, including the Silmarian guard Kokeeno Pookameeso, the warlord Magnum Opus, the hulking Gort, and the warrior Elsa Von Spielburg.\nOriginal concept.\nOriginally, the series was to be a tetralogy, consisting of four games, with the following themes and cycles: the four cardinal directions, the four classical elements, the four seasons and four different mythologies.\nThis is what the creators originally had in mind:\nHowever, when ' was designed, it was thought that it would be too difficult for the hero to go straight from Shapeir to Mordavia and defeat the Dark One. To solve the problem, a new game, ', was inserted into the canon, resulting in a renumbering of the series. Evidence for this can be found in the end of \"\": the player is told that the next game will be \"Shadows of Darkness\" and a fanged vampiric moon is shown, to hint at the next game's theme.\nThe developers discussed this in the Fall 1992 issue of Sierra's \"InterAction\" magazine, and an online chat room:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When we developed the concept for the series,\" explained Corey, \"we wanted some unifying themes for the story. We worked with the four seasons, the four basic elements \u2013 Earth, Air, Fire, and Water \u2013 and the four cardinal points of the compass. We planned to create four games to follow these elements.\n\"The first game \u2013 \"So You Want to be a Hero\" \u2013 is springtime and Earth and set in medieval Germany in the North. The second game \u2013 \"Trial by Fire\" \u2013 was the element of Fire, in the summer, and set in the South, in Arabia.\"\n\"The original third chapter,\" added Lori, \"was to be \"Shadows of Darkness\", set in Transylvania \u2013 the East \u2013 and in the Fall, using Air as the central element.\"\nSomewhere between finishing \"Trial by Fire\" and cranking up the design process for \"Shadows of Darkness\", the husband-and-wife team realized a fifth chapter would have to be added to bridge the games. That chapter became \"Wages of War\".\nThe concept of seasons in the games represents the maturation of the Hero as he moves from story to story. It's a critical component in a series that \u2013 from the very beginning \u2013 was designed to be a defined quartet of stories, representing an overall saga with a distinct beginning, middle, and end.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"One of the unifying themes,\" explained Corey, \"is the growth of your character, going from being an adolescent Hero in the first game to being a young man in the second. You're strong and confident...\"\n\"The third game,\" continued Lori, \"was to show you as a master of your profession, with the fourth depicting you at the mature peak of your powers.\"\nIn the first episode, the player is a new graduate of the Famous Adventurer's Correspondence School, ready to venture out into the springtime of his career and build a reputation. It's a light-hearted, exhilarating journey into the unknown that can be replayed three times with three distinct outlooks at puzzle-solving.\nIn the second chapter \u2013 \"Trial by Fire\" \u2013 the Hero enters the summer of his experience, facing more difficult challenges with more highly developed skills. While the episode is more serious and dangerous than its predecessor, it retains the enchanting mixture of fantasy, challenge, and humor that made the first game a hit with so many fans.\nOf all the reasons Lori and Corey found for creating a bridge between \"Trial by Fire\" and \"Shadows of Darkness\", the most compelling was the feeling that the Hero character simply hadn't matured enough to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"In terms of role-playing aspects,\" said Corey, \"\"Shadows of Darkness\" is going to be a very difficult game. You'll have very tough opposition from the very beginning of the game.\"\n\"Also,\" said Lori, \"you'll be very much alone. In \"Trial by Fire\" you had a lot of friends to help you. You always had a place to go back to rest. You always had a place of safety until the very end of the game. Once you get into \"Shadows of Darkness\", you're not going to have any sanctuary. You won't be able to trust anyone, because nobody will trust you.\n\"\"Wages of War\" is the bridge,\" she continues. \"You start with people you know to help you along in the beginning. But when push comes to shove, you're the one who's on his own, who has to solve the ultimate mystery. As you go along, just when you think you're all alone, your allies come back to you, but you have to face the final challenge by yourself.\"\u2014\u200a\nCharacters.\nAlong with the Hero, several recurring characters appear and re-appear throughout the series including: Rakeesh Sah Tarna, Baba Yaga, Abdullah Doo, Elsa von Spielburg, the evil Ad Avis, and others.\nWorld.\nThe fictional world in which the Quest for Glory series takes place includes the town of Spielburg (based on German folklore and Norse mythology), the desert city of Shapeir (based on the Arabia of \"One Thousand and One Nights\"), the jungle city of Tarna (based on African mythology, especially Egypt), the hamlet of Mordavia (based on Slavic mythology) and Silmaria (based on Greek mythology). Adventures, monsters and story of the games are usually drawn from legends of the respective mythology on which a title is based, although there are several cross-over exceptions, like the Eastern European Baba Yaga also appearing in the first game, which is distinctly German/Nordic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The acronym was originally derived from \"quasi-NGO\", where NGO is the abbreviation for a non-government organization.\nAs its original name suggests, a quango is a hybrid form of organization, with elements of both NGOs and public sector bodies. Although originating in the United States, the term is primarily used in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, other countries in the core and middle Anglosphere.\nIn the UK, the term quango covers different arm's-length bodies (ALBs), including \"non-departmental public bodies\" (NDPBs), non-ministerial government departments, and executive agencies.\nUse.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, quangos are referred to as 'Crown Corporations' or simply 'Crown corps'. As of May 2021, there were 45 Crown corps owned by the Canadian federal government, however many more are owned by each of the provincial governments. Notably electricity providers such as the 'Saskatchewan Power Corporation' a.k.a. SaskPower owned by the province of Saskatchewan and 'Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board' a.k.a. Manitoba Hydro owned by the province of Manitoba.\nSaskatchewan.\nSaskatchewan is notable for the ubiquity of provincial crown corps with most styled with the prefix \"Sask\"- followed by the primary service. The larger Saskatchewan Crown corps have their own Saskatchewan minister with all Saskatchewan Crown corps owned by the Crown Investment Corporation of Saskatchewan which in turn is owned by the provincial government. Some of the most notable Saskatchewan Crown corps are as follows:\nIreland.\nIn 2006, there were 832 quangos in the Republic of Ireland\u00a0\u2013 482 at national and 350 at local level\u00a0\u2013 with a total of 5,784 individual appointees and a combined annual budget of \u20ac13 billion.\nThe Irish majority party, Fine Gael, had promised to eliminate 145 quangos should they be the governing party in the 2016 election. Since coming to power they have reduced the overall number of quangos by 17. This reduction also included agencies which the former government had already planned to remove.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, quangos are referred to as 'Crown Entities', with the shift occurring in the 1980s during a period of neoliberalisation of the state sector. In 1996, there were an estimated 310 quangos in New Zealand, and an additional 2690 school Boards of Trustees (similar to the American model of boards of education). Other quangos from 1996 include: \"...63 Crown Health Enterprises, 39 tertiary education institutions, 21 Business development boards and 9 Crown Research Institutes. But there were also 71 single crown entities with services ranging from regulatory (e.g. Accounting Standards Review Board, Takeovers Panel) to quasi-judicial (e.g. Police Complaints Authority, Race Relations Conciliator), to the arts (e.g. New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, NZ Film Commission), to social welfare (e.g. Housing Corporation of NZ) and to substantial enterprises (e.g. Auckland International Airport Ltd).\"\nBy 2003, the number of quangos had increased to an estimated 400 (excluding Board of Trustees), with more than 3,000 people sitting on governance boards that were appointed by successive governments. This appointment of people to governance boards has been widely criticised by political parties and political commentators as a form of cronyism.\nIn 2010, there were 2,607 crown entities (including Board of Trustees) with annual expenditure of $32 billion in 2009/2010.\nUnited Kingdom.\nDespite a 1979 \"commitment\" from the Conservative Party to curb the growth of non-departmental bodies, their numbers grew rapidly throughout that party's time in power during the 1980s. One UK example is the Forestry Commission, which is a non-ministerial government department responsible for forestry in England.\nThe Cabinet Office 2009 report on non-departmental public bodies found that there were 766 NDPBs sponsored by the UK government. The number had been falling: there were 827 in 2007 and 790 in 2008. The number of NDPBs had fallen by over 10% since 1997. Staffing and expenditure of NDPBs had increased. They employed 111,000 people in 2009 and spent \u00a346.5 billion, of which \u00a338.4 billion was directly funded by the government.\nAccording to an analysis done by the Cabinet Office, there were 302 Arm's Length Bodies (or quangos) in the UK in 2022/23, 244 of which were non-departmental public bodies. ALBs employed just over 390,800 staff. By far the biggest ALB was NHS England, receiving over a third of the total funding for all ALBs. NHS England is currently being dissolved, with most of its functions and employees due to be absorbed into the Department for Health and Social Care.\nUnited States.\nUse of the term quango is less common in the United States, although many US bodies, including government-sponsored enterprises, operate in the same fashion. Paul Krugman has stated that the US Federal Reserve is, effectively, \"what the British call a quango... Its complex structure divides power between the federal government and the private banks that are its members, and in effect gives substantial autonomy to a governing board of long-term appointees.\"\nOther U.S.-based organizations that fit the original definition of quangos include the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the National Endowment for Democracy, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).\nBy the broader definition now used in the United Kingdom, there are hundreds of federal agencies that might be classed as quangos.\nIndonesia.\nThe Indonesian Ulema Council is considered a quango for its status as an independent, mass organization-like public organization but supported and financed by the state while keeping its status as independent organization outside the Indonesian state organizational system in other side. As a quango, MUI is empowered to issue religious edicts (fatwas) comparable to state laws which are binding upon the Indonesian Muslim population and can exert influence upon state policies, politics, and the economy due to its status and prestige.\nHistory.\nThe term \"quasi non-governmental organization\" was created in 1967 by Alan Pifer of the US-based Carnegie Foundation, in an essay on the independence and accountability of public-funded bodies that are incorporated in the private sector. This essay got the attention of David Howell, a Conservative M.P. in Britain, who then organized an Anglo-American project with Pifer, to examine the pros and cons of such enterprises. The lengthy term was shortened to the acronym (later lowercased quango) by a British participant to the joint project, Anthony Barker, during one of the conferences on the subject.\nIt describes an ostensibly non-governmental organization performing governmental functions, often in receipt of funding or other support from government. By contrast, traditional NGOs mostly get their donations or funds from the public and other organizations that support their cause.\nAn essential feature of a quango in the original definition was that it should not be a formal part of the state structure. The term was then extended to apply to a range of organisations, such as executive agencies providing (from 1988) health, education and other services. Particularly in the UK, this occurred in a polemical atmosphere in which it was alleged that proliferation of such bodies was undesirable and should be reversed. In this context, the original acronym was often replaced by a backronym spelt out as \"quasi-autonomous national government organisation, and often rendered as 'qango' This spawned the related acronym \"qualgo\", a 'quasi-autonomous \"local\" government organisation'.\nThe less contentious term non-departmental public body (NDPB) is often employed to identify numerous organisations with devolved governmental responsibilities. Examples in the United Kingdom include those engaged in the regulation of various commercial and service sectors, such as the Water Services Regulation Authority.\nThe UK government's definition in 1997 of a non-departmental public body or quango was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A body which has a role in the processes of national government, but is not a government department or part of one, and which accordingly operates to a greater or lesser extent at arm's length from Ministers.\nCriticisms.\n\"The Times\" has accused quangos of bureaucratic waste and excess. In 2005, Dan Lewis, author of \"The Essential Guide to Quangos\", claimed that the UK had 529 quangos, many of which were useless and duplicated the work of others.\nThe term has spawned the derivative quangocrat; the Taxpayers' Alliance faulted a majority of \"quangocrats\" for not making declarations of political activity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can be carried on an archer's body, the bow, or the ground, depending on the type of shooting and the archer's personal preference. Quivers were traditionally made of leather, wood, furs, and other natural materials, but are now often made of metal or plastic. \nEtymology.\nThe English word quiver has its origins in Old French, written as quivre, cuevre, or coivre.\nTypes.\nNorman archers depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. The top left archer was caught unprepared and has hastily thrown his belt quiver about his shoulders, as well as forgetting his helmet.\nBelt quiver.\nThe most common style of quiver is a flat or cylindrical container suspended from the belt. They are found across many cultures from North America to China. Many variations of this type exist, such as being canted forwards or backwards, and being carried on the dominant hand side, off-hand side, or the small of the back. Some variants enclose almost the entire arrow, while minimalist \"pocket quivers\" consist of little more than a small stiff pouch that only covers the first few centimeters. The Bayeux Tapestry shows that most bowmen in medieval Europe used belt quivers.\nBack quiver.\nBack quivers are secured to the archer's back by leather straps, with the nock ends protruding above the dominant hand's shoulder. Arrows can be drawn over the shoulder rapidly by the nock. This style of quiver was used by native peoples of North America and Africa, and was also commonly depicted in bas-reliefs from ancient Assyria. They were also used in Ancient Greece and often feature on sculptural representations of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. While popular in cinema and 20th century art for depictions of medieval European characters (such as Robin Hood), this style of quiver was rarely used in medieval Europe.\nGround quiver.\nA ground quiver is used for both target shooting or warfare when the archer is shooting from a fixed location. They can be simply stakes in the ground with a ring at the top to hold the arrows, or more elaborate designs that hold the arrows within reach without the archer having to lean down to draw.\nBow quiver.\nA modern invention, the bow quiver attaches directly to the bow's limbs and holds the arrows steady with a clip of some kind. They are popular with compound bow hunters as it allows one piece of equipment to be carried in the field without encumbering the hunter's body.\nArrow bag.\nA style used by medieval English longbowmen and several other cultures, an arrow bag is a simple drawstring cloth sack with a leather spacer at the top to keep the arrows divided. When not in use, the drawstring could be closed, completely covering the arrows so as to protect them from rain and dirt. Some had straps or rope sewn to them for carrying, but many either were tucked into the belt or set on the ground before battle to allow easier access.\nJapanese quivers.\nYebira refers to a variety of quiver designs. The Yazutsu is a different type, used in Kyudo. Their main use is to transport and protect arrows.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This includes the treatment of malaria due to \"Plasmodium falciparum\" that is resistant to chloroquine when artesunate is not available. While sometimes used for nocturnal leg cramps, quinine is not recommended for this purpose due to the risk of serious side effects. It can be taken by mouth or intravenously. Malaria resistance to quinine occurs in certain areas of the world. Quinine is also used as an ingredient in tonic water and other beverages to impart a bitter taste.\nCommon side effects include headache, ringing in the ears, vision issues, and sweating. More severe side effects include deafness, low blood platelets, and an irregular heartbeat. Use can make one more prone to sunburn. While it is unclear if use during pregnancy carries potential for fetal harm, treating malaria during pregnancy with quinine when appropriate is still recommended. Quinine is an alkaloid, a naturally occurring chemical compound. It possesses a quinoline functional group (pyridine fused to benzene). \nQuinine was first isolated in 1820 from the bark of a cinchona tree, which is native to Peru, and its molecular formula was determined by Adolph Strecker in 1854. The class of chemical compounds to which it belongs is thus called the cinchona alkaloids. Bark extracts had been used to treat malaria since at least 1632 and it was introduced to Spain as early as 1636 by Jesuit missionaries returning from the New World. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Treatment of malaria with quinine marks the first known use of a chemical compound to treat an infectious disease.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUses.\nMedical.\nAs of 2006, quinine is no longer recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a first-line treatment for malaria, because there are other substances that are equally effective with fewer side effects. They recommend that it be used only when artemisinins are not available. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis.\nQuinine was frequently prescribed as an off-label treatment for leg cramps at night, but this has become less common since 2010 due to a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that such practice is associated with life-threatening side effects. Quinine can also act as a competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that removes neurotransmitters from the brain. As an MAO inhibitor, it has potential to serve as a treatment for individuals with psychological disorders, similar to antidepressants that inhibit MAO.\nAvailable forms.\nQuinine is a basic amine and is usually provided as a salt. Various existing preparations include the hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate and gluconate. In the United States, quinine sulfate is commercially available in 324\u00a0mg tablets under the brand name Qualaquin.\nAll quinine salts may be given orally or intravenously (IV); quinine gluconate may also be given intramuscularly (IM) or rectally (PR). The main problem with rectal administration is that the dose can be expelled before it is completely absorbed; in practice, this is corrected by giving a further half dose. No injectable preparation of quinine is licensed in the US; quinidine is used instead.\nBeverages.\nQuinine is a flavor component of tonic water and bitter lemon soft drinks. On the soda gun behind many bars, tonic water is designated by the letter \"Q\" representing quinine.\nTonic water was initially marketed as a means of delivering quinine to consumers in order to offer anti-malarial protection. According to tradition, because of the bitter taste of anti-malarial quinine tonic, British colonials in India mixed it with gin to make it more palatable, thus creating the gin and tonic cocktail, which is still popular today. While it is possible to drink enough tonic water to temporarily achieve quinine levels that offer anti-malarial protection, it is not a sustainable long-term means of protection.\nIn France, quinine is an ingredient of an known as , or \"Cap Corse\", and the wine-based Dubonnet. In Spain, quinine (also known as \"Peruvian bark\" for its origin from the native cinchona tree) is sometimes blended into sweet Malaga wine, which is then called \"Malaga Quina\". In Italy, the traditional flavoured wine Barolo Chinato is infused with quinine and local herbs, and is served as a . In Britain, the company A.G. Barr uses quinine as an ingredient in the carbonated and caffeinated beverage Irn-Bru. In Uruguay and Argentina, quinine is an ingredient of a PepsiCo tonic water named Paso de los Toros. In Denmark, it is used as an ingredient in the carbonated sports drink Faxe Kondi made by Royal Unibrew.\nAs a flavouring agent in drinks, quinine is limited to 83\u00a0ppm (83 mg/L) in the United States, to 85\u00a0mg/L in Taiwan, and to 100\u00a0mg/L in the European Union.\nDirect use of cinchona bark in beverages is also allowed in the US, with a maximum allowed total cinchona alkaloid level of 83\u00a0ppm in the finished beverage.\nScientific.\nQuinine (and quinidine) are used as the chiral moiety for the ligands used in Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as well as for numerous other chiral catalyst backbones. Because of its relatively constant and well-known fluorescence quantum yield, quinine is used in photochemistry as a common fluorescence standard.\nContraindications.\nBecause of the narrow difference between its therapeutic and toxic effects, quinine is a common cause of drug-induced disorders, including thrombocytopenia and thrombotic microangiopathy. Even from minor levels occurring in common beverages, quinine can have severe adverse effects involving multiple organ systems, among which are immune system effects and fever, hypotension, hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, liver toxicity, and blindness. In people with atrial fibrillation, conduction defects, or heart block, quinine can cause heart arrhythmias, and should be avoided.\nQuinine can cause hemolysis in G6PD deficiency (an inherited deficiency), but this risk is small and the physician should not hesitate to use quinine in people with G6PD deficiency when there is no alternative.\nWhile not necessarily an absolute contraindication, concomitant administration of quinine with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 may lead to higher than expected plasma concentrations of the drug, due to quinine's strong inhibition of the enzyme.\nAdverse effects.\nQuinine can cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening blood and cardiovascular reactions including low platelet count and hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP), long QT syndrome and other serious cardiac arrhythmias including \"torsades de pointes\", blackwater fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukopenia, and neutropenia. Some people who have developed TTP due to quinine have gone on to develop kidney failure. It can also cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock, urticaria, serious skin rashes, including Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, facial edema, bronchospasm, granulomatous hepatitis, and itchiness.\nThe most common adverse effects involve a group of symptoms called cinchonism, which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception. More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms. Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many people will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets). Other drugs, such as Fansidar (sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine) or Malarone (proguanil with atovaquone), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate (quinine etabonate) is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.\nQuinine has diverse unwanted interactions with numerous prescription drugs, such as potentiating the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. It is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs.\nMechanism of action.\nQuinine is used for its toxicity to the malarial pathogen, \"Plasmodium falciparum\", by interfering with its ability to dissolve and metabolize hemoglobin. As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the precise mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved, although in vitro studies indicate it inhibits nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and inhibits glycolysis in \"P. falciparum\". The most widely accepted hypothesis of its action is based on the well-studied and closely related quinoline drug, chloroquine. This model involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization in the heme detoxification pathway, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing their deaths. Quinine may target the malaria purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme.\nChemistry.\nThe UV absorption of quinine peaks around 350\u00a0nm (in UVA). Fluorescent emission peaks at around 460\u00a0nm (bright blue/cyan hue). Quinine is highly fluorescent (quantum yield ~0.58) in 0.1\u00a0M sulfuric acid solution.\nSynthesis.\nCinchona trees remain the only economically practical source of quinine. However, under wartime pressure during World War II, research towards its synthetic production was undertaken. A formal chemical synthesis was accomplished in 1944 by American chemists R.B. Woodward and W.E. Doering. Since then, several more efficient quinine total syntheses have been achieved, but none of them can compete in economic terms with isolation of the alkaloid from natural sources. The first synthetic organic dye, mauveine, was discovered by William Henry Perkin in 1856 while he was attempting to synthesize quinine.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn the first step of quinine biosynthesis, the enzyme strictosidine synthase catalyzes a stereoselective Pictet\u2013Spengler reaction between tryptamine and secologanin to yield strictosidine. Suitable modification of strictosidine leads to an aldehyde. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation would initially remove one carbon from the iridoid portion and produce corynantheal. Then the tryptamine side-chain were cleaved adjacent to the nitrogen, and this nitrogen was then bonded to the acetaldehyde function to yield cinchonaminal. Ring opening in the indole heterocyclic ring could generate new amine and keto functions. The new quinoline heterocycle would then be formed by combining this amine with the aldehyde produced in the tryptamine side-chain cleavage, giving cinchonidinone. For the last step, hydroxylation and methylation gives quinine.\nCatalysis.\nQuinine and other \"Cinchona\" alkaloids can be used as catalysts for stereoselective reactions in organic synthesis.Table 3B Plate 560 For example, the quinine-catalyzed Michael addition of a malononitrile to \u03b1,\u03b2-enones gives a high degree of stereochemical control.\nHistory.\nQuinine was used as a muscle relaxant by the Quechua people, who are indigenous to Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, to halt shivering. The Quechua would mix the ground bark of cinchona trees with sweetened water to offset the bark's bitter taste, thus producing something similar to tonic water.\nSpanish Jesuit missionaries were the first to bring cinchona to Europe. The Spanish had observed the Quechua's use of cinchona and were aware of the medicinal properties of cinchona bark by the 1570s or earlier: Nicol\u00e1s Monardes (1571) and Juan Fragoso (1572) both described a tree, which was subsequently identified as the cinchona tree, whose bark was used to produce a drink to treat diarrhea. Quinine has been used in unextracted form by Europeans since at least the early 17th century.\nA popular story of how it was brought to Europe by the Countess of Chinchon was debunked by medical historian Alec Haggis around 1941. During the 17th century, malaria was endemic to the swamps and marshes surrounding the city of Rome. It had caused the deaths of several popes, many cardinals and countless common Roman citizens. Most of the Catholic priests trained in Rome had seen malaria patients and were familiar with the shivering brought on by the febrile phase of the disease.\nThe Jesuit Agostino Salumbrino (1564\u20131642), an apothecary by training who lived in Lima (now in present-day Peru), observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree to treat such shivering. While its effect in treating malaria (and malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from rigors, it was a successful medicine against malaria. At the first opportunity, Salumbrino sent a small quantity to Rome for testing as a malaria treatment. In the years that followed, cinchona bark, known as Jesuit's bark or Peruvian bark, became one of the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe. When King Charles II was cured of malaria at the end of the 17th Century with quinine, it became popular in London. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs took over.\nThe form of quinine most effective in treating malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737. In 1820, French researchers Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaim\u00e9 Caventou first isolated quinine from the bark of a tree in the genus \"Cinchona\" \u2013 probably \"Cinchona pubescens\" \u2013 and subsequently named the substance. The name was derived from the original Quechua (Inca) word for the cinchona tree bark, \"quina\" or \"quina-quina\", which means \"bark of bark\" or \"holy bark\". Prior to 1820, the bark was dried, ground to a fine powder, and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) in order to be drunk. Large-scale use of quinine as a malaria prophylaxis started around 1850. In 1853 Paul Briquet published a brief history and discussion of the literature on \"quinquina\".\nQuinine played a significant role in the colonization of Africa by Europeans. The availability of quinine for treatment had been said to be the prime reason Africa ceased to be known as the \"white man's grave\". A historian said, \"it was quinine's efficacy that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other parts of west Africa\".\nTo maintain their monopoly on cinchona bark, Peru and surrounding countries began outlawing the export of cinchona seeds and saplings in the early 19th century. In 1865, Manuel Incra Mamani collected seeds from a plant particularly high in quinine and provided them to Charles Ledger. Ledger sent them to his brother, who sold them to the Dutch government. Mamani was arrested on a seed collecting trip in 1871, and beaten so severely, likely because of providing the seeds to foreigners, that he died soon afterwards.\nBy the late 19th century the Dutch grew the plants in Indonesian plantations. Soon they became the main suppliers of the tree. In 1913 they set up the Kina Bureau, a cartel of cinchona producers charged with controlling price and production. By the 1930s Dutch plantations in Java were producing 22 million pounds of cinchona bark, or 97% of the world's quinine production. U.S. attempts to prosecute the Kina Bureau proved unsuccessful.\nDuring World War II, Allied powers were cut off from their supply of quinine when Germany conquered the Netherlands, and Japan controlled the Philippines and Indonesia. The US had obtained four million cinchona seeds from the Philippines and began operating cinchona plantations in Costa Rica. Additionally, they began harvesting wild cinchona bark during the Cinchona Missions. Such supplies came too late. Tens of thousands of US troops in Africa and the South Pacific died of malaria due to the lack of quinine. Despite controlling the supply, the Japanese did not make effective use of quinine, and thousands of Japanese troops in the southwest Pacific died as a result.\nQuinine remained the antimalarial drug of choice until after World War II. Since then, other drugs that have fewer side effects, such as chloroquine, have largely replaced it.\n\"Bromo Quinine\" were brand name cold tablets containing quinine, manufactured by Grove Laboratories. They were first marketed in 1889 and available until at least the 1960s.\nConducting research in central Missouri, John S. Sappington independently developed an anti-malaria pill from quinine. Sappington began importing cinchona bark from Peru in 1820. In 1832, using quinine derived from the cinchona bark, Sappington developed a pill to treat a variety of fevers, such as scarlet fever, yellow fever, and influenza in addition to malaria. These illnesses were widespread in the Missouri and Mississippi valleys. He manufactured and sold \"Dr. Sappington's Anti-Fever Pills\" across Missouri. Demand became so great that within three years, Sappington founded a company known as Sappington and Sons to sell his pills nationwide.\nSociety and culture.\nNatural occurrence.\nThe bark of \"Remijia\" contains 0.5\u20132% of quinine. The bark is cheaper than bark of \"Cinchona\". As it has an intense taste, it is used for making tonic water.\nRegulation in the US.\nFrom 1969 to 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 157 reports of health problems related to quinine use, including 23 which had resulted in death. In 1994, the FDA banned the marketing of over-the-counter quinine as a treatment for nocturnal leg cramps. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals had been selling the brand name Legatrin for this purpose. It is also sold as a softgel (by SmithKlineBeecham) as Q-vel. Doctors may still prescribe quinine, but the FDA has ordered firms to stop marketing unapproved drug products containing quinine. The FDA is also cautioning consumers about off-label use of quinine to treat leg cramps. Quinine is approved for treatment of malaria, but was also commonly prescribed to treat leg cramps and similar conditions. Because malaria is life-threatening, the risks associated with quinine use are considered acceptable when used to treat that condition.\nThough Legatrin was banned by the FDA for the treatment of leg cramps, the drug manufacturer URL Mutual has branded a quinine-containing drug named Qualaquin. It is marketed as a treatment for malaria and is sold in the United States only by prescription. In 2004, the CDC reported only 1,347 confirmed cases of malaria in the United States.\nTermination of pregnancy.\nFor much of the 20th century, women's use of an overdose of quinine to deliberately terminate a pregnancy was a relatively common abortion method in various parts of the world, including China.\nCutting agent.\nQuinine is sometimes detected as a cutting agent in street drugs such as cocaine and heroin.\nOther animals.\nQuinine is used as a treatment for \"Cryptocaryon irritans\" (commonly referred to as white spot, crypto or marine ich) infection of marine aquarium fish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"quarrel\" is from the Old French \"quarrel\" (&gt; French \"carreau\") \"square thing\", specialized use as \"quarrel d'arcbaleste\" (&gt; \"carreau d'arbal\u00e8te\") \"crossbow quarrel\", referring to their typically square heads. Although their lengths vary, bolts are typically shorter and heavier than traditional arrows shot with longbows.\nParts of the bolt.\nPoint.\nThe point, also called the \"head\" or the \"tip\", is the pointed and weighted front end of the bolt, which is sharp and hard so that it can penetrate the target.\nShaft.\nThe shaft is the main body of the bolt to which other parts of the bolt are attached. In modern times it is normally made of carbon fibre or aluminium alloy (or sometimes both aluminum and carbon fibre are used), and is very lightweight for its strength. Shafts come with varying degrees of stiffness \u2014 referred to as the \"spine\" of the bolt. The more resistant to bending a bolt is, the more \"spine\" it is said to have, and a crossbow with higher draw weight ideally needs to be paired with a heavier bolt point and higher spine specifications. The weight of a shaft is usually in grains, and product descriptions may provide the total weight in grains, or in grains per inch (GPI), for which the total weight of shaft can be calculated by multiplying the GPI value with length of shaft in inches.\nFletching.\nFletchings, also referred to as \"vanes\", are fins located at the rear end of the shaft just before the nock. The fletching is typically made from soft light materials such as feathers, plastic or silicone rubber. They stabilize the trajectory of the bolt via three different means: resisting pitching and yawing of the shaft by acting like a stabilizer fin (fin-stabilization); reducing deviation from the longitudinal axis by creating a back-pulling center of pressure behind the bolt's center of mass (drag-stabilization); and in some particular cases, creating a rotation around the longitudinal axis (spin-stabilization) by having the fletchings mounted at a slight angle of attack.\nThere is no rule or formula for determining the length of fletching needed \u2014 generally the longer the shaft is, the longer the fletching needs to be, and vice versa.\nNock.\nA nock is a small notched piece that is attached to the rear end of the shaft, for engaging and receiving the propulsive push from the string during shooting. Nocks are made of either plastic or aluminum.\nSize and weight.\nThere is not any hard and fast rule of bolt sizing. Generally, the bolts are 15 to 22 inches long but the standard length is 20 inches. Experts recommend longer bolts but they have certain disadvantages as well.\nThe weight of the bolt can have a serious effect on the range of the bolt. The bolt's total weight includes the bolt's weight, nock, insert, vanes, and broadhead or field point. Almost all bolt manufacturers will list how many grains each shaft weighs or how many grains are in each inch of the shaft. A more massive bolt, e.g. at least 400 grains, will have better downrange energy and offer better penetration but will travel more slowly and thus drop more due to gravity during its flight. A lighter bolt will fly quicker and give the shooter a longer range, but might not have the desired penetration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25308", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25308", "title": "Quasispecies model", "text": "Darwinian evolution of self-replicating entities within framework of physical chemistry\nThe quasispecies model is a description of the process of the Darwinian evolution of certain self-replicating entities within the framework of physical chemistry. A quasispecies is a large group or \"cloud\" of related genotypes that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent. This is in contrast to a species, which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.\nIt is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as RNA or DNA or simple asexual organisms such as bacteria or viruses (see also viral quasispecies), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the origin of life. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster based on initial work done by Eigen.\nSimplified explanation.\nWhen evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies. (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive \"fidelity\".) In evolutionary terms, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.\nSome organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations. A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless. Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other. For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again. Thus we can envision a \"cloud\" of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud. Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.\nQuasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.\nQuasispecies, fitness, and evolutionary selection.\nIn a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes. If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species. Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype's fitness.\nIn a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can't amount to much because that genotype's offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties. Instead, what matters is the \"connectedness\" of the cloud. For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on. If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud. If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.\nWhen the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.\nApplication to biological research.\nQuasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as HIV and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms. Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and Emmanuel David Tannenbaum to model the evolution of sexual reproduction. Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the Gard model for abiogenesis) and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell's replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.\nFormal background.\nThe model rests on four assumptions:\nIn the quasispecies model, mutations occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, selection arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.\nDue to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational \"clouds\" of closely related sequences, referred to as \"quasispecies\". In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate. Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in \"in vitro\" RNA replication.\nThe mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the error threshold, the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.\nMathematical description.\nA simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows: let there be formula_1 possible sequences and let there be formula_2 organisms with sequence \"i\". Let's say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to formula_3 offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence \"i\", but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate formula_4 correspond to the probability that a \"j\" type parent will produce an \"i\" type organism. Then the expected fraction of offspring generated by \"j\" type organisms that would be \"i\" type organisms is formula_5,\nwhere formula_6.\nThen the total number of \"i\"-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as formula_7, is\nformula_8\nSometimes a death rate term formula_9 is included so that:\nformula_10\nwhere formula_11 is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the \"n-th\" generation can be found by just taking the \"n-th\" power of W substituting it in place of W in the above formula.\nThis is just a system of linear equations. The usual way to solve such a system is to first diagonalize the W matrix. Its diagonal entries will be eigenvalues corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be eigenvectors of the W matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies. Assuming that the matrix W is a primitive matrix (irreducible and aperiodic), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.\nNote about primitive matrices.\nW being primitive means that for some integer formula_12, that the formula_13 power of W is &gt; 0, i.e. all the entries are positive. If W is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of W) mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. W is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.\nAlternative formulations.\nThe quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state formula_7 and the old state formula_2 to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of formula_2 is given by this difference, formula_17 we can write:\nformula_18\nThe quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations formula_19 where\nformula_20.\nformula_21.\nThe above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:\nformula_22\nor, for the continuum version:\nformula_23\nSimple example.\nThe quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let's say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let's say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, formula_24 replicas of themselves, and formula_25 of each of the other two types, where formula_26. The W matrix is then:\nformula_27.\nThe diagonalized matrix is:\nformula_28.\nAnd the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:\nOnly the eigenvalue formula_29 is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be formula_30 and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive, the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It's seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The last imperial dynasty in Chinese history, the Qing dynasty was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. At its height of power, the empire stretched from the Sea of Japan in the east to the Pamir Mountains in the west, and from the Mongolian Plateau in the north to the South China Sea in the south. Originally emerging from the Later Jin dynasty founded in 1616 and proclaimed in Shenyang in 1636, the dynasty seized control of the Ming capital Beijing and North China in 1644, traditionally considered the start of the dynasty's rule. The dynasty lasted until the Xinhai Revolution of October 1911 led to the abdication of the last emperor in February 1912. The multi-ethnic Qing dynasty assembled the territorial base for modern China. The Qing controlled the most territory of any dynasty in Chinese history, and in 1790 represented the fourth-largest empire in world history to that point. With over 426\u00a0million citizens in 1907, it was the most populous country at the time.\nNurhaci, leader of the Jianzhou Jurchens and House of Aisin-Gioro who was also a vassal of the Ming dynasty, unified Jurchen clans (known later as Manchus) and founded the Later Jin dynasty in 1616, renouncing the Ming overlordship. As the founding Khan of the Manchu state he established the Eight Banners military system, and his son Hong Taiji was declared Emperor of the Great Qing in 1636. As Ming control disintegrated, peasant rebels captured Beijing as the short-lived Shun dynasty, but the Ming general Wu Sangui opened the Shanhai Pass to the Qing army, which defeated the rebels, seized the capital, and took over the government in 1644 under the Shunzhi Emperor and his prince regent. While the Qing became a Chinese empire, resistance from Ming rump regimes and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories delayed the complete conquest until 1683, which marked the beginning of the High Qing era. As an emperor of Manchu ethnic origin, the Kangxi Emperor (1661\u20131722) consolidated control, relished the role of a Confucian ruler, patronised Buddhism, encouraged scholarship, population and economic growth.\nTo maintain prominence over its neighbors, the Qing leveraged and adapted the traditional tributary system employed by previous dynasties, enabling their continued predominance in affairs with countries on its periphery like Joseon Korea and the L\u00ea dynasty in Vietnam, while extending its control over Inner Asia. The Qing dynasty reached its apex during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1735\u20131796), who led the Ten Great Campaigns of conquest, and personally supervised Confucian cultural projects. After his death, the dynasty faced internal revolts, economic disruption, official corruption, foreign intrusion, and the reluctance of Confucian elites to change their mindset. With peace and prosperity, the population rose to 400 million, but taxes and government revenues were fixed at a low rate, soon leading to a fiscal crisis. Following China's defeat in the Opium Wars, Western colonial powers forced the Qing government to sign unequal treaties, granting them trading privileges, extraterritoriality and treaty ports under their control. The Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864) and the Dungan Revolt (1862\u20131877) in western China led to the deaths of over 20 million people, from famine, disease, and war.\nThe Tongzhi Restoration in the 1860s brought vigorous reforms and the introduction of foreign military technology in the Self-Strengthening Movement. Defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) led to loss of suzerainty over Korea and cession of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan. The ambitious Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 proposed fundamental change, but was poorly executed and terminated by the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835\u20131908) in the Wuxu Coup. In 1900, anti-foreign Boxers killed many Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries; in retaliation, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China and imposed a punitive indemnity. In response, the government initiated unprecedented fiscal and administrative reforms, including elections, a new legal code, and the abolition of the imperial examination system. Sun Yat-sen and revolutionaries debated reform officials and constitutional monarchists such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao over how to transform the Manchu-ruled empire into a modernised Han state. After the deaths of the Guangxu Emperor and Cixi in 1908, Manchu conservatives at court blocked reforms. The Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911 led to the Xinhai Revolution. The abdication of the Xuantong Emperor on 12 February 1912 brought the dynasty to an end.\nNames.\nHong Taiji proclaimed the \"Great Qing\" dynasty in 1636. There are competing explanations as to the meaning of the Chinese character in this context. One theory posits a purposeful contrast with the Ming: the character is associated with fire within the Chinese zodiacal system, while is associated with water, illustrating the triumph of the Qing as the conquest of fire by water. The name possibly also possessed Buddhist implications of perspicacity and enlightenment, as well as connection with the bodhisattva Manjusri.\nEarly European writers used the term \"Tartar\" indiscriminately for all the peoples of Northern Eurasia but in the 17th century Catholic missionary writings established \"Tartar\" to refer only to the Manchus and \"Tartary\" for the lands they ruled\u2014i.e. Manchuria and the adjacent parts of Inner Asia, as ruled by the Qing before the Ming\u2013Qing transition.\nAfter conquering China proper, the Manchus identified their state as \"China\", equivalently as in Chinese and in Manchu. The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including, among other areas, present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that only Han areas were properly part of \"China\". The government used \"China\" and \"Qing\" interchangeably to refer to their state in official documents, including the Chinese-language versions of treaties and maps of the world. The term 'Chinese people' (; Manchu: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:MongolUnicode/fonts.css\" /&gt;\u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\u1828\u1873\u1836\u1820\u182f\u182e\u1820 ) referred to all the Han, Manchu, and Mongol subjects of the Qing Empire. When the Qing conquered Dzungaria in 1759, it proclaimed within a Manchu-language memorial that the new land had been absorbed into \"China\". The Qing government expounded an ideology that it was bringing the \"outer\" non-Han peoples\u2014such as various populations of Mongolians, as well as the Tibetans\u2014together with the \"inner\" Han Chinese into \"one family\", united within the Qing state. Phraseology like and \u2014both translatable as 'home and abroad as one family'\u2014was employed to convey this idea of Qing-mediated trans-cultural unity.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Qing dynasty was founded not by Han Chinese, who constituted a majority of the population, but by Manchus, a sedentary farming people descended from the Jurchens, a Tungusic people who lived in the region now comprising the Chinese provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang.\nNurhaci.\nThe early form of the Manchu state was founded by Nurhaci, the chieftain of a minor Jurchen tribe\u00a0\u2013 the Aisin-Gioro\u00a0\u2013 in Jianzhou in the early 17th century. Nurhaci may have spent time in a Han household in his youth, and became fluent in Chinese and Mongolian languages and read the Chinese novels \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and \"Water Margin\". As a vassal of the Ming emperors, he officially considered himself a guardian of the Ming border and a local representative of the Ming dynasty. Nurhaci embarked on an intertribal feud in 1582 that escalated into a campaign to unify the nearby tribes. He also began organizing the Eight Banners military system which included Manchu, Han, and Mongol elements. By 1616, however, he had sufficiently consolidated Jianzhou so as to be able to proclaim himself Khan of the Later Jin dynasty in reference to the previous Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty.\nTwo years later, Nurhaci announced the \"Seven Grievances\" and openly renounced the sovereignty of Ming overlordship in order to complete the unification of those Jurchen tribes still allied with the Ming emperor. After a series of successful battles, he relocated his capital from Hetu Ala to successively bigger captured Ming cities in Liaodong: first Liaoyang in 1621, then Mukden (Shenyang) in 1625. Furthermore, the Khorchin proved a useful ally in the war, lending the Jurchens their expertise as cavalry archers. To guarantee this new alliance, Nurhaci initiated a policy of inter-marriages between the Jurchen and Khorchin nobilities, while those who resisted were met with military action. This is a typical example of Nurhaci's initiatives that eventually became official Qing government policy. During most of the Qing period, the Mongols gave military assistance to the Manchus.\nHong Taiji.\nNurhaci died in 1626, and was succeeded by his eighth son, Hong Taiji. Although Hong Taiji was an experienced leader and the commander of two Banners, the Jurchens suffered defeat in 1627, in part due to the Ming's newly acquired Portuguese cannons. To redress the technological and numerical disparity, Hong Taiji in 1634 created his own artillery corps, who cast their own cannons in the European design with the help of defector Chinese metallurgists. One of the defining events of Hong Taiji's reign was the official adoption of the name \"Manchu\" for the united Jurchen people in November 1635. In 1635, the Manchus' Mongol allies were fully incorporated into a separate Banner hierarchy under direct Manchu command. In April 1636, Mongol nobility of Inner Mongolia, Manchu nobility and the Han mandarin recommended that Hong as the khan of Later Jin should be the emperor of the Great Qing. When he was presented with the imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty after the defeat of the last Khagan of the Mongols, Hong Taiji renamed his state from \"Great Jin\" to \"Great Qing\" and elevated his position from Khan to Emperor, suggesting imperial ambitions beyond unifying the Manchu territories. Hong Taiji then proceeded to invade Korea again in 1636.\nMeanwhile, Hong Taiji set up a rudimentary bureaucratic system based on the Ming model. He established six boards or executive level ministries in 1631 to oversee finance, personnel, rites, military, punishments, and public works. However, these administrative organs had very little role initially, and it was not until the eve of completing the conquest ten years later that they fulfilled their government roles.\nHong Taiji staffed his bureaucracy with many Han Chinese, including newly surrendered Ming officials, but ensured Manchu dominance by an ethnic quota for top appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong according to how much grain they had. Due to a Han revolt in 1623, Nurhaci turned against them and enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them. He ordered that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally with Jurchens, not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji recognised the need to attract Han Chinese, explaining to reluctant Manchus why he needed to treat the defecting Ming general Hong Chengchou leniently. Hong Taiji incorporated Han into the Jurchen polity as citizens obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry.\nClaiming the Mandate of Heaven.\nHong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643. As Jurchen leaders were chosen by a council of nobles, there was no clear successor. The leading contenders for power were Hong Taiji's oldest son Hooge and Hong Taiji's half brother Dorgon. A compromise installed Hong Taiji's five-year-old son, Fulin, as the Shunzhi Emperor, with Dorgon as regent and de facto leader of the Manchu nation.\nMeanwhile, Ming government officials fought against fiscal collapse, against each other, and against a series of peasant rebellions. They were unable to capitalise on the Manchu succession dispute and the resulting boy emperor. In April 1644, Beijing was sacked by a contentious rebel coalition led by Li Zicheng, a former minor Ming official, who established a short-lived Shun dynasty. The last Ming ruler, the Chongzhen Emperor, committed suicide when the city fell to the rebels, marking the effective end of the dynasty.\nLi Zicheng then led rebel forces numbering some 200,000 to confront Ming general Wu Sangui, stationed at Shanhai Pass of the Great Wall to defend the capital against the approaching Manchu-led armies. Wu, to survive, had to ally with one of his adversaries against the other; one was a Han Chinese peasant army twice his size, but he chose the other. Wu may have resented Li Zicheng's attack on officials and the social order; Li had taken Wu's father hostage and it was said that Li took Wu's concubine for himself. On the other hand, the Manchus had adopted a Chinese-style form of government and promised stability. Wu and Dorgon allied to defeat Li Zicheng in the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May 1644.\nThe newly allied armies captured Beijing on 6 June. The Shunzhi Emperor was invested as the \"Son of Heaven\" on 30 October 1644. The Manchus, who had positioned themselves as political heirs to the Ming, held a formal funeral for the Chongzhen Emperor. However, completing the conquest of China proper took another seventeen years of battling Ming loyalists, pretenders and rebels. The last Ming pretender, Prince Gui, sought refuge with Pindale Min, the king of Burma, but was turned over to a Qing expeditionary army commanded by Wu Sangui, who had him brought back to Yunnan and executed in early 1662.\nThe Qing had taken shrewd advantage of Ming civilian government discrimination against the military and encouraged the Ming military to defect by spreading the message that the Manchus valued their skills. Banners made up of Han Chinese who defected before 1644 were classed among the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges. Han defectors swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners so greatly that ethnic Manchus became a minority\u00a0\u2013 only 16% in 1648, with Han bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol bannermen making up the rest. Gunpowder weapons like muskets and artillery were wielded by the Chinese Banners. Normally, Han Chinese defector troops were deployed as the vanguard, while Manchu bannermen were used predominantly for quick strikes with maximum impact, so as to minimise ethnic Manchu losses.\nThis multi-ethnic force conquered Ming China for the Qing. The three Liaodong officers who played key roles in the conquest of southern China were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde, who governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing after the conquest. Han bannermen made up the majority of governors during the early Qing, stabilising their rule. To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or with the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Later in the dynasty the policies allowing intermarriage were done away with. The Qing's depiction of itself as a Chinese empire was not hindered by the imperial house's Manchu ethnicity, especially after 1644, when the name \"Chinese\" was given a multiethnic meaning.\nThe first seven years of the young Shunzhi Emperor's reign were dominated by Dorgon's regency. Because of his own political insecurity, Dorgon followed Hong Taiji's example by ruling in the name of the emperor at the expense of rival Manchu princes, many of whom he demoted or imprisoned. Dorgon's precedents and example cast a long shadow. First, the Manchus had entered \"South of the Wall\" because Dorgon had responded decisively to Wu Sangui's appeal, then, instead of sacking Beijing as the rebels had done, Dorgon insisted, over the protests of other Manchu princes, on making it the dynastic capital and reappointing most Ming officials. No major Chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor's capital, but keeping the Ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly stabilize the regime and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country. Dorgon then drastically reduced the influence of the eunuchs and directed Manchu women not to bind their feet in the Han Chinese style.\nHowever, not all of Dorgon's policies were equally popular or as easy to implement. The controversial July 1645 Queue Order forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The order triggered strong resistance in Jiangnan. In the ensuing unrest, some 100,000 Han were slaughtered.\nOn 31 December 1650, Dorgon died suddenly, marking the start of the Shunzhi Emperor's personal rule. Because the emperor was only 12 years old at that time, most decisions were made on his behalf by his mother, Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, who turned out to be a skilled political operator. Although his support had been essential to Shunzhi's ascent, Dorgon had centralised so much power in his hands as to become a direct threat to the throne. So much so that upon his death he was bestowed the extraordinary posthumous title of Emperor Yi (), the only instance in Qing history in which a Manchu \"prince of the blood\" () was so honoured. Two months into Shunzhi's personal rule, however, Dorgon was not only stripped of his titles, but his corpse was disinterred and mutilated. Dorgon's fall from grace also led to the purge of his family and associates at court. Shunzhi's promising start was cut short by his early death in 1661 at the age of 24 from smallpox. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who reigned as the Kangxi Emperor.\nThe Manchus sent Han bannermen to fight against Koxinga's Ming loyalists in Fujian. They removed the population from coastal areas in order to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources. This led to a misunderstanding that Manchus were afraid of water. Han bannermen carried out the fighting and killing, casting conquest of the Mingdoubt on the claim that fear of the water led to the coastal evacuation and ban on maritime activities. Even though a poem refers to the soldiers carrying out massacres in Fujian as \"barbarians\", both Han Green Standard Army and Han bannermen were involved and carried out the worst slaughter. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories in addition to the 200,000 bannermen.\nKangxi Emperor's reign and consolidation.\nThe 61-year reign of the Kangxi Emperor was the longest of any emperor in Chinese history, and marked the beginning of the High Qing era, the zenith of the dynasty's social, economic and military power. The early Manchu rulers established two foundations of legitimacy that help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture that they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. His attempts to discourage Chinese women from foot binding, however, were unsuccessful.\nThe second major source of stability was the Inner Asian aspect of their Manchu identity, which allowed them to appeal to the Mongol, Tibetan and Muslim subjects. Qing emperors adopted different images for these subjects in their multi-ethnic empire. The Qing used the title of Emperor (\"Huangdi\" or \"h\u016bwangdi\"), along with Son of Heaven and \"Ejen\" in Chinese and Manchu. Like Kublai Khan of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty, Qing rulers like the Qianlong Emperor portrayed the image of themselves as Buddhist sage rulers (wheel-turning kings), patrons of Tibetan Buddhism to maintain legitimacy for Tibetan Buddhists. Mongol subjects also commonly referred to the Qing ruler as Bogda Khan, while Turkic Muslim subjects (now known as the Uyghurs) commonly referred to the Qing ruler as Chinese khagan.\nKangxi's reign began when the young emperor was seven. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's monopolising of power, on his deathbed his father hastily appointed four regents who were not closely related to the imperial family and had no claim to the throne. However, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four, gradually achieved such dominance as to be a potential threat. In 1669, Kangxi disarmed and imprisoned Oboi through trickery\u00a0\u2013 a significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor. The young emperor faced challenges in maintaining control of his kingdom, as well. Three Ming generals singled out for their contributions to the establishment of the dynasty had been granted governorships in southern China. They became increasingly autonomous, leading to the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, which lasted for eight years. Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China, which took several decades to recover.\nTo extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor expelled Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Formosa (Taiwan) from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for a series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. Galdan was ultimately killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War; after his death, his Tibetan Buddhist followers attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.\nReigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors.\nThe reigns of the Yongzheng Emperor (r.\u20091723\u00a0\u2013\u00a01735) and his son, the Qianlong Emperor (r.\u20091735\u00a0\u2013\u00a01796), marked the height of Qing power. However, the historian Jonathan Spence notes that the empire at the end of Qianlong's reign was \"like the sun at midday\". Despite \"many glories\", \"signs of decay and even collapse were becoming apparent\".\nAfter the death of the Kangxi Emperor in the winter of 1722, his fourth son, Prince Yong (), became the Yongzheng Emperor. He felt a sense of urgency about the problems that had accumulated in his father's later years. In the words of one recent historian, he was \"severe, suspicious, and jealous, but extremely capable and resourceful\", and in the words of another, he turned out to be an \"early modern state-maker of the first order\". First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and cracked down on unorthodox sects. In 1723, he outlawed Christianity and expelled most Christian missionaries. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials, which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and he created a small Grand Council of personal advisors, which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realise the extent of the financial crisis, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local elites and enforced collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \"money to nourish honesty\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangtze valley there were long-established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence. The fiscal crisis persisted.\nYongzheng also inherited diplomatic and strategic problems. A team made up entirely of Manchus drew up the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta to solidify the diplomatic understanding with Russia. In exchange for territory and trading rights, the Qing would have a free hand in dealing with the situation in Mongolia. Yongzheng then turned to that situation, where the Zunghars threatened to re-emerge, and to the southwest, where local Miao chieftains resisted Qing expansion. These campaigns drained the treasury but established the emperor's control of the military and military finance.\nWhen the Yongzheng Emperor died in 1735, his son Prince Bao () became the Qianlong Emperor. Qianlong personally led the Ten Great Campaigns to expand military control into present-day Xinjiang and Mongolia, putting down revolts and uprisings in Sichuan and southern China while expanding control over Tibet. The Qianlong Emperor launched several ambitious cultural projects, including the compilation of the \"Siku Quanshu\", the largest collection of books in Chinese history. Nevertheless, Qianlong used the literary inquisition to silence opposition. Beneath outward prosperity and imperial confidence, the later years of Qianlong's reign were marked by rampant corruption and neglect. Heshen, the emperor's handsome young favorite, took advantage of the emperor's indulgence to become one of the most corrupt officials in the history of the dynasty. Qianlong's son, the Jiaqing Emperor (r.\u20091796\u00a0\u2013\u00a01820), eventually forced Heshen to commit suicide.\nPopulations in the first half of the 17th century did not recover from civil wars and epidemics, but the following years of prosperity and stability led to steady growth. The Qianlong Emperor bemoaned the situation by remarking, \"The population continues to grow, but the land does not.\" The introduction of new crops from the Americas such as the potato and peanut improved nutrition as well, so that the population during the 18th century ballooned from 100\u00a0million to 300\u00a0million people. Soon farmers were forced to work ever-smaller holdings more intensely.\nIn 1796, the White Lotus Society raised open rebellion, saying \"the officials have forced the people to rebel\". Others blamed officials in various parts of the country for corruption, failing to keep the famine relief granaries full, poor maintenance of roads and waterworks, and bureaucratic factionalism. There soon followed uprisings of \"new sect\" Muslims against local Muslim officials, and Miao tribesmen in southwest China. The White Lotus Rebellion continued until 1804, when badly run, corrupt, and brutal campaigns finally ended it.\nRebellion, unrest, and external pressure.\nDuring the early Qing, China continued to be the hegemonic imperial power in East Asia. Although there was no formal ministry of foreign relations, the Lifan Yuan was responsible for relations with the Mongols and Tibetans in Inner Asia, while the tributary system, a loose set of institutions and customs taken over from the Ming, in theory governed relations with East and Southeast Asian countries. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk stabilised relations with the Tsardom of Russia. However, during the 18th century, European empires gradually expanded across the world and developed economies predicated on maritime trade, colonial extraction, and technological advances. The dynasty was confronted with newly developing concepts of the international system and state-to-state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in what is now India and Indonesia. The Qing response was to establish the Canton System in 1756, which restricted maritime trade to Guangzhou and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. This was successful for a time, and the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar monopoly rights by their governments.\nIn 1793, the British East India Company, with the support of the British government, sent a diplomatic mission to China led by Lord Macartney in order to open trade and put relations on a basis of equality. The imperial court viewed trade as of secondary interest, whereas the British saw maritime trade as the key to their economy. The Qianlong Emperor told Macartney \"the kings of the myriad nations come by land and sea with all sorts of precious things\", and \"consequently there is nothing we lack...\"\nSince China had little demand for European goods, Europe paid in silver for Chinese goods, an imbalance that worried the mercantilist governments of Britain and France. The growing Chinese demand for opium provided the remedy. The British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year. The First Opium War revealed the outdated state of the Chinese military. The Qing navy, composed entirely of wooden sailing junks, was severely outclassed by the modern tactics and firepower of the British Royal Navy. British soldiers, using advanced muskets and artillery, easily outmaneuvered and outgunned Qing forces in ground battles. The Qing surrender in 1842 marked a decisive, humiliating blow. The Treaty of Nanjing, the first of the \"unequal treaties\", demanded war reparations, forced China to open up the Treaty Ports of Canton, Amoy, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai to Western trade and missionaries, and to cede Hong Kong Island to Britain. It revealed weaknesses in the Qing government and provoked rebellions against the regime.\nThe Taiping Rebellion (1849\u20131864) was the first major anti-Manchu movement. Amid widespread social unrest and worsening famine, the rebellion not only posed the most serious threat to Qing rule, but during its 14-year course, between 20 and 30\u00a0million people died. The rebellion began under the leadership of Hong Xiuquan (1814\u20131864), a disappointed civil service examination candidate who, influenced by reading the Old Testament in translation, had a series of visions and announced himself to be the son of God, the younger brother of Jesus Christ, sent to reform China. In 1851, Hong launched an uprising in Guizhou and established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with himself as its king. Within this kingdom, slavery, concubinage, arranged marriage, opium smoking, footbinding, judicial torture, and the worship of idols were all banned. However, success led to internal feuds, defections and corruption. In addition, British and French troops, equipped with modern weapons, had come to the assistance of the Qing army. Nonetheless, it was not until 1864 that Qing forces under Zeng Guofan succeeded in crushing the revolt. After the outbreak of this rebellion, there were also revolts by the Muslims and Miao people of China against the Qing, most notably in the Miao Rebellion (1854\u20131873) in Guizhou, the Panthay Rebellion (1856\u20131873) in Yunnan, and the Dungan Revolt (1862\u20131877) in the northwest.\nThe Western powers, largely unsatisfied with the Treaty of Nanjing, gave grudging support to the Qing government during the Taiping and Nian rebellions. China's income fell sharply during the wars as vast areas of farmland were destroyed, millions of lives were lost, and countless armies were raised and equipped to fight the rebels. In 1854, Britain tried to re-negotiate the Treaty of Nanjing, inserting clauses allowing British commercial access to Chinese rivers and the creation of a permanent British embassy at Beijing.\nIn 1856, Qing authorities, in searching for a pirate, boarded a ship, the \"Arrow\", which the British claimed had been flying the British flag, an incident which led to the Second Opium War. In 1858, facing no other options, the Xianfeng Emperor agreed to the Treaty of Tientsin, which contained clauses deeply insulting to the Chinese, such as a demand that all official Chinese documents be written in English and a proviso granting British warships unlimited access to all navigable Chinese rivers.\nRatification of the treaty in the following year led to a resumption of hostilities. In 1860, with Anglo-French forces marching on Beijing, the emperor and his court fled the capital for the imperial hunting lodge at Rehe. Once in Beijing, the Anglo-French forces looted and burned the Old Summer Palace and, in an act of revenge for the arrest, torture, and execution of the English diplomatic mission. Prince Gong, a younger half-brother of the emperor, who had been left as his brother's proxy in the capital, was forced to sign the Convention of Beijing. The humiliated emperor died the following year at Rehe.\nSelf-strengthening and frustration of reforms.\nFollowing the death of the Xianfeng Emperor in 1861, and the accession of the 5-year-old Tongzhi Emperor, the Qing rallied. In the Tongzhi Restoration, Han Chinese officials such as Zuo Zongtang stood behind the Manchus and organised provincial troops. Zeng Guofan, in alliance with Prince Gong, sponsored the rise of younger officials such as Li Hongzhang, who put the dynasty back on its feet financially and instituted the Self-Strengthening Movement, which adopted Western military technology in order to preserve Confucian values.Their institutional reforms included China's first unified ministry of foreign affairs in the Zongli Yamen, allowing foreign diplomats to reside in the capital, the establishment of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, the institution of modern navy and army forces including the Beiyang Army, and the purchase of armament factories from the Europeans.\nThe dynasty gradually lost control of its peripheral territories. In return for promises of support against the British and the French, the Russian Empire took large chunks of territory in the Northeast in 1860. The period of cooperation between the reformers and the European powers ended with the 1870 Tianjin Massacre, which was incited by the murder of French nuns set off by the belligerence of local French diplomats. Starting with the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858, France expanded control of Indochina. By 1883, France was in full control of the region and had reached the Chinese border. The Sino-French War began with a surprise attack by the French on the Chinese southern fleet at Fuzhou. After that the Chinese declared war on the French. A French invasion of Taiwan was halted and the French were defeated on land in Tonkin at the Battle of Bang Bo. However Japan threatened to enter the war against China due to the Gapsin Coup and China chose to end the war with negotiations. The war ended in 1885 with the Treaty of Tientsin and the Chinese recognition of the French protectorate in Vietnam. Some Russian and Chinese gold miners also established a short-lived proto-state known as the Zheltuga Republic (1883\u20131886) in the Amur River basin, which was however soon crushed by the Qing forces.\nIn 1884, Qing China obtained concessions in Korea, such as the Chinese concession of Incheon, but the pro-Japanese Koreans in Seoul led the Gapsin Coup. Tensions between China and Japan rose after China intervened to suppress the uprising. The Japanese prime minister It\u014d Hirobumi and Li Hongzhang signed the Convention of Tientsin, an agreement to withdraw troops simultaneously, but the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895 was a military humiliation. The Treaty of Shimonoseki recognised Korean independence and ceded Taiwan and the Pescadores to Japan. The terms might have been harsher, but when a Japanese citizen attacked and wounded Li Hongzhang, an international outcry shamed the Japanese into revising them. The original agreement stipulated the cession of Liaodong Peninsula to Japan, but Russia, with its own designs on the territory, along with Germany and France, in the Triple Intervention, successfully put pressure on the Japanese to abandon the peninsula.\nThese years saw the participation of Empress Dowager Cixi in state affairs. Cixi initially entered the imperial palace in the 1850s as a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor, and became the mother of the future Tongzhi Emperor. Following his accession at the age of five, Cixi, Xianfeng's widow Empress Dowager Ci'an, and Prince Gong (a son of the Daoguang Emperor), staged a coup that ousted several of the Tongzhi Emperor's regents. Between 1861 and 1873, Cixi and Ci'an served as regents together; following the emperor's death in 1875, Cixi's nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, took the throne in violation of the custom that the new emperor be of the next generation, and another regency began. Ci'an suddenly died in the spring of 1881, leaving Cixi as sole regent.\nFrom 1889, when Guangxu began to rule in his own right, until 1898, the Empress Dowager lived in semi-retirement, spending the majority of the year at the Summer Palace. In 1897, two German Roman Catholic missionaries were murdered in southern Shandong province (the Juye Incident). Germany used the murders as a pretext for a naval occupation of Jiaozhou Bay. The occupation prompted a Scramble for China in 1898, which included the German lease of Jiaozhou Bay, the Russian lease of Liaodong, the British lease of the New Territories of Hong Kong, and the French lease of Guangzhouwan.\nIn the wake of these external defeats, the Guangxu Emperor initiated the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898. Newer, more radical advisers such as Kang Youwei were given positions of influence. The emperor issued a series of edicts and plans were made to reorganise the bureaucracy, restructure the school system, and appoint new officials. Opposition from the bureaucracy was immediate and intense. Although she had been involved in the initial reforms, the Empress Dowager stepped in to call them off, arrested and executed several reformers, and took over day-to-day control of policy. Yet many of the plans stayed in place, and the goals of reform were implanted.\nDrought in North China, combined with the imperialist designs of European powers and the instability of the Qing government, created background conditions for the Boxers. In 1900, local groups of Boxers proclaiming support for the Qing dynasty murdered foreign missionaries and large numbers of Chinese Christians, then converged on Beijing to besiege the Foreign Legation Quarter. A coalition of European, Japanese, and Russian armies (the Eight-Nation Alliance) then entered China without diplomatic notice, much less permission. Cixi declared war on all of these nations, only to lose control of Beijing after a short, but hard-fought campaign. She fled to Xi'an. The victorious allies then enforced their demands on the Qing government, including compensation for their expenses in invading China and execution of complicit officials, via the Boxer Protocol.\nReform, revolution, collapse.\nThe defeat by Japan in 1895 created a sense of crisis which the failure of the 1898 reforms and the disasters of 1900 only exacerbated. Cixi in 1901 moved to mollify the foreign community, called for reform proposals, and initiated the Late Qing reforms. Over the next few years the reforms included the restructuring of the national education, judicial, and fiscal systems, the most dramatic of which was the abolition of the imperial examination system in 1905. The court directed a constitution to be drafted, and provincial elections were held, the first in China's history. Sun Yat-sen and revolutionaries debated reform officials and constitutional monarchists such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao over how to transform the Manchu-ruled empire into a modernised Han Chinese state.\nThe Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, and Cixi died the following day. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. Zaifeng forced Yuan Shikai to resign. The Qing dynasty became a constitutional monarchy on 8 May 1911, when Zaifeng created a \"responsible cabinet\" led by Yikuang, Prince Qing. However, it became known as the \"royal cabinet\", as five of its thirteen members, were part of or related to the royal family.\nThe Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911 set off a series of uprisings. By November, 14 of the 22 provinces had rejected Qing rule. This led to the creation of the Republic of China, in Nanjing on 1 January 1912, with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Seeing a desperate situation, the Qing court brought Yuan Shikai back to power. His Beiyang Army crushed the revolutionaries in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister he created his own cabinet, with the support of Empress Dowager Longyu. However, Yuan Shikai decided to cooperate with Sun Yat-sen's revolutionaries to overthrow the Qing dynasty.\nOn 12 February 1912, Longyu issued the abdication of the child emperor Puyi leading to the fall of the Qing dynasty under the pressure of Yuan Shikai's Beiyang army despite objections from conservatives and royalist reformers. This brought an end to over 2,000 years imperial governance in China, and began a period of instability. In July 1917, there was an abortive attempt to restore the Qing led by Zhang Xun. Puyi was allowed to live in the Forbidden City after his abdication until 1924, when he moved to the Japanese concession in Tianjin. The Empire of Japan invaded Northeast China and founded Manchukuo there in 1932, with Puyi as its emperor. After the invasion of Northeast China to fight Japan by the Soviet Union, Manchukuo fell in 1945.\nGovernment.\nThe early Qing emperors adopted the bureaucratic structures and institutions from the Ming, but split rule between Han and Manchus, with some positions also given to Mongols. Like previous dynasties, the Qing recruited officials via the imperial examination system, until the system was abolished in 1905. The Qing divided the positions into civil and military positions, each having nine grades or ranks, each subdivided into a and b categories. Civil appointments ranged from an attendant to the emperor or a Grand Secretary in the Forbidden City (highest) to being a prefectural tax collector, deputy jail warden, deputy police commissioner, or tax examiner. Military appointments ranged from being a field marshal or chamberlain of the imperial bodyguard to a third class sergeant, corporal or a first or second class private.\nWhile the Qing dynasty tried to maintain the traditional tributary system of China, by the 19th century Qing China had become part of a European-style community of sovereign states and established official diplomatic relations with more than twenty countries around the world before its downfall, and since the 1870s it established legations and consulates.\nCentral government agencies.\nThe formal structure of the Qing government centred on the Emperor as the absolute ruler, who presided over six Boards (Ministries), each headed by two presidents and assisted by four vice presidents. In contrast to the Ming system, however, Qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations. The Grand Secretariat, which had been an important policy-making body under the Ming, lost its importance during the Qing and evolved into an imperial chancery. The institutions which had been inherited from the Ming formed the core of the Qing \"Outer Court\", which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the Forbidden City.\nIn order not to let the routine administration take over the running of the empire, the Qing emperors made sure that all important matters were decided in the \"Inner Court\", which was dominated by the imperial family and Manchu nobility and which was located in the northern part of the Forbidden City. The core institution of the inner court was the Grand Council. It emerged in the 1720s under the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor as a body charged with handling Qing military campaigns against the Mongols, but soon took over other military and administrative duties, centralising authority under the crown. The Grand Councillors served as a sort of privy council to the emperor.\nFrom the early Qing, the central government was characterised by a system of dual appointments by which each position in the central government had a Manchu and a Han Chinese assigned to it. The Han Chinese appointee was required to do the substantive work and the Manchu to ensure Han loyalty to Qing rule. While the Qing government was established as an absolute monarchy like previous dynasties in China, by the early 20th century however the Qing court began to move towards a constitutional monarchy, with government bodies like the Advisory Council established and a parliamentary election to prepare for a constitutional government.\nThere was also another government institution called Imperial Household Department which was unique to the Qing dynasty. It was established before the fall of the Ming, but it became mature only after 1661, following the death of the Shunzhi Emperor and the accession of his son, the Kangxi Emperor. The department's original purpose was to manage the internal affairs of the imperial family and the activities of the inner palace (in which tasks it largely replaced eunuchs), but it also played an important role in Qing relations with Tibet and Mongolia, engaged in trading activities (jade, ginseng, salt, furs, etc.), managed textile factories in the Jiangnan region, and even published books. Relations with the Salt Superintendents and salt merchants, such as those at Yangzhou, were particularly lucrative, especially since they were direct, and did not go through absorptive layers of bureaucracy. The department was manned by \"booi\", or \"bondservants\", from the Upper Three Banners. By the 19th century, it managed the activities of at least 56 subagencies.\nMilitary.\nThe Qing dynasty was established by conquest and maintained by armed force. The founding emperors personally organised and led the armies, and the continued cultural and political legitimacy of the dynasty depended on the ability to defend the country from invasion and expand its territory. Therefore, military institutions, leadership, and finance were fundamental to the dynasty's initial success and ultimate decay. The early military system centred on the Eight Banners, a hybrid institution that also played social, economic, and political roles. The Banner system was developed on an informal basis as early as 1601, and formally established in 1615 by Jurchen leader Nurhaci (1559\u20131626), the retrospectively recognised founder of the Qing. His son Hong Taiji (1592\u20131643), who renamed the Jurchens \"Manchus,\" created eight Mongol banners to mirror the Manchu ones and eight \"Han-martial\" () banners manned by Chinese who surrendered to the Qing before the full-fledged conquest of China proper began in 1644. After 1644, the Ming Chinese troops that surrendered to the Qing were integrated into the Green Standard Army, a corps that eventually outnumbered the Banners by three to one.\nThe use of gunpowder during the High Qing can compete with the three gunpowder empires in western Asia. Manchu imperial princes led the Banners in defeating the Ming armies, but after lasting peace was established starting in 1683, both the Banners and the Green Standard Armies started to lose their efficiency. Garrisoned in cities, soldiers had few occasions to drill. The Qing nonetheless used superior armament and logistics to expand deeply into Central Asia, defeat the Dzungar Mongols in 1759, and complete their conquest of Xinjiang. Despite the dynasty's pride in the Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735\u20131796), the Qing armies became largely ineffective by the end of the 18th century. It took almost ten years and huge financial waste to defeat the badly equipped White Lotus Rebellion (1795\u20131804), partly by legitimizing militias led by local Han Chinese elites. The Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864), a large-scale uprising that started in southern China, marched within miles of Beijing in 1853. The Qing court was forced to let its Han Chinese governors-general, first led by Zeng Guofan, raise regional armies. This new type of army and leadership defeated the rebels but signaled the end of Manchu dominance of the military establishment.\nThe military technology of the European Industrial Revolution made China's armament and military rapidly obsolete. In 1860 British and French forces in the Second Opium War captured Beijing and sacked the Summer Palace. The shaken court attempted to modernise its military and industrial institutions by buying European technology. This Self-Strengthening Movement established shipyards (notably the Jiangnan Arsenal and the Foochow Arsenal) and bought modern guns and battleships in Europe. The Qing navy became the largest in East Asia. But organisation and logistics were inadequate, officer training was deficient, and corruption widespread. The Beiyang Fleet was virtually destroyed and the modernised ground forces defeated in the 1895 First Sino-Japanese War. The Qing created a New Army, but could not prevent the Eight Nation Alliance from invading China to put down the Boxer Uprising in 1900. The revolt of a New Army corps in 1911 led to the fall of the dynasty.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe Qing reached its largest extent during the 18th century, when it ruled China proper (eighteen provinces) as well as the areas of present-day Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet, at approximately in size. There were originally 18 provinces, all in China proper, but this number was later increased to 22, with Manchuria and Xinjiang being divided or turned into provinces. Taiwan, originally part of Fujian, became a province of its own in the 19th century, but was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895.\nTerritorial administration.\nThe Qing organisation of provinces was based on the fifteen administrative units set up by the Ming dynasty, later made into eighteen provinces by splitting for example, Huguang into Hubei and Hunan provinces. The provincial bureaucracy continued the Yuan and Ming practice of three parallel lines, civil, military, and censorate, or surveillance. Each province was administered by a governor and a provincial military commander. Below the province were prefectures operating under a prefect, followed by subprefectures under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the county, overseen by a county magistrate. The eighteen provinces are also known as \"China proper\". The position of viceroy was the highest rank in the provincial administration. There were eight regional viceroys in China proper, each usually took charge of two or three provinces. The Viceroy of Zhili, who was responsible for the area surrounding Beijing, is usually considered as the most honourable and powerful viceroy among the eight.\nBy the mid-18th century, the Qing had successfully put outer regions under its control. Imperial commissioners and garrisons were sent to Mongolia and Tibet to oversee their affairs. These territories were also under supervision of a central government institution called Lifan Yuan. Qinghai was also put under direct control of the Qing court. Xinjiang, also known as Chinese Turkestan, was subdivided into the regions north and south of the Tian Shan mountains, also known today as Dzungaria and Tarim Basin respectively, but the post of Ili General was established in 1762 to exercise unified military and administrative jurisdiction over both regions. Dzungaria was fully opened to Han migration by the Qianlong Emperor from the beginning. Han migrants were at first forbidden from permanently settling in the Tarim Basin but were the ban was lifted after the invasion by Jahangir Khoja in the 1820s. Likewise, Manchuria was also governed by military generals until its division into provinces, though some areas of Xinjiang and Northeast China were lost to the Russian Empire in the mid-19th century. Manchuria was originally separated from China proper by the Inner Willow Palisade, a ditch and embankment planted with willows intended to restrict the movement of the Han Chinese, as the area was off-limits to civilian Han Chinese until the government started colonising the area, especially since the 1860s.\nWith respect to these outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control, with the emperor acting as Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism and protector of Muslims. However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During the Great Game, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yakub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing dynasty as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930. In the early 20th century, Britain sent an expedition force to Tibet and forced Tibetans to sign a treaty. The Qing court responded by asserting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet, resulting in the 1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention signed between Britain and China. The British agreed not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet, while China engaged not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet. The Qing government also turned Manchuria into three provinces in the early 20th century, officially known as the \"Three Northeast Provinces\", and established the post of Viceroy of the Three Northeast Provinces to oversee these provinces.\nSociety.\nPopulation growth and mobility.\nThe population grew in numbers, density, and mobility. The population in 1700 was roughly 150\u00a0million, about what it had been a century before, then doubled over the next century, and reached a height of 450\u00a0million on the eve of the Taiping Rebellion in 1850. The spread of New World crops, such as maize, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and potatoes decreased the number of deaths from malnutrition.\u00a0 Diseases such as smallpox were brought under control by an increase in inoculations. In addition, infant deaths were decreased due to campaigns against infanticide and improvements in birthing techniques performed by doctors and midwives and an increase in medical books available to the public. European population growth in this period was greatest in the cities, but in China there was only slow growth in cities and the lower Yangzi. The greatest growth was in the borderlands and the highlands, where farmers moved to take advantage of large tracts of marshlands and forests.\nThe population was remarkably mobile, perhaps more so than at any time in Chinese history. Millions of Han Chinese migrated to Yunnan and Guizhou in the 18th century, and also to Taiwan. After the conquests of the 1750s and 1760s, the court organised agricultural colonies in Xinjiang. This mobility also included the privately organised movement of Qing subjects overseas, largely to Southeast Asia, to pursue trade and other economic opportunities.\nManchuria, however, was formally closed to Han settlement by the Willow Palisade, with the exception of some bannermen. Nonetheless, by 1780, Han Chinese had become 80% of the population. The relatively sparse populatikon made the territory vulnerable to Russian annexation. In response, the Qing officials proposed in 1860 to open parts of Guandong to Chinese civilian farmer settlers. Late 19th century Manchuria was opened up to Han settlers, resulting in more extensive migration. By the dawn of the 20th century, largely in an attempt to counteract increasing Russian influence, the Qing had abolished the existing administrative system in Manchuria, reclassified all immigrants to the region as \"Han\" instead of \"civilians\", and replaced provincial generals with provincial governors. From 1902 to 1911, 70 civil administrations were created in Manchuria, owing to the region's growing population.\nSocial status.\nAccording to statute, Qing society was divided into relatively closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding scholar-officials, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They were divided into two categories: one of them, the good \"commoner\" people, the other \"mean\" people who were seen as debased and servile. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as \"liangmin\", a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to \"jianmin\" meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupations (scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants) were \"good\", or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), tattooed criminals, and those low-level employees of government officials were the \"mean people\". Mean people were legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, such as being forbidden to take the imperial examination. Furthermore, such people were usually not allowed to marry with free commoners and were even often required to acknowledge their abasement in society through actions such as bowing. However, throughout the Qing dynasty, the emperor and his court, as well as the bureaucracy, worked towards reducing the distinctions between the debased and free but did not completely succeed even at the end of its era in merging the two classifications together.\nQing gentry.\nAlthough there had been no powerful hereditary aristocracy since the Song dynasty, the gentry, like their British counterparts, enjoyed imperial privileges and managed local affairs. The status of scholar-officials was defined by passing at least the first level of civil service examinations and holding a degree, which qualified him to hold imperial office, although he might not actually do so. The gentry member could legally wear gentry robes and could talk to officials as equals. Informally, the gentry then presided over local society and could use their connections to influence the magistrate, acquire land, and maintain large households. The gentry thus included not only males holding degrees but also their wives and some of their relatives.\nThe gentry class was divided into groups. Not all who held office were literati, as merchant families could purchase degrees, and not all who passed the exams found employment as officials, since the number of degree-holders was greater than the number of openings. The gentry class also differed in the source and amount of their income. Literati families drew income from landholding, as well as from lending money. Officials drew a salary, which, as the years went by, were less and less adequate, leading to widespread reliance on \"squeeze\", irregular payments. Those who prepared for but failed the exams, like those who passed but were not appointed to office, could become tutors or teachers, private secretaries to sitting officials, administrators of guilds or temples, or other positions that required literacy. Others turned to fields such as engineering, medicine, or law, which by the nineteenth century demanded specialised learning. By the nineteenth century, it was no longer shameful to become an author or publisher of fiction.\nThe Qing gentry were marked as much by their aspiration to a cultured lifestyle as by their legal status. They lived more refined and comfortable lives than the commoners and used sedan-chairs to travel any significant distance. They often showed off their learning by collecting objects such as scholars' stones,\nporcelain or pieces of art for their beauty, which set them off from less cultivated commoners.\nFamily and kinship.\nDuring the Qing, the building block of society was patrilineal kinship. A shift in marital practices, identity and loyalty had begun during the Song, when the civil service examination began to replace nobility and inheritance as a means for gaining status. Instead of intermarrying within aristocratic elites of the same social status, they tended to form marital alliances with nearby families of the same or higher wealth, and established the local people's interests as first and foremost which helped to form intermarried townships. The neo-Confucian ideology, especially the Cheng-Zhu thinking favored by Qing social thought, emphasised patrilineal families and genealogy in society.\nThe emperors and local officials exhorted families to compile genealogies in order to stabilise local society. The genealogy was placed in the ancestral hall, which served as the lineage's headquarters and a place for annual ancestral sacrifice. A specific Chinese character appeared in the given name of each male of each generation, often well into the future. These lineages claimed to be based on biological descent but when a member of a lineage gained office or became wealthy, he might use considerable creativity in selecting a prestigious figure to be \"founding ancestor\". Such worship was intended to ensure that the ancestors remain content and benevolent spirits (\"shen\") who would keep watch over and protect the family. Later observers felt that the ancestral cult focused on the family and lineage, rather than on more public matters such as community and nation.\nInner Mongols and Khalkha Mongols in the Qing rarely knew their ancestors beyond four generations and Mongol tribal society was not organised among patrilineal clans, contrary to what was commonly thought, but included unrelated people at the base unit of organisation. The Qing tried but failed to promote the Chinese Neo-Confucian ideology of organising society along patrimonial clans among the Mongols.\nReligion.\nManchu rulers presided over a multi-ethnic empire and the emperor, who was held responsible for \"all under heaven\", patronised and took responsibility for all religions and belief systems. The empire's \"spiritual centre of gravity\" was the \"religio-political state\". Since the empire was part of the order of the cosmos, which conferred the Mandate of Heaven, the emperor as \"Son of Heaven\" was both the head of the political system and the head priest of the State Cult. The emperor and his officials, who were his personal representatives, took responsibility over all aspects of the empire, especially spiritual life and religious institutions and practices. The county magistrate, as the emperor's political and spiritual representative, made offerings at officially recognised temples. The magistrate lectured on the Emperor's Sacred Edict to promote civic morality; he kept close watch over religious organisations whose actions might threaten the sovereignty and religious prerogative of the state.\nManchu and imperial religion.\nThe Manchu imperial family were especially attracted by Yellow Sect or Gelug Buddhism that had spread from Tibet into Mongolia. The Fifth Dalai Lama, who had gained power in 1642, just before the Manchus took Beijing, looked to the Qing court for support. The Kangxi and Qianlong emperors practiced this form of Tibetan Buddhism as one of their household religions and built temples that made Beijing one of its centres, and constructed a replica Lhasa's Potala Palace at their summer retreat in Rehe.\nShamanism, the most common religion among Manchus, was a spiritual inheritance from their Tungusic ancestors that set them off from Han Chinese. State shamanism was important to the imperial family both to maintain their Manchu cultural identity and to promote their imperial legitimacy among tribes in the northeast. Imperial obligations included rituals on the first day of Chinese New Year at a shamanic shrine (tangse). Practices in Manchu families included sacrifices to the ancestors, and the use of shamans, often women, who went into a trance to seek healing or exorcism.\nPopular religion.\nChinese folk religion was centred around the patriarchal family and shen, or spirits. Common practices included ancestor veneration, filial piety, local gods and spirits. Rites included mourning, funeral, burial, practices. Since they did not require exclusive allegiance, forms and branches of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism were intertwined, for instance in the syncretic Three teachings. Chinese folk religion combined elements of the three, with local variations. County magistrates, who were graded and promoted on their ability to maintain local order, tolerated local sects and even patronised local temples as long as they were orderly, but were suspicious of heterodox sects that defied state authority and rejected imperial doctrines. Some of these sects indeed had long histories of rebellion, such as the Way of Former Heaven, which drew on Daoism, and the White Lotus Society, which drew on millennial Buddhism. The White Lotus Rebellion (1796\u20131804) confirmed official suspicions as did the Taiping Rebellion, which drew on millennial Christianity.\nChristianity, Judaism, and Islam.\nThe Abrahamic religions had arrived from Western Asia as early as the Tang dynasty but their insistence that they should be practised to the exclusion of other religions made them less adaptable than Buddhism, which had quickly been accepted as native. Islam predominated in Central Asian areas of the empire, while Judaism and Christianity were practiced in well-established but self-contained communities.\nSeveral hundred Catholic missionaries arrived between the late Ming period and the proscription of Christianity in 1724. The Jesuits adapted to Chinese expectations, evangelised among the educated, adopted the robes and lifestyles of literati, became proficient in the Confucian classics, and did not challenge Chinese moral values. They proved their value to the early Manchu emperors with their work in gunnery, cartography, and astronomy, but fell out of favor for a time until the Kangxi Emperor's 1692 edict of toleration. In the countryside, the newly arrived Dominican and Franciscan clerics established rural communities that adapted to local folk religious practices by emphasising healing, festivals, and holy days rather than sacraments and doctrine. In 1724, the Yongzheng Emperor proscribed Christianity as a \"heterodox teaching\". Since the European Catholic missionaries had kept control in their own hands and had not allowed the creation of a native clergy, however, the number of Catholics would grow more rapidly after 1724 because local communities could now set their own rules and standards. In 1811, Christian religious activities were further criminalised by the Jiaqing Emperor. The imperial ban was lifted by Treaty in 1846.\nThe first Protestant missionary to China, Robert Morrison (1782\u20131834) of the London Missionary Society (LMS), arrived at Canton on 6 September\u00a01807. He completed a translation of the entire Bible in 1819. Liang Afa (1789\u20131855), a Morrison-trained Chinese convert, extended evangelisation into inner China. The two Opium Wars (1839\u20131860) marked the watershed of Protestant Christian missions. The series of treaties signed between the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing and the 1858 Treaty of Tianjin distinguished Christianity from local religions and granted it protected status.\nIn the late 1840s Hong Xiuquan read Morrison's Chinese Bible, as well as Liang Afa's evangelistic pamphlet, and announced to his followers that Christianity in fact had been the religion of ancient China before Confucius and his followers drove it out. He formed the Taiping Movement, which emerged in South China as a \"collusion of the Chinese tradition of millenarian rebellion and Christian messianism\", \"apocalyptic revolution, Christianity, and 'communist utopianism'\".\nAfter 1860, enforcement of the treaties allowed missionaries to spread their evangelisation efforts outside Treaty Ports. Their presence created cultural and political opposition. Historian John K. Fairbank observed that \"[t]o the scholar-gentry, Christian missionaries were foreign subversives, whose immoral conduct and teaching were backed by gunboats\". In the next decades, there were some 800 conflicts between village Christians and non-Christians mostly about non-religious issues, such as land rights or local taxes, but religious conflict often lay behind such cases. In the summer of 1900, as foreign powers contemplated the division of China, village youths, known as Boxers, who practiced Chinese martial arts and spiritual practices, attacked and murdered Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries in the Boxer Uprising. The imperialist powers once again invaded and imposed a substantial indemnity. This defeat convinced many among the educated elites that popular religion was an obstacle to China's development as a modern nation, and some turned to Christianity as a spiritual tool to build one.\nBy 1900, there were about 1,400 Catholic priests and nuns in China serving nearly 1\u00a0million Catholics. Over 3,000 Protestant missionaries were active among the 250,000 Protestant Christians in China. Western medical missionaries established clinics and hospitals, and led medical training in China. Missionaries began establishing nurse training schools in the late 1880s, but nursing of sick men by women was rejected by local tradition, so the number of students was small until the 1930s.\nEconomy.\nBy the end of the 17th century, the Chinese economy had recovered from the devastation caused by the wars in which the Ming dynasty were overthrown. In the following century, markets continued to expand, but with more trade between regions, a greater dependence on overseas markets and a greatly increased population. By the end of the 18th century the population had risen to 300\u00a0million from approximately 150\u00a0million during the late Ming dynasty. The dramatic rise in population was due to several reasons, including the long period of peace and stability in the 18th century and the import of new crops China received from the Americas, including peanuts, sweet potatoes and maize. New species of rice from Southeast Asia led to a huge increase in production. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronised literature, theater and the arts. Textile and handicraft production boomed.\nThe government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax. To give people more incentives to participate in the market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the corv\u00e9e system with a head tax used to hire laborers. The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants. A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. These restrictions on domestic resource exploration, as well as on foreign trade, are critiqued by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence, by which the West overtook China economically.\nDuring the Ming\u2013Qing period (1368\u20131911) the biggest development in the Chinese economy was its transition from a command to a market economy, the latter becoming increasingly more pervasive throughout the Qing's rule. Between roughly 1550 and 1800, China proper experienced a second commercial revolution, developing naturally from the first commercial revolution during the Song, which saw the emergence of long-distance inter-regional trade of luxury goods. During the second commercial revolution, for the first time, a large percentage of farming households began producing crops for sale in the local and national markets rather than for their own consumption or barter in the traditional economy. Surplus crops were placed onto the national market for sale, integrating farmers into the commercial economy from the ground up. This naturally led to regions specialising in certain cash-crops for export as China's economy became increasingly reliant on inter-regional trade of bulk staple goods such as cotton, grain, beans, vegetable oils, forest products, animal products, and fertiliser.\nSilver.\nSilver entered in large quantities from mines in the New World after the Spanish conquered the Philippines in the 1570s. The re-opening of the southeast coast, which had been closed in the late 17th century, quickly revived trade, which expanded at 4% per annum throughout the latter part of the 18th century. China continued to export tea, silk and manufactures, creating a large, favorable trade balance with the West. The resulting expansion of the money supply supported competitive and stable markets. During the mid-Ming China had gradually shifted to silver as the standard currency for large scale transactions and by the late Kangxi period, the assessment and collection of the land tax was done in silver. Landlords began only accepting rent payments in silver rather than in crops themselves, which in turn incentivized farmers to produce crops for sale in local and national markets rather than for their own personal consumption or barter. Unlike the copper coins, \"qian\" or cash, used mainly for smaller transactions, silver was not reliably minted into a coin but rather was traded in units of weight: the \"liang\" or \"tael\", which equaled roughly 1.3 ounces of silver. A third-party had to be brought in to assess the weight and purity of the silver, resulting in an extra \"meltage fee\" added on to the price of transaction. Furthermore, since the \"meltage fee\" was unregulated it was the source of corruption. The Yongzheng emperor cracked down on the corrupt \"meltage fees\", legalizing and regulating them so that they could be collected as a tax. From this newly increased public coffer, the Yongzheng emperor increased the salaries of the officials who collected them, further legitimising silver as the standard currency of the Qing economy.\nUrbanisation and the proliferation of market-towns.\nThe second commercial revolution also had a profound effect on the dispersion of the Qing populace. Up until the late Ming there existed a stark contrast between the rural countryside and cities because extraction of surplus crops from the countryside was traditionally done by the state. However, as commercialisation expanded in the late-Ming and early-Qing, mid-sized cities began popping up to direct the flow of domestic, commercial trade. Some towns of this nature had such a large volume of trade and merchants flowing through them that they developed into full-fledged market-towns. Some of these more active market-towns even developed into small cities and became home to the new rising merchant class. The proliferation of these mid-sized cities was only made possible by advancements in long-distance transportation and communication. As more and more Chinese citizens were travelling the country conducting trade they increasingly found themselves in a far-away place needing a place to stay; in response the market saw the expansion of guild halls to house these merchants.\nFull-fledged trade guilds emerged, which, among other things, issued regulatory codes and price schedules, and provided a place for travelling merchants to stay and conduct their business. Along with the \"huiguan\" trade guilds, guild halls dedicated to more specific professions, \"gongsuo\", began to appear and to control commercial craft or artisanal industries such as carpentry, weaving, banking, and medicine. By the nineteenth century guild halls worked to transform urban areas into cosmopolitan, multi-cultural hubs, staged theatre performances open to general public, developed real estate by pooling funds together in the style of a trust, and some even facilitated the development of social services such as maintaining streets, water supply, and sewage facilities.\nTrade with the West.\nIn 1685, the Kangxi emperor legalised private maritime trade along the coast, establishing a series of customs stations in major port cities. The customs station at Guangzhou became by far the most active in foreign trade; by the late Kangxi reign, more than forty mercantile houses specialising in trade with the West had appeared. The Yongzheng emperor made a parent corporation comprising those forty individual houses in 1725 known as the Cohong system. Firmly established by 1757, the Canton Cohong was an association of thirteen business firms that had been awarded exclusive rights to conduct trade with Western merchants in Canton. Until its abolition after the Opium War in 1842, the Canton Cohong system was the only permitted avenue of Western trade into China, and thus became a booming hub of international trade. By the eighteenth century, the most significant export China had was tea. British demand for tea increased exponentially up until they figured out how to grow it for themselves in the hills of northern India in the 1880s. By the end of the eighteenth century, tea exports going through the Canton Cohong system amounted to one-tenth of the revenue from taxes collected from the British and nearly the entire revenue of the British East India Company; in fact, until the early nineteenth century tea comprised ninety percent of exports leaving Canton.\nRevenue.\nThe recorded revenues of the central Qing government increased little over the course of the 18th and early 19th century from 36,106,483 taels in 1725 to 43,343,978 taels in 1812 before declining to 38,600,570 taels in 1841, the land tax was the principal source of revenue for the central government with the salt, customs and poll taxes being important secondary sources. Following the Opium Wars and the opening of China to foreign trade and the mid-century rebellions, two further important sources of revenue were added: the foreign maritime customs revenue and the \"likin\" revenue though only 20% of the likin revenue was actually given by the provinces to Hu Pu (board of revenue) in Beijing the rest remaining in provincial hands, the Hu Pu also managed to raise some miscellaneous taxes and increased the rate of the salt tax these measures doubled revenue by the late 19th century, this however was insufficient for the central government which was facing numerous crises and wars during the period and 9 foreign loans amounting to 40mil taels were contracted by the Qing government prior to 1890.\nIt was estimated in the 1850s that wages around the capital of Beijing and the Yangtze delta region for a farmer was between 0.99 and 1.02 taels a month; assuming every day was worked, this would amount to roughly 12 taels a year with over 400,000,000 citizens in 1890 the level of taxation was extremely low.\nThe Financial Reorganisation bureau of the Dynasty (established in 1909) estimated total revenue to be 292,000,000 taels. H.B. Morse estimated in the early 1900s a total of 284,150,000 taels of which 99,062,000 taels was spent by the Central government, 142,374,000 taels by the provincial governments and the remainder by the local government. In 1911 the Consultative assembly estimated total revenue to be 301,910,297 taels. Included in this figure was over 44,000,000 taels from the Likin of which only 13,000,000 was reported to Beijing.\nThe Qing government during and following the First Sino-Japanese war increasingly took on loans to meet its expenditure requirements a total of 746,220,453 taels of which slightly over 330,000,000 taels was for Railway construction and the repayment to come from the revenues of the railways themselves thus these loans did not burden the central government finances. A relatively small sum of just over 25,500,000 taels was borrowed for industrial projects, over 5,000,000 taels for Telegraph lines with less than 1,000,000 taels for miscellaneous purposes. The remainder was primarily for the costs of the Sino-Japanese war and the indemnity in the Treaty of Shimonoseki amounting to over 382,000,000 taels.\nTaizu noted that these figures for formal taxation only amounted to half of the total taxation and therefore revenue of the government with these surcharges being levied at a local level by local officials who found the level of taxation far too low to support even basic governance, despite the ability to levy surcharges belonging solely to the central government.\nScience and technology.\nChinese scholars, court academies, and local officials carried on late Ming dynasty strengths in astronomy, mathematics, and geography, as well as technologies in ceramics, metallurgy, water transport, printing. Contrary to stereotypes in some Western writing, 16th and 17th century Qing dynasty officials and literati eagerly explored the technology and science introduced by Jesuit missionaries. Manchu leaders employed Jesuits to use cannon and gunpowder to great effect in the conquest of China, and the court sponsored their research in astronomy. The aim of these efforts, however, was to reform and improve inherited science and technology, not to replace it. Scientific knowledge advanced during the Qing, but there was not a change in the way this knowledge was organised or the way scientific evidence was defined or its truth tested. Those who studied the physical universe shared their findings with each other and identified themselves as men of science, but they did not have a separate and independent professional role with its own training and advancement. They were still literati.\nThe Opium Wars, however, demonstrated the power of steam engine and military technology that had only recently been put into practice in the West. During the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s and 1870s Confucian officials in several coastal provinces established an industrial base in military technology. The introduction of railroads into China raised questions that were more political than technological. A British company built the Shanghai\u2013Woosung line in 1876, obtaining the land under false pretenses, and it was soon torn up. Court officials feared local public opinion and that railways would help invaders, harm farmlands, and obstruct feng shui. To keep development in Chinese hands, the Qing government borrowed 34\u00a0billion taels of silver from foreign lenders for railway construction between 1894 and 1911. As late as 1900, only were in operation. Finally, of railway was completed. The British and French after 1905 opened lines to Burma and Vietnam.\nProtestant missionaries by the 1830s translated and printed Western science and medical textbooks. The textbooks found homes in the rapidly enlarging network of missionary schools and universities. The textbooks opened learning open possibilities for the small number of Chinese students interested in science, and a very small number interested in technology. After 1900, Japan had a greater role in bringing modern science and technology to Chinese audiences but even then they reached chiefly the children of the rich landowning gentry.\nArts and culture.\nUnder the Qing, inherited forms of art flourished and innovations occurred at many levels and in many types. High levels of literacy, a successful publishing industry, prosperous cities, and the Confucian emphasis on cultivation all fed a lively and creative set of cultural fields.\nBy the end of the 19th century, national artistic and cultural worlds had begun to come to terms with the cosmopolitan culture of the West and Japan. The decision to stay within old forms or welcome Western models was now a conscious choice. Classically trained Confucian scholars such as Liang Qichao and Wang Guowei read widely and broke aesthetic and critical ground later cultivated in the New Culture Movement.\nFine arts.\nThe Qing emperors were generally adept at poetry and often skilled in painting, and offered their patronage to Confucian culture. The Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors, for instance, embraced Chinese traditions both to control them and to proclaim their own legitimacy. The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the \"Peiwen Yunfu\", a rhyme dictionary published in 1711, and the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference. The Qianlong Emperor sponsored the largest collection of writings in Chinese history, the \"Complete Library of the Four Treasuries\", completed in 1782. Court painters made new versions of the Song masterpiece, Zhang Zeduan's \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\", whose depiction of a prosperous and happy realm demonstrated the beneficence of the emperor. The emperors undertook tours of the south and commissioned monumental scrolls to depict the grandeur of the occasion. Imperial patronage also encouraged the industrial production of ceramics and Chinese export porcelain. Peking glassware became popular after European glass making processes were introduced by Jesuits to Beijing. During this period the European trend to imitate Chinese artistic traditions, known as chinoiserie also gained great popularity in Europe due to the rise in trade with China and the broader current of Orientalism.\nYet the most impressive aesthetic works were done among the scholars and urban elite. Calligraphy and painting remained a central interest to both court painters and scholar-officials who considered the four arts part of their cultural identity and social standing. The painting of the early years of the dynasty included such painters as the orthodox Four Wangs and the individualists Bada Shanren and Shitao. Court painting of the dynasty was also greatly influenced by some Western artists. The 19th century saw such innovations as the Shanghai School and the Lingnan School, which used the technical skills of tradition to set the stage for modern painting.\nTraditional learning and literature.\nTraditional learning flourished, especially among Ming loyalists such as Dai Zhen and Gu Yanwu, but scholars in the school of evidential learning made innovations in skeptical textual scholarship. Scholar-bureaucrats, including Lin Zexu and Wei Yuan, developed a school of practical statecraft which rooted bureaucratic reform and restructuring in classical philosophy.\nPhilosophy and literature grew to new heights in the Qing period. Poetry continued as a mark of the cultivated gentleman, but women wrote in larger numbers and came from all walks of life. The poetry of the Qing dynasty is a lively field of research, being studied (along with the poetry of the Ming dynasty) for its association with Chinese opera, developmental trends of Classical Chinese poetry, the transition to a greater role for vernacular language, and for poetry by women. The Qing dynasty was a period of literary editing and criticism, and many of the modern popular versions of Classical Chinese poems were transmitted through Qing dynasty anthologies, such as the \"Complete Tang Poems\" and the \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\". Although fiction did not have the prestige of poetry, novels flourished. Pu Songling brought the short story to a new level in his \"Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio\", published in the mid-18th century, and Shen Fu demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in \"Six Chapters of a Floating Life\", written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877. The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in Cao Xueqin's \"Dream of the Red Chamber\", but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as Wu Jingzi's \"The Scholars\" (1750) and Li Ruzhen's \"Flowers in the Mirror\" (1827).\nCuisine.\nCuisine embodied cultural pride. The gentleman gourmet, such as Yuan Mei, applied aesthetic standards to the art of cooking, eating, and appreciation of tea at a time when New World crops and products entered everyday life. Yuan's \"Suiyuan Shidan\" expounded culinary aesthetics and theory, along with a range of recipes. The Manchu\u2013Han Imperial Feast originated at the court. Although this banquet was probably never common, it reflected an appreciation of Manchu culinary customs. New food imports were also implemented into Qing cuisine. Sweet potatoes from the Philippines and white potatoes from Peru were roasted at street corners and in markets. Other foods such as corn on the cob and peanuts were also implemented into Qing cuisine.\nHomosexuality.\nInitially, many early Qing Dynasty explored romantic bonds and intimate relationships between men. Works such as \"The Amorous History of the Peach Flowers' Garden\" (\u6843\u82b1\u8c54\u53f2) and \"The Journey of Male Mencius's Mother's Teaching and Three Relocations\" (\u7537\u5b5f\u6bcd\u6559\u5408\u9077) detailed same-sex sexual encounters with vivid language. However, the moral lessons of these works condemned anal sex as impure and spiritually distracting. On the other hand, late Ming works such as \"Bian er chai\" remained popular stories that displayed homosexual acts and pederasty as heroic. Nevertheless, the protagonists follow Confucian doctrine by marrying wives and raising families at the end of the stories.\nEventually, sodomy was outlawed in 1740 under the Great Qing Legal Code. Works such as \"Bian er chai\" were repeatedly banned. By the late Qing, physical intimacy faced scrutiny for being amoral, as evidenced in the 1849 work \"Precious Mirror of Ranked Flowers\" (\u54c1\u82b1\u5bf6\u9452). Portraying the lives of actors in opera, the protagonist engages in romance with another man without physical contact. In contrast, the antagonists of the story engage in physical sex.\nHistoriography.\nThe Confucian concept of the dynastic cycle was used by traditional Chinese historiography to organise China's past in terms of consecutive ruling houses that arose and collapsed. The Qing dynasty was the closing chapter of the 2000-year history of Imperial China. John King Fairbank of Harvard University, a historian who is essentially credited with founding modern Chinese history in the United States, steadfastly maintained a perspective that split the history of China's past half millennium around 1842. All that fell before remained part of \"traditional China\", and with the Western \"shock\" of the First Opium War and the resulting Treaty of Nanking, \"modern China\" was born. The Qing dynasty was thus bifurcated in this manner. In contemporary China, there is also a similar view for such a division.\nThe New Qing History is a revisionist historiographical school that emerged in the mid-1990s and emphasises the particular Manchu character of the dynasty. Earlier historians had emphasised a pattern of Han sinicisation of various conquerors. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began learning the Manchu language, taking advantage of archival holdings in this and other non-Chinese languages that had long been held in Taipei and Beijing but had previously attracted little scholarly attention. This research concluded that the Manchu rulers 'manipulated' their subjects by fostering a sense of Manchu identity, often adopting Central Asian models of rule as much as Confucian ones. The most prominent feature of the studies has been characterised by a renewed interest in the Manchus and their relationship to China and Chinese culture, as well as that of other non-Han groups ruled by Beijing.\nWilliam T. Rowe of Johns Hopkins University wrote that the name \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b; \u4e2d\u83ef) was generally understood to refer to the political realm of the Han Chinese during the Ming dynasty, and this understanding persisted among the Han Chinese into the early Qing dynasty, and the understanding was also shared by Aisin Gioro rulers before the Ming-Qing transition. The Qing dynasty, however, \"came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the Great Qing but also, nearly interchangeably, as China\" within a few decades of this development. Instead of the earlier (Ming) idea of an ethnic Han Chinese state, this new Qing China was a \"self-consciously multi-ethnic state\". Han Chinese scholars had some time to adapt this, but by the 19th century, the notion of China as a multinational state with new, significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for Han Chinese writers. Rowe noted that \"these were the origins of the China we know today\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It deals with environments in which neither gravitational nor quantum effects can be ignored, such as in the vicinity of black holes or similar compact astrophysical objects, as well as in the early stages of the universe moments after the Big Bang.\nThree of the four fundamental forces of nature are described within the framework of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory: the electromagnetic interaction, the strong force, and the weak force; this leaves gravity as the only interaction that has not been fully accommodated. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which incorporates his theory of special relativity and deeply modifies the understanding of concepts like time and space. Although general relativity is highly regarded for its elegance and accuracy, it has limitations: the gravitational singularities inside black holes, the ad hoc postulation of dark matter, as well as dark energy and its relation to the cosmological constant are among the current unsolved mysteries regarding gravity, all of which signal the collapse of the general theory of relativity at different scales and highlight the need for a gravitational theory that goes into the quantum realm. At distances close to the Planck length, like those near the center of a black hole, quantum fluctuations of spacetime are expected to play an important role. Finally, the discrepancies between the predicted value for the vacuum energy and the observed values (which, depending on considerations, can be of 60 or 120 orders of magnitude) highlight the necessity for a quantum theory of gravity.\nThe field of quantum gravity is actively developing, and theorists are exploring a variety of approaches to the problem of quantum gravity, the most popular being M-theory and loop quantum gravity. All of these approaches aim to describe the quantum behavior of the gravitational field, which does not necessarily include unifying all fundamental interactions into a single mathematical framework. However, many approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory, try to develop a framework that describes all fundamental forces. Such a theory is often referred to as a theory of everything. Some of the approaches, such as loop quantum gravity, make no such attempt; instead, they make an effort to quantize the gravitational field while it is kept separate from the other forces. Other lesser-known but no less important theories include causal dynamical triangulation, noncommutative geometry, and twistor theory.\nOne of the difficulties of formulating a quantum gravity theory is that direct observation of quantum gravitational effects is thought to only appear at length scales near the Planck scale, around 10\u221235 meters, a scale far smaller, and hence only accessible with far higher energies, than those currently available in high energy particle accelerators. Therefore, physicists lack experimental data which could distinguish between the competing theories which have been proposed.\nThought experiment approaches have been suggested as a testing tool for quantum gravity theories. In the field of quantum gravity there are several open questions \u2013 e.g., it is not known how the spin of elementary particles sources gravity, and thought experiments could provide a pathway to explore possible resolutions to these questions, even in the absence of lab experiments or physical observations.\nIn the early 21st century, new experiment designs and technologies have arisen which suggest that indirect approaches to testing quantum gravity may be feasible over the next few decades. This field of study is called phenomenological quantum gravity.\nOverview.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nHow can the theory of quantum mechanics be merged with the theory of general relativity / gravitational force and remain correct at microscopic length scales? What verifiable predictions does any theory of quantum gravity make?\nMore unsolved problems in physics\nMuch of the difficulty in meshing these theories at all energy scales comes from the different assumptions that these theories make on how the universe works. General relativity models gravity as curvature of spacetime: in the slogan of John Archibald Wheeler, \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\" On the other hand, quantum field theory is typically formulated in the \"flat\" spacetime used in special relativity. No theory has yet proven successful in describing the general situation where the dynamics of matter, modeled with quantum mechanics, affect the curvature of spacetime. If one attempts to treat gravity as simply another quantum field, the resulting theory is not renormalizable. Even in the simpler case where the curvature of spacetime is fixed \"a priori\", developing quantum field theory becomes more mathematically challenging, and many ideas physicists use in quantum field theory on flat spacetime are no longer applicable.\nIt is widely hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would allow us to understand problems of very high energy and very small dimensions of space, such as the behavior of black holes, and the origin of the universe.\nOne major obstacle is that for quantum field theory in curved spacetime with a fixed metric, bosonic/fermionic operator fields supercommute for spacelike separated points. (This is a way of imposing a principle of locality.) However, in quantum gravity, the metric is dynamical, so that whether two points are spacelike separated depends on the state. In fact, they can be in a quantum superposition of being spacelike and not spacelike separated.\nQuantum mechanics and general relativity.\nGraviton.\nThe observation that all fundamental forces except gravity have one or more known messenger particles leads researchers to believe that at least one must exist for gravity. This hypothetical particle is known as the \"graviton\". These particles act as a force particle similar to the photon of the electromagnetic interaction. Under mild assumptions, the structure of general relativity requires them to follow the quantum mechanical description of interacting theoretical spin-2 massless particles. Many of the accepted notions of a unified theory of physics since the 1970s assume, and to some degree depend upon, the existence of the graviton. The Weinberg\u2013Witten theorem places some constraints on theories in which the graviton is a composite particle. While gravitons are an important theoretical step in a quantum mechanical description of gravity, they are generally believed to be undetectable because they interact too weakly.\nNonrenormalizability of gravity.\nGeneral relativity, like electromagnetism, is a classical field theory. One might expect that, as with electromagnetism, the gravitational force should also have a corresponding quantum field theory.\nHowever, gravity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable. For a quantum field theory to be well defined according to this understanding of the subject, it must be asymptotically free or asymptotically safe. The theory must be characterized by a choice of \"finitely many\" parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment. For example, in quantum electrodynamics these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.\nOn the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, \"infinitely many independent parameters\" (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory. At low energies, the logic of the renormalization group tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity. On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then \"every one\" of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.\nIt is conceivable that, in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured. One possibility is that normal perturbation theory is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, and that there really \"is\" a UV fixed point for gravity. Since this is a question of non-perturbative quantum field theory, finding a reliable answer is difficult, pursued in the asymptotic safety program. Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set. This is the route taken by string theory, where all of the excitations of the string essentially manifest themselves as new symmetries.\nQuantum gravity as an effective field theory.\nIn an effective field theory, all but the first few of the infinite set of parameters in a nonrenormalizable theory are suppressed by huge energy scales and hence can be neglected when computing low-energy effects. Thus, at least in the low-energy regime, the model is a predictive quantum field theory. Furthermore, many theorists argue that the Standard Model should be regarded as an effective field theory itself, with \"nonrenormalizable\" interactions suppressed by large energy scales and whose effects have consequently not been observed experimentally.\nBy treating general relativity as an effective field theory, one can actually make legitimate predictions for quantum gravity, at least for low-energy phenomena. An example is the well-known calculation of the tiny first-order quantum-mechanical correction to the classical Newtonian gravitational potential between two masses. Another example is the calculation of the corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.\nSpacetime background dependence.\nA fundamental lesson of general relativity is that there is no fixed spacetime background, as found in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity; the spacetime geometry is dynamic. While simple to grasp in principle, this is a complex idea to understand about general relativity, and its consequences are profound and not fully explored, even at the classical level. To a certain extent, general relativity can be seen to be a relational theory, in which the only physically relevant information is the relationship between different events in spacetime.\nOn the other hand, quantum mechanics has depended since its inception on a fixed background (non-dynamic) structure. In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, Minkowski spacetime is the fixed background of the theory.\nString theory.\nString theory can be seen as a generalization of quantum field theory where instead of point particles, string-like objects propagate in a fixed spacetime background, although the interactions among closed strings give rise to space-time in a dynamic way.\nAlthough string theory had its origins in the study of quark confinement and not of quantum gravity, it was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the graviton, and that \"condensation\" of certain vibration modes of strings is equivalent to a modification of the original background. In this sense, string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect of a perturbation theory that may exhibit a strong dependence on asymptotics (as seen, for example, in the AdS/CFT correspondence) which is a weak form of background dependence.\nBackground independent theories.\nLoop quantum gravity is the fruit of an effort to formulate a background-independent quantum theory.\nTopological quantum field theory provided an example of background-independent quantum theory, but with no local degrees of freedom, and only finitely many degrees of freedom globally. This is inadequate to describe gravity in 3+1 dimensions, which has local degrees of freedom according to general relativity. In 2+1 dimensions, however, gravity is a topological field theory, and it has been successfully quantized in several different ways, including spin networks.\nSemi-classical quantum gravity.\nQuantum field theory on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results. In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.\nPhenomena such as the Unruh effect, in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds). The vacuum state is the state with the least energy (and may or may not contain particles).\nProblem of time.\nA conceptual difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with general relativity arises from the contrasting role of time within these two frameworks. In quantum theories, time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, with the Hamiltonian operator acting as the generator of infinitesimal translations of quantum states through time. In contrast, general relativity treats time as a dynamical variable which relates directly with matter and moreover requires the Hamiltonian constraint to vanish. Because this variability of time has been observed macroscopically, it removes any possibility of employing a fixed notion of time, similar to the conception of time in quantum theory, at the macroscopic level.\nCandidate theories.\nThere are a number of proposed quantum gravity theories. Currently, there is still no complete and consistent quantum theory of gravity, and the candidate models still need to overcome major formal and conceptual problems. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests, although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments become available.\nString theory.\nThe central idea of string theory is to replace the classical concept of a point particle in quantum field theory with a quantum theory of one-dimensional extended objects: string theory. At the energies reached in current experiments, these strings are indistinguishable from point-like particles, but, crucially, different modes of oscillation of one and the same type of fundamental string appear as particles with different (electric and other) charges. In this way, string theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions. The theory is successful in that one mode will always correspond to a graviton, the messenger particle of gravity; however, the price of this success is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three for space and one for time.\nIn what is called the , it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity. As presently understood, however, string theory admits a very large number (10500 by some estimates) of consistent vacua, comprising the so-called \"string landscape\". Sorting through this large family of solutions remains a major challenge.\nLoop quantum gravity.\nLoop quantum gravity seriously considers general relativity's insight that spacetime is a dynamical field and is therefore a quantum object. Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space.\nThe main result of loop quantum gravity is that there is a granular structure of space at the Planck length. This is derived from the following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectra. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space. It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.\nThe quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called spin networks. Spin networks were initially introduced by Roger Penrose in abstract form, and later shown by Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity. Spin networks do not represent quantum states of a field in spacetime: they represent directly quantum states of spacetime.\nThe theory is based on the reformulation of general relativity known as Ashtekar variables, which represent geometric gravity using mathematical analogues of electric and magnetic fields. In the quantum theory, space is represented by a network structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.\nThe dynamics of the theory is today constructed in several versions. One version starts with the canonical quantization of general relativity. The analogue of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation, which can be defined within the theory. In the covariant, or spinfoam formulation of the theory, the quantum dynamics is obtained via a sum over discrete versions of spacetime, called spinfoams. These represent histories of spin networks.\nOther proposals.\nThere are a number of other approaches to quantum gravity. The theories differ depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and which features are modified. Such approaches include:\nExperimental tests.\nAs was emphasized above, quantum gravitational effects are extremely weak and therefore difficult to test. For this reason, the possibility of experimentally testing quantum gravity had not received much attention prior to the late 1990s. However, since the 2000s, physicists have realized that evidence for quantum gravitational effects can guide the development of the theory. Since theoretical development has been slow, the field of phenomenological quantum gravity, which studies the possibility of experimental tests, has obtained increased attention.\nThe most widely pursued possibilities for quantum gravity phenomenology include gravitationally mediated entanglement,\nviolations of Lorentz invariance, imprints of quantum gravitational effects in the cosmic microwave background (in particular its polarization), and decoherence induced by fluctuations in the space-time foam. The latter scenario has been searched for in light from gamma-ray bursts and both astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos, placing limits on phenomenological quantum gravity parameters.\nESA's INTEGRAL satellite measured polarization of photons of different wavelengths and was able to place a limit in the granularity of space that is less than 10\u221248\u00a0m, or 13 orders of magnitude below the Planck scale.\nThe BICEP2 experiment detected what was initially thought to be primordial B-mode polarization caused by gravitational waves in the early universe. Had the signal in fact been primordial in origin, it could have been an indication of quantum gravitational effects, but it soon transpired that the polarization was due to interstellar dust interference.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25315", "revid": "49409394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25315", "title": "Quality of service", "text": "Traffic prioritization and measure of network performance\nQuality of service (QoS) is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network, or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission delay, availability, jitter, etc.\nIn the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priorities to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.\nQuality of service is particularly important for the transport of traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have introduced Voice over IP technology to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as supporting new applications with even stricter network performance requirements.\nDefinitions.\nIn the field of telephony, quality of service was defined by the ITU in 1994. Quality of service comprises requirements on all the aspects of a connection, such as service response time, loss, signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, echo, interrupts, frequency response, loudness levels, and so on. A subset of telephony QoS is grade of service (GoS) requirements, which comprises aspects of a connection relating to capacity and coverage of a network, for example guaranteed maximum blocking probability and outage probability.\nIn the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, teletraffic engineering refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priorities to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. For example, a required bit rate, delay, delay variation, packet loss or bit error rates may be guaranteed. Quality of service is important for real-time streaming multimedia applications such as voice over IP, multiplayer online games and IPTV, since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive. Quality of service is especially important in networks where the capacity is a limited resource, for example in cellular data communication.\nA network or protocol that supports QoS may agree on a traffic contract with the application software and reserve capacity in the network nodes, for example during a session establishment phase. During the session it may monitor the achieved level of performance, for example the data rate and delay, and dynamically control scheduling priorities in the network nodes. It may release the reserved capacity during a tear down phase.\nA best-effort network or service does not support quality of service. An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a best-effort network by over-provisioning the capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected peak traffic load. The resulting absence of network congestion reduces or eliminates the need for QoS mechanisms.\nQoS is sometimes used as a quality measure, with many alternative definitions, rather than referring to the ability to reserve resources. Quality of service sometimes refers to the level of quality of service, i.e. the guaranteed service quality. High QoS is often confused with a high level of performance, for example high bit rate, low latency and low bit error rate.\nQoS is sometimes used in application layer services such as telephony and streaming video to describe a metric that reflects or predicts the subjectively experienced quality. In this context, QoS is the acceptable cumulative effect on subscriber satisfaction of all imperfections affecting the service. Other terms with similar meaning are the quality of experience (QoE), mean opinion score (MOS), perceptual speech quality measure (PSQM) and perceptual evaluation of video quality (PEVQ).\nHistory.\nA number of attempts for layer 2 technologies that add QoS tags to the data have gained popularity in the past. Examples are Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) (a technique between layer 2 and 3). Despite these network technologies remaining in use today, this kind of network lost attention after the advent of Ethernet networks. Today Ethernet is, by far, the most popular layer 2 technology. Conventional Internet routers and network switches operate on a best-effort basis. This equipment is less expensive, less complex and faster and thus more popular than earlier more complex technologies that provide QoS mechanisms.\nEthernet optionally uses 802.1p to signal the priority of a frame.\nThere were four \"type of service\" bits and three \"precedence\" bits originally provided in each IP packet header, but they were not generally respected. These bits were later re-defined as Differentiated services code points (DSCP).\nWith the advent of IPTV and IP telephony, QoS mechanisms are increasingly available to the end user.\nFactors.\nIn packet-switched networks, quality of service is affected by various factors, which can be divided into human and technical factors. Human factors include: stability of service quality, availability of service, waiting times and user information. Technical factors include: reliability, scalability, effectiveness, maintainability and network congestion.\nMany things can happen to packets as they travel from origin to destination, resulting in the following problems as seen from the point of view of the sender and receiver:\nGoodput.\nDue to varying load from disparate users sharing the same network resources, the maximum throughput that can be provided to a certain data stream may be too low for real-time multimedia services.\nPacket loss.\nThe network may fail to deliver (\"drop\") some packets due to network congestion. The receiving application may ask for this information to be retransmitted, possibly resulting in congestive collapse or unacceptable delays in the overall transmission.\nErrors.\nSometimes packets are corrupted due to bit errors caused by noise and interference, especially in wireless communications and long copper wires. The receiver has to detect this, and, just as if the packet was dropped, may ask for this information to be retransmitted.\nLatency.\nIt might take a long time for each packet to reach its destination because it gets held up in long queues, or it takes a less direct route to avoid congestion. In some cases, excessive latency can render an application such as VoIP or online gaming unusable.\nPacket delay variation.\nPackets from the source will reach the destination with different delays. A packet's delay varies with its position in the queues of the routers along the path between source and destination, and this position can vary unpredictably. Delay variation can be absorbed at the receiver, but in so doing increases the overall latency for the stream.\nOut-of-order delivery.\nWhen a collection of related packets is routed through a network, different packets may take different routes, each resulting in a different delay. The result is that the packets arrive in a different order than they were sent. This problem requires special additional protocols for rearranging out-of-order packets. The reordering process requires additional buffering at the receiver, and, as with packet delay variation, increases the overall latency for the stream.\nApplications.\nA defined quality of service may be desired or required for certain types of network traffic, for example:\nThese types of service are called \"inelastic\", meaning that they require a certain minimum bit rate and a certain maximum latency to function. By contrast, \"elastic\" applications can take advantage of however much or little bandwidth is available. Bulk file transfer applications that rely on TCP are generally elastic.\nMechanisms.\nCircuit switched networks, especially those intended for voice transmission, such as ATM or GSM, have QoS in the core protocol, resources are reserved at each step on the network for the call as it is set up, there is no need for additional procedures to achieve required performance. Shorter data units and built-in QoS were some of the unique selling points of ATM for applications such as video on demand.\nWhen the expense of mechanisms to provide QoS is justified, network customers and providers can enter into a contractual agreement termed a service-level agreement (SLA) which specifies guarantees for the ability of a connection to give guaranteed performance in terms of throughput or latency based on mutually agreed measures.\nOver-provisioning.\nAn alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication by generously over-provisioning a network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates. This approach is simple for networks with predictable peak loads. This calculation may need to appreciate demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers, which is often possible for example in video streaming.\nOver-provisioning can be of limited use in the face of transport protocols (such as TCP) that over time increase the amount of data placed on the network until all available bandwidth is consumed and packets are dropped. Such greedy protocols tend to increase latency and packet loss for all users.\nThe amount of over-provisioning in interior links required to replace QoS depends on the number of users and their traffic demands. This limits usability of over-provisioning. Newer more bandwidth intensive applications and the addition of more users results in the loss of over-provisioned networks. This then requires a physical update of the relevant network links which is an expensive process. Thus over-provisioning cannot be blindly assumed on the Internet.\nCommercial VoIP services are often competitive with traditional telephone service in terms of call quality even without QoS mechanisms in use on the user's connection to their ISP and the VoIP provider's connection to a different ISP. Under high load conditions, however, VoIP may degrade to cell-phone quality or worse. The mathematics of packet traffic indicate that network requires just 60% more raw capacity under conservative assumptions.\nIP and Ethernet efforts.\nUnlike single-owner networks, the Internet is a series of exchange points interconnecting private networks. Hence the Internet's core is owned and managed by a number of different network service providers, not a single entity. Its behavior is much more unpredictable.\nThere are two principal approaches to QoS in modern packet-switched IP networks, a parameterized system based on an exchange of application requirements with the network, and a prioritized system where each packet identifies a desired service level to the network.\nEarly work used the integrated services (IntServ) philosophy of reserving network resources. In this model, applications used RSVP to request and reserve resources through a network. While IntServ mechanisms do work, it was realized that in a broadband network typical of a larger service provider, Core routers would be required to accept, maintain, and tear down thousands or possibly tens of thousands of reservations. It was believed that this approach would not scale with the growth of the Internet, and in any event was antithetical to the end-to-end principle, the notion of designing networks so that core routers do little more than simply switch packets at the highest possible rates.\nUnder DiffServ, packets are marked either by the traffic sources themselves or by the edge devices where the traffic enters the network. In response to these markings, routers and switches use various queuing strategies to tailor performance to requirements. At the IP layer, DSCP markings use the 6 bit DS field in the IP packet header. At the MAC layer, VLAN IEEE 802.1Q can be used to carry 3 bit of essentially the same information. Routers and switches supporting DiffServ configure their network scheduler to use multiple queues for packets awaiting transmission from bandwidth constrained (e.g., wide area) interfaces. Router vendors provide different capabilities for configuring this behavior, to include the number of queues supported, the relative priorities of queues, and bandwidth reserved for each queue.\nIn practice, when a packet must be forwarded from an interface with queuing, packets requiring low jitter (e.g., VoIP or videoconferencing) are given priority over packets in other queues. Typically, some bandwidth is allocated by default to network control packets (such as Internet Control Message Protocol and routing protocols), while best-effort traffic might simply be given whatever bandwidth is left over.\nAt the medium access control (MAC) layer, VLAN IEEE 802.1Q and IEEE 802.1p can be used to distinguish between Ethernet frames and classify them. Queueing theory models have been developed on performance analysis and QoS for MAC layer protocols.\nCisco IOS NetFlow and the Cisco Class Based QoS (CBQoS) Management Information Base (MIB) are marketed by Cisco Systems.\nOne compelling example of the need for QoS on the Internet relates to congestive collapse. The Internet relies on congestion avoidance protocols, primarily as built into Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), to reduce traffic under conditions that would otherwise lead to congestive collapse. QoS applications, such as VoIP and IPTV, require largely constant bitrates and low latency, therefore they cannot use TCP and cannot otherwise reduce their traffic rate to help prevent congestion. Service-level agreements limit traffic that can be offered to the Internet and thereby enforce traffic shaping that can prevent it from becoming overloaded, and are hence an indispensable part of the Internet's ability to handle a mix of real-time and non-real-time traffic without collapse.\nProtocols.\nSeveral QoS mechanisms and schemes exist for IP networking.\nQoS capabilities are available in the following network technologies.\nEnd-to-end quality of service.\nEnd-to-end quality of service can require a method of coordinating resource allocation between one autonomous system and another. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) for bandwidth reservation as a proposed standard in 1997. RSVP is an end-to-end bandwidth reservation and admission control protocol. RSVP was not widely adopted due to scalability limitations. The more scalable traffic engineering version, RSVP-TE, is used in many networks to establish traffic-engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) label-switched paths. The IETF also defined Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) with QoS signalling as a target. NSIS is a development and simplification of RSVP.\nResearch consortia such as \"end-to-end quality of service support over heterogeneous networks\" (EuQoS, from 2004 through 2007) and fora such as the IPsphere Forum developed more mechanisms for handshaking QoS invocation from one domain to the next. IPsphere defined the Service Structuring Stratum (SSS) signaling bus in order to establish, invoke and (attempt to) assure network services. EuQoS conducted experiments to integrate Session Initiation Protocol, Next Steps in Signaling and IPsphere's SSS with an estimated cost of about 15.6 million Euro and published a book.\nA research project Multi Service Access Everywhere (MUSE) defined another QoS concept in a first phase from January 2004 through February 2006, and a second phase from January 2006 through 2007. Another research project named PlaNetS was proposed for European funding circa 2005.\nA broader European project called \"Architecture and design for the future Internet\" known as 4WARD had a budget estimated at 23.4 million Euro and was funded from January 2008 through June 2010.\nIt included a \"Quality of Service Theme\" and published a book. Another European project, called WIDENS (Wireless Deployable Network System), proposed a bandwidth reservation approach for mobile wireless multirate adhoc networks.\nLimitations.\nStrong cryptography network protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer, I2P, and virtual private networks obscure the data transferred using them. As all electronic commerce on the Internet requires the use of such strong cryptography protocols, unilaterally downgrading the performance of encrypted traffic creates an unacceptable hazard for customers. Yet, encrypted traffic is otherwise unable to undergo deep packet inspection for QoS.\nProtocols like ICA and RDP may encapsulate other traffic (e.g. printing, video streaming) with varying requirements that can make optimization difficult.\nThe Internet2 project found, in 2001, that the QoS protocols were probably not deployable inside its Abilene Network with equipment available at that time. The group predicted that \"logistical, financial, and organizational barriers will block the way toward any bandwidth guarantees\" by protocol modifications aimed at QoS.\nThey believed that the economics would encourage network providers to deliberately erode the quality of best effort traffic as a way to push customers to higher priced QoS services. Instead they proposed over-provisioning of capacity as more cost-effective at the time.\nThe Abilene network study was the basis for the testimony of Gary Bachula to the US Senate Commerce Committee's hearing on Network Neutrality in early 2006. He expressed the opinion that adding more bandwidth was more effective than any of the various schemes for accomplishing QoS they examined. Bachula's testimony has been cited by proponents of a law banning quality of service as proof that no legitimate purpose is served by such an offering. This argument is dependent on the assumption that over-provisioning isn't a form of QoS and that it is always possible. Cost and other factors affect the ability of carriers to build and maintain permanently over-provisioned networks.\nMobile (cellular) QoS.\nMobile cellular service providers may offer mobile QoS to customers just as the wired public switched telephone network services providers and Internet service providers may offer QoS. QoS mechanisms are always provided for circuit switched services, and are essential for inelastic services, for example streaming multimedia.\nMobility adds complications to QoS mechanisms. A phone call or other session may be interrupted after a handover if the new base station is overloaded. Unpredictable handovers make it impossible to give an absolute QoS guarantee during the session initiation phase.\nStandards.\nQuality of service in the field of telephony was first defined in 1994 in ITU-T Recommendation E.800. This definition is very broad, listing 6 primary components: Support, Operability, Accessibility, Retainability, Integrity and Security. In 1998 the ITU published a document discussing QoS in the field of data networking. X.641 offers a means of developing or enhancing standards related to QoS and provide concepts and terminology that should assist in maintaining the consistency of related standards.\nSome QoS-related IETF Request for Comments (RFC)s are , and ; both these are discussed above. The IETF has also published two RFCs giving background on QoS: , and .\nThe IETF has also published as an informative or \"best practices\" document about the practical aspects of designing a QoS solution for a DiffServ network. The document tries to identify applications commonly run over an IP network, groups them into traffic classes, studies the treatment required by these classes from the network, and suggests which of the QoS mechanisms commonly available in routers can be used to implement those treatments.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25316", "revid": "18731412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25316", "title": "Quadrature amplitude modulation", "text": "Family of digital modulation methods\nQuadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the name of a family of digital modulation methods and a related family of analog modulation methods widely used in modern telecommunications to transmit information. It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (\"modulating\") the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves are of the same frequency and are out of phase with each other by 90\u00b0, a condition known as orthogonality or quadrature. The transmitted signal is created by adding the two carrier waves together. At the receiver, the two waves can be coherently separated (demodulated) because of their orthogonality. Another key property is that the modulations are low-frequency/low-bandwidth waveforms compared to the carrier frequency, which is known as the narrowband assumption.\nIn M-ary transmission amplitude-shift keying the phase is the same but with different amplitudes, while phase-shift keying has the same amplitude but different phases. Combining these concepts leads to QAM, where both amplitude and phase are modulated, or two binary PSK signals are combined with orthogonal carriers.\nQAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital communications systems, such as in 802.11 Wi-Fi standards. Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel.\u00a0 QAM is being used in optical fiber systems as bit rates increase; QAM16 and QAM64 can be optically emulated with a three-path interferometer.\nDemodulation.\nIn a QAM signal, one carrier lags the other by 90\u00b0, and its amplitude modulation is customarily referred to as the in-phase component, denoted by \"I\"(\"t\"). The other modulating function is the quadrature component, \"Q\"(\"t\"). So the composite waveform is mathematically modeled as:\nformula_1 \u00a0 \u00a0 or:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere \"f\"c is the carrier frequency.\u00a0 At the receiver, a coherent demodulator multiplies the received signal separately with both a cosine and sine signal to produce the received estimates of \"I\"(\"t\") and \"Q\"(\"t\"). For example:\nformula_2\nUsing standard trigonometric identities, we can write this as:\nformula_3\nLow-pass filtering \"r\"(\"t\") removes the high frequency terms (containing 4\u03c0\"f\"c\"t\"), leaving only the \"I\"(\"t\") term. This filtered signal is unaffected by \"Q\"(\"t\"), showing that the in-phase component can be received independently of the quadrature component.\u00a0 Similarly, we can multiply \"s\"c(\"t\") by a sine wave and then low-pass filter to extract \"Q\"(\"t\").\nThe addition of two sinusoids is a linear operation that creates no new frequency components. So the bandwidth of the composite signal is comparable to the bandwidth of the DSB (double-sideband) components. Effectively, the spectral redundancy of DSB enables a doubling of the information capacity using this technique. This comes at the expense of demodulation complexity. In particular, a DSB signal has zero-crossings at a regular frequency, which makes it easy to recover the phase of the carrier sinusoid. It is said to be self-clocking. But the sender and receiver of a quadrature-modulated signal must share a clock or otherwise send a clock signal. If the clock phases drift apart, the demodulated \"I\" and \"Q\" signals bleed into each other, yielding crosstalk. In this context, the clock signal is called a \"phase reference\". Clock synchronization is typically achieved by transmitting a burst subcarrier or a pilot signal. The phase reference for NTSC, for example, is included within its colorburst signal.\nAnalog QAM is used in:\nFourier analysis.\nApplying Euler's formula to the sinusoids in Eq.1, the positive-frequency portion of \"s\"c (or analytic representation) is:\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 denotes the Fourier transform, and and are the transforms of \"I\"(\"t\") and \"Q\"(\"t\"). This result represents the sum of two DSB-SC signals with the same center frequency. The factor of i (= \"e\"\"i\u03c0\"/2) represents the 90\u00b0 phase shift that enables their individual demodulations.\nDigital QAM.\nAs in many digital modulation schemes, the constellation diagram is useful for QAM. In QAM, the constellation points are usually arranged in a square grid with equal vertical and horizontal spacing, although other configurations are possible (e.g. a hexagonal or triangular grid). In digital telecommunications the data is usually binary, so the number of points in the grid is typically a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, \u2026), corresponding to the number of bits per symbol. The simplest and most commonly used QAM constellations consist of points arranged in a square, i.e. 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM (even powers of two). Non-square constellations, such as Cross-QAM, can offer greater efficiency but are rarely used because of the cost of increased modem complexity.\nBy moving to a higher-order constellation, it is possible to transmit more bits per symbol. However, if the mean energy of the constellation is to remain the same (by way of making a fair comparison), the points must be closer together and are thus more susceptible to noise and other corruption; this results in a higher bit error rate and so higher-order QAM can deliver more data less reliably than lower-order QAM, for constant mean constellation energy. Using higher-order QAM without increasing the bit error rate requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by increasing signal energy, reducing noise, or both.\nIf data rates beyond those offered by 8-PSK are required, it is more usual to move to QAM since it achieves a greater distance between adjacent points in the I-Q plane by distributing the points more evenly. The complicating factor is that the points are no longer all the same amplitude and so the demodulator must now correctly detect both phase and amplitude, rather than just phase.\n64-QAM and 256-QAM are often used in digital cable television and cable modem applications. In the United States, 64-QAM and 256-QAM are the mandated modulation schemes for digital cable (see QAM tuner) as standardised by the SCTE in the standard https://. In the UK, 64-QAM is used for digital terrestrial television (Freeview) whilst 256-QAM is used for Freeview-HD.\nCommunication systems designed to achieve very high levels of spectral efficiency usually employ very dense QAM constellations. For example is ADSL technology for copper twisted pairs, whose constellation size goes up to 32768-QAM (in ADSL terminology this is referred to as bit-loading, or bit per tone, 32768-QAM being equivalent to 15 bits per tone).\nUltra-high capacity microwave backhaul systems also use 1024-QAM. With 1024-QAM, adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) and XPIC, vendors can obtain gigabit capacity in a single 56\u00a0MHz channel.\nInterference and noise.\nIn moving to a higher order QAM constellation (higher data rate and mode) in hostile RF/microwave QAM application environments, such as in broadcasting or telecommunications, multipath interference typically increases. There is a spreading of the spots in the constellation, decreasing the separation between adjacent states, making it difficult for the receiver to decode the signal appropriately. In other words, there is reduced noise immunity. There are several test parameter measurements which help determine an optimal QAM mode for a specific operating environment. The following three are most significant:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
