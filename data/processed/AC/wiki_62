He was born in British India, which inspired much of his work.\nKipling's works of fiction include the \"Jungle Book\" duology (\"The Jungle Book\", 1894; \"The Second Jungle Book\", 1895), \"Kim\" (1901), the \"Just So Stories\" (1902) and many short stories, including \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1888). His poems include \"Mandalay\" (1890), \"Gunga Din\" (1890), \"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\" (1919), \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899) and \"If\u2014\" (1910). He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story. His children's books are classics; one critic noted \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift\".\nKipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom's most popular writers. Henry James said \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known.\" In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and at 41, its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood, but declined both. Following his death in 1936, his ashes were interred at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.\nKipling's subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age. The contrasting views of him continued for much of the 20th century. The literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote that Kipling \"is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.\"\nChildhood (1865\u20131882).\nRudyard Kipling was born on 30 December 1865 in Bombay in the Bombay Presidency of British India, to Alice Kipling (born MacDonald) and John Lockwood Kipling. Alice (one of the four noted MacDonald sisters) was a vivacious woman, of whom Lord Dufferin would say, \"Dullness and Mrs Kipling cannot exist in the same room.\" John Lockwood Kipling, a sculptor and pottery designer, was the Principal and Professor of Architectural Sculpture at the newly founded Sir J. J. School of Art in Bombay.\nJohn Lockwood and Alice met in 1863 and courted at Rudyard Lake in Rudyard, Staffordshire, England. They married and moved to India in 1865 after John Lockwood had accepted the position as Professor at the School of Art. They had been so moved by the beauty of the Rudyard Lake area that they named their first child after it, Joseph Rudyard. Two of Alice's sisters were married to artists: Georgiana to the painter Edward Burne-Jones, and her sister Agnes to Edward Poynter. A third sister, Louisa, was the mother of Kipling's most prominent relative, his first cousin Stanley Baldwin, who was the British prime minister three times in the 1920s and 1930s.\nKipling's birth home on the campus of the Sir J. J. School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the dean's residence. Although a cottage bears a plaque noting it as his birth site, the original building was torn down and replaced. Some historians and conservationists take the view that the bungalow marks a site merely close to the home of Kipling's birth, as it was built in 1882 \u2013 about 15 years after Kipling was born. Kipling seems to have said as much to the dean when visiting J. J. School in the 1930s.\nKipling wrote of Bombay:\n&lt;poem&gt;Mother of Cities to me,\nFor I was born in her gate,\nBetween the palms and the sea,\nWhere the world-end steamers wait.&lt;/poem&gt;\nAccording to Bernice M. Murphy, \"Kipling's parents considered themselves 'Anglo-Indians' [a term used in the 19th century for people of British origin living in India] and so too would their son, though he spent the bulk of his life elsewhere. Complex issues of identity and national allegiance would become prominent in his fiction.\"\nKipling referred to such conflicts. For example: \"In the afternoon heats before we took our sleep, she (the Portuguese \"ayah\", or nanny) or Meeta (the Hindu \"bearer\", or male attendant) would tell us stories and Indian nursery songs all unforgotten, and we were sent into the dining-room after we had been dressed, with the caution 'Speak English now to Papa and Mamma.' So one spoke 'English', haltingly translated out of the vernacular idiom that one thought and dreamed in.\"\nEducation in Britain.\nKipling's days of \"strong light and darkness\" in Bombay ended when he was five. As was the custom in British India, he and his three-year-old sister Alice (\"Trix\") were taken to the United Kingdom \u2013 in their case to Southsea, Portsmouth \u2013 to live with a couple who boarded children of British nationals living abroad. For the next six years (from October 1871 to April 1877), the children lived with the couple \u2013 Captain Pryse Agar Holloway, once an officer in the merchant navy, and Sarah Holloway \u2013 at their house, Lorne Lodge, 4 Campbell Road, Southsea. Kipling referred to the place as \"the House of Desolation\".\nIn his autobiography published 65 years later, Kipling recalled the stay with horror, and wondered if the combination of cruelty and neglect that he experienced there at the hands of Mrs Holloway might not have hastened the onset of his literary life: \"If you cross-examine a child of seven or eight on his day's doings (specially when he wants to go to sleep) he will contradict himself very satisfactorily. If each contradiction be set down as a lie and retailed at breakfast, life is not easy. I have known a certain amount of bullying, but this was calculated torture \u2013 religious as well as scientific. Yet it made me give attention to the lies I soon found it necessary to tell: and this, I presume, is the foundation of literary effort.\"\nTrix fared better at Lorne Lodge; Mrs Holloway apparently hoped that Trix would eventually marry the Holloways' son. The two Kipling children, however, had no relatives in England they could visit, except that they spent a month each Christmas with a maternal aunt Georgiana (\"Georgy\") and her husband, Edward Burne-Jones, at their house, The Grange, in Fulham, London, which Kipling called \"a paradise which I verily believe saved me\".\nIn the spring of 1877 Alice returned from India and removed the children from Lorne Lodge. Kipling remembers \"Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion of what they are likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it.\"\nAlice took the children during spring 1877 to Goldings Farm at Loughton, where a carefree summer and autumn was spent on the farm and adjoining Forest, some of the time with Stanley Baldwin. In January 1878, Kipling was admitted to the United Services College at Westward Ho!, Devon, a school recently founded to prepare boys for the army. It proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories \"Stalky &amp; Co.\" (1899). While there, Kipling met and fell in love with Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned). Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling's first novel, \"The Light That Failed\" (1891).\nReturn to India.\nNear the end of his schooling, it was decided that Kipling did not have the academic ability to get into Oxford University on a scholarship. His parents lacked the wherewithal to finance him, and so Kipling's father obtained a job for him in Lahore, where the father served as Principal of the Mayo College of Art and Curator of the Lahore Museum. Kipling was to be assistant editor of a local newspaper, the \"Civil and Military Gazette\".\nHe sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October. He described the moment years later: \"So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them.\" This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: \"There were yet three or four days' rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength.\"\nEarly adult life (1882\u20131914).\nFrom 1883 to 1889 Kipling worked in British India for local newspapers such as the \"Civil and Military Gazette\" in Lahore and \"The Pioneer\" in Allahabad.\nThe former, which was the newspaper Kipling was to call his \"mistress and most true love\", appeared six days a week throughout the year, except for one-day breaks for Christmas and Easter. Stephen Wheeler, the editor, worked Kipling hard, but Kipling's need to write was unstoppable. In 1886 he published his first collection of verse, \"Departmental Ditties\". That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; Kay Robinson, the new editor, allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper.\nIn an article printed in the \"Chums\" boys' annual, an ex-colleague of Kipling's stated that \"he never knew such a fellow for ink \u2013 he simply revelled in it, filling up his pen viciously, and then throwing the contents all over the office, so that it was almost dangerous to approach him.\" The anecdote continues: \"In the hot weather when he (Kipling) wore only white trousers and a thin vest, he is said to have resembled a Dalmatian dog more than a human being, for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction.\"\nIn the summer of 1883 Kipling visited Simla (today Shimla), a well-known hill station and the summer capital of British India. By then it was the practice for the Viceroy of India and government to move to Simla for six months, and the town became a \"centre of power as well as pleasure\". Kipling's family became annual visitors to Simla, and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in Christ Church there. Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888, and the town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for the \"Gazette\". \"My month's leave at Simla, or whatever Hill Station my people went to, was pure joy \u2013 every golden hour counted. It began in heat and discomfort, by rail and road. It ended in the cool evening, with a wood fire in one's bedroom, and next morn \u2013 thirty more of them ahead! \u2013 the early cup of tea, the Mother who brought it in, and the long talks of us all together again. One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one's head, and that was usually full.\"\nBack in Lahore, 39 of his stories appeared in the \"Gazette\" between November 1886 and June 1887. Kipling included most of them in \"Plain Tales from the Hills\", his first prose collection, published in Calcutta in January 1888, a month after his 22nd birthday. Kipling's time in Lahore, however, had come to an end. In November 1887 he was moved to the \"Gazette\"'s larger sister newspaper, \"The Pioneer\", in Allahabad in the United Provinces, where he worked as assistant editor and lived in Belvedere House from 1888 to 1889.\nKipling's writing continued at a frenetic pace. In 1888 he published six collections of short stories: \"Soldiers Three\", \"The Story of the Gadsbys\", \"In Black and White\", \"Under the Deodars\", \"The Phantom Rickshaw\" and \"Wee Willie Winkie\". These contain a total of 41 stories, some quite long. In addition, as \"The Pioneer\"'s special correspondent in the western region of Rajputana, he wrote many sketches that were later collected in \"Letters of Marque\" and published in \"From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel\".\nKipling was discharged from \"The Pioneer\" in early 1889 after a dispute. By this time, he had been increasingly thinking of his future. He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for \u00a3200 and a small royalty, and the \"Plain Tales\" for \u00a350; in addition, he received six months' salary from \"The Pioneer\", \"in lieu\" of notice.\nReturn to London.\nKipling decided to use the money to move to London, the literary centre of the British Empire. On 9 March 1889, he left India, travelling first to San Francisco via Rangoon, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Kipling was favourably impressed by Japan, calling its people and ways \"gracious folk and fair manners\". The Nobel Prize committee cited Kipling's writing on the manners and customs of the Japanese when they awarded his Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907.\nKipling later wrote that he \"had lost his heart\" to a geisha whom he called O-Toyo, writing while in the United States during the same trip across the Pacific, \"I had left the innocent East far behind... Weeping softly for O-Toyo... O-Toyo was a darling.\" Kipling then travelled through the United States, writing articles for \"The Pioneer\" that were later published in \"From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel\".\nStarting his North American travels in San Francisco, Kipling went north to Portland, Oregon, then Seattle, Washington, up to Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia, through Medicine Hat, Alberta, back into the US to Yellowstone National Park, down to Salt Lake City, then east to Omaha, Nebraska and on to Chicago, then to Beaver, Pennsylvania on the Ohio River to visit the Hill family -- Mrs. Edmonia 'Ted' Hill, \"eight years older than [him, who had] become Kipling's closest confidante, friend and sometimes collaborator\" in British India, and her husband, Professor S. A. Hill, who [had] taught Physical Science at Muir College in Alhallabad. From Beaver, Kipling went to Chautauqua with Professor Hill, and later to Niagara Falls, Toronto, Washington, D.C., New York and Boston.\nIn the course of this journey he met Mark Twain in Elmira, New York, and was deeply impressed. Kipling arrived unannounced at Twain's home, and later wrote that as he rang the doorbell, \"It occurred to me for the first time that Mark Twain might possibly have other engagements other than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from India, be they ever so full of admiration.\"\nAs it was, Twain gladly welcomed Kipling and had a two-hour conversation with him on trends in Anglo-American literature and about what Twain was going to write in a sequel to \"Tom Sawyer\", with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming, although he had not decided upon the ending: either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or he would be hanged. Twain also passed along the literary advice that an author should \"get your facts first and then you can distort 'em as much as you please.\" Twain, who rather liked Kipling, later wrote of their meeting: \"Between us, we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and I cover the rest.\" Kipling then crossed the Atlantic to Liverpool in October 1889. He soon made his d\u00e9but in the London literary world, to great acclaim.\nLondon.\nIn London Kipling had several stories accepted by magazines. He found a place to live for the next two years at Villiers Street, near Charing Cross (in a building subsequently named Kipling House):\nMeantime, I had found me quarters in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six years ago was primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower walked up and down with his traffic.\nIn the next two years, he published a novel, \"The Light That Failed\", had a nervous breakdown, and met an American writer and publishing agent, Wolcott Balestier, with whom he collaborated on a novel, \"\" (a title which he uncharacteristically misspelt; see below). In 1891, as advised by his doctors, Kipling took another sea voyage, to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and once again India. He cut short his plans to spend Christmas with his family in India when he heard of Balestier's sudden death from typhoid fever and decided to return to London immediately. Before his return, he had used the telegram to propose to, and be accepted by, Wolcott's sister, Caroline Starr Balestier (1862\u20131939), called \"Carrie\", whom he had met a year earlier, and with whom he had apparently been having an intermittent romance. Meanwhile, late in 1891, a collection of his short stories on the British in India, \"Life's Handicap\", was published in London.\nOn 18 January 1892 Carrie Balestier (aged 29) and Kipling (aged 26) married in London, in the \"thick of an influenza epidemic, when the undertakers had run out of black horses and the dead had to be content with brown ones.\" The wedding was held at All Souls Church in Langham Place, Central London. Henry James gave away the bride.\nUnited States.\nKipling and his wife settled upon a honeymoon that took them first to the United States (including a stop at the Balestier family estate near Brattleboro, Vermont) and then to Japan. On arriving in Yokohama, they discovered that their bank, The New Oriental Banking Corporation, had failed. Taking this loss in their stride, they returned to the US, back to Vermont \u2013 Carrie by this time was pregnant with their first child \u2013 and rented a small cottage on a farm near Brattleboro for $10 a month. According to Kipling, \"We furnished it with a simplicity that fore-ran the hire-purchase system. We bought, second or third hand, a huge, hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar. We cut generous holes in our thin floors for its eight-inch [20 cm] tin pipes (why we were not burned in our beds each week of the winter I never can understand) and we were extraordinarily and self-centredly content.\"\nIn this house, which they called \"Bliss Cottage\", their first child, Josephine, was born \"in three-foot of snow on the night of 29th December, 1892. Her Mother's birthday being the 31st and mine the 30th of the same month, we congratulated her on her sense of the fitness of things...\"\nIt was also in this cottage that the first dawnings of \"The Jungle Books\" came to Kipling: \"The workroom in the Bliss Cottage was seven feet by eight, and from December to April, the snow lay level with its window-sill. It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of '92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in Haggard's \"Nada the Lily\", combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two \"Jungle Books\".\"\nWith Josephine's arrival, \"Bliss Cottage\" was felt to be congested, so eventually the couple bought land \u2013 on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River \u2013 from Carrie's brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house. Kipling named this Naulakha, in honour of Wolcott and of their collaboration, and this time the name was spelt correctly. From his early years in Lahore (1882\u201387), Kipling had become enamoured with the Mughal architecture, especially the Naulakha pavilion situated in Lahore Fort, which eventually inspired the title of his novel as well as the house. The house still stands on Kipling Road, north of Brattleboro in Dummerston, Vermont: a big, secluded, dark-green house, with shingled roof and sides, which Kipling called his \"ship\", and which brought him \"sunshine and a mind at ease\". His seclusion in Vermont, combined with his healthy \"sane clean life\", made Kipling both inventive and prolific.\nIn a mere four years he produced, along with the \"Jungle Books\", a book of short stories (\"The Day's Work\"), a novel (\"Captains Courageous\"), and a profusion of poetry, including the volume \"The Seven Seas\". The collection of \"Barrack-Room Ballads\" was issued in March 1892, first published individually for the most part in 1890, and contained his poems \"Mandalay\" and \"Gunga Din\". He especially enjoyed writing the \"Jungle Books\" and also corresponding with many children who wrote to him about them.\nLife in New England.\nThe writing life in \"Naulakha\" was occasionally interrupted by visitors, including his father, who visited soon after his retirement in 1893, and the British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, who brought his golf clubs, stayed for two days, and gave Kipling an extended golf lesson. Kipling seemed to take to golf, occasionally practising with the local Congregational minister and even playing with red-painted balls when the ground was covered in snow. However, winter golf was \"not altogether a success because there were no limits to a drive; the ball might skid down the long slope to Connecticut river.\"\nKipling loved the outdoors, not least of whose marvels in Vermont was the turning of the leaves each fall. He described this moment in a letter: \"A little maple began it, flaming blood-red of a sudden where he stood against the dark green of a pine-belt. Next morning there was an answering signal from the swamp where the sumacs grow. Three days later, the hill-sides as fast as the eye could range were afire, and the roads paved, with crimson and gold. Then a wet wind blew, and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army; and the oaks, who had held themselves in reserve, buckled on their dull and bronzed cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf, till nothing remained but pencil-shadings of bare boughs, and one could see into the most private heart of the woods.\"\nIn February 1896 Elsie Kipling was born, the couple's second daughter. By this time, according to several biographers, their marital relationship was no longer light-hearted and spontaneous. Although they would always remain loyal to each other, they seemed now to have fallen into set roles. In a letter to a friend who had become engaged around this time, the 30\u2011year\u2011old Kipling offered this sombre counsel: marriage principally taught \"the tougher virtues \u2013 such as humility, restraint, order, and forethought.\" Later in the same year, he temporarily taught at Bishop's College School in Quebec, Canada.\nThe Kiplings loved life in Vermont and might have lived out their lives there, were it not for two incidents \u2013 one of global politics, the other of family discord. By the early 1890s, the United Kingdom and Venezuela were in a border dispute involving British Guiana. The US had made several offers to arbitrate, but in 1895 the new American Secretary of State, Richard Olney, upped the ante by arguing for the American \"right\" to arbitrate on grounds of sovereignty on the continent (see the Olney interpretation as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine). This raised hackles in Britain, and the situation grew into a major Anglo-American crisis, with talk of war on both sides.\nAlthough the crisis eased into greater American\u2013British co-operation, Kipling was bewildered by what he felt was persistent anti-British sentiment in the US, especially in the press. He wrote in a letter that it felt like being \"aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table.\" By January 1896 he had decided to end his family's \"good wholesome life\" in the US and seek their fortunes elsewhere.\nA family dispute became the final straw. For some time, relations between Carrie and her brother Beatty Balestier had been strained, owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896 an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling on the street and threatened him with physical harm. The incident led to Beatty's eventual arrest, but in the subsequent hearing and the resulting publicity, Kipling's privacy was destroyed, and he was left feeling miserable and exhausted. In July 1896, a week before the hearing was to resume, the Kiplings packed their belongings, left the United States and returned to England.\nDevon.\nBy September 1896 the Kiplings were in Torquay, Devon, on the south-western coast of England, in a hillside home (Rock House, Maidencombe) overlooking the English Channel. Although Kipling did not much care for his new house, whose design, he claimed, left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy, he managed to remain productive and socially active.\nKipling was now a famous man, and in the previous two or three years had increasingly been making political pronouncements in his writings. The Kiplings had welcomed their first son, John, in August 1897. Kipling had begun work on two poems, \"Recessional\" (1897) and \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899), which were to create controversy when published. Regarded by some as anthems for enlightened and duty-bound empire-building (capturing the mood of the Victorian era), the poems were seen by others as propaganda for brazen-faced imperialism and its attendant racial attitudes; still others saw irony in the poems and warnings of the perils of empire.\n&lt;poem&gt;Take up the White Man's burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo, bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives' need;\nTo wait, in heavy harness,\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught sullen peoples,\nHalf devil and half child.\n\u2014\"The White Man's Burden\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThere was also foreboding in the poems, a sense that all could yet come to naught.\n&lt;poem&gt;Far-called, our navies melt away;\nOn dune and headland sinks the fire:\nLo, all our pomp of yesterday\nIs one with Nineveh and Tyre!\nJudge of the Nations, spare us yet.\nLest we forget \u2013 lest we forget!\n\u2014\"Recessional\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nA prolific writer during his time in Torquay, he also wrote \"Stalky &amp; Co.\", a collection of school stories (born of his experience at the United Services College in Westward Ho!), whose juvenile protagonists display a know-it-all, cynical outlook on patriotism and authority. According to his family, Kipling enjoyed reading aloud stories from \"Stalky &amp; Co.\" to them and often went into spasms of laughter over his own jokes.\nVisits to South Africa.\nIn early 1898 the Kiplings travelled to South Africa for their winter holiday, so beginning an annual tradition which (except the following year) would last until 1908. They would stay in \"The Woolsack\", a house on Cecil Rhodes's estate at Groote Schuur (now a student residence for the University of Cape Town), within walking distance of Rhodes' mansion.\nWith his new reputation as \"Poet of the Empire\", Kipling was warmly received by some of the influential politicians of the Cape Colony, including Rhodes, Sir Alfred Milner and Leander Starr Jameson. Kipling cultivated their friendship and came to admire the men and their politics. The period 1898\u20131910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), the ensuing peace treaty, and the 1910 formation of the Union of South Africa. Back in England, Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900, became a correspondent for \"The Friend\" newspaper in Bloemfontein, which had been commandeered by Lord Roberts for British troops.\nAlthough his journalistic stint was to last only two weeks, it was Kipling's first work on a newspaper staff since he left \"The Pioneer\" in Allahabad more than ten years before. At \"The Friend\", he made lifelong friendships with Perceval Landon, H. A. Gwynne and others. He also wrote articles published more widely expressing his views on the conflict. Kipling penned an inscription for the Honoured Dead Memorial in Kimberley.\nSussex.\nIn 1897 Kipling moved from Torquay to Rottingdean, near Brighton, East Sussex \u2013 first to North End House and then to the Elms. In 1902 Kipling bought Bateman's, a house built in 1634 and located in rural Burwash.\nBateman's was Kipling's home from 1902 until his death in 1936. The house and its surrounding buildings, the mill and , were bought for \u00a39,300. It had no bathroom, no running water upstairs and no electricity, but Kipling loved it: \"Behold us, lawful owners of a grey stone lichened house \u2013 A.D. 1634 over the door \u2013 beamed, panelled, with old oak staircase, and all untouched and unfaked. It is a good and peaceable place. We have loved it ever since our first sight of it\" (from a November 1902 letter).\nIn the non-fiction realm, he became involved in the debate over the British response to the rise in German naval power known as the Tirpitz Plan, to build a fleet to challenge the Royal Navy, publishing a series of articles in 1898 collected as \"A Fleet in Being\". On a visit to the United States in 1899, Kipling and his daughter Josephine developed pneumonia, from which she eventually died.\nIn the wake of his daughter's death, Kipling concentrated on collecting material for what became \"Just So Stories for Little Children\", published in 1902, the year after \"Kim\". The American art historian Janice Leoshko and the American literary scholar David Scott have argued that \"Kim\" disproves the claim by Edward Said that Kipling was a promoter of Orientalism, since Kipling \u2013 who was deeply interested in Buddhism \u2013 presented Tibetan Buddhism in a fairly sympathetic light and aspects of the novel appeared to reflect a Buddhist understanding of the universe. Kipling was offended by the German Emperor Wilhelm II's Hun speech \"()\" in 1900, urging German troops being sent to China to crush the Boxer Rebellion to behave like \"Huns\" and take no prisoners.\nIn a 1902 poem, \"The Rowers\", Kipling attacked the Kaiser as a threat to Britain and made the first use of the term \"Hun\" as an anti-German insult, using Wilhelm's own words and the actions of German troops in China to portray Germans as essentially barbarian. In an interview with the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\", the Francophile Kipling called Germany a menace and called for an Anglo-French alliance to stop it. In another letter at the same time, Kipling described the \"\"unfrei\" peoples of Central Europe\" as living in \"the Middle Ages with machine guns\".\nSpeculative fiction.\nKipling wrote a number of speculative fiction short stories, including \"The Army of a Dream\", in which he sought to show a more efficient and responsible army than the hereditary bureaucracy of England at the time, and two science fiction stories: \"With the Night Mail\" (1905) and \"As Easy As A.B.C.\" (1912). Both were set in the 21st century in Kipling's Aerial Board of Control universe. They read like modern hard science fiction, and introduced the literary technique known as indirect exposition, which would later become one of the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein's hallmarks. This technique is one that Kipling picked up in India, and used to solve the problem of his English readers not understanding much about Indian society when writing \"The Jungle Book\".\nNobel laureate and beyond.\nIn 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, having been nominated in that year by Charles Oman, professor at the University of Oxford. The prize citation said it was \"in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author.\" Nobel prizes had been established in 1901 and Kipling was the first English-language recipient. At the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1907, the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, Carl David af Wirs\u00e9n, praised both Kipling and three centuries of English literature:\nThe Swedish Academy, in awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature this year to Rudyard Kipling, desires to pay a tribute of homage to the literature of England, so rich in manifold glories, and to the greatest genius in the realm of narrative that that country has produced in our times.\nTo \"book-end\" this achievement came the publication of two connected poetry and story collections: \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" (1906), and \"Rewards and Fairies\" (1910). The latter contained the poem \"If\u2014\". In a 1995 BBC opinion poll it was voted the UK's favourite poem. This exhortation to self-control and stoicism is arguably Kipling's most famous poem.\nSuch was Kipling's popularity that he was asked by his friend Max Aitken to intervene in the 1911 Canadian federal election on behalf of the Conservatives. In 1911 the major issue in Canada was a reciprocity treaty with the United States signed by the Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and vigorously opposed by the Conservatives under Sir Robert Borden. On 7 September 1911, the \"Montreal Daily Star\" newspaper published a front-page appeal against the agreement by Kipling, who wrote: \"It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social, and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.\" At the time, the \"Montreal Daily Star\" was Canada's most read newspaper. Over the next week, Kipling's appeal was reprinted in every English newspaper in Canada and is credited with helping to turn Canadian public opinion against the Liberal government.\nKipling sympathised with the anti-Home Rule stance of Irish Unionists, who opposed Irish autonomy. He was friends with Edward Carson, the Dublin-born leader of Ulster Unionism, who raised the Ulster Volunteers to prevent Home Rule in Ireland. Kipling wrote in a letter to a friend that Ireland was not a nation, and that before the English arrived in 1169, the Irish were a gang of cattle thieves living in savagery and killing each other while \"writing dreary poems\" about it all. In his view it was only British rule that allowed Ireland to advance. A visit to Ireland in 1911 confirmed Kipling's prejudices. He wrote that the Irish countryside was beautiful, but spoiled by what he called the ugly homes of Irish farmers, with Kipling adding that God had made the Irish into poets having \"deprived them of love of line or knowledge of colour.\" In contrast, Kipling had nothing but praise for the \"decent folk\" of the Protestant minority and Unionist Ulster, free from the threat of \"constant mob violence\".\nKipling wrote the poem \"Ulster\" in 1912, reflecting his Unionist politics. Kipling often referred to the Irish Unionists as \"our party\". Kipling had no sympathy or understanding for Irish nationalism, seeing Home Rule as an act of treason by the government of the Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that would plunge Ireland into the Dark Ages and allow the Irish Catholic majority to oppress the Protestant minority. The scholar David Gilmour wrote that Kipling's lack of understanding of Ireland could be seen in his attack on John Redmond \u2013 the Anglophile leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party who wanted Home Rule because he believed it was the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together \u2013 as a traitor working to break up the United Kingdom. \"Ulster\" was first publicly read at an Unionist rally in Belfast, where the largest Union Jack ever made was unfolded. Kipling admitted it was meant to strike a \"hard blow\" against the Asquith government's Home Rule bill: \"Rebellion, rapine, hate, Oppression, wrong and greed, Are loosed to rule our fate, By England's act and deed.\" \"Ulster\" generated much controversy with the Conservative MP Sir Mark Sykes \u2013 who as a Unionist was opposed to the Home Rule bill \u2013 condemning \"Ulster\" in \"The Morning Post\" as a \"direct appeal to ignorance and a deliberate attempt to foster religious hate.\"\nKipling was a staunch opponent of Bolshevism, a position which he shared with his friend Henry Rider Haggard. The two had bonded on Kipling's arrival in London in 1889, largely on the strength of their shared opinions, and remained lifelong friends.\nFreemasonry.\nAccording to the English magazine \"Masonic Illustrated\", Kipling became a Freemason in about 1885, before the usual minimum age of 21, being initiated into Hope and Perseverance Lodge No. 782 in Lahore. He later wrote to \"The Times\", \"I was Secretary for some years of the Lodge... which included Brethren of at least four creeds. I was entered [as an Apprentice] by a member from Brahmo Somaj, a Hindu, passed [to the degree of Fellow Craft] by a Mohammedan, and raised [to the degree of Master Mason] by an Englishman. Our Tyler was an Indian Jew.\" Kipling received not only the three degrees of Craft Masonry but also the side degrees of Mark Master Mason and Royal Ark Mariner.\nKipling so loved his Masonic experience that he memorialised its ideals in his poem \"The Mother Lodge\", and used the fraternity and its symbols as vital plot devices in his novella \"The Man Who Would Be King\".\nFirst World War (1914\u20131918).\nAt the beginning of the First World War Kipling, like others, wrote pamphlets and poems enthusiastically supporting the UK war aim of restoring Belgium after it had been occupied by Germany, together with generalised statements that Britain was standing up for the cause of good. In September 1914 Kipling was asked by the government to write propaganda, to which he agreed. Kipling's pamphlets and stories were popular with the British people during the war. His major themes were to glorify the British military as \"the\" place for heroic men to be, while citing German atrocities against Belgian civilians and stories of women brutalised by a horrific war unleashed by Germany, yet surviving and triumphing in spite of their suffering.\nKipling was enraged by reports of the Rape of Belgium together with the sinking of the in 1915, which he saw as a deeply inhumane act, leading him to view the war as a crusade for civilisation against barbarism. In a 1915 speech, Kipling declared, \"There was no crime, no cruelty, no abomination that the mind of men can conceive of which the German has not perpetrated, is not perpetrating, and will not perpetrate if he is allowed to go on... Today, there are only two divisions in the world... human beings and Germans.\"\nAlongside his passionate antipathy towards Germany, Kipling was privately deeply critical of how the war was being fought by the British Army. Shocked by the heavy losses that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914, he blamed the entire pre-war generation of British politicians who, Kipling argued, had failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War. Thus thousands of British soldiers were paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium.\nKipling scorned men who shirked duty in the First World War. In \"The New Army in Training\" (1915), He concluded by saying:\nThis much we can realise, even though we are so close to it, the old safe instinct saves us from triumph and exultation. But what will be the position in years to come of the young man who has deliberately elected to outcaste himself from this all-embracing brotherhood? What of his family, and, above all, what of his descendants, when the books have been closed and the last balance struck of sacrifice and sorrow in every hamlet, village, parish, suburb, city, shire, district, province, and Dominion throughout the Empire?\nIn 1914 Kipling was one of 53 British authors\u00a0\u2013 a number that included H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Thomas Hardy\u00a0\u2013 who signed their names to the \"Authors' Declaration.\" This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.\"\nDeath of John Kipling.\nKipling's only son, John, was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in September 1915, at age 18. John initially wanted to join the Royal Navy, but having had his application turned down due to poor eyesight, he applied for military service as an army officer. Again, his eyesight was an issue during the medical examination. He tried twice to enlist, but was rejected. His father had been lifelong friends with Lord Roberts, former commander-in-chief of the British Army, and colonel of the Irish Guards, and at Rudyard's request, John was accepted into the Irish Guards.\nJohn Kipling was sent to Loos two days into the battle in a reinforcement contingent. He was last seen stumbling through the mud blindly, with a possible facial injury. A body identified as his was found in 1992, although that identification has been challenged. In 2015 the Commonwealth War Grave Commission confirmed that it had correctly identified the burial place of John Kipling; they recorded his date of death as 27 September 1915, and that he is buried at St Mary's A.D.S. Cemetery, Haisnes.\nAfter his son's death, in a poem titled \"Epitaphs of the War\", Kipling wrote \"If any question why we died / Tell them, because our fathers lied.\" Critics have speculated that these words may express Kipling's guilt over his role in arranging John's commission. Professor Tracy Bilsing contends that the line refers to Kipling's disgust that British leaders failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War, and were unprepared for the struggle with Germany in 1914, with the \"lie\" of the \"fathers\" being that the British Army was prepared for war when it was not.\nJohn's death has been linked to Kipling's 1916 poem \"My Boy Jack\", by the play \"My Boy Jack\" and its subsequent television adaptation, along with the documentary \"\". However, the poem was originally published at the head of a story about the Battle of Jutland and appears to refer to a death at sea; the \"Jack\" referred to may be the boy VC Jack Cornwell, or perhaps a generic \"Jack Tar\". In the Kipling family, Jack was the name of the family dog, while John Kipling was always John, making the identification of the protagonist of \"My Boy Jack\" with John Kipling questionable. However, Kipling was emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of Jane Austen aloud to his wife and daughter. During the war, he wrote a booklet \"The Fringes of the Fleet\" containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war. Some of these were set to music by the English composer Edward Elgar.\nKipling became friends with a French soldier named Maurice Hammoneau, whose life had been saved in the First World War when his copy of \"Kim\", which he had in his left breast pocket, stopped a bullet. Hammoneau presented Kipling with the book, with bullet still embedded, and his Croix de Guerre as a token of gratitude. They continued to correspond, and when Hammoneau had a son, Kipling insisted on returning the book and medal.\nOn 1 August 1918 the poem \"The Old Volunteer\" appeared under his name in \"The Times\". The next day, he wrote to the newspaper to disclaim authorship and a correction appeared. Although \"The Times\" employed a private detective to investigate, the detective appears to have suspected Kipling of being the author, and the identity of the hoaxer was never established.\nAfter the war (1918\u20131936).\nPartly in response to John's death, Kipling joined Sir Fabian Ware's Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the group responsible for the garden-like British war graves that can be found to this day dotted along the former Western Front and the other places in the world where British Empire troops lie buried. His main contributions to the project were his selection of the biblical phrase, \"Their Name Liveth For Evermore\" (Ecclesiasticus 44.14, KJV), found on the Stones of Remembrance in larger war cemeteries, and his suggestion of the phrase \"Known unto God\" for the gravestones of unidentified servicemen. He also chose the inscription \"The Glorious Dead\" on the Cenotaph, Whitehall, London. Additionally, he wrote a two-volume history of the Irish Guards, his son's regiment, published in 1923 and seen as one of the finest examples of regimental history.\nKipling's short story \"The Gardener\" depicts visits to the war cemeteries, and the poem \"The King's Pilgrimage\" (1922) a journey which King George V made, touring the cemeteries and memorials under construction by the Imperial War Graves Commission. With the increasing prevalence of the automobile, Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press, writing enthusiastically of trips around England and abroad, though he was usually driven by a chauffeur.\nAfter the war, Kipling was sceptical of the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations, but had hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and the post-war world be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance. He hoped the United States would take on a League of Nations mandate for Armenia as the best way of preventing isolationism, and hoped that Theodore Roosevelt, whom Kipling admired, would again become president. Kipling was saddened by Roosevelt's death in 1919, believing him to be the only American politician capable of keeping the United States in the \"game\" of world politics.\nKipling was hostile towards communism, writing of the Bolshevik take-over in 1917 that one sixth of the world had \"passed bodily out of civilization\". In a poem in 1918 Kipling wrote of Soviet Russia that everything good in Russia had been destroyed by the Bolsheviks \u2013 all that was left was \"the sound of weeping and the sight of burning fire, and the shadow of a people trampled into the mire.\"\nIn 1920 Kipling co-founded the Liberty League with Haggard and Lord Sydenham. This short-lived enterprise focused on promoting classic liberal ideals as a response to the rising power of communist tendencies within Great Britain, or as Kipling put it, \"to combat the advance of Bolshevism.\"\nIn 1922 Kipling, having referred to the work of engineers in some of his poems, such as \"The Sons of Martha\", \"Sappers\" and \"McAndrew's Hymn\", and in other writings, including short-story anthologies such as \"The Day's Work\", was asked by a University of Toronto civil engineering professor, Herbert E. T. Haultain, for assistance in developing a dignified obligation and ceremony for graduating engineering students. Kipling was enthusiastic in his response and shortly produced both, formally titled \"The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer\". Today, engineering graduates all across Canada are presented with an iron ring at a ceremony to remind them of their obligation to society. In 1922 Kipling became Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews, a three-year position.\nKipling, as a Francophile, argued strongly for an Anglo-French alliance to uphold the peace, calling Britain and France in 1920 the \"twin fortresses of European civilization\". Similarly, Kipling repeatedly warned against revising the Treaty of Versailles in Germany's favour, which he predicted would lead to a new world war. An admirer of Raymond Poincar\u00e9, Kipling was one of few British intellectuals who supported the French Occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, at a time when the British government and most public opinion was against the French position. In contrast to the popular British view of Poincar\u00e9 as a cruel bully intent on impoverishing Germany with unreasonable reparations, Kipling argued that he was rightfully trying to preserve France as a great power in the face of an unfavourable situation. Kipling argued that even before 1914, Germany's larger economy and higher birth rate had made that country stronger than France; with much of France devastated by war and the French suffering heavy losses meant that its low birth rate would give it trouble, while Germany was mostly undamaged and still with a higher birth rate. So he reasoned that the future would bring German domination if Versailles were revised in Germany's favour, and it was madness for Britain to press France to do so.\nIn 1924 Kipling was opposed to the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald as \"Bolshevism without bullets\". He believed Labour was a communist front organisation, and \"excited orders and instructions from Moscow\" would expose Labour as such to the British people. Kipling's views were on the political right. Though he admired Benito Mussolini to some extent in the 1920s, he was against fascism, calling Oswald Mosley \"a bounder and an \"arriviste\"\". By 1935 he was calling Mussolini a deranged and dangerous egomaniac and in 1933 wrote, \"The Hitlerites are out for blood\".\nDespite his anti-communism, Kipling was popular with Russian readers in the interwar period. Many younger Russian poets and writers, such as Konstantin Simonov, were influenced by him. Kipling's clarity of style, use of colloquial language and employment of rhythm and rhyme were seen as major innovations in poetry that appealed to many younger Russian poets. Though it was obligatory for Soviet journals to begin translations of Kipling with an attack on him as a \"fascist\" and an \"imperialist\", such was Kipling's popularity with Russian readers that his works were not banned in the Soviet Union until 1939, with the signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. The ban was lifted in 1941 after Operation Barbarossa, when Britain become a Soviet ally, but imposed again with the Cold War in 1946.\nMany older editions of Rudyard Kipling's books have a swastika printed on the cover, associated with a picture of an elephant carrying a lotus flower, reflecting the influence of Indian culture. Kipling's use of the swastika was based on the Indian sun symbol conferring good luck and the Sanskrit word meaning \"fortunate\" or \"well-being\". He used the swastika symbol in both right and left-facing forms, and it was in general use by others at the time.\nIn a note to Edward Bok after the death of Lockwood Kipling in 1911, Rudyard said: \"I am sending with this for your acceptance, as some little memory of my father to whom you were so kind, the original of one of the plaques that he used to make for me. I thought it being the Swastika would be appropriate for your Swastika. May it bring you even more good fortune.\" Once the swastika had become widely associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, Kipling ordered that it should no longer adorn his books. Less than a year before his death, Kipling gave a speech (titled \"An Undefended Island\") to the Royal Society of St George on 6 May 1935, warning of the danger which Nazi Germany posed to Britain.\nKipling scripted the first Royal Christmas Message, delivered via the BBC's Empire Service by George V in 1932. In 1934, he published a short story in \"The Strand Magazine\", \"Proofs of Holy Writ\", postulating that William Shakespeare had helped to polish the prose of the King James Bible.\nDeath.\nKipling kept writing until the early 1930s, but at a slower pace and with less success than before. On the night of 12 January 1936 he suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine. He underwent surgery, but died at Middlesex Hospital in London less than a week later on 18 January 1936, at the age of 70, of a perforated duodenal ulcer. Kipling's body lay in state in the Fitzrovia Chapel, part of Middlesex Hospital, after his death, and is commemorated with a plaque near the altar. His death had previously been incorrectly announced in a magazine, to which he wrote, \"I've just read that I am dead. Don't forget to delete me from your list of subscribers.\"\nThe pallbearers at the funeral included Kipling's cousin, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and the marble casket was covered by a Union Jack. Kipling was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in north-west London, and his ashes interred at Poets' Corner, part of the south transept of Westminster Abbey, next to the graves of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy. Kipling's will was proven on 6 April, with his estate valued at \u00a3168,141 2s. 11d. (roughly equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023).\nLegacy.\nIn 2002 Kipling's \"Just So Stories\" featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the centenary of the publication of the book. In 2010, the International Astronomical Union approved the naming of a crater on the planet Mercury after Kipling \u2013 one of ten newly discovered impact craters observed by the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2008\u20132009. In 2012 an extinct species of crocodile, \"Goniopholis kiplingi\", was named in his honour \"in recognition for his enthusiasm for natural sciences.\" More than 50 unpublished poems by Kipling, discovered by the American scholar Thomas Pinney, were released for the first time in March 2013.\nKipling's writing has strongly influenced that of others. His stories for adults remain in print and have garnered high praise from writers such as Randall Jarrell, who wrote: \"After you have read Kipling's fifty or seventy-five best stories you realize that few men have written this many stories of this much merit, and that very few have written more and better stories.\"\nHis children's stories remain popular and his \"Jungle Books\" made into several films. The first was made by the producer Alexander Korda. Other films have been produced by The Walt Disney Company. A number of his poems were set to music by Percy Grainger. A series of short films based on some of his stories was broadcast by the BBC in 1964. Kipling's work is still popular today.\nThe poet T. S. Eliot edited \"A Choice of Kipling's Verse\" (1941) with an introductory essay. Eliot was aware of the complaints that had been levelled against Kipling and he dismissed them one by one: that Kipling is \"a Tory\" using his verse to transmit right wing political views, or \"a journalist\" pandering to popular taste; while Eliot writes: \"I cannot find any justification for the charge that he held a doctrine of race superiority.\" Eliot finds instead:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An immense gift for using words, an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses, the mask of the entertainer, and beyond that a queer gift of second sight, of transmitting messages from elsewhere, a gift so disconcerting when we are made aware of it that thenceforth we are never sure when it is \"not\" present: all this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle.\u2014\u200a\nOf Kipling's verse, such as his \"Barrack-Room Ballads\", Eliot writes \"of a number of poets who have written great poetry, only... a very few whom I should call great verse writers. And unless I am mistaken, Kipling's position in this class is not only high, but unique.\"\nIn response to Eliot, George Orwell wrote a long consideration of Kipling's work for \"Horizon\" in 1942, noting that although as a \"jingo imperialist\" Kipling was \"morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting\", his work had many qualities which ensured that while \"every enlightened person has despised him... nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there.\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One reason for Kipling's power [was] his sense of responsibility, which made it possible for him to have a world-view, even though it happened to be a false one. Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question, 'In such and such circumstances, what would you \"do?\"', whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover, anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings', as Kipling put it, always return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to \"\u00e9pater les bourgeois\". He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of \"Man and Superman\".\u2014\u200a\nIn 1939 the poet W. H. Auden celebrated Kipling in a similarly ambiguous way in his elegy for W. B. Yeats. Auden deleted this section from later editions of his poems.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nTime, that is intolerant\nOf the brave and innocent,\nAnd indifferent in a week\nTo a beautiful physique,\nWorships language, and forgives\nEveryone by whom it lives;\nPardons cowardice, conceit,\nLays its honours at his feet.\nTime, that with this strange excuse,\nPardoned Kipling and his views,\nAnd will pardon Paul Claudel,\nPardons him for writing well. \n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe poet Alison Brackenbury writes \"Kipling is poetry's Dickens, an outsider and journalist with an unrivalled ear for sound and speech.\"\nThe English folk singer Peter Bellamy was a lover of Kipling's poetry, much of which he believed to have been influenced by English traditional folk forms. He recorded several albums of Kipling's verse set to traditional airs, or to tunes of his own composition written in traditional style. However, in the case of the bawdy folk song, \"The Bastard King of England\", which is commonly credited to Kipling, it is believed that the song is actually misattributed.\nKipling often is quoted in discussions of contemporary British political and social issues. In 1911 Kipling wrote the poem \"The Reeds of Runnymede\" that celebrated Magna Carta, and summoned up a vision of the \"stubborn Englishry\" determined to defend their rights. In 1996 the following verses of the poem were quoted by the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher warning against the encroachment of the European Union on national sovereignty:\n&lt;poem&gt;At Runnymede, at Runnymede,\nOh, hear the reeds at Runnymede:\n\"You musn't sell, delay, deny,\nA freeman's right or liberty.\nIt wakes the stubborn Englishry,\nWe saw 'em roused at Runnymede!\"\n... And still when Mob or Monarch lays\nToo rude a hand on English ways,\nThe whisper wakes, the shudder plays,\nAcross the reeds at Runnymede.\nAnd Thames, that knows the mood of kings,\nAnd crowds and priests and suchlike things,\nRolls deep and dreadful as he brings\nTheir warning down from Runnymede!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe political singer-songwriter Billy Bragg, who attempts to build a left-wing English nationalism in contrast with the more common right-wing English nationalism, has attempted to 'reclaim' Kipling for an inclusive sense of Englishness. Kipling's enduring relevance has been noted in the United States, as it has become involved in Afghanistan and other areas about which he wrote.\nCamp Mowglis and Wolf Cubs.\nIn 1903 Kipling gave permission to Elizabeth Ford Holt to borrow themes from the \"Jungle Books\" to establish Camp Mowglis, a summer camp for boys on the shores of Newfound Lake in New Hampshire, US. Throughout their lives, Kipling and his wife Carrie maintained an active interest in Camp Mowglis, which still continues the traditions that Kipling inspired. Buildings at Mowglis have names such as Akela, Toomai, Baloo and Panther. The campers are referred to as \"the Pack\", from the youngest \"Cubs\" to the oldest living in \"Den\".\nKipling's writings were very similarly used as the basis of the 1916 Wolf Cubs programmes of Robert Baden-Powell and his Boy Scouts Association. Wolf Cubs use themes from \"Jungle Book\" stories and \"Kim\" and play \"Kim's Game\". The Wolf Cubs were named after Mowgli's adopted wolf family, and adult helpers of Wolf Cub (now Cub) Packs take names from \"The Jungle Book\", especially the adult leader called \"Akela\" after the leader of the Seeonee wolf pack.\nKipling's Burwash home.\nAfter the death of Kipling's wife in 1939 his house, Bateman's in Burwash, East Sussex, where he had lived from 1902 until 1936, was bequeathed to the National Trust. It is now a public museum dedicated to him. Elsie Bambridge, his only child who lived to maturity, died childless in 1976, and bequeathed her copyrights to the National Trust, which in turn donated them to the University of Sussex to ensure better public access.\nThe novelist and poet Sir Kingsley Amis wrote a poem, \"Kipling at Bateman's\", after visiting Burwash (where Amis's father lived briefly in the 1960s) as part of a BBC television series on writers and their houses.\nIn 2003 the actor Ralph Fiennes read excerpts from Kipling's works from the study in Bateman's, including \"The Jungle Book\", \"Something of Myself\", \"Kim\", and \"The Just So Stories\", and poems, including \"If ...\" and \"My Boy Jack\", for a CD published by the National Trust.\nReputation in India.\nIn modern-day India, whence he drew much of his material, Kipling's reputation remains controversial, especially among modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics. It has long been alleged that Rudyard Kipling was a prominent supporter of Colonel Reginald Dyer, who was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar (in Punjab), and that Kipling called Dyer \"the man who saved India\" and initiated collections for the latter's homecoming prize. Kim Wagner, senior lecturer in British Imperial History at Queen Mary University of London, says that while Kipling did make a \u00a310 donation, he never made that remark. Similarly, author Derek Sayer states that Dyer was \"widely lauded as the saviour of Punjab\", that Kipling had no part in organising \"The Morning Post\" fund, and that Kipling only sent \u00a310, making the laconic observation: \"He did his duty, as he saw it.\" Subhash Chopra also writes in his book \"Kipling Sahib \u2013 the Raj Patriot\" that the benefit fund was started by \"The Morning Post\" newspaper, not by Kipling. \"The Economic Times\" attributes the phrase \"The Man Who Saved India\" along with the Dyer benefit fund to \"The Morning Post\" as well.\nMany contemporary Indian intellectuals, such as Ashis Nandy, have a nuanced view of Kipling's legacy. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India, often described Kipling's novel \"Kim\" as one of his favourite books.\nG. V. Desani, an Indian writer of fiction, had a more negative opinion of Kipling. He alludes to Kipling in his novel \"All About H. Hatterr\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I happen to pick up R. Kipling's autobiographical \"Kim\".\nTherein, this self-appointed whiteman's burden-bearing sherpa feller's stated how, in the Orient, blokes hit the road and think nothing of walking a thousand miles in search of something.\nThe Indian writer Khushwant Singh wrote in 2001 that he considers Kipling's \"If\u2014\" \"the essence of the message of the \"Gita\" in English\", referring to the \"Bhagavad Gita\", an ancient Indian scripture. The writer R. K. Narayan (1906\u20132001) said: \"Kipling, the supposed expert writer on India, showed a better understanding of the mind of the animals in the jungle than of the men in an Indian home or the marketplace.\" The politician and writer Shashi Tharoor commented \"Kipling, that flatulent voice of Victorian imperialism, would wax eloquent on the noble duty to bring law to those without it\".\nIn November 2007 it was announced that Kipling's birth home within the campus of the Sir J. J. School of Art in Mumbai would be turned into a museum celebrating the author and his works. A plaque at the entrance of the Kipling Bungalow, located on campus, is engraved with the words: \"Rudyard Kipling, son of Lockwood Kipling, first dean of Sir JJ School of Art, was born here on December 30, 1865.\" A bust of Rudyard Kipling also exists there.\nArt.\nAlthough he was best known as an author, Kipling was also an accomplished artist. Influenced by Aubrey Beardsley, Kipling produced many illustrations for his stories, for example a 1926 edition of his \"Just So Stories\".\nBibliography.\nKipling's bibliography includes fiction (including novels and short stories), non-fiction and poetry. Several of his works were collaborations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some feel that the popular use of the term \"Regency dance\" is not technically correct, as the actual English Regency (the future George IV ruling on behalf of mad King George III) lasted only from 1811 until 1820. However, the term \"Regency\" has been used to refer to a much broader period than the historical Regency for a very long time, particularly in areas such as the history of art and architecture, literature, and clothing. This is because there are consistencies of style over this period which make having a single term useful.\nMost popular exposure to this era of dance comes in the works of Jane Austen. Balls occur in her novels and are discussed in her letters, but specifics are few. Films based on her works tend to incorporate modern revival English Country Dance; however, they rarely incorporate dances actually of the period and do them without the appropriate footwork and social style which make them accurate to the period. Dances of this era were lively and bouncy, not the smooth and stately style seen in films. Steps ranging from simple skipping to elaborate ballet-style movements were used.\nIn the early part of this period, up to the early 1810s, the ballroom was dominated by the country dance, the cotillion, and the scotch reel.\nIn the longways Country Dance, a line of couples perform figures with each other, progressing up and down the line. Regency country dances were often proceeded by a brief March by the couples, then begun by the top lady in the set and her partner, who would dance down the set to the bottom. Each couple in turn as they reached the top would likewise dance down until the entire set had returned to its original positions. This could be a lengthy process, easily taking an hour in a long set. An important social element was the calling of the dance by the leading lady (a position of honor), who would determine the figures, steps, and music to be danced. The rest of the set would listen to the calling dancing master or pick up the dance by observing the leading couple. Austen mentions in her letters instances in which she and her partner called the dance.\nThe cotillion was a French import, performed in a square using more elaborate footwork. It consisted of a \"chorus\" figure unique to each dance which was danced alternately with a standard series of up to ten \"changes\", which were simple figures such as a right hand moulinet (star) common to cotillions in general.\nThe scotch reel of the era consisted of alternate heying (interlacing) and setting (fancy steps danced in place) by a line of three or four dancers. More complex reels appear in manuals as well but it's unclear if they ever actually caught on. A sixsome reel is mentioned in a description of Scottish customs in the early 1820s and eightsome reels (danced in squares like cotillions) occur in some dance manuscripts of the era.\nIn the 1810s, the era of the Regency proper, English dance began an important transition with the introduction of the quadrille and the waltz.\nThe Waltz was first imported to England around 1810, but it was not considered socially acceptable until continental visitors at the post-Napoleonic-Wars celebrations danced it in London\u2014and even then it remained the subject of anti-waltz diatribes, caricatures, and jokes. Even the decadent Lord Byron was scandalized by the prospect of people \"embracing\" on the dance floor. The Regency version is relatively slow, and done up on the balls of the feet with the arms in a variety of graceful positions. The Sauteuse is a leaping waltz commonly done in 2/4 rather than 3/4 time, similar in pattern (leap-glide-close) to the Redowa and Waltz Galop of the later nineteenth century.\nFirst imported from France by Lady Jersey in 1815, the Quadrille was a shorter version of the earlier cotillions. Figures from individual cotillions were assembled into sets of five or six figures, and the changes were left out, producing much shorter dances. By the late 1810s, it was not uncommon to dance a series of quadrilles during the evening, generally consisting of the same first three figures combined with a variety of different fourth and fifth figures. Jane Austen's niece Fanny danced quadrilles and in their correspondence Jane mentions that she finds them much inferior to the cotillions of her own youth.\nBy the late 1810s, under siege from the Quadrille, dancing masters began to invent \"new\" forms of country dance, often with figures borrowed from the Quadrille, and giving them exotic names such as the Danse Ecossoise and Danse Espagnuole which suggested entire new dances but actually covered very minor variations in the classic form. A few of these dances became sufficiently popular that they survived through the entire 19th century. One example of this is the \"Spanish dance\" popular in vintage dance circles, which is a solitary survivor of its entire genre of Regency-era dances.\nOther popular dances of the era.\n\"La Boulangere\", the only dance mentioned by name in Jane Austen's writings, is a simple circle dance for a group of couples. Sir Roger de Coverly, mentioned by Charles Dickens, is the ancestor of America's Virginia Reel.\nNumerous instruction manuals survive from the Regency era. Several by Thomas Wilson are in the US Library of Congress online collection. The Scotch Reel is described by Francis Peacock, whose manual is also available in the LC collection.\nRevival.\nThe first major revival of English Country Dance, one of the major types of Regency dance, was by Englishman Cecil Sharp in the early 20th century. Various other revivals have followed, most using at least some of Sharp's research. Today, there are many groups around the world which perform a variety of English period dances, including many of the types of dance which were popular during the English Regency.\nRegency dance has gained popularity at science fiction conventions, in part due to the efforts of John Hertz. Reconstructed dances from the era are taught to newcomers and experienced dancers alike. Some authors\u2014notably, Larry Niven\u2014have added their personal enthusiasm to the trend.\nIn Silicon Valley, the Bay Area English Regency Society sponsors local dance classes and formal balls in churches, community centers, and other venues. In Los Angeles, California, the Valley Area English Regency Society hosts teas and Regency dance parties in a local church. Both societies were founded by Laura Brodian Freas Beraha.\nSome enthusiasts go to extremes: Cisco Systems founders Sandra Lerner and Len Bosack created a foundation that bought a Regency-era country house once owned by Jane Austen's brother. In Australia, Earthly Delights Historic Dance Academy and John Gardiner-Garden run a Regency Dance School in conjunction with Jane Austen Festival Australia every April.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26310", "revid": "35482227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26310", "title": "Reproduction", "text": "Biological process\nReproduction (or procreation or breeding) is the biological process by which new individual organisms \u2013 \"offspring\" \u2013 are produced from their \"parent\" or parents. There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual.\nIn asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms. The cloning of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce and organisms only pass on 50% of their genes.\nSexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized reproductive cells, called gametes, which contain half the number of chromosomes of normal cells and are created by meiosis, with typically a sperm cell fertilizing an egg cell from the same species to create a fertilized zygote. This produces offspring organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.\nMethods.\nAsexual.\nAsexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. Bacteria divide asexually via binary fission; viruses take control of host cells to produce more viruses; Hydras (invertebrates of the order \"Hydroidea\") and yeasts are able to reproduce by budding. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of \"splitting\" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most plants have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species Mycocepurus smithii is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.\nSome species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like hydra, yeast (See Mating of yeasts) and jellyfish, may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of vegetative reproduction\u00a0\u2013 reproduction without seeds or spores\u00a0\u2013 but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by conjugation.\nOther ways of asexual reproduction include parthenogenesis, fragmentation and spore formation that involves only mitosis. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of embryo or seed without fertilization. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower plants (where it is called apomixis), invertebrates (e.g. water fleas, aphids, some bees and parasitic wasps), and vertebrates (e.g. some\nreptiles, some fish, and very rarely, domestic birds).\nSexual.\nSexual reproduction is a biological process that creates a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms in a process that starts with meiosis, a specialized type of cell division. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating haploid gametes. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these anisogamous species, the two sexes are referred to as male (producing sperm or microspores) and female (producing ova or megaspores). In isogamous species, the gametes are similar or identical in form (isogametes), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see isogamy). Because both gametes look alike, they generally cannot be classified as male or female. For example, in the green alga, \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\", there are so-called \"plus\" and \"minus\" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many fungi and the ciliate \"Paramecium aurelia\", have more than two \"sexes\", called mating types.\nMost animals (including humans) and plants reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called alleles). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that \"the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases\" where recombination occurs freely.\nBryophytes reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are haploid and produce gametes. The gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a sporangium, which in turn produces haploid spores. The diploid stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. \"haploid dominance\". The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as genetic recombination between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the population more able to survive environmental variation.\nAllogamy.\nAllogamy is the fertilization of flowers through cross-pollination, this occurs when a flower's ovum is fertilized by spermatozoa from the pollen of a different plant's flower. Pollen may be transferred through pollen vectors or abiotic carriers such as wind. Fertilization begins when the pollen is brought to a female gamete through the pollen tube. Allogamy is also known as cross fertilization, in contrast to autogamy or geitonogamy which are methods of self-fertilization.\nAutogamy.\nSelf-fertilization, also known as autogamy, occurs in hermaphroditic organisms where the two gametes fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many vascular plants, some foraminiferans, some ciliates. The term \"autogamy\" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes self-pollination within the same flower, distinguished from geitonogamous pollination, transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same flowering plant, or within a single monoecious gymnosperm plant.\nMitosis and meiosis.\nMitosis and meiosis are types of cell division. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, while meiosis occurs in gametes.\nMitosis\nThe resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of chromosomes in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.\nMeiosis\nThe resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of chromosomes present in the parent cell. A diploid cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions (tetraploid to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four haploid cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.\nGametogenesis.\nAnimals, including mammals, produce gametes (sperm and egg) by means of meiosis in gonads (testicles in males and ovaries in females). Sperm are produced by spermatogenesis and eggs are produced by oogenesis. During gametogenesis in mammals numerous genes encoding proteins that participate in DNA repair mechanisms exhibit enhanced or specialized expression. Male germ cells produced in the testes of animals are capable of special DNA repair processes that function during meiosis to repair DNA damages and to maintain the integrity of the genomes that are to be passed on to progeny. Such DNA repair processes include homologous recombinational repair as well as non-homologous end joining. Oocytes located in the primordial follicle of the ovary are in a non-growing prophase arrested state, but are able to undergo highly efficient homologous recombinational repair of DNA damages including double-strand breaks. These repair processes allow the integrity of the genome to be maintained and offspring health to be protected.\nSame-sex.\n Scientific research is currently investigating the possibility of same-sex procreation, which would produce offspring with equal genetic contributions from either two females or two males. The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are female sperm and male eggs. In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice In 2010, American scientists used genetically manipulated stem cells to produce viable mouse offspring carrying genetic contributions from two fathers. In 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice. Researches noted that there is little chance these techniques would be applied to humans in the near future. In 2023, Japanese scientists created mouse pups from two mice fathers which grew into adulthood.\nStrategies.\nThere are a wide range of reproductive strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the human and northern gannet, do not reach sexual maturity for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to adulthood. For example, a rabbit (mature after 8 months) can produce 10\u201330 offspring per year, and a fruit fly (mature after 10\u201314 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as K-selection (few offspring) and r-selection (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by evolution depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population. Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called sperm storage thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.\nAsexual vs. sexual reproduction.\nOrganisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.\nMany organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. Aphids, slime molds, sea anemones, some species of starfish (by fragmentation), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.\nWhen food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see Meiosis). In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other \"over-wintering\" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can \"wait out\" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.\nLife without.\nThe existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the origin of life produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called abiogenesis. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the last universal ancestor to all present life on Earth lived about 3.5 billion years ago.\nScientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials. However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no metabolism and can only replicate with the assistance of a hijacked cell's metabolic machinery.\nThe production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A synthetic genome has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new \"M. mycoides\" organism.\nThere is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term \"synthetic bacterial cell\" but they also clarify \"...we do not consider this to be \"creating life from scratch\" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA\". Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that \"they are pretty clearly human inventions\". Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield \"truly programmable organisms\". Researchers involved stated that the creation of \"true synthetic biochemical life\" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.\nLottery principle.\nSexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. George C. Williams used lottery tickets as an analogy in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction. He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of \"winning\" \u2013 that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dr Peter Mark Roget former secretary of the Royal Society was inspired by the Utilitarian teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help \"those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition ... this work processes to hold out a helping hand\". The Karpeles Library Museum houses the original manuscript in its collection.\nRoget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of Leibniz (see ), itself following a long tradition of epistemological work starting with Aristotle. Some of Aristotle's Categories are included in Roget's first class, \"abstract relations\".\nContent.\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\n\"Roget's Thesaurus\" is composed of six primary classes. Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual \"meaning clusters\" or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly synonyms, they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept.

The name \"Roget\" is trademarked in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom . By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name \"Roget\" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a generic thesaurus name.\nIn 1952 the copyright belonging after Roget's death in 1869 to his son \"John Lewis\" Roget a lawyer then his grandson \"Samuel Romilly\" Roget a engineer passed to the original publishers, now known as Longman.

Segregation can involve the spatial separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races. Specifically, it may be applied to activities such as eating in restaurants, drinking from water fountains, using public toilets, attending schools, going to movie theaters, riding buses, renting or purchasing homes, renting hotel rooms, going to supermarkets, or attending places of worship. In addition, segregation often allows close contact between members of different racial or ethnic groups in hierarchical situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Racial segregation has generally been outlawed worldwide.\nSegregation is defined by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance as \"the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation\". According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, \"The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature.\" Racial segregation can amount to the international crime of apartheid and a crime against humanity under the 2002 Rome Declaration of Statute of the International Criminal Court.\nHistoric cases from ancient times to the 1960s.\nRacial segregation was often used to secure the advantages enjoyed by a certain dominant group, e.g. \"various conquerors\u2014among them Asian Mongols, African Bantu, and American Aztecs\". In recent times, it was mostly imposed by white groups.\nImperial China.\nTang dynasty.\nSeveral laws which enforced racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the Han Chinese during the Tang dynasty. In 779, the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uyghurs to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Han Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Han Chinese. In 836, when Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to own property. Lu Chun believed his principles were just and upright. The 836 law specifically banned Chinese from forming relationships with \"Dark peoples\" or \"People of colour\", which was used to describe foreigners, such as \"Iranians, Sogdians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans\", among others.\nQing dynasty.\nThe Qing dynasty was founded not by Han Chinese, who form the majority of the Chinese population, but by Manchus, who are today an ethnic minority of China. The Manchus were keenly aware of their minority status, however, it was only later in the dynasty that they banned intermarriage.\nHan defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals of the Ming Dynasty who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618. Jurchen (Manchu) women married most of the Han Chinese defectors in Liaodong. Aisin Gioro women were married to the sons of the Han Chinese Generals Sun Sike (Sun Ssu-k'o), Geng Jimao (Keng Chi-mao), Shang Kexi (Shang K'o-hsi), and Wu Sangui (Wu San-kuei).\nA mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and Hongtaiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.\nGeng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under Shunzhi and marry Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's (Hong Taiji) granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.\nThe Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were made out of Han Chinese who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75%. It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered China for the Qing.\nIt was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing conquest of China, they made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule. Han Bannermen dominated the post of governor-general in the time of the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors, and also the post of governors, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians from the posts.\nTo promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Manchu Shunzhi Emperor allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.\nThe Qing implemented a policy of segregation between the Bannermen of the Eight Banners (Manchu Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, Han Bannermen) and Han Chinese civilians. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchu heritage and minimize sinicization. Han Chinese civilians and Mongol civilians were banned from settling in Manchuria. Han civilians and Mongol civilians were banned from crossing into each other's lands. Ordinary Mongol civilians in Inner Mongolia were banned from even crossing into other Mongol Banners (a banner in Inner Mongolia was an administrative division and not related to the Mongol Bannermen in the Eight Banners).\nThese restrictions did not apply to Han Bannermen, who were settled in Manchuria by the Qing. Han bannermen were differentiated from Han civilians by the Qing and treated differently.\nThe Qing Dynasty started colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the Outer Willow Palisade, which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.\nThe policy of segregation applied directly to the banner garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. Manchu Bannermen, Han Bannermen, and Mongol Bannermen were separated from the Han civilian population. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding Ming dynasty, their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese civilian officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations, and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.\nColonial societies.\nBelgian Congo.\nFrom 1952, and even more so after the triumphant visit of King Baudouin to the colony in 1955, Governor-General L\u00e9on P\u00e9tillon (1952\u20131958) worked to create a \"Belgian-Congolese community\", in which Black and White people were to be treated as equals. Regardless, anti-miscegenation laws remained in place, and between 1959 and 1962 thousands of mixed-race Congolese children were forcibly deported from the Congo by the Belgian government and the Catholic Church and taken to Belgium.\nFrench Algeria.\nFollowing its conquest of Ottoman controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century, France maintained colonial rule in the territory which has been described as \"quasi-apartheid\". The colonial law of 1865 allowed Arab and Berber Algerians to apply for French citizenship only if they abandoned their Muslim identity; Azzedine Haddour argues that this established \"the formal structures of a political apartheid\". Camille Bonora-Waisman writes that \"in contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates\", this \"colonial apartheid society\" was unique to Algeria.\nThis \"internal system of apartheid\" met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection and ensuing independence war.\nRhodesia.\nThe Land Apportionment Act of 1930 passed in Southern Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe) was a segregationist measure that governed land allocation and acquisition in rural areas, making distinctions between Blacks and Whites.\nOne highly publicised legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races; the proposed unsegregated public toilets at the newly built Reps Theatre in 1959 caused an argument called \"The Battle of the Toilets\".\nUganda.\nAfter the end of British rule in 1962, Indian people living in Uganda existed in segregated ethnic communities with their own schools and healthcare. Indians constituted 1% of the population but earned a fifth of the national income and controlled 90% of the country's businesses.\nIn 1972, the President of Uganda Idi Amin ordered the expulsion of the country's Indian minority with disastrous consequences for the local economy. The government confiscated some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates, along with cars, homes and other household goods.\nReligious and racial antisemitism.\nJews in Europe were generally forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated ghettos and shtetls. In 1204, the papacy required Jews to segregate themselves from Christians and it also required them to wear distinctive clothing. Forced segregation of Jews spread throughout Europe during the 14th and 15th centuries. In the Russian Empire, Jews were restricted to the so-called Pale of Settlement, the Western frontier of the Russian Empire which roughly corresponds to the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. By the early 20th century, the majority of Europe's Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement.\nFrom the beginning of the 15th century, Jewish populations in Morocco were confined to mellahs. In cities, a \"mellah\" was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural \"mellahs\" were separate villages whose sole inhabitants were Jews.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, J. J. Benjamin wrote about the lives of Persian Jews:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2026they are obliged to live in a separate part of town\u2026; for they are considered as unclean creatures\u2026 Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity, and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt\u2026 For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans\u2026 If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him\u2026 unmercifully\u2026 If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods\u2026 Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)\u2026, he is sure to be murdered.\nOn 16 May 1940 in Norway, the asked the Rikskommisariatet why radio receivers had been confiscated from Jews in Norway. That thereafter \"quietly\" accepted racial segregation between Norwegian citizens, has been claimed by Tor Bomann-Larsen. Furthermore, he claimed that this segregation \"created a precedent. 2 years later (with \"NS-styret\" in the ministries of Norway) Norwegian police arrested citizens at the addresses where radios had previously been confiscated from Jews.\nFascist Italy.\nIn 1938, under pressure from the Nazis, the fascist regime, which was led by Benito Mussolini, passed a series of racial laws which instituted an official segregationist policy in the Italian Empire, this policy was especially directed against Italian Jews. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the laws which banned Jews from teaching or studying in ordinary schools and universities, banned Jews from owning industries that were reputed to be very important to the nation, banned Jews from working as journalists, banned Jews from joining the military, and banned Jews from marrying non-Jews.\nAs an immediate consequence of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race), many of the best Italian scientists quit their jobs, and some of them also left Italy. Amongst these scientists were the internationally-known physicists Emilio Segr\u00e8, Enrico Fermi (whose wife was Jewish), Bruno Pontecorvo, Bruno Rossi, Tullio Levi-Civita, mathematicians Federigo Enriques and Guido Fubini and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist Margherita Sarfatti, who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. Rita Levi-Montalcini, who would successively win the Nobel Prize for Medicine, was forbidden to work at the university. Upon the passage of the racial law, Albert Einstein cancelled his honorary membership in the .\nAfter 1943, when Northern Italy was occupied by the Nazis, Italian Jews were rounded up during the Holocaust by Nazis and Nazi collaborators, with a significant portion being killed.\nNazi Germany.\nGerman praise for America's system of institutional racism, which was expressed in Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\", was continuous throughout the early 1930s. The U.S. was the global leader of codified racism, and its race laws fascinated the Germans. The \"National Socialist Handbook for Law and Legislation\" of 1934\u201335, edited by Hitler's lawyer Hans Frank, contains a pivotal essay by Herbert Kier on the recommendations for race legislation which devoted a quarter of its pages to U.S. legislation\u2014from segregation, race-based citizenship, immigration regulations, and anti-miscegenation. This directly inspired the two principal Nuremberg Laws\u2014the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. The ban on interracial marriage (anti-miscegenation) prohibited sexual relations and marriages between people classified as \"Aryan\" and \"non-Aryan\". Such relationships were called \"Rassenschande\" (race defilement). At first the laws were aimed primarily at Jews but were later extended to \"Gypsies, Negroes\". Aryans found guilty could face incarceration in a Nazi concentration camp, while non-Aryans could face the death penalty. To preserve the so-called purity of the German blood, after the war began, the Nazis extended the race defilement law to include all foreigners (non-Germans).\nUnder the General Government of occupied Poland in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split the Polish people's identity, they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of Kashubians and Gorals (Goralenvolk), based on these groups' alleged \"Germanic component\".\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were forced to wear something that identified them as Jewish, such as a yellow ribbon or a star of David, and along with Romas (Gypsies), they were subjected to discrimination by the racial laws. Jewish doctors were not allowed to treat Aryan patients and Jewish professors were not permitted to teach Aryan pupils. In addition, Jews were not allowed to use any form of public transportation, besides the ferry, and they were only allowed to shop in Jewish stores from 3\u20135 pm. After \"Kristallnacht\" (\"The Night of Broken Glass\"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000,000\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 for the damage which was done by Nazi troops and SS members.\nJews, Poles, and Roma were subjected to genocide as \"undesirable\" racial groups in The Holocaust. The Nazis established ghettos in order to confine Jews and sometimes, they confined Romas in tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into \"de facto\" concentration camps. The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people. The \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto was the second largest, holding about 160,000.\nBetween 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million Polish citizens were transported to the Reich for forced labour (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside Nazi Germany). Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, Poles, along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior, were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear a yellow with purple border and letter \"P\" (for Polen/Polish) cloth identifying tag sewn to their clothing, subjected to a curfew, and banned from public transportation.\nWhile the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers, as a rule, were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans \u2013 in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with Germans outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (\"Rassenschande\" or \"racial defilement\") were punishable by death.\nOther countries.\nCanada.\nRacial segregation was widespread and deeply imbedded into the fabric of Canadian society prior to the Canadian constitution of 1982. Multiple court decisions, including one from the Supreme Court of Canada in 1939, upheld racial segregation as valid. The last black specifically segregated school closed in Ontario in 1965, while the last black specifically segregated school closed in Nova Scotia in 1983. The last racially segregated Indigenous school closed in 1996 in Saskatchewan. \nCanada has had multiple white only neighbourhoods and cities, white only public spaces, stores, universities, hospitals, employment, restaurants, theatres, sports arenas and universities. Though the black population in Canada was significantly less than the black population in the United States, severe restrictions on black people existed in all forms, particularly in immigration, employment access and mobility. Unlike in the United States, racial segregation in Canada applied to all non-whites and was historically enforced through laws, court decisions and social norms with a closed immigration system that barred virtually all non-whites from immigrating until 1962. Section 38 of the 1910 Immigration Act permitted the government to prohibit the entry of immigrants \"belonging to any race deemed unsuited to the climate or requirements of Canada, or of immigrants of any specified class, occupation or character.\"\nRacial segregation practices extended to many areas of employment in Canada. Black men and women in Quebec were historically relegated to the service sector regardless of their educational attainment. White business owners and even provincial and federal government agencies often did not hire black people, with explicit rules preventing their employment. When the labour movement took hold in Canada near the end of the 19th century, workers began organizing and forming trade unions with the aim of improving the working conditions and quality of life for employees. However, black workers were systematically denied membership to these unions, and worker's protection was reserved exclusively for whites.\nSouth Africa.\nThe apartheid system carried out by Afrikaner minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy \"separate development\" with the National Party victory in the 1948 general election, following the \"colour bar\"-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the Union of South Africa and the Boer republics before which, while repressive to Black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far.\nApartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the Population Registration Act in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: \"black\", \"white\", \"Coloured\", and \"Indian\" and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the Group Areas Act in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act in 1953, amenities in public areas, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. In addition, the Bantu Education Act in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well. Additionally, the government of the time enforced the pass laws, which deprived Black South Africans of their right to travel freely within their own country. Under this system Black South Africans were severely restricted from urban areas, requiring authorisation from a white employer to enter.\nUprisings and protests against apartheid appeared immediately when apartheid arose. As early as 1949, the Youth League of the African National Congress (ANC) advocated the ending of apartheid and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-apartheid actions occurred, including those of the Black Consciousness Movement, students' protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1991, the Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act was passed, repealing laws enforcing racial segregation, including the Group Areas Act. In 1994, Nelson Mandela won in the first multiracial democratic election in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of apartheid in South African history.\nDespite this, the legacy of apartheid and segregationism is still ongoing to this day in South Africa with high racial inequality in post-apartheid South Africa.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, racial segregation was mandated by law in some states and enforced along with anti-miscegenation laws (prohibitions against interracial marriage), until the U.S. Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren struck down racial segregation.\nAfter the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing Slavery in the United States, Jim Crow laws were introduced to codify racial discrimination. The laws mandated strict segregation of the races. Though many of these laws were passed shortly after the Civil War ended, they only became formalized after the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877. The period that followed the Reconstruction era is known as the nadir of American race relations. \nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court majority in the 1896 \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" case explicitly permitted \"separate but equal\" facilities (specifically, transportation facilities), Justice John Marshall Harlan, in his dissent, protested that the decision would \"stimulate aggressions ... upon the admitted rights of colored citizens\", \"arouse race hate\", and \"perpetuate a feeling of distrust between [the] races. Feelings between Whites and Blacks were so tense, even the jails were segregated.\"\nElected in 1912, President Woodrow Wilson tolerated the extension of segregation throughout the federal government that was already underway. In World War I, Blacks were drafted and served in the United States Army in segregated units. The U.S. military was still heavily segregated in World War II. The air force and the marines had no Blacks enlisted in their ranks. There were Blacks in the Navy Seabees. The army had only five African-American officers. In addition, no African-American would receive the Medal of Honor during the war, and their tasks in the war were largely reserved to noncombat units. Black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the Nazi prisoners of war.\nA club which was central to the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York City was a whites-only establishment, where Blacks (such as Duke Ellington) were allowed to perform, but they were only allowed to perform in front of a white audience. In the reception to honor his success at the 1936 Summer Olympics, Jesse Owens was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the Waldorf Astoria New York and instead forced to travel up to the event in a freight elevator. \nThe first black Academy Award recipient, actress Hattie McDaniel, was not permitted to attend the premiere of \"Gone with the Wind\" at Loew's Grand Theatre in Atlanta because of Georgia's segregation laws. During the 12th Academy Awards ceremony at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, McDaniel was required to sit at a segregated table at the far wall of the room; the hotel had a no-blacks policy, but allowed McDaniel in as a favor. Her final wish to be buried in Hollywood Forever Cemetery was denied because the graveyard was restricted to Whites only.\nOn 11 September 1964, John Lennon announced the Beatles would not play to a segregated audience in Jacksonville, Florida. City officials relented following this announcement. A contract for a 1965 Beatles concert at the Cow Palace in California specifies that the band \"not be required to perform in front of a segregated audience\".\nAmerican sports were racially segregated until the mid-twentieth century. In baseball, the \"Negro leagues\" were established by Rube Foster for non-white players, such as Negro league baseball, which ran through the early 1950s. In basketball, the Black Fives (all-black teams) were established in 1904, and emerged in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other cities. Racial segregation in basketball lasted until 1950 when the NBA became racially integrated.\nMany U.S. states banned interracial marriage, with Maryland passing the first anti-miscegenation law in 1691. Though opposed to slavery in the U.S., Abraham Lincoln stated during the Lincoln-Douglas Debates in 1858: \n\"I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people. I as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race\". \nLikewise, when former president Harry S. Truman was asked by a reporter in 1963 if interracial marriage would become widespread in the U.S., he responded, \"I hope not; I don\u2019t believe in it\", before asking a question often aimed at anyone advocating racial integration: \"Would you want your daughter to marry a Negro? She won't love someone who isn't her color.\"\nIn 1958, Mildred Loving, a black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were prosecuted in Virginia because their marriage violated the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which prohibited marriage between people classified as white and people classified as \"colored\" (persons of non-white ancestry). Although their one-year prison sentence was suspended, in 1963 they sought the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed an appeal on their behalf that eventually found its way to the United States Supreme Court. In 1967 the court issued a historic ruling in \"Loving v. Virginia\" that invalidated all laws prohibiting interracial marriage in the U.S.\nInstitutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice during the civil rights movement by the efforts of such civil rights activists as Clarence M. Mitchell Jr., Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and James Farmer working for social and political freedom during the period from the end of World War II through the Interstate Commerce Commission desegregation order of 1961, the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965 supported by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Many of their efforts were acts of non-violent civil disobedience aimed at disrupting the enforcement of racial segregation rules and laws, such as refusing to give up a seat in the black part of the bus to a white person (Rosa Parks), or holding sit-ins at all-white diners.\nBy 1968, all forms of segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, and by 1970 support for formal legal segregation had dissolved. The Warren Court's decision on landmark case \"Brown v. Board of Education\" of Topeka, Kansas in 1954 outlawed segregation in public schools, and its decision on \"Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States\" in 1964 prohibits racial segregation and discrimination in public institutions and public accommodations. The Fair Housing Act of 1968, administered and enforced by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, prohibited discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Formal racial discrimination became illegal in school systems, businesses, the American military, other civil services and the government. However, implicit racism continues to this day through avenues like occupational segregation. In recent years, there has been a trend that reverses those efforts to desegregate schools made by those mandatory school desegregation orders.\nHistoric cases (1970s to present).\nBahrain.\nOn 28 April 2007, the lower house of Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law, Nasser Fadhala, MP, a close ally of the government, said \"bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids\".\nSadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of Al Wefaq, said: \"The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment,\" said Mr Rahma. \"The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested.\"\nBahrain Centre for Human Rights issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Nabeel Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: \"It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people's hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers \u2013 and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.\"\nCanada.\nUntil 1965, racial segregation in schools, stores and most aspects of public life existed legally in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, and informally in other provinces such as British Columbia.\nSince the 1970s, there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines. Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger Toronto and the southern bedroom communities of Greater Vancouver have become steadily more immigrant and visible minority dominated communities and have lagged behind other neighbourhoods in average income. A CBC panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of ethnic enclaves in Greater Vancouver (such as Han Chinese in Richmond B.C. and Punjabis in Surrey, B.C.) amounted to a type of self-segregation. In response to these fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet white people are never accused of \"self-segregation\".\nThe of Kahnawake has been criticized for evicting non-Mohawks from the Mohawk reserve. Mohawks who marry outside of their tribal nation lose their right to live in their homelands. The Mohawk government claims that its policy of nationally exclusive membership is for the preservation of its identity, but there is no exemption for those who adopt Mohawk language or culture. All interracial couples were sent eviction notices regardless of how long they have lived on the reserve. The only exemption is for mixed national couples married before the 1981 moratorium. Although some concerned Mohawk citizens contested the nationally exclusive membership policy, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the Mohawk government may adopt policies it deems necessary to ensure the survival of its people.\nA long-standing practice of national segregation has also been imposed upon the commercial salmon fishery in British Columbia since 1992 when separate commercial fisheries were created for select aboriginal groups on three B.C. river systems. Canadians of other nations who fish in the separate fisheries have been arrested, jailed and prosecuted. Although the fishermen who were prosecuted were successful at trial in R v Kapp, this decision was overturned on appeal.\nFiji.\nTwo military coups in Fiji in 1987 removed a democratically elected government led by Indo-Fijians. This coup was supported principally by the ethnic Fijian population.\nA new constitution was promulgated in 1990, establishing Fiji as a republic, with the offices of President, Prime Minister, two-thirds of the Senate, and a clear majority of the House of Representatives reserved for ethnic Fijians; ethnic Fijian ownership of the land was also entrenched in the constitution. Most of these provisions were ended with the promulgation of the 1997 Constitution, although the President (and 14 of the 32 Senators) were still selected by the all-indigenous Great Council of Chiefs. The last of these distinctions were removed by the 2013 Constitution.\nFiji's case is a situation of \"de facto\" racial segregation, as Fiji has a long complex history of more than 3500 years as a divided tribal nation, with unification under 96 years of British rule also bringing other racial groups, particularly immigrants from the Indian subcontinent.\nHungary.\nThe racial segregation of Roma children in the Hungarian education system has been an ongoing issue since the 1990s. Over the past 20 years, there has been an increase in cases where Roma pupils have been placed in separate schools or classes. In a landmark strategic litigation case involving twenty-eight schools, Hungarian courts found that educational authorities had failed to intervene against discriminatory practices, thereby violating national equal treatment laws. Similar cases have been documented across Hungary, with multiple courts ruling that schools and authorities violated equal treatment laws by creating or maintaining segregation.\nIsrael.\nThe Israeli Declaration of Independence proclaims equal rights to all citizens regardless of ethnicity, denomination or race. Israel has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality (such as prohibition of discrimination, equality in Employment, libel based on race or ethnicity). There is however, in practice, significant institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens.\nIn 2010, the Israeli Supreme Court sent a message against racial segregation in a case involving the Slonim Hassidic sect of the Ashkenazi Jews, ruling that segregation between Ashkenazi and Sephardi students in a school is illegal. They argue that they seek \"to maintain an equal level of religiosity, not from racism\". Responding to the charges, the Slonim Haredim invited Sephardi girls to school, and added in a statement: \"All along, we said it's not about race, but the High Court went out against our rabbis, and therefore we went to prison.\"\nDue to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left \"marooned outside the mainstream\". This de facto segregation also exists between different Jewish ethnic groups (\"edot\") such as Sepharadim, Ashkenazim and Beta Israel (Jews of Ethiopian descent), which leads to de facto segregated schools, housing and public policy. The government has embarked on a program to shut down such schools, in order to force integration, but some in the Ethiopian community complained that not all such schools have been closed. In a 2007 poll commissioned by the Center Against Racism and conducted by the GeoCartographia Institute, 75% of Israeli Jews would not agree to live in a building with Arab residents, 60% would not accept any Arab visitors at their homes, 40% believed that Arabs should be stripped of their right to vote, and 59% believe that the culture of Arabs is primitive. In 2012, a public opinion poll showed that 53% of the polled Israeli Jews said they would not object to an Arab living in their building, while 42% said they would. Asked whether they would object to Arab children being in their child's class in school, 49% said they would not, 42% said they would. The secular Israeli public was found to be the most tolerant, while the religious and Haredi respondents were the most discriminatory.\nSome commentators have sought to find commonalities between apartheid in South Africa and the political situation in Israel. A system of apartheid, a system of institutionalized segregation and discrimination in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and to a lesser extent in Israel proper. There is near-total physical separation between the Palestinian and the Israeli settler population of the West Bank, as well as the judicial separation that governs both communities, which discriminates against the Palestinians in a wide range of ways. Israel also discriminates against its own Palestinian citizens. Palestinians in the occupied territories live under military occupation and are progressively segregated, barred from freedom of movement, and discriminated against. After institutionalized segregation, Palestinians face eventual forced displacement of their homes by Israeli settlers at which point they barred from returning home, and the Palestinian areas becomes annexed into the Israeli state.\nOther commentators have sought to refute these allegations of apartheid. Palestinian citizens of Israel participate in elections (see List of Arab members of the Knesset) and members of the judiciary include Palestinians. The Supreme Court contains at least one Palestinian person. Jewish and Palestinian Israelis both attend colleges and universities in Israel. Hospital facilities in Israel treat all Israelis, regardless of religion or creed. Lastly, Jewish Israelis are in the majority in Israel proper, comprising some 73% of the population. These characteristics are not associated with a system of Apartheid.\nKenya.\nThe end of British colonial rule in Kenya in 1964 led to an inadvertent increase in ethnic segregation. Through private purchases and government schemes, farmland previously held by European farmers was transferred to African owners. These farms were further sub-divided into smaller localities, and, due to joint migration, many adjacent localities were occupied by members of different ethnic groups. This separation along these boundaries persists today. Kimuli Kasara, in a study of recent ethnic violence in the wake of the disputed 2007-08 Kenyan elections, used these post-colonial boundaries as an instrument for the degree of ethnic segregation. Through a 2 Stage Least Squares Regression analysis, Kasara showed that increased ethnic segregation in Kenya's Rift Valley Province is associated with an increase in ethnic violence.\nLiberia.\nThe Constitution of Liberia limits Liberian nationality to Negro people (see also Liberian nationality law).\nWhile Lebanese and Indian nationals are active in trading, as well as in the retail and service sectors, and Europeans and Americans work in the mining and agricultural sectors, these minority groups with long-tenured residence in the Republic are precluded from becoming citizens as a result of their race.\nMalaysia.\nMalaysia has an article in its constitution which distinguishes the ethnic Malays and the non-ethnic Malays people\u2014i.e. bumiputra\u2014from the non-Bumiputra such as ethnic Chinese and Indians, among others, under the social contract, of which by law would guarantee the former certain special rights and privileges. To question these rights and privileges is strictly prohibited under the Internal Security Act (ISA), legalised by the 10th Article (IV) of the Constitution of Malaysia. In essence, non-Malays are treated as second-class citizens in Malaysia, facing many roadblocks and discrimination in matters such as economic freedom, education, healthcare and housing.\nMalaysia is also not a signatory of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), one of the only few countries in the world not to do so. A possible ratification in 2018 led to an anti-ICERD mass rally by Malay supremacists at the country's capital to prevent it, threatening a racial conflict if it does happen.\nThe privileges mentioned herein covers\u2014few of which\u2014the economical and education aspects of Malaysians, e.g. the Malaysian New Economic Policy; an economic policy criticised by Thierry Rommel, who headed a European Commission's delegation to Malaysia, as an excuse for \"significant protectionism\" and a quota maintaining higher access of Malays into public universities.\nSuch racial segregation policies have caused significant rates of human capital flight (brain drain) from Malaysia. A study by Stanford University highlighted that among the main factors behind the Malaysian brain drain include social injustice. It stated that the high rates of emigration of non-bumiputera Malaysians from the country is driven by discriminatory policies that appear to favour Malays/Bumiputeras\u2014such as providing exclusive additional assistance in starting businesses and educational opportunities.\nMauritania.\nSlavery in Mauritania was finally criminalized in August 2007. It was already abolished in 1980, although it was still affecting the black Africans. The number of slaves in the country was not known exactly, but it was estimated to be up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population.\nFor centuries, the so-called Haratin lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by white Moors of Arab/Berber ancestry. Many descendants of the Arab and Berber tribes today still adhere to the supremacist ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAlthough racial segregation was never made legal in the UK, pubs, workplaces, shops and other commercial premises operated a \"colour bar\" where non-white customers were banned from using certain rooms and facilities. Segregation also operated in the 20th century in certain professions, in housing and even at Buckingham Palace. The colour bar in pubs was deemed illegal by the Race Relations Act 1965 but other institutions such as members' clubs could still bar people because of their race until a few years later.\nThe United Kingdom nowadays has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality. However, due to many cultural differences between the pre-existing system of passively co-existing communities, segregation along racial lines has emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, with minority communities being left \"marooned outside the mainstream\".\nThe affected and 'ghettoised' communities are often largely representative of Pakistanis, Indians and other Sub-Continentals, and has been thought to be the basis of ethnic tensions, and a deterioration of the standard of living and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas. These factors are considered by some to have been a cause of the 2001 English race riots in Bradford, Oldham and Harehills in northern England which have large Asian communities.\nThere may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral 'steering' of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals. This may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and desirability of a residential area. This is likely as other theories such as \"ethnic self segregation\" have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.\nUnited States.\nDe facto segregation in the United States has increased since the civil rights movement, while official segregation has been outlawed. The Supreme Court ruled in Milliken v. Bradley (1974) that de facto racial segregation was acceptable, as long as schools were not actively making policies for racial exclusion; since then, schools have been segregated due to myriad indirect factors.\nRedlining is part of how white communities in America maintained some level of racial segregation. It is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as mortgages, banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most effective form of redlining, and the practice most commonly meant by the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act\" and measure to end mortgage discrimination in 1975, would completely invalidate \"de jure\" racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S. According to Rajiv Sethi, an economist at Columbia University, black-white segregation in housing is slowly declining for most metropolitan areas in the US. Racial segregation or separation can lead to social, economic and political tensions. Thirty years (the year 2000) after the civil rights era, the United States remained in many areas a residentially segregated society, in which Blacks, whites and Hispanics inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality.\nDan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods still received fewer loans, even after accounting for businesses density, businesses size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses. Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry. Workers living in American inner cities have a harder time finding jobs than suburban workers.\nSome academics have labeled the desire of many whites to avoid having their children attend academically inferior integrated schools as being a factor in \"white flight\" from the cities. A 2007 study in San Francisco showed that groups of homeowners of all races tended to self-segregate in order to be with people of the same economic status, education level and race. By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been mostly replaced, although today many white Americans are willing to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood. Equivalent housing in white areas commands a higher rent. These higher rents are largely attributable to exclusionary zoning policies that restrict the supply of housing. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called \"hypersegregation\" by some sociologists or \"American Apartheid\".\nIn February 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Johnson v. California\" 543 U.S. https:// (2005) that the California Department of Corrections' unwritten practice of racially segregating prisoners in its prison reception centers\u2014which California claimed was for inmate safety (gangs in California, as throughout the U.S., usually organize on racial lines)\u2014is to be subject to strict scrutiny, the highest level of constitutional review. \nThe Blaxit movement promotes the expatriation of African-American people to Africa or Europe for cultural, racial, and economic reasons, in an attempt to deal with historic segregation.\nYemen.\nIn Yemen, the Arab elite practices a form of discrimination against the lower class Al-Akhdam people based on their racial characteristics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It constitutes the northern part of the Stockholm archipelago and extends north along the coast. The old designation for the area was Roden.\nIn the Viking Age, Roden was divided into \"skeppslag\" (\"ship districts\"), each responsible for supplying ships and crews when the king issued a call to the leidang, the conscript navy system. Unlike the inland hundreds, Roden lay outside the regular division of the Uppland folklands. It mainly covered the coastal areas of Tiundaland and Attundaland, sometimes reaching into G\u00e4strikland, and in some sources even included islands further south such as Liding\u00f6 and V\u00e4rmd\u00f6.\nOver time, especially from the 1500s onward, the term \"Roslagen\" came to be used more generally for the entire Uppland coast and even some inland areas.\nA person from Roslagen is called a \"Rospigg\", a modernized form of \"rosbyggiar\" (\"inhabitant of Roden\"). The area also gives its name to the endangered domesticated Roslag sheep, which originated from the area centuries ago.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Roslagen is\" first attested in 1493 as \"Rodzlagen\". Before that, the area was known as \"Roden (\"from Old Swedish \"ro\u00f0er,\" \"rowing\"\")\", which referred to the coastal districts organized for naval defense. The second element \"-lagen\" comes from Old Swedish \"lag\", meaning a group or team acting together, the same word that appears in \"skeppslag\" (\"ship district\").\nThe name \"Roden\" itself may be attested already in the 11th century on two Uppland runestones (inscribed \"i ro\u00fe\" and \"i ru\u00fei\"). It was called \"ro\u00fei\" by Northmen in the 11th century that wrote down the words on the Uppland Runic Inscription 11. In written medieval sources it appears in the 14th century (\"Rodhinum\" 1316, \"Rodhin\" 1344). \"Roden\" was later contracted to \"Ron\" (attested in 1545 and 1608) before it disappeared from common usage, and \"Roslagen\" became the established name.\n\"Ruotsi\", \"Rus\"' and \"Russia\".\nEtymologically, Roslagen or Roden is the source of the Finnish and Estonian names for Sweden: and . \nSwedes from the Roslagen area also gave their name to the Rus' people and Russia (see Names of Rus', Russia and Ruthenia). The scholarly consensus is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as \"Roslagen\". According to the prevalent theory, the name \"Rus\"', like the Proto-Finnic name for Sweden (\"*roocci\"). is derived from an Old Norse term for \"the men who row\" (\"rods-\") as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen. The name \"Rus'\" would then have the same origin as the Finnish and Estonian names for Sweden.\nCommunications.\nThe region is served by the Roslagsbanan, a narrow-gauge railway network from Stockholm, going as far north as K\u00e5rsta. The motorway E18 goes through Roslagen between Kapellsk\u00e4r and Stockholm.\nNature.\nThe hiking trail Roslagsleden crosses the region starting in Danderyd and ending in Grisslehamn.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Weapons designers are investigating ramjet technology for use in artillery shells to increase range; a 120\u00a0mm ramjet-assisted mortar shell is thought to be able to travel . They have been used, though not efficiently, as tip jets on the ends of helicopter rotors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFrance.\nCyrano de Bergerac.\n\"L'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune (Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon)\" (1657) was the first of three satirical novels written by Cyrano de Bergerac that are considered among the first science fiction stories. Arthur C Clarke credited this book with conceiving the ramjet, and as the first fictional example of rocket-powered space flight.\nRen\u00e9 Lorin.\nThe ramjet was designed in 1913 by French inventor Ren\u00e9 Lorin, who was granted a patent (FR290356) for his device. He could not test his invention due to the unavailability of adequate equipment since there was no way at the time for an aircraft to go fast enough for a ramjet to function properly. His patent showed a piston internal combustion engine with added 'trumpets' as exhaust nozzles, expressing the idea that the exhaust from internal combustion engines could be directed into nozzles to create jet propulsion.\nRen\u00e9 Leduc.\nThe works of Ren\u00e9 Leduc were notable. Leduc's Model, the Leduc 0.10 was one of the first ramjet-powered aircraft to fly, in 1949.\nNord Aviation.\nThe Nord 1500 Griffon reached in 1958.\nAustria-Hungary.\nAlbert Fon\u00f3.\nIn 1915, Hungarian inventor Albert Fon\u00f3 devised a solution for increasing the range of artillery, comprising a gun-launched projectile united with a ramjet propulsion unit, thus giving a long range from relatively low muzzle velocities, allowing heavy shells to be fired from relatively lightweight guns. Fon\u00f3 submitted his invention to the Austro-Hungarian Army, but the proposal was rejected. After World War I, Fon\u00f3 returned to the subject. In May 1928 he described an \"air-jet engine\" as suitable for high-altitude supersonic aircraft, in a German patent application. In an additional patent application, he adapted the engine for subsonic speed. The patent was granted in 1932 (German Patent No. 554,906, 1932-11-02).\nSoviet Union.\nIn the Soviet Union, a theory of supersonic ramjet engines was presented in 1928 by Boris Stechkin. Yuri Pobedonostsev, chief of GIRD's 3rd Brigade, carried out research. The first engine, the GIRD-04, was designed by I.A. Merkulov and tested in April 1933. To simulate supersonic flight, it was fed by air compressed to 200 bar, and was fueled with hydrogen. The GIRD-08 phosphorus-fueled ramjet was tested by firing it from an artillery cannon. These shells may have been the first jet-powered projectiles to break the speed of sound.\nIn 1939, Merkulov did further ramjet tests using a two-stage rocket, the R-3. He developed the first ramjet engine for use as an auxiliary motor of an aircraft, the DM-1. The world's first ramjet-powered airplane flight took place in December 1940, using two DM-2 engines on a modified Polikarpov I-15. Merkulov designed a ramjet fighter \"Samolet D\" in 1941, which was never completed. Two of his DM-4 engines were installed on the Yak-7 PVRD fighter during World War II. In 1940, the Kostikov-302 experimental plane was designed, powered by a liquid fuel rocket for take-off and ramjet engines for flight. That project was cancelled in 1944.\nIn 1947, Mstislav Keldysh proposed a long-range antipodal bomber, similar to the S\u00e4nger-Bredt bomber, but powered by ramjet instead of rocket. In 1954, NPO Lavochkin and the Keldysh Institute began development of a Mach 3 ramjet-powered cruise missile, \"Burya\". This project competed with the R-7 ICBM developed by Sergei Korolev, but was cancelled in 1957.\nJapan.\nSeveral ramjets were designed, built, and ground-tested at the Kawasaki Aircraft Company's facility in Gifu during the Second World War. Company officials claimed, in December 1945, that these domestic initiatives were uninfluenced by parallel German developments. One post-war U.S. intelligence assessment described the Kawasaki ramjet's centrifugal fuel disperser as the company's \"most outstanding accomplishment ... eliminat[ing] a large amount of the fuel injection system normally employed.\" Because of excessive vibration, the engine was only intended for use in rocket, or catapult-launched pilotless aircraft. Preparations for flight testing ended with the Japanese surrender in August 1945.\nGermany.\nIn 1936, Hellmuth Walter constructed a test engine powered by natural gas. Theoretical work was carried out at BMW, Junkers, and DFL. In 1941, Eugen S\u00e4nger of DFL proposed a ramjet engine with a high combustion chamber temperature. He constructed large ramjet pipes with and diameter and carried out combustion tests on lorries and on a special test rig on a Dornier Do 17Z at flight speeds of up to . Later, as petrol became scarce in Germany, tests were carried out with blocks of pressed coal dust as a fuel (see e.g. Lippisch P.13a), which were not successful due to slow combustion.\nUnited States.\nStovepipe (flying/flaming/supersonic) was a popular name for the ramjet during the 1950s in trade magazines such as \"Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology\" and other publications such as \"The Cornell Engineer.\" The simplicity implied by the name came from a comparison with the turbojet engine which employs relatively complex and expensive spinning turbomachinery.\nThe US Navy developed a series of air-to-air missiles under the name of \"Gorgon\" using different propulsion mechanisms, including ramjet propulsion on the Gorgon IV. The ramjet Gorgon IVs, made by Glenn Martin, were tested in 1948 and 1949 at Naval Air Station Point Mugu. The ramjet was designed at the University of Southern California and manufactured by the Marquardt Aircraft Company. The engine was long and in diameter and was positioned below the missile.\nIn the early 1950s the US developed a Mach 4+ ramjet under the Lockheed X-7 program. This was developed into the Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher. Further development resulted in the Lockheed D-21 spy drone.\nIn the late 1950s the US Navy introduced a system called the RIM-8 Talos, which was a long range surface-to-air missile fired from ships. It successfully shot down enemy fighters during the Vietnam War, and was the first ship-launched missile to destroy an enemy aircraft in combat. On 23 May 1968, a Talos fired from USS \"Long Beach\" shot down a Vietnamese MiG at a range of about . It was also used as a surface-to-surface weapon and was modified to destroy land-based radars.\nUsing technology proven by the AQM-60, In the late 1950s and early 1960s the US produced a widespread defense system called the CIM-10 Bomarc, which was equipped with hundreds of nuclear armed ramjet missiles with a range of several hundred miles. It was powered by the same engines as the AQM-60, but with improved materials to endure longer flight times. The system was withdrawn in the 1970s as the threat from bombers subsided.\nTHOR-ER.\nIn April 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Norwegian Ministry of Defense jointly announced their partnership to develop advanced technologies applicable to long range high-speed and hypersonic weapons. The \"Tactical High-speed Offensive Ramjet for Extended Range (THOR-ER)\" program completed a solid fuel ramjet (SFRJ) vehicle test in August 2022.\nDual-mode ramjet.\nIn 2023, General Electric demonstrated a ramjet with rotating detonation combustion. It is a turbine-based combined-cycle engine that incorporates a\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the late 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, the UK developed several ramjet missiles.\nThe Blue Envoy project was supposed to equip the country with a long range ramjet powered air defense against bombers, but the system was cancelled. It was replaced by a shorter range ramjet missile system called the Bloodhound. The system was designed as a second line of defense in case attackers were able to bypass the fleet of defending English Electric Lightning fighters.\nIn the 1960s the Royal Navy developed and deployed a ramjet powered surface to air missile for ships called the Sea Dart. It had a range of and a speed of Mach 3. It was used successfully in combat against multiple types of aircraft during the Falklands War.\nFritz Zwicky.\nEminent Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky was research director at Aerojet and holds many patents in jet propulsion. Patents &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00a0 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00a0 are for ram accelerators. The U.S. Navy would not allow Zwicky to publicly discuss his invention, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00a0 is for the Underwater Jet, a ramjet that performs in a fluid medium. \"Time\" magazine reported on Zwicky's work.\nDesign.\nThe first part of a ramjet is its diffuser (compressor) in which the forward motion of the ramjet is used to raise the pressure of its working fluid (air) as required for combustion. Air is compressed, heated by combustion and expanded in a thermodynamic cycle known as the Brayton cycle, before being passed through a nozzle to accelerate it to supersonic speeds and generate forward thrust.\nRamjets are much less complex than turbojets or turbofans, requiring only an air intake, a combustor, and a nozzle to be built. Additionally, ramjets have little to no moving parts - liquid-fuel ramjets have only a fuel pump, whilst solid-fuel ramjets lack even this.\nBy comparison, a turbojet uses a compressor driven by a turbine, which generates its own compressed air (i.e. ram air in a ramjet) in order to generate thrust.\nConstruction.\nDiffuser.\nThe diffuser converts the high velocity of the air approaching the intake into high (static) pressure required for combustion. High combustion pressures minimise entropy rise during heat addition, thus minimising wasted thermal energy in the exhaust gases\nSubsonic and low-supersonic ramjets use a pitot-type opening for the inlet. This is followed by a widening internal passage (subsonic diffuser) to achieve a lower subsonic velocity that is required at the combustor. At low supersonic speeds a normal (planar) shock wave forms in front of the inlet.\nFor higher supersonic speeds the pressure loss through the shock wave becomes prohibitive and a protruding spike or cone is used to produce oblique shock waves in front of a final normal shock that occurs at the inlet entrance lip. The diffuser in this case consists of two parts: the supersonic diffuser, with shock waves external to the inlet, followed by the internal subsonic diffuser.\nAt higher speeds still, part of the supersonic diffusion has to take place internally, requiring external and internal oblique shock waves. The final normal shock has to occur in the vicinity of a minimum flow area known as the throat, which is followed by the subsonic diffuser.\nCombustor.\nAs with other jet engines, the combustor raises the air temperature by burning fuel. This takes place with a small pressure loss. The air velocity entering the combustor has to be low enough such that continuous combustion can take place in sheltered zones provided by flame holders.\nA ramjet combustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel:air ratios. This implies a combustor exit stagnation temperature of the order of for kerosene. Normally, the combustor must be capable of operating over a wide range of throttle settings, matching flight speeds and altitudes. Usually, a sheltered pilot region enables combustion to continue when the vehicle intake undergoes high yaw/pitch during turns. Other flame stabilization techniques make use of flame holders, which vary in design from combustor cans to flat plates, to shelter the flame and improve fuel mixing. Over-fuelling the combustor can cause the final (normal) shock in the diffuser to be pushed forward beyond the intake lip, resulting in a substantial drop in airflow and thrust.\nNozzles.\nThe propelling nozzle is a critical part of a ramjet design, since it accelerates exhaust flow to produce thrust.\nSubsonic ramjets accelerate exhaust flow with a nozzle. Supersonic flight typically requires a convergent\u2013divergent nozzle.\nPerformance and control.\nAlthough ramjets have been run as slow as , below about they give little thrust and are highly inefficient due to their low pressure ratios.\nAbove this speed, given sufficient initial flight velocity, a ramjet is self-sustaining. Unless the vehicle drag is extremely high, the engine/airframe combination tends to accelerate to higher and higher flight speeds, substantially increasing the air intake temperature. As this could damage the engine and/or airframe integrity, the fuel control system must reduce fuel flow to stabilize speed and, thereby, air intake temperature.\nDue to the stoichiometric combustion temperature, efficiency is usually good at high speeds (around ), whereas at low speeds the relatively low pressure means the ramjets are outperformed by turbojets and rockets.\nControl.\nRamjets can be classified according to the type of fuel, either liquid or solid; and the booster.\nLiquid fuel.\nIn a liquid fuel ramjet (LFRJ), hydrocarbon fuel (typically) is injected into the combustor ahead of a flameholder. The flameholder stabilises the flame with the compressed air from the intake(s). A means of pressurizing and supplying the fuel to the ramcombustor is required, which can be complicated and expensive. This propulsion system was first perfected by Yvonne Brill during her work at Marquardt Corporation.\nA\u00e9rospatiale-Celerg designed an LFRJ where the fuel is forced into the injectors by an elastomer bladder that inflates progressively along the length of the fuel tank. Initially, the bladder forms a close-fitting sheath around the compressed air bottle from which it is inflated, which is mounted lengthwise in the tank. This offers a lower-cost approach than a regulated LFRJ requiring a pump system to supply the fuel.\nTake-off.\nA ramjet generates no static thrust and needs a booster to achieve a forward velocity high enough for efficient operation of the intake system. The first ramjet-powered missiles used external boosters, usually solid-propellant rockets, either in tandem, where the booster is mounted immediately aft of the ramjet, e.g. Sea Dart, or wraparound where multiple boosters are attached around the outside of the ramjet, e.g. 2K11 Krug. The choice of booster arrangement is usually driven by the size of the launch platform. A tandem booster increases the length of the system, whereas wraparound boosters increase the diameter. Wraparound boosters typically generate higher drag than a tandem arrangement.\nIntegrated boosters provide a more efficient packaging option, since the booster propellant is cast inside the otherwise empty combustor. This approach has been used on solid-fuel ramjets (SFRJ), for example 2K12 Kub, liquid, for example ASMP, and ducted rocket, for example Meteor, designs. Integrated designs are complicated by the different nozzle requirements of the boost and ramjet flight phases. Due to the booster's higher thrust levels, a differently shaped nozzle is required for optimum thrust compared to that required for the lower thrust ramjet sustainer. This is usually achieved via a separate nozzle, which is ejected after booster burnout. However, designs such as Meteor feature nozzleless boosters. This offers the advantages of elimination of the hazard to launch aircraft from the boost debris, simplicity, reliability, and reduced mass and cost, although this must be traded against the reduction in performance of a dedicated booster nozzle.\nIntegral rocket ramjet/ducted rocket.\nA slight variation on the ramjet uses the supersonic exhaust from a rocket combustion process to compress and react with the incoming air in the main combustion chamber. This has the advantage of giving thrust even at zero speed.\nIn a solid fuel integrated rocket ramjet (SFIRR), the solid fuel is cast along the outer wall of the ramcombustor. In this case, fuel injection is through ablation of the propellant by the hot compressed air from the intake(s). An aft mixer may be used to improve combustion efficiency. SFIRRs are preferred over LFRJs for some applications because of the simplicity of the fuel supply, but only when the throttling requirements are minimal, i.e. when variations in altitude or speed are limited.\nIn a ducted rocket, a solid fuel gas generator produces a hot fuel-rich gas which is burnt in the ramcombustor with the compressed air supplied by the intake(s). The flow of gas improves the mixing of the fuel and air and increases total pressure recovery. In a throttleable ducted rocket, also known as a variable flow ducted rocket, a valve allows the gas generator exhaust to be throttled allowing thrust control. Unlike an LFRJ, solid propellant ramjets cannot flame out. The ducted rocket sits somewhere between the simplicity of the SFRJ and LFRJ's unlimited speed control.\nFlight speed.\nRamjets generally give little or no thrust below about half the speed of sound, and they are inefficient (specific impulse of less than 600 seconds) until the airspeed exceeds due to low compression ratios. It takes from 300\u00a0mph (485\u00a0km/h) at sea level onwards to work effectively.\nEven above the minimum speed, a wide flight envelope (range of flight conditions), such as low to high speeds and low to high altitudes, can force significant design compromises, and they tend to work best optimised for one designed speed and altitude (point designs). However, ramjets generally outperform gas turbine-based jet engine designs and work best at supersonic speeds (Mach 2\u20134). Although inefficient at slower speeds, they are more fuel-efficient than rockets over their entire useful working range up to at least .\nThe performance of conventional ramjets falls off above Mach 6 due to dissociation and pressure loss caused by shock as the incoming air is slowed to subsonic velocities for combustion. In addition, the combustion chamber's inlet temperature increases to very high values, approaching the dissociation limit at some limiting Mach number.\nRelated engines.\nSupersonic-combustion ramjets (scramjets).\nRamjet diffusers slow the incoming air to a subsonic velocity before it enters the combustor. Scramjets are similar to ramjets, but the air flows through the combustor at supersonic speed. This increases the pressure recovered from the streaming air and improves net thrust. Thermal choking of the exhaust is avoided by having a relatively high supersonic air velocity at combustor entry. Fuel injection is often into a sheltered region below a step in the combustor wall. The Boeing X-43 was a small experimental ramjet that achieved for 200 seconds on the X-51A Waverider.\nPrecooled engines.\nA variant of the ramjet is the 'combined cycle' engine, intended to overcome the ramjet's limitations. One example of this is the SABRE engine, which uses a precooler, behind which is the ramjet and turbine machinery.\nThe ATREX engine developed in Japan is an experimental implementation of this concept. It uses liquid hydrogen fuel in a single-fan arrangement. The liquid fuel is pumped through a heat exchanger in the air intake, simultaneously heating the fuel and cooling the incoming air. This cooling is critical to efficient operation. The hydrogen then continues through a second heat exchanger position after the combustion section, where the hot exhaust is used to further heat the hydrogen, turning it into a high pressure gas. This gas is then passed through the tips of the fan to provide driving power to the fan at subsonic speeds. After mixing with the air, it is burned in the combustion chamber.\nThe Reaction Engines Scimitar was proposed for the LAPCAT hypersonic airliner, and the Reaction Engines SABRE for the Reaction Engines Skylon spaceplane.\nNuclear-powered ramjet.\nUnited States.\nDuring the Cold War, the United States designed and ground-tested a nuclear-powered ramjet called Project Pluto. This system, intended for use in a cruise missile, used no combustion; a high-temperature, unshielded nuclear reactor heated the air. The ramjet was predicted to be able to fly at supersonic speeds for months. Because the reactor was unshielded, it was dangerous to anyone in or around the vehicle flight path (although its exhaust wasn't radioactive). The project was ultimately cancelled because ICBMs seemed to serve the purpose better.\nThis type of engine could be used for the exploration of planetary atmospheres such as Jupiter's.\nRussia.\nOn 1 March 2018 President Vladimir Putin announced a nuclear-powered ramjet cruise missile capable of extended long range flight. It was designated 9M730 \"Burevestnik\" (Petrel) and has the NATO reporting name SSC-X-9 \"Skyfall\". On 9 August 2019, an explosion and release of radioactive material was recorded at the State Central Navy Testing Range. Recovery efforts were underway to raise a test article that had landed in the White Sea during testing in 2018 when the nuclear power source of the missile detonated and killed 5 researchers.\nIonospheric ramjet.\nThe upper atmosphere above about contains monatomic oxygen produced by the sun through photochemistry. A concept was created by NASA for recombining this (thin) gas back to diatomic molecules at orbital speeds to power a ramjet.\nRamjet mode for an afterburning turbojet.\nAn afterburning turbojet or bypass engine can be described as transitioning from turbo to ramjet mode if it can attain a flight speed at which the engine pressure ratio (epr) has fallen to one. The turbo afterburner then acts as a ramburner. The intake ram pressure is present at entry to the afterburner but is no longer augmented with a pressure rise from the turbomachinery. Further increase in speed introduces a pressure loss due to the presence of the turbomachinery as the epr drops below one.\nA notable example was the propulsion system for the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird with an epr=0.9 at Mach 3.2. The thrust required, airflow and exhaust temperature, to reach this speed came from a standard method for increasing airflow through a compressor running at low corrected speeds, compressor bleed, and being able to increase the afterburner temperature as a result of cooling the duct and nozzle using the air taken from the compressor rather than the usual, much hotter, turbine exhaust gas.\nAircraft using ramjets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMissiles using ramjets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The manga and anime series were licensed by Viz Media for English-language releases in North America. Madman Entertainment released the manga, part of the anime series, and the first two films in Australasia, while MVM Films released the first two films in the United Kingdom.\nThe \"Ranma \u00bd\" manga has over 55 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Both the manga and anime are cited as among the first in their respective media to have become popular in the United States.\nPlot.\nOn a training journey in the Bayankala Mountain Range in the Qinghai Province of China, Ranma Saotome and his father Genma fell into the cursed springs of . The cursed spring causes any afflicted to assume the physical form of whatever drowned there hundreds or thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water, which reverts on contact with hot water but resumes with exposure to cold water. Genma fell into the spring of a drowned panda while Ranma fell into the spring of a drowned girl.\nSoun Tendo is a fellow practitioner of or \"Anything-Goes School\" of martial arts and owner of a dojo in Nerima. Genma and Soun agreed years ago that their children would marry and carry on the Tendo Dojo. Soun has three teenage daughters: the polite and easygoing Kasumi, the greedy and indifferent Nabiki and the short-tempered, martial arts practicing Akane. Akane, who is Ranma's age, is appointed for bridal duty by her sisters with the reasoning that they are the older sisters and can dump the duty on her, and that they all dislike the arranged engagement and think Akane's dislike of men is the right way to express it to the fathers. At the appointed time, the Saotomes arrive in their new forms given by the cursed springs, confusing the Tendos, and ultimately leading to Akane seeing Ranma changing from girl form to boy form in the tub, much to her horror. It takes several more pages for the situation to be explained to Soun Tendo and his daughters. Both Ranma and Akane refuse the engagement initially, having not been consulted on the decision, but the fathers are insistent and they are generally treated as betrothed and end up helping or saving each other on some occasions. They are frequently found in each other's company and are constantly arguing in their trademark awkward love-hate manner that is a franchise focus.\nRanma goes to school with Akane at , where he meets his recurring opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the conceited kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also falls in love with Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters eventually knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately fell into the Spring of the Drowned Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he takes the form of a little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also fell into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Genma and Soun's impish grand master, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.\nRanma's prospective paramours include the martial arts rhythmic gymnastics champion (and Tatewaki's sister) Kodachi Kuno, and his second fianc\u00e9e and childhood friend Ukyo Kuonji the okonomiyaki vendor, along with the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, supported by her great-grandmother Cologne. As the series progresses, the school becomes more eccentric with the return of the demented, Hawaii-obsessed Principal Kuno and the placement of the power-leeching alternating child/adult Hinako Ninomiya as Ranma's English teacher. Ranma's indecision in choosing his true love causes chaos in his romantic and school life.\nProduction.\nRumiko Takahashi stated that \"Ranma \u00bd\" was conceived to be a martial arts manga that connects all aspects of everyday life to martial arts. Because her previous series had female protagonists, the author decided that she wanted a male this time. However, she was worried about writing a male main character, and therefore decided to make him half-female. According to Takahashi, the idea of making Ranma \"just kinda popped into [her] head\", and she looked for a way to make it possible for him to go back and forth between genders. It was then when she had a vision of a bathhouse's cloth entrance sign. She considered Ranma changing every time he was punched before deciding on water for initiating his changes. That decision led her to feeling that Jusenkyo had to be set in China, as it is the only place that could have such mysterious springs. She drew inspiration for \"Ranma \u00bd\" from a variety of real-world objects. Some of the places frequently seen in the series are modeled after actual locations in Nerima, Tokyo (both the home of Takahashi and the setting of \"Ranma \u00bd\").\nIn a 1990 interview with \"Amazing Heroes\", Takahashi stated that she had four assistants that draw the backgrounds, panel lines and tone, while she creates the story and layout, and pencils and inks the characters. All her assistants are female; Takahashi stated that \"I don't use male assistants so that the girls will work more seriously if they aren't worried about boys.\" In 1992, she explained her process as beginning with laying out the chapter in the evening so as to finish it by dawn, and resting for a day before calling her assistants. They finish it in two or three nights, usually utilizing five days for a chapter.\nTakahashi purposefully aimed the series to be popular with women and children. In 1993, an \"Animerica\" interviewer talking with Takahashi asked her if she intended the sex-changing theme \"as an effort to enlighten a male-dominated society\". Takahashi said that she does not think in terms of societal agendas and that she created the \"Ranma \u00bd\" concept from simply wanting \"a simple, fun idea\". She added that she, as a woman and while recalling what manga she liked to read as a child, felt that \"humans turning into animals might also be fun and ... you know, like a fairy tale.\" In 2013, she revealed that at the start of \"Ranma\" her editor told her to make it more dramatic, but she felt that was something she could not do. However, she admitted that drama did start to appear at the end. She also sat in on the voice actor auditions for the anime, where she insisted that male and female Ranma be voiced by different actors whose gender corresponded to that of the part.\nMedia.\nManga.\nWritten and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, \"Ranma \u00bd\" began publication in the manga anthology \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" issue #36 published on August 19, 1987, following the ending of her series \"Urusei Yatsura\". From August 1987 until March 1996, the manga was published on a near weekly basis with the occasional colored page to spruce up the usually black and white stories. After nearly a decade of storylines, the final chapter was published in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" issue #12 on March 6, 1996. The 407 chapters were periodically collected and published by Shogakukan into a total of 38 black and white volumes from 1988 to 1996. They were reassembled in 38 from April 2002 to October 2003. A \"Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" Special edition for all 20 volumes was published from 2016 to 2018. This edition included a series of interviews with Rumiko Takahashi called \"The Making of Ranma.\"\nNorth American publisher Viz Media originally released \"Ranma \u00bd\" in a monthly comic book format that contained two chapters each from 1992 to 2003, and had the images \"flipped\" to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored. These were periodically collected into graphic novels. On March 18, 2004, after releasing 21 volumes, Viz announced that it would reprint a number of its graphic novels. The content remained the same, but the novels moved to a smaller format with different covers and a price drop. Each volume covers roughly the same amount of material as the Japanese volumes, but retained its left-to-right format and had minor differences in grouping so that it spans 36 volumes rather than the original 38. The final volume was released in stores on November 14, 2006, thus making it Viz's longest running manga, spanning over 13 years. At Anime Expo on July 7, 2013, Viz Media announced re-release of the manga in a format that combines two individual volumes into a single large one, and restores the original right-to-left reading order (a first in North America for this series). The first 2-in-1 book (volumes 1\u20132) was published on March 11, 2014; the final (volumes 35\u201336) on March 14, 2017. On July 27, 2021, Viz released all 19 2-in-1 books digitally. Madman Entertainment publishes the two-in-one version in Australasia.\nTogether with \"Spriggan\", it was the first manga published in Portugal, by Texto Editora in 1995.\n1989 \u2013 1992 anime series.\nAn anime television series was created by Studio Deen and aired weekly between April 15, 1989, and September 16, 1989, on Fuji TV for 18 episodes, before being canceled due to low ratings. The series was then reworked by most of the same staff, retitled and launched in a different time slot, running for 143 episodes from October 20, 1989, to September 25, 1992. The anime stays true to the original manga but does differ by keeping Ranma's gender transformation a secret from the high school students, at least throughout most of its length. It also does not introduce Hikaru Gosunkugi until very late in the series, instead, Sasuke Sarugakure, the diminutive ninja retainer of the Kuno family fills a number of Gosunkugi's roles in early storylines but is a major character in his own right. The anime also alters the placement of many story arcs and contains numerous original episodes and characters not adapted from the manga.\nViz Media licensed both anime series in 1993, making \"Ranma \u00bd\" one of the first anime titles licensed by Viz. The English dub produced for the series was recorded by The Ocean Group in Vancouver, British Columbia. They released the series on VHS from their own \"Viz Video\" label, and on DVD a few years later in association with Pioneer Home Entertainment. Their releases collected both anime series as one, separated episodes into what they call \"seasons\", and changed the ordering of many of the episodes. Viz themselves re-released it on DVD in 2007 using their own DVD production company. At Otakon 2013, Viz announced that they re-acquired the TV series for Blu-ray and DVD release in 2014. The show is streamed on their anime channel service Neon Alley since Autumn 2013. In September 2020, Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco revealed that he had previously tried to get \"Ranma \u00bd\" aired on the American TV programming block, but \"it's something we never were able to figure out, because, frankly, there's too much nudity\". Madman Entertainment licensed some of the series for release in Australasia, although their rights expired after releasing only the first four \"seasons\" as one series.\nThe original (1989\u20131992) anime adapts 56% of the manga, or 229 chapters, 22 volumes out of the 38.\nFilms and original video animations.\nStudio Deen also created three theatrical films; \"The Battle of Nekonron, China! A Battle to Defy the Rules!\" on November 2, 1991; \"Battle at Togenkyo! Get Back the Brides\" on August 1, 1992; and \"Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix\" on August 20, 1994. The first two films are feature length, but the third was originally shown in theaters with two other films: \"Ghost Sweeper Mikami\" and \"Heisei Dog Stories: Bow\".\nFollowing the ending of the TV series, 11 original video animations were released directly to home video, the earliest on December 7, 1993, and the eleventh on June 4, 1996. All but two are based on stories originally in the manga. Twelve years later, a \"Ranma\" animation was created for the \"It's a Rumic World\" exhibition of Rumiko Takahashi's artwork. Based on the \"Nightmare! Incense of Deep Sleep\" manga story from volume 34, it was shown on odd numbered days at the exhibition in Tokyo from July 30 to August 11, 2008. But it was not released on video until January 29, 2010, when it was put in a DVD box set with the \"Urusei Yatsura\" and \"Inuyasha\" specials that premiered at the same exhibit. It was then released on DVD and Blu-ray by itself on October 20, 2010. Viz Media also licensed all three films, and the original 11 OVAs for distribution in North America (however they released the third film as an OVA). MVM Films has released the first two films in the United Kingdom, while Madman Entertainment released them in Australasia.\n2024 \u2013 present anime series.\nA new anime adaptation was announced in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" in June 2024. The new anime remake series, simply titled \"Ranma \u00bd\", is produced by MAPPA with Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions handling planning and production duties. The series is directed by K\u014dnosuke Uda, with Kimiko Ueno handling series composition, Hiromi Taniguchi designing the characters, and Kaoru Wada composing the music. Most of the original Japanese voice cast for the main characters reprise their roles. In contrast with the original animation, the remake censors some Chinese communist symbolism. The first season aired from October 6 to December 22, 2024, on Nippon Television and its affiliates, with Netflix licensing it for streaming worldwide weekly after the Japanese broadcast. Viz Media and Hot Topic hosted the world premiere of the first episode on August 23 during Anime NYC. Earlier that same month, it was reported that the entire first season was leaked online alongside many other Iyuno localization company works. Netflix promptly responded to the leaks with DMCA takedowns.\nA second season was announced immediately following the first season finale. The staff and cast from the first season are reprising their roles. It is set to premiere on October 5, 2025, on the same television network and its affiliates.\nOne opening and ending theme was used per season. For the first season, the opening theme is \"Iinazukekkyun\" performed by Ano, while the ending theme is \"Anta Nante\" performed by Riria. For the second season, the opening theme is \"Wo Ai Ni\" performed by Wednesday Campanella, while the ending theme is \"Panda Girl\" performed by Nishina.\nVideo games.\nThere have been seventeen video games based on the \"Ranma \u00bd\" franchise. While most are fighting games, there have been several RPGs, puzzle games, and Pachinko slot machines. The most recent game is \"Pachislot Ranma 1/2\", released on November 5, 2018, for \"Pachinko\". Only two have been released in Western countries. \"Ranma \u00bd: Ch\u014dnai Gekit\u014dhen\" was released in the US as \"Street Combat\"; the characters were Americanized, having their appearances completely changed, and the music was changed as well. However, \"\" was released in both North America and Europe unaltered.\nLive-action special.\nA live action television adaption of \"Ranma \u00bd\" aired on Nippon Television, in a two-hour time-slot, on December 9, 2011. Although it was initially reported that the special would contain an original story, the film does take its main plot from one of the manga's early stories with several other early scenes mixed in. The special stars Yui Aragaki as Akane, with Kento Kaku and Natsuna Watanabe playing male and female Ranma respectively. Ry\u014dsei Tayama is cast as the antagonist, the new original character Okamada. The all-girl pop group 9nine contribute \"Chikutaku\u26062Nite\" as the theme song. It was released on both DVD and Blu-ray on March 21, 2012.\nOther media.\n\"The Ranma \u00bd Memorial Book\" was published just as the manga ended in 1996. Acting as an end-cap to the series, it collects various illustrations from the series, features an interview with Takahashi, and includes tidbits about Ranma: summaries of his battles, his daily schedule, trivia, and a few exclusive illustrations.\nA \"Movie + OVA Visual Comic\" was released to illustrate the theatrical film \"Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix\" and the OVA episodes \"The One to Carry On\" (both parts). It also included information on the voice actors, character designs, and a layout of the Tendo dojo.\nAdditionally, guidebooks were released for three of the \"Ranma \u00bd\" video games; these included not only strategies, but also interviews. Two books including interviews with the cast of the live-action TV drama, and some select stories, were released in 2011.\nThe music from the \"Ranma \u00bd\" TV series, films and OVAs have been released on various CDs. Four from the TV series, two from the first film, one from the second, one from the third film and OVAs, and three compiling the music by DoCo used in the OVAs. DoCo is a pop group composed of the anime's main female characters' voice actresses. Several compilation albums were also released, some composed of the opening and closing theme songs and others of image songs. Many of the image songs were first released as singles.\nReception.\nBy November 2006, it was reported that \"Ranma \u00bd\" had sold over 49 million manga volumes in Japan. Shogakukan has printed 53 million copies as of November 2011, and by April 2021 it had 55 million copies in circulation.\nThe \"Ranma \u00bd\" anime was ranked number 17 on \"Anime Insider\"'s 2001 list of the Top 50 Anime, although the list was limited to series that were released in North America. It ranked 36th on TV Asahi's 2006 list of Japan's 100 favorite animated TV series, which is based on an online poll of the Japanese people, up from the previous year's list where it ranked 45th. In November 2006, the New York Comic Con announced that it would host the first-ever American Anime Awards. Fans had the chance to vote for their favorite anime online during the month of January 2007. Only the five nominees receiving the most votes for each category were announced on February 5. Among the 12 different categories, \"Ranma \u00bd\" was voted into the \"Best Comedy Anime\" category, and the \"Ranma \u00bd\" OVAs were voted into the \"Best Short Series\" category. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw \"Ranma \u00bd\" and \"Ranma \u00bd Nett\u014dhen\" named Takahashi's second best-animated work. Shampoo and Ranma were voted fourth and fifth place respectively in her characters category. The 2024 anime adaptation was nominated for 6 categories, including Best Comedy, Best Romance, and Best Ending Sequence (\"Anta Nante\" by Riria) at the 9th Crunchyroll Anime Awards in 2025.\nAlthough Lum from Takahashi's first series \"Urusei Yatsura\" is often cited as the first character in anime and manga, Theron Martin of \"Anime News Network\" stated that \"Ranma \u00bd\"'s Akane Tendo is closer to how they would later typically be portrayed in the 2000s. He also suggested that one could argue \"Ranma\" is an early example of a harem or reverse harem series, due to the main character attracting suitors in both genders. The series's publication in North America proved highly successful as well, being many Americans' first introduction to manga and its anime adaptation one of the first Japanese animation shows to achieve popularity in the US. In an overview of the series, Jason Thompson called \"Ranma \u00bd\" \"the direct ancestor of all comedy-action manga, like \"Sumomomo Momomo\" and \"History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi\"\", although noted that it was not the first, but only spanned the period when manga and anime sales were at their height. Relating it to Takahashi's other works, he summed the series up as \"At the start, the fighting is minimal and it's almost a semi-serious relationship comedy, like \"Maison Ikkoku\"; then it turns completely ridiculous; and by the climax, when Ranma fights the evil bird-people of Phoenix Mountain in an excessively long and un-funny fight scene, it's like a warmup for \"Inuyasha\".\" Reviewing the final volume of the manga, \"Anime News Network\" remarked that \"Every dimension of Rumiko Takahashi's storytelling skills come into play here: comedy, romance and introspection, and of course, high-flying fantasy martial-arts action.\" However, they felt some of the action scenes were hard to follow and noted that the mirroring to left-to-right format caused errors with the art.\nIn their review of Viz Media's season five DVD box set, \"Anime News Network\" praised the Japanese cast's performance and the animation, but criticized the English version's slight script changes and minor voice actors while praising its main cast. They also remarked that while \"Ranma \u00bd\" is a classic, after a hundred episodes, the same jokes are just not funny anymore. \"THEM Anime Reviews\"' Raphael See called the television series and the OVAs \"one of the funniest things [he's] ever seen, anime or otherwise\" and also praised the English dub as some of the best. However, he was much more critical of the first two films particularly for both using the same damsel in distress plot. Mike Toole of \"Anime News Network\" included \"Big Trouble in Nekronon, China\" at number 83 on The Other 100 Best Anime Movies of All Time, a list of \"lesser-known, lesser-loved classics\", calling it \"a solid action-comedy and a good, well-rounded example of the appeal of \"Ranma \u00bd\"\".\nLegacy.\nHiroshi Aro admitted that he created \"Futaba-kun Change!\" based on \"Ranma \u00bd\". Western comic book artists who have cited \"Ranma \u00bd\" as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley on his series \"Scott Pilgrim\" and American Colleen Coover on her erotic series \"Small Favors\".\nFilm director Makoto Shinkai mentioned that \"Ranma \u00bd\" served as an inspiration for the 2016 animation film \"Your Name\". Matt Bozon, creator of the \"Shantae\" video game series, cited \"Ranma \u00bd\" as a big influence on his work. The title of the fourth game, \"\", is also a tribute to the series.\nIn 2009, a crustacean species was discovered by Dr. Keiichi Kakui, which contains both male and female reproductive organs. It was later named Apseudes ranma in 2024, taking its name from Ranma Saotome.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The professional head of the RAN is Chief of Navy (CN) Vice Admiral Mark Hammond. The Chief of Navy is also jointly responsible to the Minister for Defence (MINDEF) and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). The Department of Defence, which is a part of the Australian Public Service, supports the ADF, and ergo, the Royal Australian Navy.\nThe navy was formed in 1901 as the Commonwealth Naval Forces (CNF) through the amalgamation of the colonial navies of Australia following the federation of Australia. Although it was originally intended for local defence, it became increasingly responsible for regional defence as the British Empire started to diminish its influence in the South Pacific.\nThe Royal Australian Navy was initially a green-water navy, as the Royal Navy provided a blue-water force to the Australian Squadron, which the Australian and New Zealand governments helped to fund; the squadron was assigned to the Australia Station. This period lasted until 1913, when naval ships purchased from Britain arrived, although the British Admiralty continued to provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and Indian Oceans up to the early years of the Second World War.\nDuring its history, the Royal Australian Navy has participated in a number of major wars, including the First and Second World Wars, Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation and the Vietnam War. As of 2025, the RAN consists of 36 commissioned vessels, 12 non-commissioned vessels and over 16,000 personnel. The navy is one of the largest and most sophisticated naval forces in the South Pacific region, with a significant presence in the Indian Ocean and worldwide operations in support of military campaigns and peacekeeping missions.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Commonwealth Naval Forces were established on 1 March 1901, with the amalgamation of the six separate colonial naval forces, following the Federation of Australia. The Commonwealth Navy initially consisted of the former New South Wales, Victorian, Queensland, Western Australian, South Australian and Tasmanian ships and resources of their disbanded navies.\nThe \"Defence Act 1903\" established the operation and command structure of the Commonwealth Navy. When policymakers sought to determine the newly established force's requirements and purpose, there were arguments about whether Australia's naval force would be structured mainly for local defence or designed to serve as a fleet unit within a larger imperial force, controlled centrally by the British Admiralty. In 1908\u201309, a compromise solution was pursued, with the Australian government agreeing to establish a force for local defence but that would be capable of forming a fleet unit within the Royal Navy, albeit without central control. As a result, the navy's force structure was set at \"one battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers and three submarines\". The first of the Navy's new vessels, the destroyer HMAS Yarra, was completed in September 1910, and by the outbreak of the First World War the majority of the planned fleet had been realised. On 10 July 1911, the Navy was renamed the Royal Australian Navy, with the approval of King George V.\nWorld War I.\nPacific.\nFollowing the British Empire's declaration of war on Germany, the British War Office tasked the capture of German New Guinea to the Australian Government. This was to deprive the Imperial German Navy's East Asia Squadron of regional intelligence by removing their access to wireless stations. On 11 August, three destroyers and HMAS \"Sydney\" prepared to engage the squadron at German Anchorages in New Guinea, which did not eventuate as the vessels were not present. Landing parties were placed on Rabaul and Herbertshohe to destroy its German wireless station; however, the objective was found to be further inland and an expeditionary force was required. Meanwhile, HMAS \"Australia\" was tasked with scouring the Pacific Ocean for the German squadron.\nThe Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (ANMEF) began recruiting on the same day that the taskforce arrived in New Britain, and consisted of two battalions: one of 1,000 men, and the other with 500 serving and former seamen. On 19 August, the ANMEF departed Sydney for training in Townsville before the rendezvous with other RAN vessels in Port Moresby. On 29 August, four cruisers and HMAS \"Australia\" assisted New Zealand's Samoa Expeditionary Force in landing at Apia, and committing a bloodless takeover of German Samoa. Additionally, the RAN captured German merchant vessels, disrupting German merchant shipping in the Pacific. On 7 September, the ANMEF, now including HMAS \"Australia\", three destroyers, and two each of cruisers and submarines, departed for Rabaul.\nA few days later, on 9 September, HMAS \"Melbourne\" landed a party to destroy the island's wireless station, though the German administration promptly surrendered. Between 11 and 12 September, landings were put ashore at Kabakaul, Rabaul and Herbertshohe; it was during this period that the first Australian casualties and deaths of the war occurred. On 14 September, HMAS \"Encounter\" barraged an enemy position at Toma with shells; it was the first time the RAN had fired upon an enemy and had shelled an inland location. On 17 September, German New Guinea surrendered to the encroaching ANMEF, with the overall campaign a success and exceeded the objectives set by the War Office. However, the RAN submarine HMAS \"AE1\" became the first ever vessel of the new navy to be sunk. The Australian Squadron was placed under control of the British Admiralty, and was moreover tasked with protecting Australian shipping.\nOn 1 November, the RAN escorted the First Australian Imperial Force convoy from Albany, WA and set for the Khedivate of Egypt, which was soon to become the Sultanate of Egypt. On 9 November, HMAS \"Sydney\" began hunting for SMS \"Emden\", a troublesome German coastal raider. The SMS \"Emden\" and HMAS \"Sydney\" met in the Battle of Cocos, the \"Emden\" was destroyed in Australia's first naval victory. Following the almost complete destruction of the East Asia Squadron in the Battle of the Falklands by the Royal Navy, the RAN became able to be reassigned to other naval theatres of the war.\nAtlantic and Mediterranean.\nOn 28 February 1915, the Royal Australian Naval Bridging Train (RANBT) was formed with members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve who could not find billets in the RAN. Following the entrance of the Ottoman Empire in alliance with the Central Powers, HMAS \"AE2\" was committed to the initial naval operation of the Gallipoli campaign. After the failure of the naval strategy, an amphibious assault was planned to enable the Allies' warships to pass through the Dardanelles and capture Constantinople. The RANBT was sent ashore, along with the invasion, for engineering duties.\nLater in the war, most of the RAN's major ships operated as part of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean and North Seas, and then later in the Adriatic, and then the Black Sea following the surrender of the Ottoman Empire.\nInterwar years.\nIn 1919, the RAN received a force of six destroyers, three sloops and six submarines from the Royal Navy, but throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, the RAN was drastically reduced in size due to a variety of factors including political apathy and economic hardship as a result of the Great Depression. In this time the focus of Australia's naval policy shifted from defence against invasion to trade protection, and several fleet units were sunk as targets or scrapped. By 1923, the size of the navy had fallen to eight vessels, and by the end of the decade it had fallen further to five, with just 3,500 personnel. In the late 1930s, as international tensions increased, the RAN was modernised and expanded, with the service receiving primacy of funding over the Army and Air Force during this time as Australia began to prepare for war.\nWorld War II.\nEarly in the Second World War, RAN ships again operated as part of Royal Navy formations, many serving with distinction in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and off the West African coast. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the virtual destruction of Allied naval forces in Southeast Asia, the RAN operated more independently, defending against Axis naval activity in Australian waters, or participating in United States Navy offensives. As the navy took on an even greater role, it was expanded significantly and at its height the RAN was the fourth-largest navy in the world, with 39,650 personnel operating 337 warships, but no active submarines. A total of 34 vessels were lost during the war, including three cruisers and four destroyers.\nPost war to present.\nAfter the Second World War, the size of the RAN was again reduced, but it gained new capabilities with the acquisition of two aircraft carriers, \"Sydney\" and \"Melbourne\". The RAN saw action in many Cold War\u2013era conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region and operated alongside the Royal Navy and United States Navy off Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Since the end of the Cold War, the RAN has been part of Coalition forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, operating in support of Operation Slipper and undertaking counter piracy operations. It was also deployed in support of Australian peacekeeping operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands.\nThe high demand for personnel in the Second World War led to the establishment of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) branch in 1942, where over 3,000 women served in shore-based positions. The WRANS was disbanded in 1947, but then re-established in 1951 during the Cold War. It was given permanent status in 1959, and the RAN was the final branch to integrate women in the Australian military in 1985.\nIn April 2023, following the release of the \"Defence Strategic Review\", the government sought an \"Independent analysis into Navy's surface fleet combatant fleet\". In February 2024, the government released its response to the independent analysis.\nStructure.\nCommand structure.\nThe strategic command structure of the RAN was overhauled during the New Generation Navy changes. The RAN is commanded through Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Canberra. NHQ is responsible for implementing policy decisions handed down from the Department of Defence and for overseeing tactical and operational issues that are the purview of the subordinate commands.\nBeneath NHQ are two subordinate commands:\nFleet Command was previously made up of seven Force Element Groups, but after the New Generation Navy changes, this was restructured into four Force Commands:\nFleet.\nThe Royal Australian Navy consists of over 50 commissioned vessels and over 16,000 personnel. Ships commissioned into the RAN are given the prefix HMAS (His/Her Majesty's Australian Ship).\nThe RAN has two primary bases for its fleet: the first, Fleet Base East, is located at , Sydney and the second, Fleet Base West, is located at , near Perth. In addition, three other bases are home to the majority of the RAN's minor war vessels: , in Cairns, , in Darwin, and , in Sydney.\nClearance Diving Branch.\nThe Clearance Diving Branch is composed of two \"Clearance Diving Teams\" (CDT) that serve as parent units for naval clearance divers:\nWhen clearance divers are sent into combat, Clearance Diving Team Three (AUSCDT THREE) is formed.\nThe CDTs have two primary roles:\nPersonnel.\nAs of June 2023, the RAN has 14,745 permanent full-time personnel, 172 gap-year personnel, and 4,607 reserve personnel. The permanent full-time trained force consists of 3,070 commissioned officers, and 9,695 enlisted personnel. Male personnel made up 75.9% of the permanent full-time force, while female personnel made up 24%. The RAN has the second-highest percentage of women in the permanent forces, compared to the RAAF's 26.6% and the Army's 15.3%. Throughout the 2022-23 financial year 1,141 enlisted in the RAN on a permanent basis while 1,354 left, representing a net loss of 213 personnel. \nThe following are some of the current senior Royal Australian Navy officers:\nRanks and uniforms.\nCommissioned officers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nCommissioned officers of the Australian Navy have pay grades ranging from S-1 to O-10. The highest rank achievable in the current Royal Australian Navy structure is O-10, an admiral who serves as the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) when the position is held by a Naval Officer. The navy has a O-11 position Admiral of the Fleet that is honorary and is currently held by Charles III, King of Australia.\nO-8 (rear admiral) to O-11 (admiral of the fleet) are referred to as flag officers, O-5 (commander) and above are referred to as senior officers, while S-1 (midshipman) to O-4 (lieutenant commander) are referred to as junior officers. All RAN Officers are issued a commission by the Governor-General as Commander-in-Chief on behalf of His Majesty King Charles III.\nNaval officers are trained at the Royal Australian Naval College (HMAS \"Creswell\") in Jervis Bay as well as the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.\nSailors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough the Royal Australian Navy historically referred to these ranks as ratings in the same fashion as the Royal Navy and other Commonwealth navies, this was replaced by the term 'sailors' in 1965 as it was decided that this term would be better understood outside naval circles.\nRate insignia.\nRoyal Australian Navy sailors wear \"right arm rates\" insignia, called \"Category Insignia\" to indicate specialty training qualifications. This is a holdover from the Royal Navy.\nSpecial insignia.\nThe Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N) is an appointment held by the most senior sailor in the RAN and holds the rank of warrant officer (WO). However, the WO-N does not wear the WO rank insignia; instead, they wear the special insignia of the appointment. The WO-N appointment has similar equivalent appointments in the other services, each holding the rank of warrant officer, each being the most senior sailor/soldier/airman in that service, and each wearing their own special insignia rather than their rank insignia. The Australian Army equivalent is the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) and the Royal Australian Air Force equivalent is the Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF).\nChaplains and Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officers.\nChaplains in the Royal Australian Navy are commissioned officers who complete the same training as other officers in the RAN at the Royal Australian Naval College, HMAS Creswell. From July 2020, Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officers (MSWOs) were introduced to the Navy Chaplaincy Branch, designed to give Navy people and their families with professional, non-religious pastoral care and spiritual support.\nIn the Royal Australian Navy, Chaplains and MSWOs are commissioned officers without rank. For reasons of protocol, ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes, they are, where appropriate, normally grouped with Commanders (O-5). The more senior Division 4 Senior Chaplains are grouped with Captains (O-6) and Division 5 Principal Chaplains are grouped with Commodores (O-7), but their rank slide remains the same. Principal Chaplains and MSWOs, however, have gold braid on the peak of their white service cap.\nFrom January 2021, MSWOs and all chaplains wear the branch's new non-faith-specific rank insignia of a fouled anchor overlaying a compass rose, which represents a united team front, encompassing all faiths and purpose. Chaplains and MSWOs have insignia that reflect their religion on collar mounted patches (Cross for Christian, Crescent for Muslim etc, Compass rose for MSWOs.)\nShips and equipment.\nCurrent ships.\nThe RAN currently operates 36 commissioned vessels, made up of 11 ship classes, plus 12 non-commissioned vessels. In addition, DMS Maritime operates a large number of civilian-crewed vessels under contract to the Australian Defence Force.\nSmall arms.\nRAN personnel utilise the following small arms:\nFuture.\nThere are currently several major projects underway that will see upgrades to RAN capabilities.\nCurrent operations.\nThe RAN currently has forces deployed on seven major operations:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26328", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26328", "title": "Royal Australian Air Force", "text": "Air warfare and space branch of the Australian Defence Force\nMilitary unit\nThe Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the principal aerial warfare force of Australia, a part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army. Constitutionally the governor-general of Australia is the de jure commander-in-chief of the Australian Defence Force. The Royal Australian Air Force is commanded by the Chief of Air Force (CAF), who is subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). The CAF is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence, with the Department of Defence administering the ADF and the Air Force.\nFormed in March 1921, as the Australian Air Force, through the separation of the Australian Air Corps from the Army in January 1920, which in turn amalgamated the separate aerial services of both the Army and Navy. It directly continues the traditions of the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), the aviation corps of the Army that fought in the First World War and that was formed on 22 October 1912.\nDuring its history, the Royal Australian Air Force has fought in a number of major wars, including the Second World War in Europe and the Pacific, participated in the Berlin Airlift, Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesia\u2013Malaysia Confrontation, Vietnam War, and more recently, operations in East Timor, the Iraq War and subsequent intervention, and the War in Afghanistan.\nThe RAAF operates the majority of the ADF's fixed wing aircraft, although both the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy also operate aircraft in various roles. The RAAF provides support across a spectrum of operations such as air superiority, precision strikes, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, air mobility, space surveillance, and humanitarian support. The RAAF has 252 aircraft, of which 108 are combat aircraft.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe RAAF traces its history back to the 1911 Imperial Conference that was held in London, where it was decided aviation should be developed within the armed forces of the British Empire. Australia implemented this decision, the first dominion to do so, by approving the establishment of the \"Australian Aviation Corps\". This initially consisted of the Central Flying School at Point Cook, Victoria, opening on 22 October 1912. By 1914 the corps was known as the \"Australian Flying Corps\".\nFirst World War.\nSoon after the outbreak of war in 1914, the Australian Flying Corps sent aircraft to assist in capturing German colonies in what is now north-east New Guinea. However, these colonies surrendered quickly, before the planes were even unpacked. The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in providing air support during the Mesopotamian Campaign against the Ottoman Empire, in what is now Iraq.\nThe corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of the First World War. By the end of the war, four squadrons\u2014Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4\u2014had seen operational service, while another four training squadrons\u2014Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8\u2014had also been established. A total of 460 officers and 2,234 other ranks served in the AFC, whilst another 200 men served as aircrew in the British flying services. Casualties included 175 dead, 111 wounded, 6 gassed and 40 captured.\nInter-war period.\nThe Australian Flying Corps remained part of the Australian Army until 1919, when it was disbanded along with the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Although the Central Flying School continued to operate at Point Cook, military flying virtually ceased until 1920, when the interim Australian Air Corps (AAC), with a wing each for the Army and the Navy, was formed as a unit of the Army. The AAC was succeeded by the Australian Air Force which was formed on 31 March 1921. King George V approved the prefix \"Royal\" in May 1921 and became effective on 13 August 1921. The RAAF then became the second Royal air arm to be formed in the British Commonwealth, following the British Royal Air Force. When formed the RAAF had more aircraft than personnel, with 21 officers and 128 other ranks and 153 aircraft.\nAs British aircraft manufacturers at the time were unable to meet Australian requirements, in addition to British production demands, the Australian government established the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1936 and purchased some American aircraft.\nSecond World War.\nEurope and the Mediterranean.\nIn September 1939, the Australian Air Board directly controlled the Air Force via RAAF Station Laverton, RAAF Station Richmond, RAAF Station Pearce, No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF at Point Cook, RAAF Station Rathmines and five smaller units.\nIn 1939, just after the outbreak of the Second World War, Australia joined the Empire Air Training Scheme, under which flight crews received basic training in Australia before travelling to Canada for advanced training. A total of 17 RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain and with the Desert Air Force located in North Africa and the Mediterranean. Thousands of Australians also served with other Commonwealth air forces in Europe during the Second World War. About nine percent of the personnel who served under British RAF commands in Europe and the Mediterranean were RAAF personnel.\nWith British manufacturing targeted by the German Luftwaffe, in 1941 the Australian government created the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP; later known as the Government Aircraft Factories) to supply Commonwealth air forces, and the RAAF was eventually provided with large numbers of locally built versions of British designs such as the DAP Beaufort torpedo bomber, Beaufighters and Mosquitos, as well as other types such as Wirraways, Boomerangs, and Mustangs.\nIn the European theatre of the war, RAAF personnel were especially notable in RAF Bomber Command: although they represented just two percent of all Australian enlistments during the war, they accounted for almost twenty percent of those killed in action. No. 460 Squadron RAAF, mostly flying Avro Lancasters from 1942, had an official establishment of about 200 aircrew and yet had 1,018 combat deaths of which about half were Australian. The squadron was therefore effectively wiped out five times over. Total RAAF casualties in Europe were 5,488 killed or missing.\nPacific War.\nThe beginning of the Pacific War\u2014and the rapid advance of Japanese forces\u2014threatened the Australian mainland for the first time in its history. The RAAF was quite unprepared for the emergency, and initially had negligible forces available for service in the Pacific. In 1941 and early 1942, many RAAF airmen, including Nos. 1, 8, 21 and 453 Squadrons, saw action with the RAF Far East Command in the Malayan, Singapore and Dutch East Indies campaigns. Equipped with aircraft such as the Brewster Buffalo, and Lockheed Hudsons, the Australian squadrons suffered heavily against Japanese Zeros.\nDuring the fighting for Rabaul in early 1942, No. 24 Squadron RAAF fought a brief, but ultimately futile defence as the Japanese advanced south towards Australia. The devastating air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 increased concerns about the direct threat facing Australia. In response, some RAAF squadrons were transferred from the Northern Hemisphere\u2014although a substantial number remained there until the end of the war. Shortages of fighter and ground attack planes led to the acquisition of US-built Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks and the rapid design and manufacture of the first Australian fighter, the CAC Boomerang. RAAF Kittyhawks came to play a crucial role in the New Guinea and Solomon Islands campaigns, especially in operations like the Battle of Milne Bay. As a response to a possible Japanese chemical warfare threat the RAAF imported hundreds of thousands of chemical weapons into Australia.\nIn the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, imported Bristol Beaufighters proved to be highly effective ground attack and maritime strike aircraft. Beaufighters were later made locally by the DAP from 1944. Although it was much bigger than Japanese fighters, the Beaufighter had the speed to outrun them. The RAAF operated a number of Consolidated PBY Catalina as long-range bombers and scouts. The RAAF's heavy bomber force was predominantly made up of 287 B-24 Liberators, equipping seven squadrons, which could bomb Japanese targets as far away as Borneo and the Philippines from airfields in Australia and New Guinea. By late 1945, the RAAF had received or ordered about 500 P-51 Mustangs, for fighter/ground attack purposes. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation initially assembled US-made Mustangs, but later manufactured most of those used.\nBy mid-1945, the RAAF's main operational formation in the Pacific, the First Tactical Air Force (1st TAF), consisted of over 21,000 personnel, while the RAAF as a whole consisted of about 50 squadrons and 6,000 aircraft, of which over 3,000 were operational. The 1st TAF's final campaigns were fought in support of Australian ground forces in Borneo, but had the war continued some of its personnel and equipment would likely have been allocated to the invasion of the Japanese mainland, along with some of the RAAF bomber squadrons in Europe, which were to be grouped together with British and Canadian squadrons as part of the proposed Tiger Force. However, the war was brought to a sudden end by the US nuclear attacks on Japan. The RAAF's casualties in the Pacific were around 2,000 killed, wounded or captured.\nBy the time the war ended, a total of 216,900 men and women served in the RAAF, of whom 10,562 were killed in action; a total of 76 squadrons were formed. With over 152,000 personnel operating nearly 6,000 aircraft it was the world's fourth-largest air force.\nCold War.\nPostwar.\nDuring the Berlin Airlift, in 1948\u201349, the RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift aided the international effort to fly in supplies to the stricken city; two RAF Avro York aircraft were also crewed by RAAF personnel. Although a small part of the operation, the RAAF contribution was significant, flying 2,062 sorties and carrying 7,030 tons of freight and 6,964 passengers.\nIn the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, North American Mustangs from No. 77 Squadron RAAF, stationed in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, were among the first United Nations aircraft to be deployed, in ground support, combat air patrol, and escort missions. When the UN planes were confronted by North Korean Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighters, 77 Sqn acquired Gloster Meteor jets, however the MiGs remained superior and the Meteors were relegated to ground support missions as the North Koreans gained experience. The air force also operated transport aircraft during the conflict. No. 77 Squadron flew 18,872 sorties, claiming the destruction of 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, 16 bridges, 98 railway carriages and an unknown number of enemy personnel. Three MiG-15s were confirmed destroyed, and two others probably destroyed. RAAF casualties included 41 killed and seven captured; 66 aircraft\u00a0\u2013 22 Mustangs and 44 Meteors\u00a0\u2013 were lost.\nIn July 1952, No. 78 Wing RAAF was deployed to Malta in the Mediterranean where it formed part of a British force which sought to counter the Soviet Union's influence in the Middle East as part of Australia's Cold War commitments. Consisting of No. 75 and 76 Squadrons equipped with de Havilland Vampire jet fighters, the wing provided an air garrison for the island for the next two and half years, returning to Australia in late 1954.\nIn 1953, a Royal Air Force officer, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman, was brought out to Australia to become Chief of the Air Staff. He reorganised the RAAF into three commands: Home Command, Maintenance Command, and Training Command. Five years later, Home Command was renamed Operational Command, and Training Command and Maintenance Command were amalgamated to form Support Command.\nSouth East Asia operations.\nIn the Malayan Emergency, from 1950 to 1960, six Avro Lincolns heavy bombers from No. 1 Squadron RAAF and a flight of Douglas Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron RAAF took part in operations against the communist guerrillas (labelled as \"Communist Terrorists\" by the British authorities) as part of the RAF Far East Air Force. The Dakotas were used on cargo runs, in troop movement and in paratrooper and leaflet drops within Malaya. The Lincolns, operating from bases in Singapore and from Kuala Lumpur, formed the backbone of the air war against the CTs, conducting bombing missions against their jungle bases. Although results were often difficult to assess, they allowed the government to harass CT forces, attack their base camps when identified and keep them on the move. Later, in 1958, Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF were deployed to Malaya and took part in bombing missions against the CTs.\nDuring the Vietnam War, from 1964 to 1972, the RAAF contributed Caribou STOL transport aircraft as part of the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam, later redesignated No. 35 Squadron RAAF, UH-1 Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron RAAF, and English Electric Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF. The Canberras flew 11,963 bombing sorties, and two aircraft were lost. One went missing during a bombing raid. The wreckage of the aircraft was recovered in April 2009, and the remains of the crew were found in late July 2009. The other was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, although both crew were rescued. They dropped 76,389 bombs and were credited with 786 enemy personnel confirmed killed and a further 3,390 estimated killed, 8,637 structures, 15,568 bunkers, 1,267 sampans and 74 bridges destroyed. RAAF transport aircraft also supported anti-communist ground forces. The UH-1 helicopters were used in many roles including medical evacuation and close air support. RAAF casualties in Vietnam included six killed in action, eight non-battle fatalities, 30 wounded in action and 30 injured. A small number of RAAF pilots also served in United States Air Force units, flying F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers or serving as forward air controllers.\nIn September 1975, a group of 44 civilians, including armed supporters of the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT), commandeered an RAAF Caribou, \"A4-140\", on the ground at Baucau Airport in the then Portuguese Timor, which was in the middle of a civil war. The Caribou had landed at Baucau on a humanitarian mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross. The civilians demanded that the RAAF crew members fly them to Darwin Airport (also RAAF Base Darwin) in Australia, which they did. After the Caribou arrived there, the Australian government detained the civilians for a short period, and then granted refugee visas to all of them. \"The Guardian\" later described \"A4-140\" as \"the only RAAF plane ever hijacked\", and the incident as \"one of the more remarkable stories in Australia's military and immigration history\".\nRecent history (1990\u2013present).\nMilitary airlifts were conducted for a number of purposes in subsequent decades, such as the peacekeeping operations in East Timor from 1999. Australia's combat aircraft were not used again in combat until the Iraq War in 2003, when 14 F/A-18s from No. 75 Squadron RAAF operated in the escort and ground attack roles, flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser-guided bombs. A detachment of AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft were deployed in the Middle East between 2003 and 2012. These aircraft conducted maritime surveillance patrols over the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea in support of Coalition warships and boarding parties, as well as conducting extensive overland flights of Iraq and Afghanistan on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and supporting counter-piracy operations in Somalia.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, a detachment of No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit RAAF was on active service at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan.\nApproximately 75 personnel deployed with the AN/TPS-77 radar assigned the responsibility to co-ordinate coalition air operations. A detachment of IAI Heron unmanned aerial vehicles was deployed in Afghanistan from January 2010 until November 2014.\nIn late September 2014, an Air Task Group consisting of up to eight F/A-18F Super Hornets, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control aircraft and 400 personnel was deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Operations began on 1 October. A number of C-17 and C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft based in the Middle East have also been used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid and to airlift arms and munitions since August.\nIn June 2017, two RAAF AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft were deployed to the southern Philippines in response to the Marawi crisis.\nIn 2021, the Royal Australian Air Force commemorated its 100th anniversary. Later that year, on 29 November, the Hornet was officially retired from RAAF service, with a ceremony to mark the occasion taking place that day at RAAF Base Williamtown.\nIn January 2022, two RAAF P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and one C-130J Hercules departed RAAF Amberley and Richmond to conduct aerial reconnaissance of Tonga in the wake of the 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami. According to Australian Defence News, the flights were to \"help determine the extent of the damage [to Tongan infrastructure]\u2026 and inform future disaster support requests.\"\nIn October 2023, the Australian Government announced that, in addition to a further round of A$31.6 million for military assistance for Ukraine, it would be sending a single E-7A Wedgetail. This aircraft, and the associated 100 personnel - mainly from 2 Squadron, would operate from Ramstein Air Base for a six month deployment under Operation Kudu. The stated objective of the deployment was to \"help ensure that vital support flowing to Ukraine by the international community is protected.\"\nPersonnel.\nStrength.\nAs of June 2018, the RAAF had 14,313 permanent full-time personnel and 5,499 part-time active reserve personnel.\nWomen.\nThe RAAF established the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) in March 1941, which then became the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF) in 1951. The service merged with the RAAF in 1977; however, all women in the Australian military were barred from combat-related roles until 1990. Women have been eligible for flying roles in the RAAF since 1987, with the RAAF's first women pilots awarded their \"wings\" in 1988. In 2016, the remaining restrictions on women in frontline combat roles were removed, and the first two female RAAF fast jet fighter pilots graduated in December 2017. Air Force has implemented several programs to assist women who choose a pilot career. Entry to the Graduate Pilot Scheme is open to women who are currently undertaking a Bachelor of Aviation (BAv). Once qualified, women pilots are able to access the Flying Females Mentoring Network. Men and women are required to undergo the same basic fitness tests to become a pilot; however the standards are lower for females. For some roles, the requirement cannot be adjusted for safety reasons.\nRanks.\nThe rank structure of the nascent RAAF was established to ensure that the service remained separate from the Army and Navy. The service's predecessors, the AFC and the AAC, had used the Army's rank structure. In November 1920 it was decided by the Air Board that the RAAF would adopt the structure adopted by the RAF the previous year. As a result, the RAAF's rank structure came to be: Aircraftman, Leading Aircraftman, Corporal, Sergeant, Flight Sergeant, Warrant Officer, Officer Cadet, Pilot Officer, Flying Officer, Flight Lieutenant, Squadron Leader, Wing Commander, Group Captain, Air Commodore, Air Vice-Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Chief Marshal, and Marshal of the RAAF.\nUniforms.\nIn 1922, the colour of the RAAF winter uniform was determined by Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams on a visit to the Geelong Wool Mill. He asked for one dye dip fewer than the RAN blue (three indigo dips rather than four). There was a change to a lighter blue-grey when an all-seasons uniform was introduced in 1972 by Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Colin Hannah. The original colour and style were re-adopted from 1 January 2000 under direction from the then CAF Air Marshal Errol McCormack. Slip-on rank epaulettes, known as \"Soft Rank Insignia\" (SRI), displaying the word are worn on the shoulders of the service dress uniform. When not in the service dress or \"ceremonial\" uniform, RAAF personnel wear the General Purpose Uniform (GPU) as a working dress, which is a blue version of the Australian Multicam Camouflage Uniform.\nRoundel and badge.\nOriginally, the air force used the red, white and blue roundel of the RAF. However, during the Second World War the inner red circle, which was visually similar to the Japanese \"hinomaru\", was removed after a No. 11 Squadron Catalina was mistaken for a Japanese aircraft and attacked by a Grumman Wildcat of VMF-212 of the United States Marine Corps on 27 June 1942. After the war, a range of options for the RAAF roundel was proposed, including the Southern Cross, a boomerang, a sprig of wattle, and a red kangaroo. On 2 July 1956, the current version of the roundel was formally adopted. This consists of a white inner circle with a red kangaroo surrounded by a royal blue circle. The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face forward. Low visibility versions of the roundel exist, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey.\nThe RAAF badge was accepted by the Chester Herald in 1939. The badge is composed of the St Edward's Crown (the Tudor Crown before 1955) mounted on a circle featuring the words Royal Australian Air Force, beneath which scroll work displays the Latin motto \"Per Ardua Ad Astra\", which it shares with the Royal Air Force. Surmounting the badge is a wedge-tailed eagle. \"Per Ardua Ad Astra\" is attributed with the meaning \"Through Adversity to the Stars\" and is from Sir Henry Rider Haggard's novel \"The People of the Mist\". Due to the change in the crown used in King Charles III's cypher, a new version of the badge came into effect from 1 August 2025.\nMusic.\nThe \"Eagles of Australia\" is the official march of the RAAF and is played as a quick march when the RAAF bands perform public duties in the capital. Composed by the RAAF's Director of Music, Squadron Leader Ron Mitchell (who was also director of the Air Force Band), it was officially adopted as the RAAF's new march music on 23 March 1983, replacing the Royal Air Force March Past, which had long been the RAAF's march as well as the marchpast of other Commonwealth air forces. Subsequently, journalist Frank Cranston wrote lyrics to the march and a musical score was produced by September of the following year.\nRoulettes.\nThe Roulettes are the RAAF's formation aerobatic display team. They perform around Australia and Southeast Asia, and are part of the RAAF Central Flying School (CFS) based at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. The Roulettes operate the Pilatus PC-21 and formations for shows are a group of six aircraft. The pilots learn many formations including loops, rolls, corkscrews and ripple rolls. Most of the performances are done at a low altitude of .\nFuture procurement.\nThis list includes aircraft on order or a requirement which has been identified:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26329", "revid": "28564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26329", "title": "Responsible government", "text": "Concept of parliamentary democracy\nResponsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is usually responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more representative than the upper house, as it usually has more members and they are always directly elected.\nResponsible government and the principle of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Firstly, ministers must account to parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in parliament means that ministers must have the privileges of the floor, which are only granted to those who are members of parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must ordinarily immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.\nLastly, the head of state is in turn required to effectuate their executive power only through these responsible ministers. They must never attempt to set up a shadow government of executives or advisors and attempt to use them as instruments of government, or to rely upon their unofficial advice. They generally are not permitted to take any action under the color of their executive power without that action being as a result of the counsel and advisement of their responsible ministers. Common exceptions to this rule include emergency or wartime acts of necessity and the granting of certain state honours. Their ministers are required to counsel them (i.e., explain to them and be sure they understand any issue that they will be called upon to decide) and to form and have recommendations for them (i.e., their advice or advisement) to choose from, which are the ministers' formal, reasoned recommendations as to what course of action should be taken.\nHistory in the British Empire and Commonwealth.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century, the United Kingdom began to introduce systems of responsible government to the colonial governments of its settler colonies including in Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. These systems were strongly based upon the system that had historically developed in the United Kingdom, with a bicameral legislature and an executive responsible to the Lower House.\nCanada.\nResponsible government was implemented in several colonies of British North America (present day Canada), between 1848 and 1850, with the executive council formulating policy with the assistance of the legislative branch, which voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacting those policies that the legislature had approved. This replaced the previous system, whereby the governor took advice from an executive council and used the legislature chiefly to raise money.\nUnder responsible government, the executive is also a part of the legislature. The Executive branch must consist of MPs.\nResponsible government was a major element of Canada's gradual development toward independence. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with self-government than with parliamentary accountability; hence, there is the notion that the Dominion of Newfoundland \"gave up responsible government\" when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933, as a result of financial problems. It did not regain responsible government until it became a province of Canada in 1949.\nBackground.\nFollowing the formation of elected legislative assemblies, starting with Nova Scotia in 1758, governors and their executive councils did not require the consent of elected legislators in order to carry out all their roles. It was only in the decades leading up to Canadian Confederation in 1867 that the governing councils of those British North American colonies became responsible to the elected representatives of the people. In the aftermath of the American Revolution, sparked by the perceived shortcomings of virtual representation, the British government became more sensitive to unrest in its remaining colonies with large populations of European-descended colonists. Elected assemblies were introduced to both Upper Canada and Lower Canada with the Constitutional Act 1791. Many reformers thought that these assemblies should have some control over the executive power, leading to political unrest between the governors and assemblies in both Upper and Lower Canada. The Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Sir Francis Bond Head, wrote in one dispatch to London that, if responsible government were implemented, \"democracy, in the worst possible form, will prevail in our colonies.\"\nAfter the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838 in the Canadas, the Earl of Durham was appointed governor general of British North America, with the task of examining the issues and determining how to defuse tensions. In his report, one of his recommendations was colonies that were developed enough should be granted \"responsible government\". This term specifically meant the policy that British-appointed governors should bow to the will of elected colonial assemblies.\nImplementation.\nThe first instance of responsible government in the British Empire outside of the United Kingdom itself was achieved by the colony of Nova Scotia in January and February 1848, through the efforts of Joseph Howe. Howe's push for responsible government was inspired by the work of Thomas McCulloch and Jotham Blanchard almost two decades earlier. The plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly reads:\nFirst Responsible Government in the British Empire.&lt;br&gt;\nThe first executive council chosen exclusively from the party having a majority in the representative branch of a colonial legislature was formed in Nova Scotia on 2 February 1848. Following a vote of want of confidence in the preceding council, James Boyle Uniacke, who had moved the resolution, became attorney general and leader of the government. Joseph Howe, the long-time campaigner for this \"peaceable revolution\", became provincial secretary. Other members of the council were Hugh Bell, Wm.F. Desbarres, Lawrence O.C. Doyle, Herbert Huntingdon, James McNab, Michael Tobin, and George R. Young.\nThe colony of New Brunswick soon followed in May 1848, when lieutenant governor Edmund Walker Head brought in a more balanced representation of members of the Legislative Assembly to the Executive Council and ceded more powers to that body.\nIn the Province of Canada, responsible government was introduced when the governor general, Lord Elgin, swore in the ministry of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin on 11 March 1848. It was put to the test in the following year, when Reformers in the legislature passed the Rebellion Losses Bill, which provided compensation to French-Canadians who suffered losses during the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838. Elgin had serious misgivings about the bill, but, nonetheless assented to it, despite demands from the Tories that he refuse to do so. Elgin was physically assaulted by an English-speaking mob for this and the parliament building in Montreal was burned to the ground in the ensuing riots. Nonetheless, the Rebellion Losses Bill helped entrench responsible government into Canadian politics.\nIn time, the granting of responsible government became the first step on the road to complete independence. Canada gradually gained greater autonomy through inter imperial and Commonwealth diplomacy, including the British North America Act, 1867; the Statute of Westminster, 1931; and the patriation of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nPrior to European colonisation, the Australian continent was inhabited by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples, who had their own traditional forms of self-government. They were divided into various nations and clans and, in some cases, large alliances between several nations. In 1770, Royal Navy officer James Cook sailed along the east coast of Australia and claimed it for King George III. Nearly two decades later, in 1788 the First Fleet led by Arthur Phillip established the first permanent European settlement in Australia at Port Jackson. The settlers gradually expanded across the continent, displacing the indigenous population, until they had established six colonies; the legal system of these colonies were based on the common law system.\nAt first, the Australian colonies were run by autocratic governors. They were appointed by the British monarch, but in practice the governors exercised vast executive and legislative powers with very little oversight. Several factors influenced this: most of these early colonies were penal colonies, they were at a great distance from the United Kingdom and communication was slow. In addition the continent was of enormous size and the Australian colonies were largely unexplored by Europeans and sparsely settled by them.\nIn 1808 a military coup d'\u00e9tat known as the Rum Rebellion deposed Governor Bligh and briefly established military rule over the Colony of New South Wales until a new Governor (Lachlan Macquarie) was appointed and sent from Britain. This did not aid in establishing responsible or representative government.\nThe early colonists, coming mostly from the United Kingdom (which by 1801 included Ireland), were familiar with the Westminster system and made efforts to reform local government in order to increase the opportunity for ordinary men to participate. The Governors and London therefore set in motion a gradual process of establishing a Westminster system in the colonies. They did not want to get ahead of population or economic growth, nor be so slow as to provoke clamouring for revolutionary change as had happened in the American Revolutionary War and was threatened in the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838 in Canada. The government first established appointed or partially elected Legislative Councils. William Wentworth among other prominent colonists in this time advocated for the introduction of responsible government in the Australian colonies.\nViolence erupted in the Colony of Victoria during the 1850s, where there was growing political discontent and civil disobedience among the common men, especially in the inland gold fields areas. This culminated in the 1854 Eureka Rebellion near Ballarat. 190 miners armed themselves, erected a stockade, and raised the Southern Cross Flag. They demanded an end to taxation (via an expensive miner's license) without representation, the right to vote in colonial elections, and colonial maintenance and upkeep of the area's roads.\nThe British colonial forces overran the stockade, capturing or killing dozens of miners and bringing many to Melbourne for trial. However, mass public support led to the miners' release. Within a year, most of their demands had been met, including responsible self-government and universal male suffrage for the Colony of Victoria.\nThe Eureka Rebellion and events in Victoria resonated around the Australian colonies, which had their own regional agitators for change. South Australia was quick to pass universal male suffrage, and Victoria and New South Wales followed soon after. By the end of the 1850s, all the Australian colonies and New Zealand had achieved responsible self-government. Only Western Australia took until 1890 to achieve this.\nThe Northern Territory was originally part of South Australia, but transferred to the Australian Commonwealth Government in 1911. It then \"lost\" responsible self-government (although residents could still vote in federal elections) and did not gain it back until 1974. Likewise, the Australian Capital Territory was originally part of New South Wales. It was transferred to the Commonwealth Government in 1911 and lost responsible self-government until 1989.\nParticipation by women and indigenous people.\nWhite female suffrage was gained from the 1890s to the 1910s in Australia and New Zealand (1893), allowing the other half of the ethnic European population to participate in responsible representative government.\nIn New Zealand, the indigenous Maori became British subjects following the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.\nIn Australia during the colonial period, some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people may have theoretically had the right to vote in colonial elections. But, in practice they were usually unable to exercise this right: they lived traditional lifestyles in remote areas uncontacted by the colony, or affected by the disruption of the Frontier Wars. In addition, they often were excluded from voting by racial discrimination in practices or by property requirements.\nAfter federation, the Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902 barred Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from voting in federal elections unless they were already eligible to vote in their state. Queensland explicitly barred Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from voting until the 1960s, while Western Australia barred Aboriginal people unless they successfully applied to become citizens. As a result, most Aboriginal people across the country were prevented from voting, including those who in theory had the right. Later, the 1962 Commonwealth Electoral Act gave all Aboriginal people the option to enroll to vote, but still most were not able to exercise their rights.\nAfter passage of the 1967 Australian referendum, the federal government was allowed to count Indigenous Australians in the census, and to ensure that their voting rights were respected across the country.\nCape Colony.\nThe Cape Colony, in Southern Africa, was under responsible self-government from 1872 until 1910 when it became the Cape Province of the new Union of South Africa.\nUnder its previous system of representative government, the Ministers of the Cape Government reported directly to the British Imperial Governor, and not to the locally elected representatives in the Cape Parliament. Among Cape citizens of all races, growing anger at their powerlessness in influencing unpopular imperial decisions had repeatedly led to protests and rowdy political meetings \u2013 especially during the early \"Convict Crisis\" of 1849 to 1850.\nA popular political movement for responsible government soon emerged, under local leader John Molteno. A protracted struggle was then conducted over the ensuing years as the movement (known informally as \"the responsibles\") grew increasingly powerful, and used their parliamentary majority to put pressure on the British Governor, withholding public finances from him, and conducting public agitations. Not everyone favoured responsible government though, and pro-imperial press outlets even accused the movement of constituting \"crafts and assaults of the devil\".\nSupporters believed that the most effective means of instituting responsible government was simply to change the section of the constitution which prevented government officials from being elected to parliament or members of parliament from serving in executive positions. The conflict therefore centred on the changing of this specific section. \"Although responsible government merely required an amendment to s.79 of the constitution, it transpired only after nearly twenty years in 1872 when the so-called 'responsibles' under Molteno were able to command sufficient support in both houses to secure the passage of the necessary bill.\" Finally, with a parliamentary majority and with the Colonial Office and new Governor Henry Barkly won over, Molteno instituted responsible government, making the Ministers directly responsible to the Cape Parliament, and becoming the Cape's first Prime Minister.\nThe ensuing period saw an economic recovery, a massive growth in exports and an expansion of the colony's frontiers. Despite political complications that arose from time to time (such as an ill-fated scheme by the British Colonial Office to enforce a confederation in Southern Africa in 1878, and tensions with the Afrikaner-dominated Government of Transvaal over trade and railroad construction), economic and social progress in the Cape Colony continued at a steady pace until a renewed attempt to extend British control over the hinterland caused the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer Wars in 1899.\nAn important feature of the Cape Colony under responsible government was that it was the only state in southern Africa (and one of very few in the world at the time) to have a non-racial system of voting.\nLater however \u2013 following the South Africa Act 1909 to form the Union of South Africa \u2013 this multi-racial universal suffrage was steadily eroded, and eventually abolished by the Apartheid government in 1948.\nFormer British colonies with responsible government.\nThe following is a list of British colonies, and the year when responsible government was established in the territory:\nIn German history.\nIn the early 1860s, the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck was involved in a bitter dispute with the Liberals, who sought to institute a system of responsible government modeled on that of Britain. Bismarck, who strongly opposed that demand, managed to deflect the pressure by embarking energetically and successfully on the unification of Germany. The Liberals, who were also strong German nationalists, backed Bismarck's unification efforts and tacitly accepted that the Constitution of Imperial Germany, crafted by Bismarck, did not include a responsible government \u2013 the Chancellor being accountable solely to the emperor and needing no parliamentary confidence. Germany gained a responsible government only with the Weimar Republic and more securely with the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany. Historians account the lack of responsible government in the formative decades of united Germany as one of the factors contributing to the prolonged weakness of German democratic institutions, lasting also after such a government was finally instituted.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is urbanization seen from the rural perspective.\nIn industrializing economies like Britain in the eighteenth century or East Asia in the twentieth century, it can occur following the industrialization of primary industries such as agriculture, mining, fishing, and forestry\u2014when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of output to market\u2014and related secondary industries (refining and processing) are consolidated. Rural exodus can also follow an ecological or human-caused catastrophe such as a famine or resource depletion. These are examples of push factors.\nPeople can also move into town to seek higher wages, educational access and other urban amenities; examples of pull factors.\nOnce rural populations fall below a critical mass, the population is too small to support certain businesses, which then also leave or close, in a vicious circle. Services to smaller and more dispersed populations may be proportionately more expensive, which can lead to closures of offices and services, which further harm the rural economy. Schools are the archetypal example because they influence the decisions of parents of young children: a village or region without a school will typically lose families to larger towns that have one. But the concept (urban hierarchy) can be applied more generally to many services and is explained by central place theory.\nGovernment policies to combat rural flight include campaigns to expand services to the countryside, such as electrification or distance education. Governments can also use restrictions like internal passports to make rural flight illegal. Economic conditions that can counter rural depopulation include commodities booms, the expansion of outdoor-focused tourism, and a shift to remote work, or exurbanization. To some extent, governments generally seek only to manage rural flight and channel it into certain cities, rather than stop it outright as this would imply taking on the expensive task of building airports, railways, hospitals, and universities in places with few users to support them, while neglecting growing urban and suburban areas.\nHistorical trends.\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution, rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. Ancient Athens and Rome, scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000.\nThe onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of these checks. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers arose, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the start of rural flight on a massive scale. This was often helped along by periodic agricultural recessions. The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925. While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in Western Europe and the United States, as industrialization spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and urbanization followed quickly behind. In the early twenty-first century, rural flight was especially distinctive phenomenon in China and sub-Saharan Africa.\nMechanization and ecology: case study of the Dust Bowl in 1930s North America.\nThe shift from mixed subsistence farming to commodity crops and livestock began in the late 19th century. New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as steel plows, mechanical reapers, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production. The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions. Most homesteaders had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.\nDuring the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the 1930s, large numbers of people fled rural areas of the Great Plains and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high debt loads exacerbated by several years of drought and large dust storms. Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, as in John Steinbeck's novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939), in which a family from the Great Plains migrates to California, fleeing the Dust Bowl.\nSince World War II.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Women leave in greater numbers than men. There is a glass ceiling for women everywhere, but in rural areas it tends to be made of thick steel.\" \"Hiroya Masuda, author of Japanese report on rural depopulation.\"\nPost-World War II rural flight has been caused primarily by the spread of industrialized agriculture. Small, labor-intensive family farms have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms. While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products\u2014all requiring substantial labor\u2014large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, Iowa State University reports the number of hog farmers in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.\nThe consolidation of the feed, seed, processed grain, and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.\nAbandonment of small towns.\nThe rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.\nSince the 1990s, China has merged schools into more centralized village-, town-, or county-level schools in rural areas to address some of these very problems.\nReasons for leaving.\nAs with other human migration, various push and pull factors contribute to rural flight: lower levels of (perceived) economic opportunity in rural communities versus urban ones, lower levels of government investment in rural communities, greater education opportunities in cities, marriages, increased social acceptance in urban areas, and higher levels of rural fertility.\nEconomic motives.\nSome migrants choose to leave rural communities to pursue economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the Harris-Todaro Model, migration to urban areas will continue as long as \"expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product\" (127). However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level. This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as overurbanization. With the rise of industrial agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs in rural communities. \nSome scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor. At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates. The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as chain migration, migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.\nSome families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.\nPoorer people face severe challenges in the agricultural sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in Cambodia and Ethiopia. This has led to the loss of farmland, range land, woodlands and water sources from local communities. Large-scale agricultural projects funded by FDI only employed a few experts specialized in the relevant new technologies.\nSocial motives.\nIn other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants. A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions. \nRural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity. With the stagnation of the rural economy and encouragement from their parents, rural youth may choose to migrate to cities out of social norms \u2013 demonstrating leadership and self-respect. With this societal encouragement combined with depressed rural economies, rural youth form a large proportion of the migrants moving to urban areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. \nLastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West. It is estimated that as many as one out of every four residents in the Plains States left during the 1930s. More recently, drought in Syria from 2006 to 2011 has prompted a rural exodus to major urban centers. Massive influxes in urban areas, combined with difficult living conditions, have prompted some scholars to link the drought to the arrival of the Arab Spring in Syria.\nExamples.\nUnited States and Canada.\nThe terms are used in the United States and Canada to describe the flight of people from rural areas in the Great Plains and Midwest regions, and to a lesser extent rural areas of the northeast and southeast and Appalachia. It is also particularly noticeable in parts of Atlantic Canada (especially Newfoundland), since the collapse of Atlantic cod fishing fields in 1992.\nRural counties in the United States make up about 70 percent of the nation's land mass. Historically, population increase from births in rural areas more than compensated for the number of people moving from rural areas to urban areas, but from 2010 to 2016, rural areas lost population in absolute numbers for the first time.\nChina.\nChina, like many other currently industrializing countries, has had a relatively late start to rural flight. Until 1983, the Chinese government, through the hukou system, greatly restricted the ability of their citizens to internally migrate. Since 1983, the Chinese government has progressively lifted the restrictions on internal migration. This has led to a great increase in the number of people migrating to urban areas. However, even today, the hukou system limits the ability of rural migrants to receive full access to urban social services at the urban subsidized costs. As with most examples of rural flight, several factors have led towards China's massive urbanization. Income disparity, family pressure, surplus labor in rural areas due to higher average fertility rates, and improved living conditions all play a role in contributing to the flows of migrants from rural to urban areas. In 2014, approximately 250 million rural migrants lived in cities with 54% of the total Chinese population living in urban areas.\nEngland and Wales.\nA focus by landowners on efficient production led to the enclosure of the commons in the 16th and 17th centuries. This created unrest in rural areas as tenants were then unable to graze their livestock. They sometimes resorted to illegal means to support their families. This was followed, in turn, by penal transportation which sent offenders out of the country, often Australia. Eventually, economic measures produced the British Agricultural Revolution.\nGermany.\nMiddle Ages.\nRural flight has been occurring to some degree in Germany since the 11th century. A corresponding principle of German law is \"Stadtluft macht frei\" (\"city air makes you free\"), in longer form \"Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag\" (\"city air makes you free after a year and a day\"): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a serf who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.\nGerman \"Landflucht\".\n\"Landflucht\" (\"flight from the land\") refers to the mass migration of peasants into the cities that occurred in Germany (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.\nIn 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%. In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Posen, Silesia, and Pomerania lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities, where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class; One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.\n\"Landflucht\" resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture. Mechanized agriculture and migrant workers, particularly Poles from the east (Sachseng\u00e4nger), became more common. This was especially true in the province of Posen that was gained by Prussia when Poland was partitioned. The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the \"Polish corridor\" after World War I and the absorption of the land east of the Oder-Neisse line into Poland after World War II. Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as game preserves.\nThe word \"Landflucht\" has negative connotations in German, as it was coined by agricultural employers, often of the German aristocracy, who were lamenting their labor shortages.\nScotland.\nThe rural exodus of Scotland followed that of England, but delayed by several centuries. Consolidation of farms and elimination of inefficient tenants occurred over about 110 years from the 18th to the 19th centuries. Samuel Johnson encountered this in 1773 and documented it in his work \"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland.\" He deplored the exodus but did not have the information to analyze the problem.\nSweden.\nRural flight and out-migration in Sweden can be traced in two distinct waves. The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.\nThe second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly \"pull factors\" due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden's GDP per capita increased from US$850 to US$6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.\nRussia and the former Soviet states.\nRural flight began later for the former states of the USSR than in Western Europe. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas. Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid urbanization of the USSR. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while that of urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change. Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district. Rural flight persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the end of the Soviet Union, rural flight reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.\nRural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and the Ukraine experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like Central Asia, experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.\nRural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas. In particular, the Soviet \"kolkhoz\" system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the kolkhoz system replaced family farms throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to inflation, Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life. While Brezhnev's wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.\nAlthough migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.\nMexico.\nRural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.\nIn the 1930s, President Cardenas implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940 to 1965 as the \"Golden Era for Mexican Migration.\" During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in Mexico City demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for migration to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.\nHowever, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs. This regulation severely undercut the market price of maize lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the Green Revolution had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of Norman Borlaug, farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre. Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the maize price regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates. A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population. The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.\nConsequences of rural flight.\nRural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.\nAdditionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.\nWomen, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With this technology, Earth developed robotic technologies, such as transformable mecha, to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions.\nName origin.\nPrior to the release of the TV series, the name \"Robotech\" was used by model kit manufacturer Revell on their \"Robotech Defenders\" line in the mid-1980s. The line consisted of mecha model kits imported from Japan and featured in anime titles such as \"Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" (1982), \"Super Dimension Century Orguss\" (1983), and \"Fang of the Sun Dougram\" (1981). The kits were originally intended to be a marketing tie-in to a similarly named comic book series by DC Comics, which ran for only two issues.\nAt the same time, Harmony Gold licensed the \"Macross\" TV series for direct-to-video distribution in 1984, but their merchandising plans were compromised by Revell's prior distribution of the \"Macross\" kits. In the end, both parties signed a co-licensing agreement and the \"Robotech\" name was adopted for the TV syndication of \"Macross\" combined with \"Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\" (1984) and \"Genesis Climber MOSPEADA\" (1983).\nFictional chronology.\nThe \"Robotech\" chronology, according to Harmony Gold, is illustrated below:\nIn 2002, with the publication of the WildStorm (DC) comics, Harmony Gold officially decided to retcon the \"Robotech\" Universe. The following \"Robotech\" material is now relegated to the status of secondary continuity:\nWhile these materials are not precisely 'retired' or 'removed' from the continuity, their events are subject to critical review, and are strictly subordinate to the 'official' events of the 85-episode animated series.\nTelevision and film.\nThe original television series.\n\"Robotech\" (1985) is an original story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different mecha anime series:\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market \"Macross\" for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). \"Macross\" and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. On some television stations, the syndicated run was preceded by the broadcast premiere of \"\", a feature-length pilot.\nThis combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations, as mankind must fight three destructive 'Robotech Wars' in succession with various invading forces, each of which is motivated in one way or another by a desire for a powerful energy source called 'protoculture'. While each of the three animated series used for its footage informs its content, the Robotech storyline is distinct and separate from each of them.\n\"Robotech: The Movie\".\n\"Robotech: The Movie\", also called \"Robotech: The Untold Story\", is a feature film and was the first new \"Robotech\" adventure created after the premiere of the original series. It uses footage from the \"Megazone 23 \u2013 Part 1\" OVA (original video animation; made-for-video animated feature) combined with scenes from \"Southern Cross\" and additional original animation produced for the film.\nThe original plan for the film was to have it set during the Macross Saga, parallel to the SDF-1's return to Earth from Pluto. The film would also have served as a prequel to the Sentinels, as both projects were initially meant to share many characters. Harmony Gold producer Carl Macek worked with the OVA's original creators to make the story and the new ending work. The film had to be changed again after the distributor of the film, Cannon Films, saw an incomplete rough cut of the film and were upset by it. They ordered Macek to remove multiple scenes from the film and to add more violence (most of the scenes removed were scenes setting up characters and showing female characters interacting). Macek reluctantly did what they ordered, and created a new script and rough edit for the film in less than 24 hours. When the distributors saw Macek act out the new film, they were much more pleased with the new cut. The opening night in Texas received a positive response, but Cannon Films pulled out after noting that most attendants were adults; the bulk of the scheduled advertising for the series was targeted to children. The film had limited success in Argentina and Belgium.\nIn 2011, A&amp;E Home Video released, as a part of their \"Robotech: The Complete Series\" collection, a 29-minute version of \"Robotech: The Movie\" containing only footage used from \"Southern Cross\". There was no attempt to remaster the footage.\n\"Robotech II: The Sentinels\".\nThis aborted American-produced series would have followed the continuing adventures of Rick and Lisa Hunter and the Robotech Expedition during the events of \"The Masters\" and \"The New Generation\". The feature-length pilot is composed of the first three (and only) episodes that were produced. \"The Sentinels\" featured characters from all three \"Robotech\" sagas and introduced the SDF-3 along with an overview of their new mission. The series was planned to have a total of 65 episodes.\nIn \"Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels\", Carl Macek blamed the cancellation of the series on the crash of the Yen/Dollar exchange rate, which caused toy partner Matchbox to withdraw from the project. Harmony Gold lacked the funds to produce the series on its own, and production ceased after only three episodes.\n\"Robotech II: The Sentinels\" was released on VHS by Palladium Books. In 2011, a \"remastered\" version was released on the A&amp;E DVD set, \"Robotech: The Complete Original Series\" DVD. This version has opening titles resembling those found on the \"Robotech Remastered\" DVDs, as well as a new ending with text explaining the fate of the SDF-3. Also, all of the flashback footage used from \"The Macross Saga\" has been removed, including the re-used footage from the episode \"Wedding Bells\".\n\"Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles\".\nIn 2002, Tommy Yune announced development of a new animated sequel. Originally announced as a television series with a planned 2004 release date, the project was revealed at Anime Expo 2004 as a feature-length film titled \"Robotech: Shadow Force\". The storyline overlaps with and continues from the unresolved ending of the original series. The title of the story arc was soon changed to \"\". The first trailers with finished animation were shown at Anime Expo and Comic-Con International in 2005. It was not until February 2006, when Kevin McKeever, operations coordinator at Harmony Gold, https:// that the pilot movie had been completed. After a series of delays, FUNimation Entertainment was finally announced as the home video, broadcast, and theatrical distributor at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego with the possibility of producing further sequels. Harmony Gold premiered the movie at various film festivals in 2006, and it was first seen by a public audience at MechaCon on August 9, 2006, where it was showcased as a charity screening to help raise funds for the ongoing Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita recovery effort. A limited theatrical run followed in January 2007, and the film was released on DVD on February 6, 2007. A two-disc collector's edition was released in November 2007.\n\"Robotech: Love Live Alive\".\nFirst revealed in late 2011 in the final minutes of \"Carl Macek's Robotech Universe\", a documentary on the making of \"Robotech\" dedicated to the then-recent passing of Macek, \"Love Live Alive\" is an adaptation of the 1985 \"Genesis Climber Mospeada\" OVA, \"Love Live Alive\", incorporating some brand-new animation. The film was released on DVD on July 23, 2013, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in North America.\nOther television and film productions.\n\"Robotech Wars\".\nThis promotional VHS tape created by Matchbox was included with their \"Robotech Wars\" playset. This video includes two episodes cobbled together from clips of \"The Macross Saga\". Titled \"To the End of the Universe\" and \"Battle Royale\", these episodes contain no new footage, and are not meant to follow any continuity established in the TV series.\n\"Robotech III\", \"Robotech IV\" and \"Robotech V\".\nDuring the production of \"Robotech II: The Sentinels\", Carl Macek had already begun to plot out 13 weeks of a third series title \"Robotech III: The Odyssey\", which would have raised the total number or Robotech episodes 215 had both series been produced. He envisioned two additional series (\"Robotech IV\" and \"Robotech V\") to bring the total number of episodes to around 300, one to air every weekday for over a year.\nFor \"Robotech III: The Odyssey,\" Macek stated that his plans were to create a time-travel loop, allowing the last episode of \"The Odyssey\" to lead directly into the first episode of \"The Macross Saga.\" This particular plot detail was eventually adapted into the Robotech novel \"The End of the Circle\" by Jack McKinney.\nIn 1986, fan publication \"Macross Life\" published an interview with Harmony Gold executive Richard Firth who first mentioned the \"Robotech IV\" and \"Robotech V\" series plans. Firth said the story would be about a retired Commodore character from \"The Macross Saga\" telling a story via flashback, but Macek later refuted that plot detail in a 2007 interview. Macek stated that while he was hoping to do up to five series, nothing was ever written for the final two.\n\"Robotech 3000\".\nMacek attempted another sequel with the development of \"Robotech 3000\". This all-CGI series would have been set a millennium in the future of the \"Robotech\" universe and feature none of the old series' characters. In the three-minute trailer, an expedition is sent to check on a non-responsive mining outpost and is attacked by \"infected\" Veritech mecha. The idea was abandoned midway into production after negative reception within the company, negative fan reactions at the FanimeCon anime convention in 2000, and financial difficulties within Netter Digital who was animating the show. During a 2000 San Diego Comic-Con panel, Macek announced the series was would be re-conceptualized as a traditional, hand-drawn animated series, however that idea was \"abandoned\" sometime prior to 2002 in favor of development of what would become \"Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles\". The trailer was hosted on the official \"Robotech\" website, and was included in the 2007 release of the \"Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles\" 2-disc collector's DVD, along with behind-the-scenes motion capture footage.\n\"Robotech: Mars Force\".\nIn October 2004, veteran animation writer and producer Greg Weisman revealed that he developed an animated spin-off series titled \"Robotech: Mars Force\". When asked about the project, Weisman said that he was under a non-disclosure agreement with Harmony Gold and was only allowed to mention that he developed the series.\nIn 2006, Harmony Gold Creative Director Tommy Yune elaborated on the project in the Space Station Liberty Podcast, saying that Mars Force was a series geared at younger audiences, following the children of the Robotech Expeditionary Force. A similar plot would later be used for the canceled 2014 spin-off, \"Robotech Academy\".\n\"Robotech UN Public Service Announcement\".\nA sixty-second public service announcement for the 60th anniversary of the United Nations, featuring Scott Bernard and Ariel, was animated during the production of \"The Shadow Chronicles\". Although it did not use the original voice actors and the dialogue was somewhat out-of-character, it nonetheless marked the first fully completed \"Robotech\" footage in many years.\n\"Robotech: Shadow Rising\".\nOn July 27, 2007, at their Comic-Con International panel, Harmony Gold and Yune unveiled the second entry of the \"Shadow Chronicles\" production, titled \"Robotech: Shadow Rising\" and was to be a co-production with FUNimation Entertainment. Pre-production reportedly began in February 2007 and a projected release date of sometime in 2009 was originally expected. In 2009 Harmony Gold revealed that production had not moved forward since the summer of 2007, due to the announced development deal of a live-action film deal with Warner Bros. in September 2007.\nAt Comic-Con 2012, Tommy Yune announced that \"Love Live Alive\" would pave the way for \"Shadow Rising\", and one year later announced at Anime Expo that they had resumed work on \"Shadow Rising.\" \nHarmony Gold's trademark of the term \"Shadow Rising\" was filed in 2007, extended in 2010, but abandoned since 2011.\n\"Robotech Academy\".\nOn July 5, 2014, Harmony Gold started a Kickstarter project for \"Robotech Academy\", which Macek had developed before he died. The goal of this project was to raise US$500,000 to produce a new 24-minute pilot episode. The crowdfunding project was to have closed on August 9, 2014; however, on August 2, the project was canceled with a pledge level of US$194,574, or 39% of its target. Harmony Gold, however, announced that further plans to fund the project were being explored. At the 2014 Long Beach Comic Con, it was announced that the producers at Harmony Gold were in talks with at least one new media network on the prospect of producing the show. As of December 7, 2015, the project remains abandoned.\nUnofficial and parody productions.\nIn the 1990s, Seishun Shitemasu, an anime fandubbing group, produced the parodies \"Robotech III: Not Necessarily the Sentinels\" and \"Robotech IV: Khyron's Counterattack\", using footage from, respectively, \"Gunbuster\" and \"\", continuing the tradition of the original Robotech's adaptation of unrelated anime series into a single continuity.\nOn July 2, 2010, Ecuadorian animator Patricio \"Pat\" Mosquera uploaded to YouTube a teaser for \"Robotech Skull Knights\". On August 17, 2010, second teaser revealed Rick Hunter standing in front of an image of the VF-4 shown in the final episodes of the original series. \"Robotech Skull Knights\" has not been released yet. In July 2013, Patricio Mosquera was included as an animation director in the staff list in the IMDb page of \"Love Live Alive\".\nOn December 31, 2012, Cesar Turturro uploaded to YouTube an Argentine fan trailer for \"Robotech Valkyrie Project\". In December 2013 the first episode was uploaded to YouTube, and in January 2014, the second episode was also uploaded. The series was cancelled after Harmony Gold issued a \"cease and desist\" letter to the producers. The team was, however, hired to do the CGI effects for \"Robotech: Academy\".\nProposed live-action film.\nAttempts at producing a live-action \"Robotech\" have been in development for an extended time, with numerous writers, directors, and actors attached at various times and the film rights changing between studios.\nSome time prior to February 2006, the company Kickstart Entertainment (founded by \"Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles\" and \"Robotech 3000\" producer Jason Netter) featured a graphic on their website stating that a live-action Robotech movie was in development with Chuck Russel attached to write and direct. While never formally announced by Harmony Gold, Kickstart Entertainment's announcement of this project was reported by Anime News Network on February 27, 2006. Anime News Network's article was updated on March 1, 2006 saying that this announcement had been removed.\nWarner Bros..\nOn September 7, 2007, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Warner Bros. had acquired the film rights to \"Robotech\", with Tobey Maguire producing and pursuing the lead role. A Harmony Gold representative stated that the company had been approached by WB and would have \"a say\" in the film's creative direction. Though S. Craig Zahler was initially announced to be writing the script, many other writers would be attached to the project across the following years: Lawrence Kasdan in June 2008, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar in November 2008, Tom Rob Smith in June 2009, and Michael B. Gordon in February 2015. A screenplay draft from March 2008 demonstrated a plot very loosely based on the \"Macross Saga\" portion of \"Robotech\". Nic Mathieu had been announced as director in early 2013.\nSony.\nOn March 25, 2015, the \"Robotech\" franchise was acquired by Sony Pictures; on July 3, 2015, Harmony Gold clarified that Sony has the rights to release the film worldwide with the exception of Japan. Sony featured a sizzle reel at CinemaCon 2016 with Robotech among its upcoming slate of films, which included a very brief title card. After Harmony Gold and Big West reached an agreement which was signed on March 1, 2021 regarding to the \"Macross\" and \"Robotech\" franchises, announced on April 8, 2021, Big West officially affirmed as part of the deal that they will not take any opposition on Harmony Gold's upcoming live action adaptation of \"Robotech\". Both Harmony Gold and Big West will cooperate on future projects for the foreseeable future.\nFor the Sony production, James Wan was announced in 2015 to direct a script written with Kurt Johnstad; Andy Muschietti took over the project in 2017 after Wan dropped out to direct \"Aquaman\", with Jason Fuchs writing the screenplay from scratch. On April 27, 2022, it was reported that \"Hawkeye\" producer and director Rhys Thomas will be directing the film, with duo Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing.\nIn June 2023, artist Col Price posted images on both social media and his official ArtStation page of concept art he was hired to create for the film. While only citing \"a few years ago\" as the time frame of which they were made, Price's images depict an adaptation of \"The Macross Saga\".\nIn June 2024, co-owner of the company \"In Development\" Ross Olivey posted to LinkedIn that the film was still in development with Sony Pictures Entertainment and its subsidiary Columbia Pictures. Olivey gave no details of the work his company provided, other than having created a presentation deck capturing Rhys Thomas' vision for the film and having worked for producer Michelle Stockwell of Thomas' production company.\nOther media.\nAt the time of its broadcast, Harmony Gold also launched \"Robotech\" through a popular line of comics to be followed by novels, role-playing games, toys, and other consumer products. With the cancellation of \"Robotech II: The Sentinels\", many of these licensed products were discontinued, and led to a drought of \"Robotech\" product through much of the 1990s, except for publishers who continued \"The Sentinels\" storyline in print.\nArt books.\nIn 1986, Starblaze Graphics published \"Robotech Art 1\", a reference book containing artwork, Japanese production designs, and episode guides from the original television series. This was followed by \"Robotech Art 2\", which was largely a collection of art by various American artists and fans. In 1988, Carl Macek collected much of the unused designs from \"Robotech II: The Sentinels\" into \"Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels\", which also included his story outline for the rest of the unfinished series, with an explanation behind its cancellation. In 2007, Stone Bridge Press published \"The Art of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles\".\nComics.\n\"Robotech\" comics were first published in 1984 with DC Comics' short-lived \"Robotech Defenders\" and Comico's adaptation of the first episode of the Japanese version of \"Macross\". However, the first adaptation of the \"Robotech\" television series did not arrive until 1985 with Comico's \"Robotech: The Macross Saga\" Number 2, which continued from the first \"Macross\" issue.\nThe various comic publishers include:\nCollectible card game.\nThe first \"Robotech\" collectible card game was released in 2006 by Hero Factory, which had previously produced \"Robotech\" trading cards.\nMusic and soundtracks.\nVarious \"Robotech\" soundtracks have been released on records, cassettes, and compact discs since 1988.\nNovelizations.\nSince 1987, \"Robotech\" was adapted into novel form by \"Jack McKinney\", a pseudonym for the team of James Luceno and Brian Daley, a pair of writers who had been working with Macek since they had collaborated on the animated series \"Galaxy Rangers\". Using fictitious epigraphs in the style of \"Dune\", McKinney's novels fleshed out the chronology (including adapting the incomplete \"Sentinels\" source material) in far greater detail than the original animation. Many \"Robotech\" fans consider the McKinney series to be an unofficial canon of its own, despite notable divergences in the writing from Harmony Gold's current official animation-based canon. Despite no longer being considered core-continuity by Harmony Gold, the novels have been recently re-issued by Del Rey Books as Omnibus compilations.\nRole-playing games.\nIn 1986, Palladium Books published a role-playing game based on the \"Robotech\" series, including several books covering the \"Sentinels\" portion of the storyline. The original \"Robotech\" RPG line went out of print as of June 30, 2001, but Harmony Gold and Palladium Books signed an agreement in 2007 to produce a new line of Robotech RPG books, beginning with a book covering and promoting the feature-length film \"The Shadow Chronicles\". The \"\" sourcebook first book was released on March 21, 2008, followed by sourcebooks covering the Macross, Masters, and New Generation chapters of Robotech (redrafted to reflect the Harmony Gold canon). Other sourcebooks and supplements are reflected in the Palladium Books production pipeline.\nOn April 18, 2013, Palladium started a campaign on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter for a tabletop miniatures game based on the Robotech RPG called \"Robotech: RPG Tactics\". The miniatures are being produced by Ninja Division (combining sculpting talents from Soda Pop Miniatures and Cipher Studios), and will feature multi part plastic miniatures that can be posed during assembly. The campaign reached its goal in 3 hours, and was initially scheduled to release in December 2013, but delays have persisted into 2018.\nIn May 2019, under licensing from Harmony Gold and Strange Machine Games, Battlefield Press International produced a game book for the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.\nToys.\nAction figures in the size of the three \"Robotech\" generations were initially released in 1985 by Matchbox toy company, but then reissued in 1992 by Harmony Gold (Lunk and Corg were only released by Matchbox and Lynn Minmei was only released by Harmony Gold). Each included a weapon and helmet where appropriate. Matchbox also released figures of Zentraedi characters from the first generation. These figures were supposed to represent the size difference between the Humans and the giant Zentraedi forces, but to be correct these figures would have to have been made about tall. None of the larger figures came with weapons but the Armored Zentraedi came with a removable helmet.\nAlso many toys depicting the vehicles and mecha from the series were released by Matchbox in 1985, Harmony Gold in 1992 and Playmates Toys in 1994 (under the Exosquad line). There were major differences in packaging, toy stickers and colors between the different releases. The vehicles were designed to be used only with the 3\u00be-inch figures. The SDF-1 Playset was only released under the Matchbox line in the 1980s and could be used with both the 3\u00be- and six-inch figures.\nHarmony Gold and Matchbox were unable to sell the 1/55 VF-1 Valkyrie toy originally sold in Japan by Takatoku Toys due to Hasbro licensing it as Jetfire in the Transformers toy line. Because of this, they settled with manufacturing a non-transformable Veritech Fighter that could fit any of the 3\u00be-inch action figures, as well as importing the transformable super deformed Veritech Fighters (originally manufactured in Japan by Bandai as \"Macross\" VF-1 Valkyrie \"Joke machines\").\nSince the late 1990s, there has been a resurgence of \"Robotech\"-related toys. In 2001, Toynami released the \"Robotech Masterpiece Collection\" line, featuring replicas of the Veritech Fighters of \"The Macross Saga\". Since then, Toynami has become the exclusive toy manufacturer of the \"Robotech\" franchise\u2014having covered mecha from \"The Macross Saga\", \"The New Generation\" and \"The Shadow Chronicles\".\nVideo games.\n\"Robotech\" spawned five video game licenses, of which the most recent three were released:\nReception of adaptation.\n\"Robotech\" is often a polarizing subject amongst anime fans. Some critics look down upon the show for its extensive edits to the source material (Westernizing character names, editing for content and chiefly, forging a connection between previously unrelated series), while supporters of the adaptation have pointed out that the weaving of three unrelated series into a contiguous whole necessarily required reworking, and that it helped to maintain a slow but continuous rise in the consumption of anime in the US.\nSeries writer/actor Gregory Snegoff said in an interview on the now-defunct \"Shadow Chronicles News\" fansite that, \"afterward, we received compliments from the Japanese who thought our dialogue and stories were better than the original,\" likely a reference to the creators of the latter two series, both of whom worked with the team on \"The Sentinels\". The producers of \"Megazone 23 \u2013 Part 1\" were very happy with the original plans for \"\" (where the incomplete film would have been added to the \"Robotech\" mythos to play part in \"The Sentinels\" storyline), and worked closely with Carl Macek to plan the new ending and animation. When the film reached a limited release, the new ending was released on a LaserDisc of \"Megazone 23\", with the title \"Present For You.\" However, \"Animag\" magazine (issue 11) and \"Animerica\" magazine (issue 9, volume 4) reports that the staff of \"Macross\" at Studio Nue and Artland, such as the original story creator and mecha designer Sh\u014dji Kawamori and chief director Noboru Ishiguro, expressed their concern over the \"Robotech\" adaptation, and surprise at its differences.\nIn 2009, \"IGN\" ranked \"Robotech\" as the 34th-greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.\nIn a review of \"The Macross Saga\" for \"NEO\", David West considered it a landmark in Japanese animation and an essential watch for fans of the mecha genre. He considered its take on human issues such as love and death to be fresh and enduring, and although he found the animation to be not as up to date as the story, he considers the show impressive despite its age.\nDistribution.\nFollowing the original broadcast, the series enjoyed popularity on home video in VHS and DVD formats from the following distributors:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Radioteletype evolved from earlier landline teleprinter operations that began in the mid-1800s. The US Navy Department successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, Massachusetts, radio station to the RMS \"Majestic\". Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. From the 1980s, teleprinters were replaced by personal computers (PCs) running software to emulate teleprinters.\nThe term radioteletype is used to describe both the original radioteletype system, sometimes described as \"Baudot\", as well as the entire family of systems connecting two or more teleprinters or PCs using software to emulate teleprinters, over radio, regardless of alphabet, link system or modulation.\nIn some applications, notably military and government, radioteletype is known by the acronym RATT (Radio Automatic Teletype).\nHistory.\nLandline teleprinter operations began in 1849 when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City. \u00c9mile Baudot designed a system using a five unit code in 1874 that is still in use today. Teleprinter system design was gradually improved until, at the beginning of World War II, it represented the principal distribution method used by the news services.\nRadioteletype evolved from these earlier landline teleprinter operations. The US Department of the Navy successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in August 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, MA radio station to the RMS \"Majestic\". An early implementation of the Radioteletype was the Watsongraph, named after Detroit inventor Glenn Watson in March 1931. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US Military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. The Navy called radioteletype \"RATT\" (Radio Automatic Teletype) and the Army Signal Corps called radioteletype \"SCRT\", an abbreviation of Single-Channel Radio Teletype. The military used frequency shift keying (FSK) technology and this technology proved very reliable even over long distances.\nTechnical description.\nA radioteletype station consists of three distinct parts: the Teletype or teleprinter, the modem and the radio.\nThe Teletype or teleprinter is an electromechanical or electronic device. The word \"Teletype\" was a trademark of the Teletype Corporation, so the terms \"TTY\", \"RTTY\", \"RATT\" and \"teleprinter\" are usually used to describe a generic device without reference to a particular manufacturer.\nElectromechanical teleprinters are heavy, complex and noisy, and have largely been replaced with electronic units. The teleprinter includes a keyboard, which is the main means of entering text, and a printer or visual display unit (VDU). An alternative input device is a perforated tape reader and, more recently, computer storage media (such as floppy disks). Alternative output devices are tape perforators and computer storage media.\nThe line output of a teleprinter can be at either digital logic levels (+5\u00a0V signifies a logical \"1\" or \"mark\" and 0\u00a0V signifies a logical \"0\" or \"space\") or line levels (\u221280\u00a0V signifies a \"1\" and +80\u00a0V a \"0\"). When no traffic is passed, the line idles at the \"mark\" state.\nWhen a key of the teleprinter keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit character is generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits a sequence of a \"start bit\" (a logical 0 or space), then one after the other the 5 data bits, finishing with a \"stop bit\" (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.\nThe 5 data bits allow for only 32 different codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as carriage return, new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the teleprinter has two \"states\", the \"unshifted\" or \"letters\" state and the \"shifted\" or \"numbers\" or \"figures\" state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes \"LETTERS\" and \"FIGURES\" are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the \"letters\" state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional \"third shift\" state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.\nThe modem is sometimes called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to one or the other of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125\u00a0Hz (US) or 2125/1955\u00a0Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the \"mark\" condition and the other to the \"space\" condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the \"mark\" or \"space\" input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.\nOn reception, the FSK signal is converted to the original tones by mixing the FSK signal with a local oscillator called the BFO or \"beat frequency oscillator\". These tones are fed to the demodulator part of the modem, which processes them through a series of filters and detectors to recreate the original digital signal. The FSK signals are audible on a communications radio receiver equipped with a BFO, and have a distinctive \"beedle-eeeedle-eedle-eee\" sound, usually starting and ending on one of the two tones (\"idle on mark\").\nThe transmission speed is a characteristic of the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is a characteristic of the modem. These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given transmission speed. Electronic teleprinters can readily operate in a variety of speeds, but mechanical teleprinters require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.\nToday, both functions can be performed with modern computers equipped with digital signal processors or sound cards. The sound card performs the functions of the modem and the CPU performs the processing of the digital bits. This approach is very common in amateur radio, using specialized computer programs like fldigi, MMTTY or MixW.\nBefore the computer mass storage era, most RTTY stations stored text on paper tape using paper tape punchers and readers. The operator would type the message on the TTY keyboard and punch the code onto the tape. The tape could then be transmitted at a steady, high rate, without typing errors. A tape could be reused, and in some cases - especially for use with ASCII on NC Machines - might be made of plastic or even very thin metal material in order to be reused many times.\nThe most common test signal is a series of \"RYRYRY\" characters, as these form an alternating tone pattern exercising all bits and are easily recognized. Pangrams are also transmitted on RTTY circuits as test messages, the most common one being \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", and in French circuits, \"Voyez le brick g\u00e9ant que j'examine pr\u00e8s du wharf\"\nTechnical specification.\nThe original (or \"Baudot\") radioteletype system is based almost invariably on the Baudot code or ITA-2 5 bit alphabet. The link is based on character asynchronous transmission with 1 start bit and 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits. Transmitter modulation is normally FSK (F1B). Occasionally, an AFSK signal modulating an RF carrier (A2B, F2B) is used on VHF or UHF frequencies. Standard transmission speeds are 45.45, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 300 baud.\nCommon carrier shifts are 85\u00a0Hz (used on LF and VLF frequencies), 170\u00a0Hz, 425\u00a0Hz, 450\u00a0Hz and 850\u00a0Hz, although some stations use non-standard shifts. There are variations of the standard Baudot alphabet to cover languages written in Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek etc., using special techniques.\nSome combinations of speed and shift are standardized for specific services using the original radioteletype system:\nEarly amateur radioteletype history.\nAfter World War\u00a0II, amateur radio operators in the U.S. started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model\u00a026 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. \"The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society\" was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to \"The VHF Teletype Society\" and started US amateur radio operations on 2\u00a0meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radio teletype contact (QSO) of record took place in May\u00a01946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY, and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2\u00a0meters. Operation on 80\u00a0meters, 40\u00a0meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized.\nIn early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY contact was accomplished on 11\u00a0meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January\u00a031. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSW's test transmissions. While contacts could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \"The RTTY Society of Southern California\" publisher of \"RTTY\" and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of \"CQ Magazine\", amateur radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part\u00a012 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40, and 20\u00a0meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60\u00a0words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 \u00b1 50 Hz was specified. Amateur radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for amateur radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part\u00a012 was amended, in March\u00a01956, to allow amateur radio operators to use any shift that was 900\u00a0Hz or less.\nThe FCC \"Notice of Proposed Rule Making\" (NPRM) that resulted in the authorization of FSK in the amateur high frequency (HF) bands responded to petitions by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), the National Amateur Radio Council, and a Mr.\u00a0Robert Weinstein. The NPRM specifically states this, and this information may be found in its entirety in the December\u00a01951 issue of \"QST Magazine\". While \"The New RTTY Handbook\" gives ARRL no credit, it was published by \"CQ Magazine\" and its author was a \"CQ\" columnist (\"CQ\" was generally hostile to the ARRL at that time).\nThe first RTTY Contest was held by the RTTY Society of Southern California from October 31 to November 1, 1953. Named the RTTY Sweepstakes Contest, twenty nine participants exchanged messages that contained a serial number, originating station call, check or RST report of two or three numbers, ARRL section of originator, local time (0000-2400 preferred) and date. Example: NR 23 W0BP CK MINN 1325 FEB 15. By the late 1950s, the contest exchange was expanded to include band used. Example: NR 23 W0BP CK MINN 1325 FEB 15 FORTY METERS. The contest was scored as follows: One point for each message sent and received entirely by RTTY and one point for each message received and acknowledged by RTTY. The final score was computed by multiplying the total number of message points by the number of ARRL sections worked. Two stations could exchange messages again on a different band for added points, but the section multiplier did not increase when the same section was reworked on a different band. Each DXCC entity was counted as an additional ARRL section for RTTY multiplier credit.\nA new magazine named \"RTTY\", later renamed \"RTTY Journal\", also published the first listing of stations, mostly located in the continental US, that were interested in RTTY in 1956. Amateur radio operators used this callbook information to contact other operators both inside and outside the United States. For example, the first recorded USA to New Zealand two-way RTTY contact took place in 1956 between W0BP and ZL1WB.\nBy the late 1950s, new organizations focused on amateur radioteletype started to appear. The \"British Amateur Radio Teletype Group\", BARTG, now known as the \"British Amateur Radio Teledata Group\" was formed in June 1959. The Florida RTTY Society was formed in September\u00a01959. Amateur radio operators outside of Canada and the U.S. began to acquire surplus teleprinter and receive permission to get on the air. The first recorded RTTY contact in the U.K. occurred in September\u00a01959 between G2UK and G3CQE. A few weeks later, G3CQE had the first G/VE RTTY QSO with VE7KX. This was quickly followed up by G3CQE QSOs with VK3KF and ZL3HJ. Information on how to acquire surplus teleprinter equipment continued to spread and before long it was possible to work all continents on RTTY.\nAmateur radio operators used various equipment designs to get on the air using RTTY in the 1950s and 1960s. Amateurs used their existing receivers for RTTY operation but needed to add a terminal unit, sometimes called a demodulator, to convert the received audio signals to DC signals for the teleprinter.\nMost of the terminal unit equipment used for receiving RTTY signals was home built, using designs published in amateur radio publications. These original designs can be divided into two classes of terminal units: audio-type and intermediate frequency converters. The audio-type converters proved to be more popular with amateur radio operators. The Twin City, W2JAV and W2PAT designs were examples of typical terminal units that were used into the middle 1960s. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of terminal units designed by W6FFC, such as the TT/L, ST-3, ST-5, and ST-6. These designs were first published in \"RTTY Journal\" starting in September\u00a01967 and ending in 1970.\nAn adaptation of the W6FFC TT/L terminal unit was developed by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ, and it was first published in the \"RTTY Journal\" in September\u00a01967. The drafting of the schematic in the article was done by Ralph Leland, W8DLT.\nAmateur radio operators needed to modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor in and out of the circuit, shifting the transmitter\u2019s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80\u00a0meters but become progressively less stable on 40\u00a0meters, 20\u00a0meters, and 15\u00a0meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all amateur radio HF bands.\nDuring the early days of Amateur RTTY, the RTTY Worked All Continents Award was conceived by the RTTY Society of Southern California and issued by RTTY Journal. The first amateur radio station to achieve this WAC \u2013 RTTY Award was VE7KX. The first stations recognized as having achieved single band WAC RTTY were W1MX (3.5\u00a0MHz); DL0TD (7.0\u00a0MHz); K3SWZ (14.0\u00a0MHz); W0MT (21.0\u00a0MHz) and FG7XT (28.0\u00a0MHz). The ARRL began issuing WAC RTTY certificates in 1969.\nBy the early 1970s, amateur radio RTTY had spread around the world and it was finally possible to work more than 100\u00a0countries via RTTY. FG7XT was the first amateur radio station to claim to achieve this honor. However, Jean did not submit his QSL cards for independent review. ON4BX, in 1971, was the first amateur radio station to submit his cards to the DX editor of \"RTTY Journal\" and to achieve this honor. The ARRL began issuing DXCC RTTY Awards on November 1, 1976. Prior to that date, an award for working 100 countries on RTTY was only available via RTTY Journal.\nIn the 1950s through the 1970s, \"RTTY art\" was a popular on-air activity. This consisted of (sometimes very elaborate and artistic) pictures sent over RTTY through the use of lengthy punched tape transmissions and then printed by the receiving station on paper.\nOn January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part\u00a097 to allow faster RTTY speeds. Four standard RTTY speeds were authorized, namely, 60\u00a0words per minute (WPM) (45\u00a0baud), 67\u00a0WPM (50\u00a0baud), 75\u00a0WPM (56.25\u00a0baud), and 100\u00a0WPM (75\u00a0baud). Many amateur radio operators had equipment that was capable of being upgraded to 75 and 100\u00a0words per minute by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100\u00a0WPM operation, many amateur radio operators moved back to 60\u00a0WPM. Some of the reasons for the failure of 100\u00a0WPM HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical teleprinters, narrow bandwidth terminal units, continued use of 170\u00a0Hz shift at 100\u00a0WPM, and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.\nThe FCC approved the use of ASCII by amateur radio stations on March 17, 1980 with speeds up to 300\u00a0baud from 3.5\u00a0MHz to 21.25\u00a0MHz and 1200\u00a0baud between 28\u00a0MHz and 225\u00a0MHz. Speeds up to 19.2\u00a0kilobaud was authorized on amateur frequencies above 420\u00a0MHz.\nThese symbol rates were later modified:\nThe requirement for amateur radio operators in the U.S. to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each digital transmission, and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code, was finally lifted by the FCC on June 15, 1983.\nComparison with other modes.\nRTTY has a typical baud rate for Amateur operation of 45.45 baud (approximately 60 words per minute). It remains popular as a \"keyboard to keyboard\" mode in Amateur Radio. RTTY has declined in commercial popularity as faster, more reliable alternative data modes have become available, using satellite or other connections.\nFor its transmission speed, RTTY has low spectral efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170\u00a0Hz shift at 45.45 baud requires around 250\u00a0Hz receiver bandwidth, more than double that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725\u00a0Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter does not need to use a linear amplifier, which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.\nRTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, is moderately resistant to vagaries of HF propagation and interference, however modern digital modes, such as MFSK, use Forward Error Correction to provide much better data reliability.\nPrimary users.\nPrincipally, the primary users are those who need robust shortwave communications. Examples are:\nOne regular service transmitting RTTY meteorological information is the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst or DWD). The DWD regularly transmit two programs on various frequencies on LF and HF in standard RTTY (ITA-2 alphabet). The list of callsigns, frequencies, baud rates and shifts are as follows:\nThe DWD signals can be easily received in Europe, North Africa and parts of North America.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used to describe data flow at the register-transfer level of an architecture. Academic papers and textbooks often use a form of RTL as an architecture-neutral assembly language. RTL is used as the name of a specific intermediate representation in several compilers, including the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Zephyr, and the European compiler projects CerCo and CompCert.\nHistory.\nThe idea behind RTL was first described in \"The Design and Application of a Retargetable Peephole Optimizer\".\nGCC.\nIn GCC, RTL is generated from the GIMPLE representation, transformed by various passes in the GCC middle-end, and then converted to assembly language.\nGCC's RTL is usually written in a form that looks like a Lisp S-expression:\n (plus:SI (reg:SI 138)\n (reg: SI 139)))\nThis side-effect expression says \"sum the contents of register 138 with the contents of register 139 and store the result in register 140\". The SI specifies the access mode for each register. In the example, it is \"SImode\", i.e. \"access the register as 32-bit integer\".\nThe sequence of RTL generated has some dependency on the characteristics of the processor for which GCC is generating code. However, the meaning of the RTL is more or less independent of the target: it would usually be possible to read and understand a piece of RTL without knowing what processor it was generated for. Similarly, the meaning of the RTL doesn't usually depend on the program's original high-level language.\nA register transfer language is a system for expressing in symbolic form the microoperation sequences among the registers of a digital module. It is a convenient tool for describing the internal organization of digital computers in a concise and precise manner. It can also be used to facilitate the design process of digital systems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request\u2013response message passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually, they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.\nRPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine, they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is also different. Many different (often incompatible) technologies have been used to implement the concept. Modern RPC frameworks, such as gRPC and Apache Thrift, enhance the basic RPC model by using efficient binary serialization (e.g., Protocol Buffers), HTTP/2 multiplexing, and built-in support for features such as authentication, load balancing, streaming, and error handling, making them well-suited for building scalable microservices and enabling language interoperability.\nHistory and origins.\nRequest\u2013response protocols date to early distributed computing in the late 1960s, theoretical proposals of remote procedure calls as the model of network operations date to the 1970s, and practical implementations date to the early 1980s. Bruce Jay Nelson is generally credited with coining the term \"remote procedure call\" in 1981.\nRemote procedure calls used in modern operating systems trace their roots back to the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, which used a request-response communication protocol for process synchronization. The idea of treating network operations as remote procedure calls goes back at least to the 1970s in early ARPANET documents. In 1978, Per Brinch Hansen proposed Distributed Processes, a language for distributed computing based on \"external requests\" consisting of procedure calls between processes.\nOne of the earliest practical implementations was in 1982 by Brian Randell and colleagues for their Newcastle Connection between UNIX machines. This was soon followed by \"Lupine\" by Andrew Birrell and Bruce Nelson in the Cedar environment at Xerox PARC. Lupine automatically generated stubs, providing type-safe bindings, and used an efficient protocol for communication. One of the first business uses of RPC was by Xerox under the name \"Courier\" in 1981. The first popular implementation of RPC on Unix was Sun's RPC (now called ONC RPC), used as the basis for Network File System (NFS).\nIn the 1990s, with the popularity of object-oriented programming, an alternative model of remote method invocation (RMI) was widely implemented, such as in Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA, 1991) and Java remote method invocation. RMIs, in turn, fell in popularity with the rise of the internet, particularly in the 2000s.\nMessage passing.\nRPC is a request\u2013response protocol. An RPC is initiated by the \"client\", which sends a request message to a known remote \"server\" to execute a specified procedure with supplied parameters. The remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process. While the server is processing the call, the client is blocked (it waits until the server has finished processing before resuming execution), unless the client sends an asynchronous request to the server, such as an XMLHttpRequest. There are many variations and subtleties in various implementations, resulting in a variety of different (incompatible) RPC protocols.\nAn important difference between remote procedure calls and local calls is that remote calls can fail because of unpredictable network problems. Also, callers generally must deal with such failures without knowing whether the remote procedure was actually invoked. Idempotent procedures (those that have no additional effects if called more than once) are easily handled, but enough difficulties remain that code to call remote procedures is often confined to carefully written low-level subsystems.\nStandard contact mechanisms.\nTo let different clients access servers, a number of standardized RPC systems have been created. Most of these use an interface description language (IDL) to let various platforms call the RPC. The IDL files can then be used to generate code to interface between the client and servers.\nAnalogues.\nNotable RPC implementations and analogues include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On 12 August 2000, K-141 \"Kursk\" was lost when it sank in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 personnel on board.\nConstruction.\nK-141 \"Kursk\" was a Project 949A class \"Antey\" () submarine of the Oscar class, known as the Oscar II by its NATO reporting name, and was the penultimate submarine of the Oscar II class designed and approved in the Soviet Union. Construction began in 1990 at the Soviet Navy military shipyards in Severodvinsk, near Arkhangelsk, in the northern Russian SFSR. During the construction of K-141, the Soviet Union collapsed; work continued, and she became one of the first naval vessels completed after the collapse. In 1993 K-141 was named \"Kursk\" after the Battle of Kursk, on the 50-year anniversary of this battle. K-141 was inherited by Russia and launched in 1994, before being commissioned by the Russian Navy on 30 December, as part of the Russian Northern Fleet.\n\"Kursk\" was assigned to the home port of Vidyayevo, Murmansk Oblast.\nCapabilities.\nThe \"Antey\" design represented the highest achievement of Soviet nuclear submarine technology. They are the second-largest cruise missile submarines ever built, after some s converted to carry cruise missiles in 2007. \"Kursk\" was built to defeat an entire United States aircraft carrier group. A single Type 65 torpedo carried a warhead powerful enough to sink an aircraft carrier. Both missiles and torpedoes could be equipped with nuclear warheads. She was longer than the preceding Oscar I-class submarines. The senior officers had individual cabins and the entire crew had access to a gymnasium.\nHer outer hull, made of high-nickel, high-chromium stainless steel thick, had exceptional corrosion resistance and a weak magnetic signature, helping to conceal it from U.S. magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) systems. There was a gap to the -thick steel pressure hull. She was designed to remain submerged for up to 120 days. The sail superstructure was reinforced to allow it to break through Arctic ice.\nThe submarine was armed with 24 SS-N-19/P-700 Granit cruise missiles, and eight torpedo tubes in the bow: four and four . With a range of , Granit missiles were capable of supersonic flight at altitudes over . They were designed to swarm enemy vessels and intelligently choose individual targets which terminated with a dive onto the target. \"Kursk's\" torpedo tubes could launch either torpedoes or anti-ship missiles with a range of . Her weapons included 18 SS-N-16 \"Stallion\" anti-submarine missiles.\n\"Kursk\" was part of Russia's Northern Fleet, which suffered funding cuts throughout the 1990s. Many of its submarines were anchored and rusting in Zapadnaya Litsa Naval Base, from Murmansk. Little work to maintain all but the most essential front-line equipment, including search and rescue equipment, was performed. Northern Fleet sailors had gone unpaid in the mid-1990s.\nDeployments.\nDuring her five years of service, \"Kursk\" completed only one mission, a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea during the summer of 1999 to monitor the United States Sixth Fleet responding to the Kosovo crisis. As a result, many of her crew had spent little time at sea and were inexperienced.\nNaval exercise and disaster.\n\"Kursk\" joined the \"Summer-X\" exercise, the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in more than a decade, on 10 August 2000. It included 30 ships including the fleet's flagship \"Pyotr Velikiy\", four attack submarines, and a flotilla of smaller ships. The crew had recently won a citation for its excellent performance and had been recognized as the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet. While on an exercise, \"Kursk\" loaded a full complement of combat weapons. It was one of the few vessels authorized to carry a combat load at all times.\nExplosion.\nOn the first day of the exercise, \"Kursk\" successfully launched a Granit missile armed with a dummy warhead. Two days later, on the morning of 12 August, \"Kursk\" prepared to fire dummy torpedoes at the \"Pyotr Velikiy\". These practice torpedoes had no explosive warheads and were manufactured and tested at a much lower quality standard. On 12 August 2000, at 11:28 local time (07:28 UTC), there was an explosion while preparing to fire. The Russian Navy's final report on the disaster concluded the explosion was due to the failure of one of \"Kursk\"'s hydrogen peroxide-fueled Type 65 torpedoes. A subsequent investigation concluded that high-test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide used as propellant, seeped through a faulty weld in the torpedo casing. When HTP comes into contact with a catalyst, it rapidly expands by a factor of 5000, generating vast quantities of steam and oxygen. The pressure produced by the expanding HTP ruptured the kerosene fuel tank in the torpedo and set off an explosion equal to of TNT. The submarine sank in relatively shallow water, bottoming at a depth of about off Severomorsk, at . A second explosion 135 seconds after the initial event was equivalent to 3-7 tons of TNT. The explosions blew a large hole in the hull and caused the first three compartments of the submarine to collapse, killing or incapacitating all but 23 of the 118 personnel on board.\nRescue attempts.\nThe British and Norwegian navies offered assistance, but Russia initially refused all help. All 118 sailors and officers aboard \"Kursk\" died. The Russian Admiralty initially told the public that the majority of the crew died within minutes of the explosion. On 21 August, Norwegian and Russian divers found 24 bodies in the ninth compartment, the turbine room at the stern. Captain-lieutenant Dmitri Kolesnikov wrote a note listing the names of 23 sailors who were alive in the compartment after the sinking.\n\"Kursk\" carried a potassium superoxide cartridge of a chemical oxygen generator; these are used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen during an emergency. However, the cartridge became contaminated with sea water and the resulting chemical reaction caused a flash fire, consuming the available oxygen. Investigation showed that some personnel temporarily survived the fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. Ultimately, the remaining crew burned to death or suffocated.\nRussian president Vladimir Putin, though immediately informed of the tragedy, was assured by the Navy that the situation was under control and the crew's rescue was imminent. He waited for five days before ending his holiday at a presidential resort in Sochi on the Black Sea. Only four months into his presidency, he was highly criticized by the media and public alike for choosing to remain at the resort. Hitherto highly popular, his approval rating dropped dramatically. The president's response appeared callous and the government's actions looked incompetent. A year later he said, \"I probably should have returned to Moscow, but nothing would have changed. I had the same level of communication both in Sochi and in Moscow, but from a PR point of view I could have demonstrated some special eagerness to return.\"\nSubmarine recovery.\nA consortium formed by the Dutch companies Mammoet and Smit International was awarded a contract by Russia to raise the vessel, excluding the bow. They modified the barge \"Giant 4\" which raised \"Kursk\" and recovered the remains of her crew.\nDuring salvage operations in 2001, the team first cut the bow off the hull using a tungsten carbide-studded cable. As this tool had the potential to cause sparks which could ignite remaining pockets of reactive gases, such as hydrogen, the operation was executed with care. Most of the bow was abandoned and the rest of the vessel was towed to Severomorsk and placed in a floating dry dock for analysis.\nThe remains of \"Kursk\"'s reactor compartment were towed to Sayda Bay on Russia's northern Kola Peninsula, where more than 50 reactor compartments were afloat at pier points, after a shipyard drained all the fuel from the wreck in early 2003.\nSome torpedo and torpedo tube fragments from the bow were recovered; the rest was destroyed by explosives in 2002.\nOfficial inquiry results.\nNot withstanding the Navy's oft-stated position that a collision with a foreign vessel had triggered the event, a report issued by the government attributed the disaster to a torpedo explosion caused when high-test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide, leaking from a faulty weld in the torpedo's casing. The report found that the initial explosion destroyed the torpedo room compartment, killing everyone within the first compartment. The blast entered the second and perhaps the third and fourth compartments through an air conditioning vent. All of the 36 men in second compartment command post were immediately incapacitated or killed by the blast wave. The first explosion caused a fire that raised the temperature of the compartment above . The heat caused the warheads of between five and seven additional torpedoes to detonate, creating an explosion equivalent to 2\u20133 tons of TNT measuring 4.2 on the Richter magnitude scale on seismographs across Europe. The explosion was detected as far away as Alaska.\nAlternative explanation.\nVice-admiral Valery Ryazantsev disagreed with the government's official conclusion. He blamed the disaster on inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. Examining the wrecked sub, investigators recovered a partially burned copy of the safety instructions for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and omitted essential steps for testing an air valve. The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected the crew's qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes. \"Kursk\"'s crew had no experience with such torpedoes and had not been trained in handling or firing them. Ryazantsev believes the lack of training and improper manuals, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, set off a chain of events that led to the first explosion when the inexperienced crew loaded the practice torpedo.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is normally delivered by a linear particle accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body, and have not spread to other parts. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology. A physician who practices in this subspecialty is a radiation oncologist and practicing radiographer are therapeutic radiographer.\nRadiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue. Besides the tumor itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with the tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.\nRadiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.\nThe precise treatment intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate, and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMedical uses.\nIt is estimated that half of the United States's 1.2M invasive cancer cases diagnosed in 2022 received radiation therapy in their treatment program. Different cancers respond to radiation therapy in different ways.\nThe response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.\nHighly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include leukemias, most lymphomas, and germ cell tumors.\nThe majority of epithelial cancers are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60\u201370\u00a0Gy) to achieve a radical cure.\nSome types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. Renal cell cancer and melanoma are generally considered to be radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.\nIt is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation \"curability\" of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localized to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example, non-melanoma skin cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, anal cancer, and prostate cancer. With the exception of oligometastatic disease, metastatic cancers are incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.\nModern radiation therapy relies on a CT scan to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures and to perform dose calculations for the creation of a complex radiation treatment plan. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields. Patient positioning is crucial at this stage as the patient will have to be placed in an identical position during each treatment. Many patient positioning devices have been developed for this purpose, including masks and cushions which can be molded to the patient. Image-guided radiation therapy is a method that uses imaging to correct for positional errors of each treatment session.\nBuilding on the principles of Image-guided radiation therapy, Daily MR-guided ART (MRgART) offers many dosimetric advantages over the traditional single-plan RT workflow, including the ability to conform the high-dose region to the tumor as the anatomy changes throughout the course of RT.\nThe response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. Due to complex radiobiology, very large tumors are affected less by radiation compared to smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include cisplatin, nimorazole, and cetuximab.\nThe impact of radiotherapy varies between different types of cancer and different groups. For example, for breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy has been found to halve the rate at which the disease recurs. In pancreatic cancer, radiotherapy has increased survival times for inoperable tumors.\nSide effects.\nRadiation therapy (RT) is in itself painless, but has iatrogenic side effect risks. Many low-dose palliative treatments (for example, radiation therapy to bony metastases) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient. Serious radiation complications may occur in 5% of RT cases. Acute (near immediate) or sub-acute (2 to 3 months post RT) radiation side effects may develop after 50 Gy RT dosing. Late or delayed radiation injury (6 months to decades) may develop after 65 Gy.\nSide effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patient's body that is under treatment. Side effects are dose-dependent; for example, higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with cardiovascular complications, thyroid dysfunction, and pituitary axis dysfunction. Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.\nThe main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but may not be as elastic as it was before.\nThis is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen (which commonly react a few hours after treatment), or with radiation therapy to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the vestibules of the inner ears. As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.\nEpithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa, and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist desquamation is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.\nIf the head and neck area is treated, temporary soreness and ulceration commonly occur in the mouth and throat. If severe, this can affect swallowing, and the patient may need painkillers and nutritional support/food supplements. The esophagus can also become sore if it is treated directly, or if, as commonly occurs, it receives a dose of collateral radiation during treatment of lung cancer. When treating liver malignancies and metastases, it is possible for collateral radiation to cause gastric, stomach, or duodenal ulcers This collateral radiation is commonly caused by non-targeted delivery (reflux) of the radioactive agents being infused. Methods, techniques and devices are available to lower the occurrence of this type of adverse side effect.\nThe lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea. Nutritional interventions may be able to help with diarrhoea associated with radiotherapy. Studies in people having pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer found that changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment.\nAs part of the general inflammation that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised intracranial pressure or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a lumen (e.g., trachea or main bronchus). Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive steroids during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.\nThe gonads (ovaries and testicles) are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce gametes following direct exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment.\nLate side effects.\nLate side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.\n Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process. The long term accumulation of such fibrotic scarring, termed \"radiation-induced fibrotic compression\", is associated with indirect nerve paresis, e.g. pelvic radiation and femoral nerve neuropathy.\n Epilation (hair loss) may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1\u00a0Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field(s). Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10\u00a0Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45\u00a0Gy.\n The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30\u00a0Gy in 2\u00a0Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's quality of life. Similarly, sweat glands in treated skin (such as the armpit) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal mucosa is often dry following pelvic irradiation.\nRadiation therapy treatments to the head and neck regions for soft tissue, palate or bone cancer can cause chronic sinus tract draining and fistulae from the bone.\n Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .\n Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in some patients. Cancer survivors are already more likely than the general population to develop malignancies due to a number of factors including lifestyle choices, genetics, and previous radiation treatment. It is difficult to directly quantify the rates of these secondary cancers from any single cause. Studies have found radiation therapy as the cause of secondary malignancies for only a small minority of patients, e.g., exposure to ionizing radiation is an identified risk factor for subsequent glioma; see main topic Glioma#Causes. The combined risk of a radiation-induced glioblastoma or astrocytoma within 15 years of the initial radiotherapy is 0.5-2.7%.\n New techniques such as proton beam therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy which aim to reduce dose to healthy tissues will lower these risks. It starts to occur 4\u20136 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 3 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer even in pediatric malignancies which carry a higher burden of secondary malignancies.\n Radiation can increase the risk of heart disease and death as observed in previous breast cancer RT regimens. Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event (i.e., heart attack or stroke) by 1.5 to 4 times a person's normal rate, aggravating factors included. The increase is dose dependent, related to the RT's dose strength, volume and location. Use of concomitant chemotherapy, e.g. anthracyclines, is an aggravating risk factor. The occurrence rate of RT induced cardiovascular disease is estimated between 10 and 30%.\n Cardiovascular late side effects have been termed radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) and radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RIVD). Symptoms are dose dependent and include cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart arrhythmia and peripheral artery disease. Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular cell damage and oxidative stress can lead to these and other late side effect symptoms. Most radiation-induced cardiovascular diseases occur 10 or more years post treatment, making causality determinations more difficult.\n In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause cognitive decline. Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 and 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5-year-old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.\n The gastrointestinal tract can be damaged following abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. Atrophy, fibrosis and vascular changes produce malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea and bleeding with bile acid diarrhea and vitamin B12 malabsorption commonly found due to ileal involvement. Pelvic radiation disease includes radiation proctitis, producing bleeding, diarrhoea and urgency, and can also cause radiation cystitis when the bladder is affected.\n Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) encompasses radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Lung tissue is sensitive to ionizing radiation, tolerating only 18\u201320 Gy, a fraction of typical therapeutic dosage levels. The lung's terminal airways and associated alveoli can become damaged, preventing effective respiratory gas exchange. The adverse effects of radiation are often asymptomatic with clinically significant RILI occurrence rates varying widely in literature, affecting 5\u201325% of those treated for thoracic and mediastinal malignancies and 1\u20135% of those treated for breast cancer.\n Pelvic radiation therapy has been associated with acquired neurogenic bladder dysfunction, radiation impacting the nerves or structures involved with urinary continence and voiding. The voluntary micturition process is controlled by the central nervous system, synchronizing the bladder's detrusor muscle and the internal and external urethral sphincters. Trauma to the process's components, e.g., spinal cord, peripheral motor and sensor nerves, and the bladder and urethra sphincters, can cause dysfunction, e.g., dysuria, frequency and incontinence.\n Radiation treatments may damage nerves near the target area or within the delivery path as nerve tissue is also radiosensitive. Nerve damage from ionizing radiation occurs in phases, the initial phase from microvascular injury, capillary damage and nerve demyelination. Subsequent damage occurs from vascular constriction and nerve compression due to uncontrolled fibrous tissue growth caused by radiation. Radiation-induced polyneuropathy, https://, occurs in approximately 1\u20135% of those receiving radiation therapy.\n Depending upon the irradiated zone, late effect neuropathy may occur in either the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS for example, cranial nerve injury typically presents as a visual acuity loss 1\u201314 years post treatment. In the PNS, injury to the plexus nerves presents as radiation-induced brachial plexopathy or radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy appearing up to 3 decades post treatment.\n Myokymia (muscle cramping, spasms or twitching) may develop. Radiation-induced nerve injury, chronic compressive neuropathies and polyradiculopathies are the most common cause of myokymic discharges. Clinically, the majority of patients receiving radiation therapy have measurable myokymic discharges within their field of radiation which present as focal or segmental myokymia. Common areas affected include the arms, legs or face depending upon the location of nerve injury. Myokymia is more frequent when radiation doses exceed 10 gray (Gy).\nRadiation necrosis is the death of healthy tissue near the irradiated site. It is a type of coagulative necrosis that occurs because the radiation directly or indirectly damages blood vessels in the area, which reduces the blood supply to the remaining healthy tissue, causing it to die by ischemia, similar to what happens in an ischemic stroke. Because it is an indirect effect of the treatment, it occurs months to decades after radiation exposure. Radiation necrosis most commonly presents as osteoradionecrosis, vaginal radionecrosis, soft tissue radionecrosis, or laryngeal radionecrosis.\nCumulative side effects.\nCumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects \u2013 when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic. These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.\nEffects on reproduction.\nDuring the first two weeks after fertilization, radiation therapy is lethal but not teratogenic. High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce anomalies, impaired growth and intellectual disability, and there may be an increased risk of childhood leukemia and other tumors in the offspring.\nIn males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy. However, the use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk.\nEffects on pituitary system.\nHypopituitarism commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumors, head and neck tumors, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies. 40\u201350% of children treated for childhood cancer develop some endocrine side effect. Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects growth hormone and gonadal hormones. In contrast, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiencies are the least common among people with radiation-induced hypopituitarism. Changes in prolactin-secretion is usually mild, and vasopressin deficiency appears to be very rare as a consequence of radiation.\nEffects on subsequent surgery.\nDelayed tissue injury with impaired wound healing capability often develops after receiving doses in excess of 65\u00a0Gy. A diffuse injury pattern due to the external beam radiotherapy's holographic isodosing occurs. While the targeted tumor receives the majority of radiation, healthy tissue at incremental distances from the center of the tumor are also irradiated in a diffuse pattern due to beam divergence. These wounds demonstrate progressive, proliferative endarteritis, inflamed arterial linings that disrupt the tissue's blood supply. Such tissue ends up chronically hypoxic, fibrotic, and without an adequate nutrient and oxygen supply. Surgery of previously irradiated tissue has a very high failure rate, e.g. women who have received radiation for breast cancer develop late effect chest wall tissue fibrosis and hypovascularity, making successful reconstruction and healing difficult, if not impossible.\nRadiation therapy accidents.\nThere are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine Therac-25 was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in Missouri overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.\nAlthough medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. In 2010 the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) launched a safety initiative called https:// that, among other things, aimed to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from recurring. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.\nUse in non-cancerous diseases.\nRadiation therapy is used to treat early stage Dupuytren's disease and Ledderhose disease. When Dupuytren's disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress. Low doses of radiation are used typically three gray of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three gray of radiation for five days.\nTechnique.\nMechanism of action.\nRadiation therapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells and can cause them to undergo mitotic catastrophe. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy, photon or charged particle. This damage is either direct or indirect ionization of the atoms which make up the DNA chain. Indirect ionization happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming free radicals, notably hydroxyl radicals, which then damage the DNA.\nIn photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and double-stranded DNA damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are much more difficult to repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo cell death. Cancer cells are generally less differentiated and more stem cell-like; they reproduce more than most healthy differentiated cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.\nOne of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as hypoxia. Oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer, increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment. Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, hyperthermia therapy (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as misonidazole and metronidazole, and hypoxic cytotoxins (tissue poisons), such as tirapazamine. Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound such as trans sodium crocetinate as a radiosensitizer.\nCharged particles such as protons and boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue \u2013 the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers). This X-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and while depending on a multitude of factors, they are around 10 times more sensitive to developing secondary malignancies after radiotherapy as compared to adults.\nDose.\nThe amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in grays (Gy), and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80\u00a0Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40\u00a0Gy.\nPreventive (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45\u201360\u00a0Gy in 1.8\u20132\u00a0Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers.) Many other factors are considered by radiation oncologists when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.\nDelivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during treatment planning (part of dosimetry). Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.\nIn radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the dosimetry technique known as gel dosimetry.\nFractionation.\nThe total dose is fractionated (spread out over time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.\nFractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2\u00a0Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8\u00a0Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.\nIn some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller. In particular, tumors in the head-and-neck demonstrate this behavior.\nPatients receiving palliative radiation to treat uncomplicated painful bone metastasis should not receive more than a single fraction of radiation. A single treatment gives comparable pain relief and morbidity outcomes to multiple-fraction treatments, and for patients with limited life expectancy, a single treatment is best to improve patient comfort.\nSchedules for fractionation.\nOne fractionation schedule that is increasingly being used and continues to be studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2\u00a0Gy/fraction to 20\u00a0Gy/fraction, the latter being typical of stereotactic treatments (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, or SABR \u2013 also known as SBRT, or stereotactic body radiotherapy) for subcranial lesions, or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for intracranial lesions. The rationale of hypofractionation is to reduce the probability of local recurrence by denying clonogenic cells the time they require to reproduce and also to exploit the radiosensitivity of some tumors. In particular, stereotactic treatments are intended to destroy clonogenic cells by a process of ablation, i.e., the delivery of a dose intended to destroy clonogenic cells directly, rather than to interrupt the process of clonogenic cell division repeatedly (apoptosis), as in routine radiotherapy.\nEstimation of dose based on target sensitivity.\nDifferent cancer types have different radiation sensitivity. While predicting the sensitivity based on genomic or proteomic analyses of biopsy samples has proven challenging, the predictions of radiation effect on individual patients from genomic signatures of intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity, sometimes termed genomic adjusted radiation dose (GARD), have been shown to associate with clinical outcome. An alternative approach to genomics and proteomics was offered by the discovery that radiation protection in microbes is offered by non-enzymatic complexes of manganese and small organic metabolites. The content and variation of manganese (measurable by electron paramagnetic resonance) were found to be good predictors of radiosensitivity, and this finding extends also to human cells. An association was confirmed between total cellular manganese contents and their variation, and clinically inferred radioresponsiveness in different tumor cells, a finding that may be useful for more precise radiodosages and improved treatment of cancer patients.\nTypes.\nHistorically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are:\nThe differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel.\nParticle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions.\nA review of radiation therapy randomised clinical trials from 2018 to 2021 found many practice-changing data and new concepts that emerge from RCTs, identifying techniques that improve the therapeutic ratio, techniques that lead to more tailored treatments, stressing the importance of patient satisfaction, and identifying areas that require further study.\nExternal beam radiation therapy.\nThe following three sections refer to treatment using X-rays.\nConventional external beam radiation therapy.\nHistorically conventional external beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) was delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy X-ray units, medical linear accelerators that generate high-energy X-rays, or with machines that were similar to a linear accelerator in appearance, but used a sealed radioactive source like the one shown above. 2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides.\n\"Conventional\" refers to the way the treatment is \"planned\" or \"simulated\" on a specially calibrated diagnostic X-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired \"plan\". The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume.\nAn example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy has become the standard treatment for almost all tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.\nStereotactic radiation.\nStereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.\nThere are two types of stereotactic radiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.\nSome doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.\nStereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, Novalis, Primatom, Synergy, X-Knife, TomoTherapy, Trilogy and Truebeam. This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.\nVirtual simulation, and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy.\nThe planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.\nVirtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.\nAn enhancement of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a beam's eye view (BEV) using a multileaf collimator (MLC) and a variable number of beams. When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT. IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes, for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel. Computer-controlled X-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform optimization and treatment simulation (Treatment Planning). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam's intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissues is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.\n3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast, and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency programs must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.\nProof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers in a series of pivotal trials performed by Professor Christopher Nutting of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT, about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty \u2013 for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called image-guided radiation therapy or four-dimensional radiation therapy.\nAnother technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location. The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.\nA well-studied issue with IMRT is the \"tongue and groove effect\" which results in unwanted underdosing, due to irradiating through extended tongues and grooves of overlapping MLC (multileaf collimator) leaves. While solutions to this issue have been developed, which either reduce the TG effect to negligible amounts or remove it completely, they depend upon the method of IMRT being used and some of them carry costs of their own. Some texts distinguish \"tongue and groove error\" from \"tongue or groove error\", according as both or one side of the aperture is occluded.\nVolumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).\nVolumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2007 which can achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360\u00b0 rotating fields with one or more arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a multileaf collimator (MLC) (\"sliding window\" system of moving) and fluence output rate (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT has an advantage in patient treatment, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), of reduced radiation delivery times. Comparisons between VMAT and conventional IMRT for their sparing of healthy tissues and Organs at Risk (OAR) depends upon the cancer type. In the treatment of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas VMAT provides equivalent or better protection of the organ at risk (OAR). In the treatment of prostate cancer the OAR protection result is mixed with some studies favoring VMAT, others favoring IMRT.\nTemporally feathered radiation therapy (TFRT).\nTemporally feathered radiation therapy (TFRT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2018 which aims to use the inherent non-linearities in normal tissue repair to allow for sparing of these tissues without affecting the dose delivered to the tumor. The application of this technique, which has yet to be automated, has been described carefully to enhance the ability of departments to perform it, and in 2021 it was reported as feasible in a small clinical trial, though its efficacy has yet to be formally studied.\nAutomated planning.\nAutomated treatment planning has become an integrated part of radiotherapy treatment planning. There are in general two approaches of automated planning. 1) Knowledge based planning where the treatment planning system has a library of high quality plans, from which it can predict the target and dose-volume histogram of the organ at risk. 2) The other approach is commonly called protocol based planning, where the treatment planning system tried to mimic an experienced treatment planner and through an iterative process evaluates the plan quality from on the basis of the protocol.\nParticle therapy.\nIn particle therapy (proton therapy being one example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are directed at the target tumor. The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the Bragg peak) that occurs near the end of the particle's range, and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.\nAuger therapy.\nAuger therapy (AT) makes use of a very high dose of ionizing radiation in situ that provides molecular modifications at an atomic scale. AT differs from conventional radiation therapy in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations. Instead, the in situ delivery of a very high dose at the molecular level using AT aims for in situ molecular modifications involving molecular breakages and molecular re-arrangements such as a change of stacking structures as well as cellular metabolic functions related to the said molecule structures.\nMotion compensation.\nIn many types of external beam radiotherapy, motion can negatively impact the treatment delivery by moving target tissue out of, or other healthy tissue into, the intended beam path. Some form of patient immobilisation is common, to prevent the large movements of the body during treatment, however this cannot prevent all motion, for example as a result of breathing. Several techniques have been developed to account for motion like this. Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is commonly used for breast treatments where it is important to avoid irradiating the heart. In DIBH the patient holds their breath after breathing in to provide a stable position for the treatment beam to be turned on. This can be done automatically using an external monitoring system such as a spirometer or a camera and markers. The same monitoring techniques, as well as 4DCT imaging, can also be for respiratory gated treatment, where the patient breathes freely and the beam is only engaged at certain points in the breathing cycle. Other techniques include using 4DCT imaging to plan treatments with margins that account for motion, and active movement of the treatment couch, or beam, to follow motion.\nContact X-ray brachytherapy.\nContact X-ray brachytherapy (also called \"CXB\", \"electronic brachytherapy\" or the \"Papillon Technique\") is a type of radiation therapy using low energy (50 kVp) kilovoltage X-rays applied directly to the tumor to treat rectal cancer. The process involves endoscopic examination first to identify the tumor in the rectum and then inserting treatment applicator on the tumor through the anus into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue. Finally, treatment tube is inserted into the applicator to deliver high doses of X-rays (30Gy) emitted directly onto the tumor at two weekly intervals for three times over four weeks period. It is typically used for treating early rectal cancer in patients who may not be candidates for surgery. A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.\nBrachytherapy (sealed source radiotherapy).\nBrachytherapy is delivered by placing radiation source(s) inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, and skin cancer and can also be used to treat tumors in many other body sites.\nIn brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumor. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area \u2013 exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy \u2013 the tumor can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.\nAs one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.\nRadionuclide therapy.\nRadionuclide therapy (also known as systemic radioisotope therapy, radiopharmaceutical therapy, molecular radiotherapy, or targeted radionuclide therapy), is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule, for example an antibody, to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through infusion (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) to treat neuroblastoma, of oral iodine-131 to treat thyroid cancer or thyrotoxicosis, of peptide-bound lutetium-177 (Lutathera) and yttrium-90 to treat neuroendocrine tumors (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy), and of peptide-bound lutetium-177 (Pluvicto) to treat prostate cancer. In April 2024 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Lutathera, invented by Novartis, for pediatric patients aged 12 or older with somastotatin receptor (SSTR)-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). For the same indication in adults, approval was received in 2018. Pluvicto, also invented by Novartis, was approved for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in March 2022.\nAnother example is the injection of radioactive yttrium-90 or holmium-166 microspheres into the hepatic artery to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases. These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as selective internal radiation therapy. The microspheres are approximately 30\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (about one-third of a human hair) and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a catheter up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently three different kinds of microspheres: SIR-Spheres, TheraSphere and QuiremSpheres.\nA major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of bone metastasis from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are radium-223, strontium-89 and samarium (153Sm) lexidronam.\nIn 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody conjugated to yttrium-90.\nIn 2003, the FDA approved the tositumomab/iodine (131I) tositumomab regimen (Bexxar), which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.\nThese medications were the first agents of what is known as radioimmunotherapy, and they were approved for the treatment of refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nIntraoperative radiotherapy.\nIntraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a cancer tumor, while the area is exposed during surgery.\nRationale.\nThe rationale for IORT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.\nHistory.\nMedicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen. Emil Grubbe of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use X-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.\nThe field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of Nobel Prize\u2013winning scientist Marie Curie (1867\u20131934), who discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research. Through the 1920s the hazards of radiation exposure were not understood, and little protection was used. Radium was believed to have wide curative powers and radiotherapy was applied to many diseases.\nPrior to World War 2, the only practical sources of radiation for radiotherapy were radium, its \"emanation\", radon gas, and the X-ray tube. External beam radiotherapy (teletherapy) began at the turn of the century with relatively low voltage (&lt;150\u00a0kV) X-ray machines. It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage X-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages. Orthovoltage X-rays, which used tube voltages of 200-500\u00a0kV, began to be used during the 1920s. To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1\u00a0MV or above, called \"megavolt\" radiation. Producing megavolt X-rays required voltages on the X-ray tube of 3 to 5 million volts, which required huge expensive installations. Megavoltage X-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions. One of the first, installed at St. Bartholomew's hospital, London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long X-ray tube and weighed 10 tons. Radium produced megavolt gamma rays, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores. In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at \u00a3800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.\nThe invention of the nuclear reactor in the Manhattan Project during World War 2 made possible the production of artificial radioisotopes for radiotherapy. Cobalt therapy, teletherapy machines using megavolt gamma rays emitted by cobalt-60, a radioisotope produced by irradiating ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, revolutionized the field between the 1950s and the early 1980s. Cobalt machines were relatively cheap, robust and simple to use, although due to its 5.27 year half-life the cobalt had to be replaced about every 5 years.\nMedical linear particle accelerators, developed since the 1940s, began replacing X-ray and cobalt units in the 1980s and these older therapies are now declining. The first medical linear accelerator was used at the Hammersmith Hospital in London in 1953. Linear accelerators can produce higher energies, have more collimated beams, and do not produce radioactive waste with its attendant disposal problems like radioisotope therapies.\nWith Godfrey Hounsfield's invention of computed tomography (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient's anatomy. The advent of new imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1970s and positron emission tomography (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to image-guided radiation therapy tomotherapy. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects.\nWhile access to radiotherapy is improving globally, more than half of patients in low and middle income countries still do not have available access to the therapy as of 2017.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Coase was educated at the London School of Economics, where he was a member of the faculty until 1951. He was the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Law School, where he arrived in 1964 and remained for the rest of his life. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1991.\nCoase believed economists should study real-world wealth creation, in the manner of Adam Smith, stating, \"It is suicidal for the field to slide into a hard science of choice, ignoring the influences of society, history, culture, and politics on the working of the economy.\" He believed economic study should reduce emphasis on price theory or theoretical markets and instead focus on real markets. He established the case for the corporation as a means to pay the costs of operating a marketplace. Coase is best known for two articles: \"The Nature of the Firm\" (1937), which introduces the concept of transaction costs to explain the nature and limits of firms; and \"The Problem of Social Cost\" (1960), which suggests that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities if it were not for transaction costs (see Coase theorem). Additionally, Coase's transaction costs approach has been influential in modern organizational economics, where it was re-introduced by Oliver E. Williamson.\nBiography.\nRonald Harry Coase was born in Willesden, a suburb of London, on 29 December 1910. His father, Henry Joseph Coase (1884\u20131973) was a telegraphist for the post office, as was his mother, Rosalie Elizabeth Coase (n\u00e9e Giles; 1882\u20131972), before marriage. As a child, Coase had a weakness in his legs, for which he was required to wear leg-irons. Due to this problem, he attended the school for physical defectives. At the age of 12, he was able to enter Kilburn Grammar School on scholarship. At Kilburn, he studied for the intermediate examination of the University of London as an external student in 1927\u201329.\nCoase then continued his studies at the University of London, enrolling as an internal student of the London School of Economics, where he took courses with Arnold Plant and received a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1932. During his undergraduate studies, Coase received the Sir Ernest Cassel Travelling Scholarship which he used to visit the University of Chicago in 1931\u20131932 studying with Frank Knight and Jacob Viner. Coase's colleagues would later admit that they did not remember this first visit. Between 1932 and 1934, Coase was an assistant lecturer at the Dundee School of Economics and Commerce, which later became part of the University of Dundee. Subsequently, Coase was an assistant lecturer in commerce at the University of Liverpool between 1934 and 1935 before returning to London School of Economics as a member of staff until 1951 in which year he was awarded an earned doctorate in economics from the University of London. He then started to work at the University at Buffalo and retained his British citizenship after moving to the United States in the 1950s. In 1958, he moved to the University of Virginia. Coase settled at the University of Chicago in 1964 and became the co-editor of the \"Journal of Law and Economics\" with Aaron Director. He was also for a time a trustee of the Philadelphia Society. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991.\nNearing his 100th birthday, Coase was working on a book concerning the rise of the economies of China and Vietnam. In an interview, Coase explained the mission of the Coase China Society and his vision of economics and the part to be played by Chinese economists. This became \"How China Became Capitalist\" (2012) co-authored with Ning Wang. Coase was honoured and received an honorary doctorate from the university at Buffalo Department of Economics in May 2012.\nCoase married Marian Ruth Hartung of Chicago, Illinois in Willesden, England, 7 August 1937. Although they were unable to have children, they were married 75 years until her death on 17 October 2012, making him one of the longest-married Nobel Prize laureates. Coase himself died in Chicago on 2 September 2013, at the age of 102. Both are buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.\nHe was praised across the political spectrum, with \"Slate\" calling him \"one of the most distinguished economists in the world\" and \"Forbes\" calling him \"the greatest of the many great University of Chicago economists\". \"The Washington Post\" called his work over eight decades \"impossible to summarize\" while recommending five of his papers to read.\nContributions to economics.\n\"The Nature of the Firm\".\nIn \"The Nature of the Firm\" (1937), a brief but highly influential essay, Coase attempts to explain why the economy features a number of business firms instead of consisting exclusively of a multitude of independent, self-employed people who contract with one another. Given that \"production could be carried on without any organization [that is, firms] at all\", Coase asks, why and under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge?\nSince modern firms can only emerge when an entrepreneur of some sort begins to hire people, Coase's analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.\nThe traditional economic theory of the time (in the tradition of Adam Smith) suggested that, because the market is \"efficient\" (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.\nCoase noted, however, a number of transaction costs involved in using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market actually exceeds the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something from another party. This suggests that firms will arise which can internalise the production of goods and services required to deliver a product, thus avoiding these costs. This argument sets the stage for the later contributions by Oliver Williamson: markets and hierarchies are alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.\nThere is a natural limit to what a firm can produce internally, however. Coase notices \"decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function\", including increasing overhead costs and increasing propensity for an overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation. These factors become countervailing costs to the use of the firm.\nCoase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are \"internal\" to the firm and how many \"external\") is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above. In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.\nOther things being equal, therefore, a firm will tend to be larger:\nThe first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organised and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organising transactions across space may allow firms to become larger \u2013 the advent of the telephone and of cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms.\nA further exploration of the dichotomy between markets and hierarchies as co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions derived a third alternative way called Commons based peer production, in which individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals.\n\"The Problem of Social Cost\".\nUpon publishing his article The Federal Communications Commission in 1959, Coase received negative feedback from the faculty at the University of Chicago over his conclusions and apparent conflicts with A.C. Pigou. According to Coase, \"What I said was thought to run counter to Pigou's analysis by a number of economists at the University of Chicago and was therefore, according to them, wrong. At a meeting in Chicago I was able to convince these economists that I was right and Pigou's analysis faulty.\" Coase had presented his paper in 1960 during a seminar in Chicago, to twenty senior economist including George Stigler and Milton Friedman. He gradually won over the usually skeptic audience, in what has later been considered a \"paradigm-shifting moment\" in the genesis of Chicago Law and Economics. Coase would join the Chicago faculty four years later.\nPublished in the \"Journal of Law and Economics\" in 1960, while Coase was a member of the Economics department at the University of Virginia, \"The Problem of Social Cost\" provided the key insight that it is unclear where the blame for externalities lies. The example he gave was of a rancher whose cattle stray onto the cropland of his neighbour. If the rancher is made to restrict his cattle, he is harmed just as the farmer is if the cattle remain unrestrained.\nCoase argued that without transaction costs the initial assignment of property rights makes no difference to whether or not the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically efficient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). The allocation of property rights is primarily an equity issue, with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an efficiency issue.\nWith sufficient transaction costs, initial property rights matter for both equity and efficiency. From the point of view of economic efficiency, property rights should be assigned such that the owner of the rights wants to take the economically efficient action. To elaborate, if it is efficient not to restrict the cattle, the rancher should be given the rights (so that cattle can move about freely), whereas if it is efficient to restrict the cattle, the farmer should be given the rights over the movement of the cattle (so the cattle are restricted).\nThis seminal argument forms the basis of the famous Coase theorem as labelled by Stigler.\nIn 1990, Coase wrote that he feared \"The Problem of Social Cost\" had been widely misunderstood.\nLaw and economics.\nThough trained as an economist, Coase spent much of his career working in a law school. He is a central figure in the development of the subfield of law and economics. He viewed law and economics as having two parts, the first \"using the economists' approach and concepts to analyze the working of the legal system, often called the economic analysis of the law\"; and the second \"a study of the influence of the legal system on the working of the economic system.\" Coase said that the second part \"is the part of law and economics in which I am most interested.\"\nIn his Simons Lecture celebrating the centennial of the University of Chicago, titled \"Law and Economics at Chicago\", Coase noted that he only accidentally wandered into the field:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is generally agreed that this article has had an immense influence on legal scholarship, but this was no part of my intention. For me, 'The Problem of Social Cost' was an essay in economics. It was aimed at economists. What I wanted to do was to improve our analysis of the working of the economic system. Law came into article because, in a regime of positive transaction costs, the character of the law becomes one of the main factors determining the performance of the economy. If transaction costs were zero (as is assumed in standard economic theory) we can imagine people contracting around the law whenever the value of production would be increased by a change in the legal position. But in a regime of positive transaction costs, such contracting would not occur whenever transaction costs were greater than the gain that such a redistribution of rights would bring. As a consequence the rights which individuals possess will commonly be those established by the law, which in these circumstances can be said to control the economy. As I have said, in 'The Problem of Social Cost' I had no intention of making a contribution to legal scholarship. I referred to legal cases because they afforded examples of real situations as against the imaginary ones normally used by economists in their analysis. It was undoubtedly an economist who invented the widget. But in 'The Problem of Social Cost' I did something else. I pointed out that the judges in their opinions often seemed to show a better understanding of the economic problem than did many economists even though their views were not always expressed in a very explicit fashion. I did this not to praise the judges but to shame economists.\nDespite wandering accidentally into law and economics, the opportunity to edit the Journal of Law and Economics was instrumental in bringing him to the University of Chicago:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[W]hen I was approached to fill Aaron Director's place on his retirement, what I found most attractive about coming to Chicago was the opportunity it gave me of editing the Journal. Indeed, it is probable that without the Journal I would not have come to Chicago. I knew nothing of the original aim of the Journal. What I wanted to do was to encourage the type of research which I had advocated in 'The Problem of Social Cost', and I used my editorship of the Journal as a means of bringing this about.\nCoase believed that the University of Chicago was the intellectual center of law and economics. He concluded his Simons lecture by stating:\nI am very much aware that, in concentrating in this lecture on law and economics at Chicago, I have neglected other significant contributions to the subject made elsewhere such as those by Guido Calabresi at Yale, by Donald Turner at Harvard, and by others. But it can hardly be denied that in the emergence of the subject of law and economics, Chicago has played a very significant part and one of which the University can be proud.\nCoase theorem.\nIn law and economics, the Coase theorem () describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities. The theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property. In practice, obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent Coasean bargaining. This 'theorem' is commonly attributed to Coase.\nCoase conjecture.\nAnother important contribution of Coase is the Coase conjecture, which is an informal argument that durable goods monopolists do not have market power because they are unable to commit to not lowering their prices in future periods.\nPolitical views.\nWhen asked what he considered his politics to be, Coase stated,\nI really don't know. I don't reject any policy without considering what its results are. If someone says there's going to be regulation, I don't say that regulation will be bad. Let's see. What we discover is that most regulation does produce, or has produced in recent times, a worse result. But I wouldn't like to say that all regulation would have this effect because one can think of circumstances in which it doesn't.\nCoase admitted that early in life, he aligned himself with socialism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; As a young man I was a Socialist. The first challenge to this belief came when, in 1931, 5 months before I took the final examinations for the B.Com. degree, I attended Arnold Plant's seminar at the London School of Economics (LSE). He introduced me to Adam Smith's invisible hand and to the advantages of a competitive system. He also pointed out that government schemes in the economic sphere were often ill-conceived and were introduced to placate special interests. I adopted many of Plant's positions but continued to regard myself as a Socialist. That this meant holding what could be considered, and were, inconsistent positions was not unusual at that time. Abba Lerner, a fellow student and a fine theorist, with whom I had a very friendly relation, also believed in the virtues of a competitive system but was even more attached to Socialism than I was.\nGuido Calabresi wrote that Coase's focus on transaction costs in \"The Nature of the Firm\" was the result of his socialist beliefs. Reflecting on this, Coase wrote: \"It is very difficult to know where one's ideas come from but for all I know he may well be right.\" Coase continued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; My socialist sympathies gradually fell away and this process was accentuated as a result of being assigned in 1935 at LSE the course on the Economics of Public Utilities. I soon found out that very little was known about British public utilities and I set about making a series of historical studies on the water, gas, and electricity supply industries and of the Post Office and broadcasting.\nThese researches taught me much about the public utility industries and they certainly made me aware of the defects of government operation of these industries, whether municipal or through nationalisation. These researches were interrupted by the war, when I joined the civil service, at first, for a short period, in the Forestry Commission, then responsible for timber production, and for the rest of the war, in the Central Statistical Office, one of the offices of the War Cabinet. This war-time experience did not significantly influence my views but I could not help noticing that, with the country in mortal danger and despite the leadership of Winston Churchill, government departments often seemed more concerned to defend their own interests than those of the country.\nRonald Coase Institute.\nCoase was research advisor to the Ronald Coase Institute, an organisation that promotes research on institutions and organizations \u2013 the laws, rules, customs, and norms \u2013 that govern real economic systems, with particular support for young scholars from developing and transitional countries.\nCoase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics.\nThe University of Chicago Law School carries on the legacy of Ronald Coase through the mission of the Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics. Each year, the University of Chicago Law School hosts the Coase Lecture, which was delivered in 2003 by Ronald Coase himself.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These underpin applications to both to chemistry with NMR spectroscopy and to medicine with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nHe humbly referred to himself as a \"tool-maker\" rather than a scientist.\nEarly life.\nErnst was born in Winterthur, Switzerland on 14 August 1933 to Robert Ernst and Irma Ernst-Brunner. He was the oldest of three children of Irma Brunner and Robert Ernst. He grew up in a house built in 1898 by his grandfather, who was a merchant. During his childhood, he was interested in music, playing the violoncello and even considering a career as a musical composer. At 13-years old, Ernst stumbled upon a box of chemicals belonging to his late uncle, a metallurgical engineer. Young Ernst was excited by what he found, and set about trying all conceivable reactions, some of which resulted in explosions that terrified his parents.\nEducation.\nHe enrolled in the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich to study chemistry and received his diploma in 1957 as a \u201cDiplomierter Ingenieur Chemiker\". He was disappointed in the course content, so conducted further research and taught himself quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in his spare time. After a break to complete his military service, Ernst earned his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1962 from ETH Zurich. His dissertation was on nuclear magnetic resonance in the field of physical chemistry.\nCareer.\nErnst entered Varian Associates as a scientist in 1963 and invented Fourier transform NMR, noise decoupling, and a number of other methods. He returned to ETH Zurich in 1968 and became a lecturer. His career developed into assistant professor in 1970 and associate professor in 1972. From 1976, Richard R. Ernst was Full Professor of Physical Chemistry.\nErnst led a research group dedicated to magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and was the director of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory at the ETH Zurich. He developed two-dimensional NMR and several novel pulse techniques. He retired in 1998. He participated in the development of medical magnetic resonance tomography, as well as the NMR structure determination of biopolymers in solution collaborating with Professor Kurt W\u00fcthrich. He also participated in the study of intra-molecular dynamics.\nAwards and honours.\nErnst was a foreign fellow of the Estonian Academy of Sciences (elected 2002), the US National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Academy of Sciences, London, the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Korean Academy of Science and Technology and Bangladesh Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1993. He was awarded the John Gamble Kirkwood Medal in 1989.\nIn 1991, Ernst was on an aeroplane flying over the Atlantic when he discovered he had been awarded The Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He was invited into the cockpit, where he was given a radio to talk to the Nobel committee. Here they told him he was being honoured \"for his contributions to the development of the methodology of high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy\".\nErnst was a member of the World Knowledge Dialogue Scientific Board. He was awarded the Marcel Benoist Prize in 1986, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1991, and Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize of Columbia University in 1991. He was also awarded the Tadeus Reichstein Medal in 2000 and the Order of the Star of Romania in 2004. He also held Honorary Doctorates from the Technical University of Munich, EPF Lausanne, University of Zurich, University Antwerpen, Babes-Bolyai University, and University Montpellier.\nThe 2009 Bel Air Film Festival featured the world premiere of a documentary film on Ernst \"Science Plus Dharma Equals Social Responsibility\". Produced by Carlo Burton, the film takes place in Ernst's hometown in Switzerland. In 2022, another movie about Richard R. Ernst premiered at the Cameo cinema in Winterthur, produced by Lukas Schwarzenbacher and Susanne Schmid. The documentary contains a retrospective of Richard R. Ernsts life, which was filmed only a few months before his death.\nPersonal life.\nErnst was married to Magdalena (Kielholz) until his death. Together, they had three children: Anna Magdalena, Katharina Elisabeth and Hans-Martin Walter. Besides toiling with his work, Ernst also enjoyed music and art, specifically Tibetan scroll art. Using scientific techniques, Ernst would research the pigments on the scrolls to learn about their geographic origin and age.\nErnst died on 4 June 2021 in Winterthur at the age of 87.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are five functions in the family: RIPEMD, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320, of which RIPEMD-160 is the most common.\nThe original RIPEMD, as well as RIPEMD-128, is not considered secure because 128-bit result is too small and also (for the original RIPEMD) because of design weaknesses. The 256- and 320-bit versions of RIPEMD provide the same level of security as RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160, respectively; they are designed for applications where the security level is sufficient but longer hash result is necessary.\nWhile RIPEMD functions are less popular than SHA-1 and SHA-2, they are used, among others, in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin.\nHistory.\nThe original RIPEMD function was designed in the framework of the EU project RIPE (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation) in 1992. Its design was based on the MD4 hash function. In 1996, in response to security weaknesses found in the original RIPEMD, Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Leuven, Belgium published four strengthened variants: RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320.\nIn August 2004, a collision was reported for the original RIPEMD.

In Germany, Roman law practice remained in place longer under the Holy Roman Empire (963\u20131806). Roman law thus served as a basis for legal practice throughout Western continental Europe, as well as in most former colonies of these European nations, including Latin America, and also in Ethiopia.\nEnglish and Anglo-American common law were influenced also by Roman law, notably in their Latinate legal glossary. Eastern Europe was also influenced by the jurisprudence of the , especially in countries such as medieval Romania, which created a new legal system comprising a mixture of Roman and local law.\nAfter the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Roman law remained in effect in the Byzantine Empire. From the 7th century onward, the legal language in the East was Greek, with Eastern European law continuing to be influenced by Byzantine law.\nDevelopment.\nThe jurist Sextus Pomponius said, \"At the beginning of our city, the people began their first activities without any fixed law, and without any fixed rights: all things were ruled despotically, by kings\".\nBefore the Twelve Tables (i.e between 754 and 449 BC), private law comprised the Roman civil law (\"ius civile Quiritium\") that applied only to Roman citizens and was bonded to religion. The \"ius civile\" of the time was undeveloped, with attributes of strict formalism, symbolism, and conservatism, for example, as embodied in the ritual practice of \"mancipatio\". It is believed that Roman law is rooted in the Etruscan religion, emphasizing ritual.\nTwelve Tables.\nThe first legal text of the Roman law is the Law of the Twelve Tables, dating from the mid-fifth century BC. The plebeian tribune, C. Terentilius Arsa, proposed that the law should be written in order to prevent magistrates from applying the law arbitrarily. After eight years of political struggle, the plebeian social class convinced the patricians to send a delegation to Athens to copy the Laws of Solon; they also dispatched delegations to other Greek cities for a like reason.\nIn 451 BC, according to the traditional story, according to Livy, ten Roman citizens were chosen to record the laws, known as the \"decemviri legibus scribundis\". While they were performing this task, they were given supreme political power (\"imperium\"), whereas the power of the magistrates was restricted. In 450 BC, the \"decemviri\" produced a set of laws inscribed on ten tablets (\"tabulae\"), which were considered unsatisfactory by the plebeians. A second \"decemvirate\" is said to have added two additional tablets in 449 BC. The resulting \"Law of the Twelve Tables\" was subsequently approved by the people\u2019s assembly.\nModern scholars tend to challenge the accuracy of Latin historians. They generally do not believe that a second decemvirate ever took place. The decemvirate of 451 BC is believed to have assumed the leading functions in Rome and included the most controversial points of customary law. Questions concerning Greek influence on early Roman Law are still much discussed. Many scholars consider it unlikely that the patricians sent an official delegation to Greece, as the Latin historians believed. Rather, the Romans acquired Greek legislations from the Greek cities of Magna Graecia, the main portal between the Roman and Greek worlds.\nThe original text of the Twelve Tables has not been preserved. The tablets were probably destroyed when Rome was conquered and burned by the Gauls in 387 BC. The fragments which did survive show that it was not a law code in the modern sense. It did not provide a complete and coherent system of all applicable rules or give legal solutions for all possible cases. Rather, the tables contained specific provisions designed to change the then-existing customary law. Although the provisions pertain to all areas of law, the largest part is dedicated to private law and civil procedure.\nEarly republican law.\nAmong the most consequential laws passed during the early Republic were the \"Lex Canuleia\" (445 BC), which allowed marriage \"(conubium)\" between patricians and plebeians; the \"Leges Liciinae Sextiae\" (367 BC), which restricted the amount of public land \"(ager publicus)\" that any citizen could occupy, and stipulated that one of the two annual consuls must be plebeian; the \"Lex Ogulnia\" (300 BC), which permitted plebeians to hold certain priestly offices as pontiffs or augurs; and the \"Lex Hortensia\" (287 BC), which stated that the determinations of plebeian assemblies \"(plebiscita)\" would henceforth be binding on the entire \"populus Romanus\", both patricians and plebeians.\nAnother important statute from the Republican era is the \"Lex Aquilia\" of 286 BC, which may be regarded as the root of modern tort law.\nJurisprudence.\nRome's most important contribution to European legal culture was not the enactment of well-drafted statutes, but the emergence of a class of professional jurists (\"prudentes\" or \"jurisprudentes\", sing. \"prudens\") and of a legal science. This was achieved in a gradual process of applying the scientific methods of Greek philosophy to the subject of law, a subject which the Greeks themselves never treated as a science.\nTraditionally, the origins of Roman legal science are connected to Gnaeus Flavius. Around the year 300 BC, Flavius is said to have published the formularies containing the words which had to be spoken in court to begin a legal action. Before the time of Flavius, these formularies are said to have been secret and known only to the priests. Their publication made it possible for non-priests to explore the meaning of these legal texts. Whether or not this story is credible, jurists were active, and legal treatises were written in larger numbers before the 2nd century BC. Among the famous jurists of the republican period are Quintus Mucius Scaevola, who wrote an influential and voluminous treatise on all aspects of the law, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a friend of Marcus Tullius Cicero. Thus, Rome had developed a very sophisticated legal system and a refined legal culture when the Roman republic was replaced by the monarchical system of the Principate in 27 BC.\nPre-classical period.\nIn the period between about 201 to 27 BC, more flexible laws developed to match the needs of the time. In addition to the old and formal \"ius civile\", a new juridical class was created: the \"ius honorarium\": \"The law introduced by the magistrates who had the right to promulgate edicts in order to support, supplement or correct the existing law.\" With this new law the old formalism was abandoned, and more flexible principles of \"ius gentium\" (\"law of the nations\") were used.\nThe adaptation of law to new needs was given over to juridical practice, to magistrates, and especially to the praetors. Though the praetors were not legislators and did not technically create new law when he issued his edicts (\"magistratuum edicta\"), the results of his rulings enjoyed legal protection (\"actionem dare\") and were in effect often the source of new legal rules. A praetor's successor was not bound by the edicts of his predecessor. However, he did take rules from edicts of his predecessor that had proved to be useful. In this way a constant content was created that proceeded from edict to edict (\"edictum traslatitium\").\nThus, over the course of time, parallel to the civil law and supplementing and correcting it, a new body of praetoric law emerged. In fact, praetoric law was so defined by the famous Roman jurist Papinian (142\u2013212 AD): \"Ius praetorium est quod praetores introduxerunt adiuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia propter utilitatem publicam\" (\"praetoric law is that law introduced by praetors to supplement or correct civil law for public benefit\"). Ultimately, civil law and praetoric law were fused in the .\nClassical Roman law.\nThe first 250 years of the current era are the period during which Roman law and Roman legal science reached its greatest degree of sophistication and influence. The law of this period is often referred to as the \"classical period of Roman law\". The Roman Republic had three different branches: the Assemblies, the Senate, and the Consuls. The assemblies passed laws and made declarations of war; the Senate controlled the treasury; and the consuls had the highest juridical power.\nThe jurists worked in different functions, including giving legal opinions at the request of private parties; advising magistrates, especially the praetors; and helping the praetors draft their edicts, in which they publicly announced, at the beginning of their tenure, how they would handle their duties, and the formularies, according to which specific proceedings were conducted. Some jurists also held high judicial and administrative offices themselves.\nThe jurists also produced various legal punishments. Around 130 AD, the jurist Salvius Iulianus drafted a standard form of the praetor's edict, which was used by all praetors from that time onwards. This edict contained detailed descriptions of all cases, in which the praetor would allow a legal action and in which he would grant a defense. The standard edict thus functioned like a comprehensive law code, even though it did not formally have the force of law. It indicated the requirements for a successful legal claim. The edict therefore became the basis for extensive legal commentaries by later classical jurists like Paulus and Ulpian.\nDuring the pre-classical and classical period, such laws emerged as the separation of ownership and possession; contract and tort as distinct sources of obligations; standard types of contracts (sale, contract for work, hire, contract for services) regulated in most continental codes; the Institutes of Gaius, which invented a system of private law based on the division of all material into \"personae\" (persons), \"res\" (things) and \"actiones\" (legal actions). Gaius's system was used for many centuries, and has been recognized in legal treatises like William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" and enactments like the French Code civil and the German BGB.\nPost-classical law.\nBy the middle of the 3rd century, the conditions for the flourishing of a refined legal culture had become less favourable. The general political and economic situation deteriorated as the emperors assumed more direct control of all aspects of political life. The political system of the Principate, which had retained some features of the republican constitution, began to transform itself into the absolute monarchy of the Dominate. The existence of legal science and of jurists who regarded law as a science, not as an instrument to achieve the political goals set by the absolute monarch, did not fit well into the new order of things. Jurisprudential literary production all but ended. Few jurists after the mid-3rd century are known by name. While legal science and legal education persisted to some extent in the eastern part of the Empire, most of the subtleties of classical law came to be disregarded and finally forgotten in the west. Classical law was replaced by the so-called vulgar law of the late Roman Empire.\nByzantine law.\nWhen the centre of the Empire was moved to the Greek East in the 4th century, many legal concepts of Greek origin appeared in the official Roman legislation. The influence is visible even in the law of persons or of the family, traditionally the part of the law that changes least. For example, Constantine started putting restrictions on the ancient Roman concept of \"patria potestas\", the power held by the male head of a family over his descendants, by acknowledging that persons \"in potestate\", the descendants, could have proprietary rights. He was apparently making concessions to the much stricter concept of paternal authority under Greek-Hellenistic law. The \"Codex Theodosianus\" (438 AD) was a codification of Constantian laws. Later emperors went even further, until Justinian finally decreed that a child \"in potestate\" became owner of everything it acquired, except when it acquired something from its father.\nThe codes of Justinian, particularly the (529\u2013534) continued to be the basis of legal practice in the Empire throughout its so-called \"Byzantine\" history. Leo III the Isaurian issued a new code, the \"Ecloga\", in the early 8th century. In the 9th century, the emperors Basil I and Leo VI the Wise commissioned a combined translation of the Code and the Digest, parts of Justinian's codes, into Greek, which became known as the \"Basilica\". Roman law as preserved in the codes of Justinian and in the Basilica remained the basis of legal practice in Greece and in the courts of the Eastern Orthodox Church even after the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the conquest by the Turks, and, along with the Syro-Roman law book, also formed the basis for much of the \"Fetha Negest\", which remained in force in Ethiopia until 1931.\nSubstance.\nConcept of laws.\nThe 2nd-century Roman jurist Ulpian, however, divided law into three branches: natural law, which existed in nature and governed animals as well as humans; the law of nations, which was distinctively human; and, civil law, which was the body of laws specific to a people.\n\"Ius civile\" (\"citizen law\", originally ius civile Quiritium) was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens and the \"Praetores Urbani\", the individuals who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. \"Ius gentium\" (\"law of peoples\") was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens. The \"Praetores Peregrini\" were the individuals who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. \"Ius naturale\" (\"natural law\") was the concept that all persons had a kind of common sense, which the jurists developed to explain why all people seemed to obey some laws.\n\"Ius scriptum\" (\"written law\") was the body of statute laws made by the legislature, known as \"leges\" (lit.\u2009'laws') and \"plebiscita\" (lit.\u2009'plebiscites', originating in the Plebeian Council). Roman lawyers would also include in the \"ius scriptum\" the edicts of magistrates (\"magistratuum edicta\"), the advice of the Senate (), the responses and thoughts of jurists (\"responsa prudentium\"), and the proclamations and beliefs of the emperor (\"principum placita\"). \"Ius non scriptum\" (\"unwritten law\") was the body of common laws that arose from customary practice and had become binding over time.\n\"Ius singulare\" (\"singular law\") was the special law for certain groups of people, things, or legal relations, as exceptional from the general rules of the legal system. For example, the ius singulare about wills written by people in the military during a campaign exempted them from the solemnities generally required for citizens when writing wills in normal circumstances. (\"common law\") was the general, ordinary, law, as distinct from \"ius singulare\".\n\"Ius publicum\" (\"public law\") was the law that protected the interests of the Roman state. Roman criminal law was mostly private, with only the most severe crimes prosecuted by the state. \"Ius publicum\" was also used to describe obligatory legal regulations (today called \"ius cogens\"). \"Ius privatum\" (\"private law\") was the law that protected individuals, which included personal, property, civil and criminal law as well as the procedural law of judicial proceedings (\"iudicium privatum\").\nPublic law.\nThe Roman Republic's constitution or \"mos maiorum\" (\"custom of the ancestors\") was an unwritten, informal, and unofficial set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, constantly evolving throughout the life of the Republic.\nThroughout the 1st century BC, the power and legitimacy of the Roman constitution progressively eroded. Even Roman constitutionalists, such as the senator Cicero, lost a willingness to remain faithful to it towards the end of the Republic. When the Roman Republic ultimately fell in the years following the Battle of Actium and Mark Antony's suicide, what was left of the Roman constitution died along with the Republic. The first Roman emperor, Augustus, attempted to manufacture the appearance of a constitution that still governed the Empire, by utilising that constitution's institutions to lend legitimacy to the Principate, e.g., reusing prior grants of greater \"imperium\" to substantiate Augustus' greater \"imperium\" over the imperial provinces and the prorogation of different magistracies to justify Augustus' receipt of tribunician power. The belief in a surviving constitution lasted well into the life of the Roman Empire.\nConcepts that originated in the Roman constitution live on in constitutions to this day. Examples include checks and balances, the separation of powers, vetoes, filibusters, quorum requirements, term limits, impeachments, the powers of the purse, and regularly scheduled elections. Even some lesser used modern constitutional concepts, such as the block voting found in the electoral college of the United States, originate from ideas found in the Roman constitution.\nPrivate law.\n\"Stipulatio\" was the basic form of contract in Roman law. It was made in the format of question and answer. The precise nature of the contract is disputed.\n\"Rei vindicatio\" is a legal action by which the plaintiff demands that the defendant return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff. It was only used when the plaintiff owns the thing, and the defendant somehow impeded the plaintiff's possession of the thing. The plaintiff could also institute an \"actio furti\", a personal action, to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, the plaintiff could also claim damages from the defendant with the aid of the \"condictio furtiva\", another personal action. With the aid of the \"actio legis Aquiliae\", another personal action, the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant. \"Rei vindicatio\" was derived from the \"ius civile\", and was only available to Roman citizens.\nStatus.\nA person's abilities and duties within the Roman legal system depended on their legal \"status\". The individual could have been a Roman citizen (\"status civitatis\"), unlike a foreigner; been free (\"status libertatis\"), unlike slaves; or had a certain position in a Roman family (\"status familiae\") either as the head of the family (\"pater familias\") or some lower member (\"alieni iuris\" \"one who lives under someone else's law\").\nLitigation.\nThe history of Roman Law can be divided into three systems of procedure: \"legis actiones\", the \"formulary system\", and \"cognitio extra ordinem\". The periods in which these systems were in use overlapped and did not have definitive breaks. Roughly, \"legis actio\" system prevailed from the time of the XII Tables (c.\u2009450 BC) until about the end of the 2nd century BC; the formulary procedure was primarily used from the last century of the Republic until the end of the classical period (c.\u2009AD 200); and \"cognitio extra ordinem\" was used in post-classical times.\nDuring the republic and until the bureaucratization of Roman judicial procedure, the judge was usually a private person (\"iudex privatus\"). He had to be a Roman male citizen. The parties could agree on a judge, or they could appoint one from a list of judges known as the \"album iudicum\". They went down the list until they found a judge agreeable to both parties, or if none could be found they had to take the last one on the list.\nNo one had a legal obligation to judge a case. Judges had great latitude in the way they conducted litigation. He considered all the evidence and ruled in the way that seemed just. Because the judge was not a jurist or a legal technician, he often consulted a jurist about the technical aspects of the case, but he was not bound by the jurist's reply. At the end of the litigation, if things were not clear to him, he could refuse to give a judgment, by swearing that it wasn't clear. Also, there was a maximum time to issue a judgment, which depended on some technical issues of law.\nLater on, with the bureaucratization, this procedure disappeared, and was substituted by the so-called \"extra ordinem\" procedure, also known as the cognitory system. The whole case was reviewed before a magistrate in a single phase. The magistrate had obligation to judge and to issue a decision, and the decision could be appealed to a higher magistrate.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;German legal theorist Rudolf von Jhering famously remarked that ancient Rome had conquered the world three times: the first through its armies, the second through its religion, the third through its laws. He might have added: each time more thoroughly.\nIn the West.\nIn the west, Justinian's political authority never went any farther than certain portions of the Italian and Hispanic peninsulas. In Law codes issued by the Germanic kings, however, the influence of early Eastern Roman codes on some of these is discernible. In many early Germanic states, Roman citizens continued to be governed by Roman laws for quite some time, even while members of the various Germanic tribes were governed by their own respective codes.\nThe \"Codex Justinianus,\" Institutes of Justinian, and the earlier code of Theodosius II were well-known in Western Europe and served as models for a few of the Germanic law codes. However, the \"Digest\" portion was largely ignored for several centuries until around 1070, when a manuscript of the \"Digest\" was rediscovered in Italy. This was done mainly through the works of glossars who wrote their comments between lines (\"glossa interlinearis\"), or in the form of marginal notes (\"glossa marginalis\"). From that time, scholars began to study the ancient Roman legal texts, and to teach others what they learned from their studies. The center of these studies was Bologna. The law school there gradually developed into Europe's first university.\nThere are several reasons that Roman law was favored in the Middle Ages. Roman law regulated the legal protection of property and the equality of legal subjects and their wills, and it prescribed the possibility that the legal subjects could dispose their property through testament. The students who were taught Roman law in Bologna (and later in many other places) found that many rules of Roman law were better suited to regulate complex economic transactions than the customary rules applicable throughout Europe. For this reason, Roman law, or at least some provisions borrowed from it, began to be re-introduced into legal practice, centuries after the end of the Roman empire. This process was actively supported by many kings and princes who employed university-trained jurists as counselors and court officials and sought to benefit from rules like \"princeps legibus solutus est\" (\"The sovereign is not bound by the laws\", a phrase initially coined by Ulpian, a Roman jurist).\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the rediscovered Roman law dominated the legal practice of many European countries. A legal system, in which Roman law was mixed with elements of canon law and of Germanic custom, especially feudal law, had emerged. This legal system, which was common to all of continental Europe (and Scotland) was known as . This \"Ius Commune\" and the legal systems based on it are usually referred to as civil law in English-speaking countries.\nOnly England and the Nordic countries did not take part in the wholesale reception of Roman law. One reason for this is that the English legal system was more developed than its continental counterparts by the time Roman law was rediscovered. Therefore, the practical advantages of Roman law were less obvious to English practitioners than to continental lawyers. As a result, the English system of common law developed in parallel to Roman-based civil law, with its practitioners being trained at the Inns of Court in London rather than receiving degrees in Canon or Civil Law at the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge. Elements of Romano-canon law were present in England in the ecclesiastical courts and, less directly, through the development of the equity system. In addition, some concepts from Roman law made their way into the common law. Especially in the early 19th century, English lawyers and judges were willing to borrow rules and ideas from continental jurists and directly from Roman law.\nThe practical application of Roman law, and the era of the European \"Ius Commune\", came to an end when national codifications were made. In 1804, the French civil code came into force. In the course of the 19th century, many European states either adopted the French model or drafted their own codes. In Germany, the political situation made the creation of a national code of laws impossible. From the 17th century, Roman law in Germany had been heavily influenced by domestic (customary) law, and it was called \"usus modernus Pandectarum\". In some parts of Germany, Roman law continued to be applied until the German civil code (B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) went into effect in 1900.\nColonial expansion spread the civil law system.\nToday.\nToday, Roman law is no longer applied in legal practice, even though the legal systems of some countries like South Africa and San Marino are still based on the old \"jus commune\". However, even where the legal practice is based on a code, many rules deriving from Roman law apply: no code completely broke with the Roman tradition. Rather, the provisions of the Roman law were fitted into a more coherent system and expressed in the national language. For this reason, knowledge of the Roman law is indispensable to understand the legal systems of today. Thus, Roman law is often still a mandatory subject for law students in civil law jurisdictions. In this context, the annual International Roman Law Moot Court was developed in order to better educate the students and to network with one another internationally.\nAs steps towards a unification of the private law in the member states of the European Union are being taken, the old \"jus commune\", which was the common basis of legal practice everywhere in Europe, but allowed for many local variants, is seen by many as a model.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for purportedly saving the life of his commanding officer, Stephen Decatur, during the First Barbary War in 1804, though most historians agree he was wrongly credited for the actions of shipmate Daniel Frazier.\nBiography.\nJames was born in Delaware around 1776. By 1799, he was serving in the United States Navy aboard the frigate during the Quasi-War with France, participating in the victories over \"L'Insurgente\" and \"La Vengeance\". During the First Barbary War, James was serving aboard the USS \"Enterprise\" when the frigate USS \"Philadelphia\" was captured by Barbary pirates after running aground near Tripoli, Libya.\nOn August 3, 1804, during the naval blockade of Tripoli, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a boarding party onto a Tripolitan gunboat that he believed was crewed by the men who had feigned surrender before mortally wounding his brother. While a wounded Decatur was locked in combat with the Tripolitan commander, another enemy sailor swung his sword at him. The Tripolitan's blow was intercepted by a sailor in Decatur's party who had sacrificed himself, suffering a head wound as a result.\nMany traditional accounts credit James with saving Decatur's life, while modern scholarship credits Quartermaster Daniel Frazier. As late as 1865, Rear Admiral Charles Stewart, a friend of Decatur's, said that \"...Reuben James, a sailor, thrust out his arm and had it cleaved off by the blade of the weapon intended for his commander.\" Yet James was one of the few Americans to survive the battle uninjured, while Dr. Lewis Heermann, the surgeon aboard the \"Enterprise\", described Frazier's injuries as \"two incised wounds on the head, one of them severe; one bad wound across the wrist, and seven slightly about his hands.\" W. M. P. Dunne, writing for \"Naval History\" magazine, calls James taking the blow meant for Decatur \"a myth.\" In 1937, Lieutenant Commander R. C. Bartman wrote that James and Frazier \"each might be worthy of recognition without detracting from the other.\" Both men have had U.S. Navy ships named for them.\nAfter the Barbary War, James continued his naval career, serving under Decatur during the War of 1812 aboard the , participating in its capture of the . James later served aboard the , and was taken prisoner when that vessel was captured by the British in January 1815. Later that year, he saw action in the Second Barbary War, sailing with Decatur in the fleet that captured the Algerian flagship \"Mashouda\". Declining health forced his retirement in 1836, and an old musket ball wound necessitated the amputation of a leg. James died on December 3, 1838 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington, D.C.\nHonors.\nThree United States Navy ships have been named the USS \"Reuben James\":\nJames Island in Washington state is also named for James.\nIn literature.\nAn 1895 poem by James Jeffrey Roche, \"Reuben James,\" chronicles the sailor's exploits in Tripoli.

{"id": "26367", "revid": "954590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26367", "title": "Rockwell International", "text": "Defunct American manufacturing conglomerate\nRockwell International was a major American manufacturing conglomerate. It was involved in aircraft, the space industry, defense and commercial electronics, components in the automotive industry, printing presses, avionics and industrial products. At its peak, Rockwell International was No. 27 on the \"Fortune\" 500 list, with assets of over $8\u00a0billion, sales of $27\u00a0billion and 115,000 employees.\nRockwell International's predecessor was Rockwell Manufacturing Company, founded in 1919 by Willard Rockwell. In 1968, Rockwell Manufacturing Company included seven operating divisions manufacturing industrial valves, German 2-cycle motors, power tools, gas and water meters. In 1973, it was combined with the aerospace products and renamed Rockwell International. It was split into various companies beginning in the 1980s, including its final split in 2001 into Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins.\nHistory.\nRockwell Manufacturing Company.\nBoston-born Willard Rockwell (1888\u20131978) made his fortune with the invention and successful launch of a new bearing system for truck axles in 1919. He merged his Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based operation with the Timken-Detroit Axle Company (current Meritor Inc.) in 1928, rising to become chairman of its board in 1940.\nRockwell also drew on the strengths of several of George Westinghouse's concerns, and Westinghouse is considered a co-founder of the company.\nIn 1945, Rockwell Manufacturing Company acquired Delta Machinery and renamed it the Delta Power Tool Division of Rockwell Manufacturing Company and continued to manufacture in Milwaukee. In 1966, Rockwell invented the world's first power miter saw. In 1981, Rockwell's power tool group was acquired by Pentair and re-branded \"Delta Machinery\". Pentair's Tools group was acquired by Black &amp; Decker in 2005. Since 2011, Delta has been a subsidiary of Chang Type Industrial Co., Ltd. of China.\nIn 1956, Rockwell Manufacturing Co. bought Walker-Turner from Kearney and Trecker. In 1957, Walker-Turner operations were closed down in Plainfield, New Jersey and moved to Bellefontaine, Ohio and Tupelo, Mississippi.\nTimken-Detroit merged in 1953 with the Standard Steel Spring Company, forming the Rockwell Spring and Axle Company. After various mergers with automotive suppliers, it comprised about 10 to 20 factories in the Upper Midwestern U.S. and southern Ontario, and in 1958 renamed itself Rockwell-Standard Corporation.\nPittsburgh-based Rockwell-Standard Corp. then acquired and merged with Los Angeles-based North American Aviation to form North American Rockwell in September 1967. It then purchased Miehle-Goss-Dexter, the largest supplier of printing presses, and in 1973, acquired Collins Radio, a major avionics supplier.\nIn 1968, Sterling Faucet Company was bought by Rockwell Manufacturing Co. and it became a subsidiary of the company.\n1968\u20131974.\nMichael W. Hodges (who had also served as Corporate Director Manufacturing and later as CEO and 'Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer' (Managing Director) of the German-based Engine Division) joined Rockwell Manufacturing Company in 1968 as Corporate Director Quality Assurance. He was appointed member of the Board of Directors of Rockwell GmbH Germany and Dikkers Valve Products LLC Netherlands. Prior to Rockwell, Michael Hodges was a physicist with NASA and aerospace management with Martin-Marietta Corp. in Orlando, Florida.\nDuring Hodges' seven years with Rockwell there were approximately 90,000 employees in seven divisions: the Valve Division with products for the gas and oil industry with plants located in Barberton, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, Sulphur Springs, Texas, and Kearney, Nebraska, the Gas Products Division of meters and regulators in Dubois, Pennsylvania, the Municipal Water Meter Division in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the Power Tool Division in Syracuse, New York, Jackson, Tennessee, Tupelo, Mississippi, and Columbia, South Carolina, the Transportation Division in Atchison, Kansas with a large steel foundry of products for the automotive, railway and rapid-transit industry, the Sterling Faucet Division in Reedsville, West Virginia, and the Engine Division in Pinneberg, Germany (previously ILO-Motorenwerke, founded 1911 and acquired by Rockwell in 1959), manufacturing 2-cycle gas-driven motors for developing nation products including motor tillers, water pumps, sprayers, cement mixers, tampers and mopeds as well as snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle engines for North America.\nA significantly different direction was planned starting in 1973 away from the business model developed since 1945 by the founder Willard Rockwell (1888\u20131978). The founder's son, Willard Rockwell Jr., appeared taking the company in a new direction, replacing the founder's model of strong medium-size manufacturing companies with diverse industrial products with strong industrial engineering and quality control in multiple locations \u2013 to a new model leveraging assets of the profitable seven manufacturing divisions of Rockwell Manufacturing Company into a new business model of a dominant government-serving (NASA, Defense Dept.) aerospace company, named Rockwell International, which included North American Aviation, of products such as the Space Shuttle. By the end of the 1980s, Rockwell International began to sell-off its prior industrial product manufacturing divisions, starting with the Valve Division, leading to the sale of all divisions and the end of the Rockwell names &gt; Rockwell Manufacturing Company, North American Rockwell, and Rockwell International.\nApex and break-up.\nIn 1978, Rockwell released AIM-65, a one board microprocessor development board based on the MOS Technology 6502. With the death of company founder and first CEO Willard F. Rockwell in 1978, and the stepping down of his son Willard Rockwell Jr. in 1979 as the second CEO, Bob Anderson became CEO and led the company through the 1980s when it became the largest U.S. defense contractor and largest NASA contractor. Rockwell acquired the privately held Allen-Bradley Company for US$1.6billion (roughly $billion today) in February1985, of which $1billion ($billion today) was cash, and became a producer of industrial automation hardware and software.\nDuring the 1980s, Anderson, his CFO Bob dePalma, and the Rockwell management team built the company to #27 on the \"Fortune\" 500 list. It boasted sales of US$12billion (roughly $billion today), and assets of over $8billion ($billion today). Its workforce of over 115,000 was organized into nine major divisions: Space, Aircraft, Defense Electronics, Commercial Electronics, Light Duty Automotive Components, Heavy Duty Automotive Components, Printing Presses, Valves and Meters, and Industrial Automation. Rockwell International was a major employer in southern California, northern Ohio, northern Georgia, eastern Oklahoma, Michigan, western Texas, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and western Pennsylvania.\nAnderson stepped down as CEO in February 1988, leaving the company to president Donald R. Beall. The completion of the Space Shuttle program and the completion of the B-1 bomber program had led to a decline in revenues, and Beall sought to diversify the company away from government contracts. The end of the Cold War and the perceived \"peace dividend\", however, prompted accelerated divestitures and sweeping management reforms. From 1988 to 2001 the company moved its headquarters four times: from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where it had been for decades to El Segundo, California to Seal Beach, California to Costa Mesa, California to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nAt the end of the 1980s, the company sold its valve and meter division, formerly Rockwell Manufacturing, to British Tyre &amp; Rubber. Although Rockwell was the #1 Defense and NASA contractor, the \"peace dividend\" perceived after the fall of the Soviet bloc, led the company to sell its defense and aerospace business, including what was once North American Aviation, the Defense Electronics Division and Rocketdyne, to Boeing in December 1996. In the 1990s, the company spun off its semiconductor products as Conexant Technologies (CNXT), later bought by Synaptics in 2017. Rockwell International also spun off its two automotive divisions (light vehicles division and heavy vehicles division) as one publicly traded company, Meritor Automotive, based in Troy, Michigan, which then merged with Arvin Industries to form Arvin Meritor. That company is now known as Meritor, Inc. In 1996, Rockwell International sold Graphic Systems (formerly Miehle-Goss-Dexter), an Illinois-based newspaper and commercial printing press manufacturer, to its internal management team Stonington Partners as part of a new corporation for US$600 million.\nIn 2001, what remained of Rockwell International was split into two publicly traded companies, Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins, ending the run of what had once been a massive and diverse conglomerate. The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of the old Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off.\nIn the end, the result had been four spin-offs and three sales combined from Rockwell's nine divisions.\nThe various Rockwell companies list a large number of technological firsts and historic developments in their histories, including the World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter and B-25 Mitchell bomber, the Korean War-era F-86 Sabre fighter jet, America's first truly supersonic fighter, the F-100 Super Sabre, and the B-1 Lancer bomber, as well as the Apollo spacecraft, the Space Shuttle orbiter, and most of the Navstar Global Positioning System satellites.\nRocketdyne, which had been spun off by North American in 1955, was re-merged into Rockwell, and by that time produced most of the rocket engines used in the United States. Rockwell also purchased the Aero Design and Engineering Company from William and Rufus Travis Amis. Rockwell redesigned the company's Aero Commander aircraft, introducing its new design as the Rockwell Commander 112 and Commander 114.\nThe company developed a desktop calculator based on a MOSFET chip for use by its engineers. In 1967 Rockwell set up its own manufacturing plant to produce them, starting North American Rockwell MicroElectronics Corp. (called NARMEC). This would later become Rockwell Semiconductor. One of its major successes came in the early 1990s when it introduced the first low-cost 14.4\u00a0kbit/s modem chipset, which was used in a huge number of modems.\nCollins radios were fitted to 80% of the airliners which were based in first-world countries. Collins designed and built the radios that communicated the Apollo Moon landings and the high-frequency radio network that allows worldwide communication with U.S. military aircraft. Rockwell's Rocketdyne division designed and built the third stage of the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, and the Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere inertial navigation system that provided its navigation. It also built inertial navigation systems for the fleet of ballistic missile submarines.\nIn addition to the manufacture of nuclear missiles and bombers, Rockwell also produced key components of the bombs they carried, including plutonium triggers at the Rocky Flats Plant on a rural site northwest of Denver, Colorado. Rockwell ran the weapons plant from 1975 to 1990, and was one of the subjects of the investigation of Special Grand Jury 89-2 into mismanagement of the plant. In 1990, a group of nearby homeowners filed a lawsuit against Rockwell and Dow Chemical Company, the plant's original operator, accusing them of reducing the value of their properties as a result of plutonium releases from the plant. A $375 million settlement was reached in 2016.\nRockwell built heavy-duty truck axles and drive-trains in the U.S., along with power windows, seats, and locks. The Rockwell Tripmaster trip recording system for commercial vehicles was released along with the Logtrak module for DOT log recording for fleets who successfully petitioned the DOT for paper logbook exemptions. Rockwell also built yachts and business jets and owned large amounts of real estate.\nIt was also involved in providing custom electronic intelligence equipment to the Imperial Iranian Air Force as part of Project Ibex and paid bribes to the Shah of Iran in order to secure contracts there.\nProducts.\nRocket propulsion (Rocketdyne division).\nFor a more extensive list, see .\nResearch laboratory.\nRockwell International had a major research laboratory complex in Thousand Oaks, Ventura County, California. It was founded and built by North American Aviation in 1962, as the North American Science Center. In 1973 it became the Rockwell International Science Center.\nThe laboratory did independent contract research for the U.S. Government, and also provided research services for the company's business units. It was famous for its research in: advanced materials, particularly ceramics; for its infrared imagers; for its research in liquid-crystal displays; and for its high-speed electronics. The laboratory invented Metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE), also commonly known as Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). It also achieved fame in selected areas of information science, notably human-computer interaction, augmented reality, multimedia systems, and diagnostics. Rockwell Science Center led the United States Army Research Laboratory's Advanced Displays Federated Laboratory Consortium in the late 1990s. In 2000, the infrared imaging division of the laboratory moved into a new building in Camarillo, California.\nAfter Rockwell International's breakup in 2001, the laboratory was spun off as a semi-autonomous company called Rockwell Scientific, half owned by Rockwell Collins and half owned by Rockwell Automation. In 2006, the main laboratory and infrared imaging division were sold to Teledyne Corporation. Teledyne made the laboratory complex in Thousand Oaks into its corporate headquarters. A reduced but active research and development operation continues there, under the name Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging, LLC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine, and Gascony; Lord of Cyprus; Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes; and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and was therefore not expected to become king, but his two elder brothers predeceased their father.\nBy the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. Richard was an important Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France. Despite achieving several victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, he was ultimately forced to end his campaign without retaking Jerusalem.\nRichard probably spoke both French and Occitan, and based on the testimony of Roger of Howden, most likely understood Middle English. He was born in England, where he spent his childhood; before becoming duke of Aquitaine, however, he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France. Following his accession to the crown of England, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his reign was spent on Crusade, in captivity, or actively defending the French portions of the Angevin Empire. Though regarded as a model king during the four centuries after his death and viewed as a pious hero by his subjects, he was later perceived by historians as a ruler who treated the kingdom of England merely as a source of revenue for his armies rather than a land entrusted to his stewardship. This \"Little England\" view of Richard has come under increasing scrutiny by modern historians, who view it as anachronistic. Richard I is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France.\nEarly life and accession in Aquitaine.\nChildhood.\nRichard was born on 8 September 1157, probably at Beaumont Palace, in Oxford, England, son of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was the younger brother of William, Henry the Young King, and Matilda; William died before Richard's birth. As a younger son of Henry II, Richard was not expected to ascend the throne. Four more children were born to King Henry and Queen Eleanor: Geoffrey, Eleanor, Joan, and John. Richard also had two half-sisters from his mother's first marriage to Louis VII of France: Marie and Alix.\nRichard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother. His father was Angevin-Norman and great-grandson of William the Conqueror. Contemporary historian Ralph de Diceto traced his family's lineage through Matilda of Scotland to the Anglo-Saxon kings of England and Alfred the Great, and from there legend linked them to Noah and Woden. According to Angevin family tradition, there was even 'infernal blood' in their ancestry, with a claimed descent from the fairy, or female demon, Melusine.\nWhile his father visited his lands from Scotland to France, Richard probably spent his childhood in England. His first recorded visit to the European continent was in May 1165, when his mother took him to Normandy. His wet nurse was Hodierna of St Albans, whom he gave a generous pension after he became king. Little is known about Richard's education. Although he was born in Oxford and brought up in England up to his eighth year, it is not known to what extent he used or understood English; he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in Limousin (\"lenga d'\u00f2c\") and also in French.\nDuring his captivity, English prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother John to help destroy the authority of Richard's chancellor, William Longchamp, who was a Norman. One of the specific charges laid against Longchamp, by John's supporter Hugh Nonant, was that he could not speak English. This indicates that by the late 12th century a knowledge of English was expected of those in positions of authority in England.\nRichard was said to be very attractive; his hair was between red and blond, and he was light-eyed with a pale complexion. According to Clifford Brewer, he was , although that is unverifiable since his remains have been lost since at least the French Revolution. John, his youngest brother, was known to be .\nThe \"Itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis Ricardi\", a Latin prose narrative of the Third Crusade, states that: \"He was tall, of elegant build; the colour of his hair was between red and gold; his limbs were supple and straight. He had long arms suited to wielding a sword. His long legs matched the rest of his body\".\nMarriage alliances were common among medieval royalty: they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each other's lands. In March 1159, it was arranged that Richard would marry one of the daughters of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona; however, these arrangements failed, and the marriage never took place. Henry the Young King was married to Margaret, daughter of Louis VII of France, on 2 November 1160. Despite this alliance between the Plantagenets and the Capetians, the dynasty on the French throne, the two houses were sometimes in conflict. In 1168, the intercession of Pope Alexander III was necessary to secure a truce between them. Henry II had conquered Brittany and taken control of Gisors and the Vexin, which had been part of Margaret's dowry.\nEarly in the 1160s there had been suggestions Richard should marry Alys, Countess of the Vexin, fourth daughter of Louis VII; because of the rivalry between the kings of England and France, Louis obstructed the marriage. A peace treaty was secured in January 1169 and Richard's betrothal to Alys was confirmed. Henry II planned to divide his and Eleanor's territories among their three eldest surviving sons: Henry would become King of England and have control of Anjou, Maine, and Normandy; Richard would inherit Aquitaine and Poitiers from his mother; and Geoffrey would become Duke of Brittany through marriage with Constance, heir presumptive of Conan IV. At the ceremony where Richard's betrothal was confirmed, he paid homage to the king of France for Aquitaine, thus securing ties of vassalage between the two.\nAfter Henry II fell seriously ill in 1170, he enacted his plan to divide his territories, although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories. His son Henry was crowned as heir apparent in June 1170, and in 1171 Richard left for Aquitaine with his mother, and Henry II gave him the duchy of Aquitaine at the request of Eleanor. Richard and his mother embarked on a tour of Aquitaine in 1171 in an attempt to pacify the locals. Together, they laid the foundation stone of St Augustine's Monastery in Limoges. In June 1172, at age 14, Richard was formally recognised as duke of Aquitaine and count of Poitou when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office; the ceremony took place in Poitiers and was repeated in Limoges, where he wore the ring of St Valerie, who was the personification of Aquitaine.\nRevolt against Henry II.\nAccording to Ralph of Coggeshall, Henry the Young King instigated a rebellion against Henry II; he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him, and to break away from his dependence on Henry II, who controlled the purse strings. There were rumors that Eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father.\nHenry the Young King abandoned his father and left for the French court, seeking the protection of Louis VII; his brothers Richard and Geoffrey soon followed him, while the five-year-old John remained in England. Louis gave his support to the three brothers and even knighted Richard, tying them together through vassalage.\nJordan Fantosme, a contemporary poet, described the rebellion as a \"war without love\".\nThe brothers made an oath at the French court that they would not make terms with Henry II without the consent of Louis VII and the French barons. With the support of Louis, Henry the Young King attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money; one such baron was Philip I, Count of Flanders, who was promised \u00a31,000 and several castles. The brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in England. Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester, joined forces with Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester, and William I of Scotland for a rebellion in Suffolk. The alliance with Louis was initially successful, and by July 1173 the rebels were besieging Aumale, Neuf-March\u00e9, and Verneuil, and Hugh de Kevelioc had captured Dol in Brittany. Richard went to Poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father. Eleanor was captured, so Richard was left to lead his campaign against Henry II's supporters in Aquitaine on his own. He marched to take La Rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants; he withdrew to the city of Saintes, which he established as a base of operations.\nIn the meantime, Henry II had raised a very expensive army of more than 20,000 mercenaries with which to face the rebellion. He marched on Verneuil, and Louis retreated from his forces. The army proceeded to recapture Dol and subdued Brittany. At this point Henry II made an offer of peace to his sons; on the advice of Louis the offer was refused. Henry II's forces took Saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison, although Richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers. He took refuge in Ch\u00e2teau de Taillebourg for the rest of the war. Henry the Young King and the Count of Flanders planned to land in England to assist the rebellion led by the Earl of Leicester. Anticipating this, Henry II returned to England with 500 soldiers and his prisoners (including Eleanor and his sons' wives and fianc\u00e9es), but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed. William I of Scotland and Hugh Bigod were captured on 13 and 25 July respectively. Henry II returned to France and raised the siege of Rouen, where Louis VII had been joined by Henry the Young King after abandoning his plan to invade England. Louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in September 1174, the Treaty of Montlouis.\nWhen Henry II and Louis VII made a truce on 8 September 1174, its terms specifically excluded Richard. Abandoned by Louis and wary of facing his father's army in battle, Richard went to Henry II's court at Poitiers on 23 September and begged for forgiveness, weeping and falling at the feet of Henry, who gave Richard the kiss of peace. Several days later, Richard's brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father. The terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict (when Richard was offered four castles in Aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy): Richard was given control of two castles in Poitou and half the income of Aquitaine; Henry the Young King was given two castles in Normandy; and Geoffrey was permitted half of Brittany. Eleanor remained Henry II's prisoner until his death, partly as insurance for Richard's good behaviour.\nFinal years of Henry II's reign.\nAfter the conclusion of the war, the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against Henry II began. The King travelled to Anjou for this purpose, and Geoffrey dealt with Brittany. In January 1175 Richard was dispatched to Aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him. The historian John Gillingham notes that the chronicle of Roger of Howden is the main source for Richard's activities in this period. According to the chronicle, most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in 15\u00a0days before the outbreak of war, while others were to be razed. Given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone, and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles, this was not an easy task. Roger of Howden records the two-month siege of Castillon-sur-Agen; while the castle was \"notoriously strong\", Richard's siege engines battered the defenders into submission.\nOn this campaign, Richard acquired the name \"the Lion\" or \"the Lionheart\" due to his noble, brave and fierce leadership. He is referred to as \"this our lion\" (\"hic leo noster\") as early as 1187 in the \"Topographia Hibernica\" of \"Giraldus Cambrensis\", while the byname \"lionheart\" (\"le quor de lion\") is first recorded in Ambroise's \"L'Estoire de la Guerre Sainte\" in the context of the Accon campaign of 1191.\nHenry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him. It was suspected that he had appropriated Alys of France, Richard's betrothed, as his mistress. This made a marriage between Richard and Alys technically impossible in the eyes of the Church, but Henry prevaricated: he regarded Alys's dowry, Vexin in the \u00cele-de-France, as valuable. Richard was discouraged from renouncing Alys because she was the sister of King Philip II of France, a close ally.\nAfter his failure to overthrow his father, Richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of Aquitaine, especially in the territory of Gascony. The increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in 1179. Hoping to dethrone Richard, the rebels sought the help of his brothers Henry and Geoffrey. The turning point came in the Charente Valley in the spring of 1179. The well-defended fortress of Taillebourg seemed impregnable. The castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a three-layer wall. Richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress, leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat. The garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked Richard; he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates, where he easily took over the castle in two days. Richard's victory at Taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him. In 1181\u201382, Richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of Angoul\u00eame. His opponents turned to Philip II of France for support, and the fighting spread through the Limousin and P\u00e9rigord. The excessive cruelty of Richard's punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility.\nAfter Richard had subdued his rebellious barons, he again challenged his father. From 1180 to 1183 the tension between father and son grew, as Henry II commanded Richard to pay homage to Henry the Young King, but Richard refused. Finally, in 1183, the younger Henry and Geoffrey of Brittany invaded Aquitaine in an attempt to subdue Richard. Richard's barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke. However, Richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies, and they executed any prisoners. The conflict paused briefly in June 1183, when the Young King died. With the death of his elder brother, Richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the English crown. Henry II demanded that Richard give up Aquitaine (which he planned to give to his youngest son, John, as his inheritance). Richard refused, and conflict continued between him and his father. Finally, the King brought Queen Eleanor out of prison, sent her to Aquitaine, and demanded that Richard return possession of his lands to his mother. Meanwhile, in 1186, Geoffrey died in a tournament. He had a daughter, Eleanor, and a posthumous son, Arthur.\nIn 1187, to strengthen his position, Richard allied himself with 22-year-old Philip II, the son of Eleanor's ex-husband Louis VII by Adela of Champagne. Roger of Howden wrote:\nThe King of England was struck with great astonishment, and wondered what [this alliance] could mean, and, taking precautions for the future, frequently sent messengers into France for the purpose of recalling his son Richard; who, pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father, made his way to Chinon, and, in spite of the person who had the custody thereof, carried off the greater part of his father's treasures, and fortified his castles in Poitou with the same, refusing to go to his father.\nOverall, Howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between Richard and Philip. Gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate, which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that, as a symbol of unity between the two countries, the kings of England and France had slept overnight in the same bed. Gillingham has characterized this as \"an accepted political act, nothing sexual about it;... a bit like a modern-day photo opportunity\".\nWith news arriving of the Battle of Hattin, he took the cross at Tours in the company of other French nobles. In exchange for Philip's help against his father, Richard paid homage to Philip in November 1188. On 4 July 1189, the forces of Richard and Philip defeated Henry's army at Ballans. Henry agreed to name Richard his heir apparent. Two days later Henry died in Chinon, and Richard succeeded him as King of England, Duke of Normandy, and Count of Anjou. Roger of Howden claimed that Henry's corpse bled from the nose in Richard's presence, which was assumed to be a sign that Richard had caused his death.\nKing and crusader.\nCoronation and anti-Jewish violence.\nRichard I was officially invested as Duke of Normandy on 20 July 1189 and crowned king in Westminster Abbey on 3 September 1189. Tradition barred all Jews and women from the investiture, but some Jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king. According to Ralph of Diceto, Richard's courtiers stripped and flogged the Jews, then flung them out of court.\nWhen a rumour spread that Richard had ordered all Jews to be killed, the people of London attacked the Jewish population. Many Jewish homes were destroyed by arsonists, and several Jews were forcibly converted. Some sought sanctuary in the Tower of London, and others managed to escape. Among those killed was Jacob of Orl\u00e9ans, a respected Jewish scholar. Roger of Howden, in his \"\", claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting, and that Richard punished the perpetrators, allowing a forcibly converted Jew to return to his native religion. Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, reacted by remarking, \"If the King is not God's man, he had better be the devil's\".\nOffended that he was not being obeyed, and aware that the attacks could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade, Richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most heinous murders and persecutions, including rioters who had accidentally burned down Christian homes. He distributed a royal writ demanding that the Jews be left alone. The edict was only loosely enforced, however, and the following March further violence occurred, including a massacre at York.\nCrusade plans.\nRichard had already taken the cross as Count of Poitou in 1187. His father and Philip II had done so at Gisors on 21 January 1188 after receiving news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin. After Richard became king, he and Philip agreed to go on the Third Crusade, since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories.\nRichard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross. He started to raise and equip a new crusader army. He spent most of his father's treasury (filled with money raised by the Saladin tithe), raised taxes, and even agreed to free King William I of Scotland from his oath of subservience to Richard in exchange for marks (\u00a3). To raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions, lands, and other privileges to those interested in them. Those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts. William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and the King's chancellor, made a show of bidding \u00a3 to remain as Chancellor. He was apparently outbid by a certain Reginald the Italian, but that bid was refused.\nRichard made some final arrangements on the continent. He reconfirmed his father's appointment of William Fitz Ralph to the important post of seneschal of Normandy. In Anjou, Stephen of Tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement. Payn de Rochefort, an Angevin knight, became seneschal of Anjou. In Poitou the ex-provost of Benon, Peter Bertin, was made seneschal, and finally, the household official Helie de La Celle was picked for the seneschalship in Gascony. After repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his French possessions, Richard finally set out on the crusade in summer 1190. (His delay was criticised by troubadours such as Bertran de Born.) He appointed as regents Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex\u00a0\u2013 who soon died and was replaced by William Longchamp. Richard's brother John was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against William Longchamp. When Richard was raising funds for his crusade, he was said to have declared, \"I would have sold London if I could find a buyer\".\nOccupation of Sicily.\nIn September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily in 1189 his cousin Tancred had seized power, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip, and Tancred. Its main terms were:\nThe two kings stayed in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings eventually met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys. In 1190 King Richard, before leaving for the Holy Land for the crusade, met Joachim of Fiore, who spoke to him of a prophecy contained in the Book of Revelation.\nConquest of Cyprus.\nIn April 1191, Richard left Messina for Acre with an army of 17,000 men, but a storm dispersed his large fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister Joan and his new fianc\u00e9e, Berengaria of Navarre, was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, along with the wrecks of several other vessels, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos.\nOn 1 May 1191, Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Lemesos on Cyprus. He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and treasure. Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Lemesos. Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Lemesos at the same time, in particular Guy of Lusignan. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival, Conrad of Montferrat.\nThe local magnates abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. Isaac changed his mind, however, and tried to escape. Richard's troops, led by Guy de Lusignan, conquered the whole island by 1 June. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. Richard named Richard de Camville and Robert of Thornham as governors. He later sold the island to the master of Knights Templar, Robert de Sabl\u00e9, and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy of Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom.\nThe rapid conquest of the island by Richard was of strategic importance. The island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea. Cyprus remained a Christian stronghold until the Ottoman invasion in 1570. Richard's exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation, and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island. Richard left Cyprus for Acre on 5 June with his allies.\nMarriage.\nBefore leaving Cyprus on crusade, Richard married Berengaria, the first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. Richard had first grown close to her at a tournament held in her native Navarre. The wedding was held in Lemesos on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St George and was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour, many feasts and entertainments, and public parades and celebrations followed, commemorating the event. When Richard married Berengaria he was still officially betrothed to Alys, and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the Kingdom of Navarre as a fief, as Aquitaine had been for his father. Further, Eleanor championed the match, as Navarre bordered Aquitaine, thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands. Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately. Berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did, and she did not see England until after his death. After his release from German captivity, Richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct, but he was not reunited with his wife. The marriage remained childless.\nIn the Holy Land.\nRichard landed at Acre on 8 June 1191. He gave his support to his Poitevin vassal Guy of Lusignan, who had brought troops to help him in Cyprus. Guy was the widower of his father's cousin Sibylla of Jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of Jerusalem, despite his wife's death during the Siege of Acre the previous year. Guy's claim was challenged by Conrad of Montferrat, second husband of Sibylla's half-sister, Isabella: Conrad, whose defence of Tyre had saved the kingdom in 1187, was supported by Philip of France, son of his first cousin Louis VII of France, and by another cousin, Leopold V, Duke of Austria. Richard also allied with Humphrey IV of Toron, Isabella's first husband, from whom she had been forcibly divorced in 1190. Humphrey was loyal to Guy and spoke Arabic fluently, so Richard used him as a translator and negotiator.\nRichard and his forces aided in the capture of Acre, despite Richard's serious illness. At one point, while sick from \"arnaldia\", a disease similar to scurvy, he picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow, while being carried on a stretcher covered \"in a great silken quilt\". Eventually, Conrad of Montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with Saladin's forces inside Acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city. Richard quarrelled with Leopold over the deposition of Isaac Komnenos (related to Leopold's Byzantine mother) and his position within the crusade. Leopold's banner had been raised alongside the English and French standards. This was interpreted as arrogance by both Richard and Philip, as Leopold was a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor (although he was the highest-ranking surviving leader of the imperial forces). Richard's men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of Acre. Leopold left the crusade immediately. Philip also left soon afterwards, in poor health and after further disputes with Richard over the status of Cyprus (Philip demanded half the island) and the kingship of Jerusalem. \nRichard had kept approximately 2,700 Muslim prisoners as hostages against Saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around Acre. Philip, before leaving, had entrusted his prisoners to Conrad, but Richard forced him to hand them over to him. Richard feared his forces being bottled up in Acre, and believed that his troops could not advance with the prisoners in train. He therefore ordered all the prisoners to be executed. He then moved south, defeating Saladin's forces at the Battle of Arsuf, north of Jaffa, on 7 September 1191. Saladin attempted to harass Richard's army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail. Richard maintained his army's defensive formation, however, until the Hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of Saladin's forces. Richard then ordered a general counterattack, which won the battle. Arsuf was an important victory. The Muslim army was not destroyed, despite the considerable casualties it suffered, but it did rout; this was considered shameful by the Muslims and boosted the morale of the Crusaders. In November 1191, following the fall of Jaffa, the Crusader army advanced inland towards Jerusalem. The army then marched to Beit Nuba, only from Jerusalem. Muslim morale in Jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the Crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly. However, the weather was appallingly bad, cold with heavy rain and hailstorms; this, combined with the fear that the Crusader army, if it besieged Jerusalem, might be trapped by a relieving force, led to the decision to retreat back to the coast. Richard attempted to negotiate with Saladin, but this was unsuccessful. In the first half of 1192, he and his troops refortified Ascalon, having earlier taken the fortified town of Darum.\nAn election forced Richard to accept Conrad of Montferrat as King of Jerusalem, and he sold Cyprus to his defeated prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Guy. Only days later, on 28 April 1192, Conrad was stabbed to death by the Assassins before he could be crowned. Eight days later Richard's own nephew Henry II of Champagne was married to the widowed Isabella, although she was carrying Conrad's child. The murder was never conclusively solved, and Richard's contemporaries widely suspected his involvement.\nThe crusader army made another advance on Jerusalem, and, in June 1192, it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again, this time because of dissension amongst its leaders. In particular, Richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force Saladin to relinquish Jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of Egypt. The leader of the French contingent, Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, however, was adamant that a direct attack on Jerusalem should be made. This split the Crusader army into two factions, and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective. Richard stated that he would accompany any attack on Jerusalem but only as a simple soldier; he refused to lead the army. Without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast.\nA period of minor skirmishes with Saladin's forces commenced, punctuated by another defeat in the field for the Ayyubid army at the Battle of Jaffa. Baha' al-Din, a contemporary Muslim soldier and biographer of Saladin, recorded a tribute to Richard's martial prowess at this battle: \"I have been assured ... that on that day the king of England, lance in hand, rode along the whole length of our army from right to left, and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him. The Sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger...\". Both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable. Richard knew that both Philip and his own brother John were starting to plot against him, and the morale of Saladin's army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats. However, Saladin insisted on the razing of Ascalon's fortifications, which Richard's men had rebuilt, and a few other points. Richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade Egypt \u2013 Saladin's chief supply-base \u2013 but failed. In the end, time ran out for Richard. He realised that his return could be postponed no longer, since both Philip and John were taking advantage of his absence. He and Saladin finally came to a settlement on 2 September 1192. The terms provided for the destruction of Ascalon's fortifications, allowed Christian pilgrims and merchants access to Jerusalem, and initiated a three-year truce. Richard, being ill with \"arnaldia\", left for England on 9 October 1192.\nLife after the Third Crusade.\nCaptivity, ransom and return.\nBad weather forced Richard's ship to put in at Corfu, in the lands of Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who objected to Richard's annexation of Cyprus, formerly Byzantine territory. Disguised as a Knight Templar, Richard sailed from Corfu with four attendants, but his ship was wrecked near Aquileia, forcing Richard and his party into taking a dangerous land route through central Europe. On his way to the territory of his brother-in-law Henry the Lion, Richard was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 near Vienna by Leopold of Austria, who accused Richard of arranging the murder of his cousin Conrad of Montferrat. Moreover, Richard had personally offended Leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of Acre.\nLeopold kept Richard prisoner at D\u00fcrnstein Castle under the care of Leopold's Hadmar of Kuenring. This mishap was soon known in England, but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts. While in prison, Richard wrote the musical piece ' or ' (\"No man who is imprisoned\"), which is addressed to his half-sister Marie. He wrote the song, in French and Occitan versions, to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister. The detention of a crusader was contrary to public law, and on these grounds Pope Celestine III excommunicated Leopold.\nOn 28 March 1193, Richard was brought to Speyer and handed over to Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, who imprisoned him in Trifels Castle. The Emperor was aggrieved by the support the Plantagenets had given to the family of Henry the Lion and by Richard's recognition of Tancred in Sicily. Henry VI needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern Italy and continued to hold Richard for ransom. Nevertheless, to Richard's irritation, Pope Celestine hesitated to excommunicate Henry VI, as he had Duke Leopold, for the continued wrongful imprisonment of Richard. He famously refused to show deference to the Emperor and declared to him, \"\". The King was at first shown a certain measure of respect, but later, at the prompting of Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais and Philip of France's cousin, the conditions of Richard's captivity worsened, and he was kept in chains, \"so heavy,\" Richard declared, \"that a horse or ass would have struggled to move under them.\"\nThe Emperor demanded that marks (100,000 pounds of silver) be delivered to him before he would release the King, the same amount raised by the Saladin tithe only a few years earlier, and two to three times the annual income of the English Crown under Richard. Meanwhile, Eleanor worked tirelessly to raise the ransom for her son's release. Leopold also requested Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany, niece of Richard, marry his heir Frederick. Both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property, the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated, and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes. At the same time, Richard's brother John and King Philip of France offered marks for Henry VI to hold Richard prisoner until Michaelmas 1194. Henry turned down the offer. The money to release the King was transferred to Germany by the Emperor's ambassadors, but \"at the king's peril\" (had it been lost along the way, Richard would have been held responsible), and finally, on 4 February 1194, Richard was released. Philip sent a message to John: \"Look to yourself; the devil is loose\". Furthermore, upon the sudden death of Leopold, under the pressure of the Pope, the new duke Frederick was forced to abandon his marriage plan with Eleanor of Brittany.\nWar against Philip of France.\nIn Richard's absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip's conquests in the period of Richard's imprisonment was a part of Normandy called Norman Vexin facing French Vexin. Richard forgave John when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew Arthur. At Winchester, on 11 March 1194, Richard was crowned a second time to nullify the shame of his captivity.\nRichard began his reconquest of the lost lands in Normandy. The fall of the Ch\u00e2teau de Gisors to the French in 1193 opened a gap in the Norman defences. The search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of Normandy and act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back Vexin from French control. A naturally defensible position was identified, perched high above the River Seine, an important transport route, in the manor of Andeli. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (December 1195) between Richard and Philip II, neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build the vast Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor, as it was one of the diocese's most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in Normandy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Catholic Church. The archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of Normandy; Roger of Howden detailed \"unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of Normandy\". The interdict was still in force when work began on the castle, but Pope Celestine III repealed it in April 1197 after Richard made gifts of land to the archbishop and the diocese of Rouen, including two manors and the prosperous port of Dieppe.\nRoyal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under Henry II, attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard's war with the king of France. However, the work at Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 between 1196 and 1198. This was more than double Richard's spending on castles in England, an estimated \u00a37,000. Unprecedented in its speed of construction, the castle was mostly complete in two years, when most construction on such a scale would have taken the better part of a decade. According to William of Newburgh, in May 1198 Richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a \"rain of blood\". While some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen, Richard was undeterred.\nAs no master-mason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castle's construction, military historian Richard Allen Brown has suggested that Richard himself was the overall architect; this is supported by the interest Richard showed in the work through his frequent presence. In his final years, the castle became Richard's favourite residence, and writs and charters were written at Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard bearing \"\" (at the Fair Castle of the Rock).\nCh\u00e2teau Gaillard was ahead of its time, featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later. Allen Brown described Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard as \"one of the finest castles in Europe\", and military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that it was considered \"the masterpiece of its time. The reputation of its builder, C\u0153ur de Lion, as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure. He was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the East, but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold\".\nDetermined to resist Philip's designs on contested Angevin lands such as the Vexin and Berry, Richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into the war on the French King. He organised an alliance against Philip, including Baldwin IX of Flanders, Renaud, Count of Boulogne, and his father-in-law, King Sancho VI of Navarre, who raided Philip's lands from the south. Most importantly, he managed to secure the Welf inheritance in Saxony for his nephew, Henry the Lion's son, who was elected Otto IV of Germany in 1198.\nPartly as a result of these and other intrigues, Richard won several victories over Philip. At Fr\u00e9teval in 1194, just after Richard's return to France from captivity and money-raising in England, Philip fled, leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by Richard. At the Battle of Gisors (sometimes called Courcelles) in 1198, Richard took \"\"\u00a0\u2013 \"God and my Right\"\u00a0\u2013 as his motto (still used by the British monarchy today), echoing his earlier boast to Emperor Henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but God.\nDeath.\nIn March 1199, Richard was in Limousin suppressing a revolt by Viscount Aimar V of Limoges. Although it was Lent, he \"devastated the Viscount's land with fire and sword\". He besieged the tiny, virtually unarmed castle of Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol. Some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of Roman gold.\nOn 26 March 1199, Richard was hit in the shoulder by a crossbow bolt, and the wound turned gangrenous. Richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him; called alternatively Pierre (or Peter) Basile, John Sabroz, Dudo, and Bertrand de Gourdon (from the town of Gourdon) by chroniclers, the man turned out (according to some sources, but not all) to be a boy. He said Richard had killed his father and two brothers, and that he had intended to kill Richard in revenge. He expected to be executed, but as a final act of mercy Richard forgave him, saying \"Live on, and by my bounty behold the light of day\", before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with 100 shillings.\nRichard died on 6 April 1199 in the arms of his mother, and thus \"ended his earthly day.\" Because of the nature of his death, it was later said that \"the Lion by the Ant was slain\". According to one chronicler, Richard's last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain Mercadier had the boy flayed alive and hanged as soon as Richard died.\nRichard's heart was buried at Rouen in Normandy, his entrails in Ch\u00e2lus (where he died), and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at Fontevraud Abbey in Anjou. In 2012, scientists analysed the remains of Richard's heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances, including frankincense, a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of Christ.\nHenry Sandford, Bishop of Rochester (1226\u20131235), announced that he had seen a vision of Richard ascending to Heaven in March 1232 (along with Stephen Langton, the former archbishop of Canterbury), the King having presumably spent 33 years in purgatory as expiation for his sins.\nRichard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son, Philip of Cognac. He was succeeded by his brother John as king. His French territories, with the exception of Rouen, initially rejected John as a successor, preferring his nephew Arthur. The lack of any direct heirs from Richard was the first step in the dissolution of the Angevin Empire.\nCharacter.\nContemporaries considered Richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess; this was, apparently, the first such instance of this combination. He was known as a valiant, competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous. At the same time, he was considered prone to the sins of lust, pride, greed and, above all, excessive cruelty. Ralph of Coggeshall, summarising Richard's career, deplores that the King was one of \"the immense cohort of sinners\". He was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the Crusade and for his ransom, whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes.\nRichard was a patron and a protector of the trouv\u00e8res and troubadours of his entourage; he was also a poet himself. He was interested in writing and music, and two poems are attributed to him. The first one is a sirventes in Old French, \"Dalfin je us voill desrenier\", and the second one is a lament that he wrote during his imprisonment at D\u00fcrnstein Castle, \"Ja nus hons pris\", with a version in Old Occitan and a version in Old French.\nSpeculation regarding sexuality.\nIn the historiography of the second half of the 20th century, much interest was shown in Richard's sexuality, in particular whether there was evidence of homosexuality. The topic had not been raised by Victorian or Edwardian historians, a fact denounced as a \"conspiracy of silence\" by John Harvey (1948). The argument primarily drew on accounts of Richard's behaviour, as well as of his confessions and penitences, and of his childless marriage. Richard did have at least one illegitimate child, Philip of Cognac, and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns. Historians remain divided on the question of Richard's sexuality. Harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians, most notably John Gillingham (1994), who argues that Richard was probably heterosexual. Flori (1999) again argued in favour of Richard's homosexuality, based on Richard's two public confessions and penitences (in 1191 and 1195) which, according to Flori, \"must have\" referred to the sin of sodomy. But Flori concedes that contemporary accounts of Richard taking women by force exist, concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women. Flori and Gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bed-sharing do not support the suggestion that Richard had a sexual relationship with King Philip II, as other modern authors had suggested.\nLegacy.\nHeraldry.\nThe second Great Seal of Richard I (1198) shows him bearing a shield depicting \"three lions passant-guardant\". This is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon, which later became established as the Royal Arms of England. It is likely, therefore, that Richard introduced this heraldic design. In his earlier Great Seal of 1189, he had used either one \"lion rampant\" or two \"lions rampants combatants\", arms which he may have adopted from his father.\nRichard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a \"lion statant\" (now \"statant-guardant\"). The coat of three lions continues to represent England on several coins of the pound sterling, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (such as the England national football team, and the team's \"Three Lions\" anthem), and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.\nMedieval folklore.\nAround the middle of the 13th century, various legends developed that, after Richard's capture, his minstrel Blondel travelled Europe from castle to castle, loudly singing a song known only to the two of them (they had composed it together). Eventually, he came to the place where Richard was being held, and Richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain, thus revealing where the King was incarcerated. The story was the basis of Andr\u00e9 Ernest Modeste Gr\u00e9try's opera \"Richard C\u0153ur-de-Lion\" and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to Richard Thorpe's film version of \"Ivanhoe\". It seems unconnected to the real Jean 'Blondel' de Nesle, an aristocratic . It also does not correspond to the historical reality, since the King's jailers did not hide the fact; on the contrary, they publicised it. An early account of this legend is to be found in Claude Fauchet's \"Recueil de l'origine de la langue et poesie fran\u00e7oise\" (1581).\nAt some time around the 16th century, tales of Robin Hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry, during the misrule of Richard's evil brother John, while Richard was away at the Third Crusade.\nHistorical reputation and modern reception.\nRichard's reputation over the years has \"fluctuated wildly\", according to historian John Gillingham. \nAccording to Gillingham, \"Richard's reputation, above all as a crusader, meant that the tone of contemporaries and near contemporaries, whether writing in the West or the Middle East, was overwhelmingly favourable.\" Even historians attached to the court of his enemy Philip Augustus believed that if Richard had not fought against Philip then England would never have had a better king. A German contemporary, Walther von der Vogelweide, believed that Richard's generosity was what made his subjects willing to raise a king's ransom on his behalf. Richard's character was also praised by figures in Saladin's court such as Baha ad-Din and Ibn al-Athir, who judged him the most remarkable ruler of his time. Even in Scotland he won a high place in historical tradition.\nAfter Richard's death his image was further romanticized and for at least four centuries Richard was considered a model king by historians such as Holinshed and John Speed. However, in 1621 the Stuart courtier and poet and historian Samuel Daniel criticized Richard for wasting English resources on the crusade and wars in France. This \"remarkably original and consciously anachronistic interpretation\" eventually became the common opinion of scholars. Though Richard's popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence, his reputation among historians was typified by Steven Runciman's verdict: \"he was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier\" (\"History of the Crusades\" Vol. III).\nVictorian England was divided on Richard: many admired him as a crusader and man of God, erecting an heroic statue to him outside the Houses of Parliament. The late-Victorian scholar William Stubbs, however, thought him \"a bad son, a bad husband, a selfish ruler, and a vicious man\". During his ten years' reign, Richard was in England for no more than six months, and totally absent for the last five years. This led Stubbs to argue Richard harbored no sympathy \"or even consideration, for his people\" and that \"his ambition was that of a mere warrior.\"\nHowever, since 1978 this approach has been increasingly questioned for its insularity. According to Gillingham, \"it is now more widely acknowledged that Richard was head of a dynasty with far wider responsibilities than merely English ones, and that in judging a ruler's political acumen more weight might be attached to contemporary opinion than to views which occurred to no one until many centuries after his death.\"\nIn World War I, when British troops commanded by General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem, the British press printed cartoons of Richard looking down from the heavens with the caption reading, \"At last my dream has come true\". General Allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter-day Crusade, stating \"The importance of Jerusalem lay in its strategic importance, there was no religious impulse in this campaign\".\nFamily tree.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Norman English and early Plantagenet monarchs and their relationship with rulers of Western Europe\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26370", "revid": "3965251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26370", "title": "Robert Jordan", "text": "American fantasy writer (1948\u20132007)\nJames Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 \u2013 September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author of epic fantasy. He is best known as the author of \"The Wheel of Time\" series, which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. The series is among the highest selling book series of all time, with 90 million copies sold. In his earlier career he became one of several writers to produce original Conan the Barbarian novels; his are considered by fans to be some of the best of the non-Robert E. Howard efforts. Robert Jordan was the most well known of several pen names he used, adopting different monikers for different genres.\nEarly life.\nJordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina on October 17, 1948 to James and Eva Rigney (nee Grooms). Rigney Sr. was a World War II veteran and served as a police officer before working at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. He taught himself to read at the age of four years old, because his older brother did not finish reading White Fang to him and Jordan \"wanted to know what happened,\" and at five was reading Mark Twain and Jules Verne. He went to Clemson University, where he played football as a lineman, but dropped out after one year and enlisted in the U.S. Army. \nMilitary service.\nHe served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War as a helicopter gunner, from 1968 to 1970. He supported Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters, and was deployed to Saigon and later Bien Hoa. Asked about his experiences in 2003, he stated that they flew in \"Zone C, The Phu Rieng Rubber Plantation, down to Cu Chi in the delta, over to Nui Ba Dinh, Black Virgin Mountain, and we were flying into Cambodia long before the Parrot's Beak\". He survived a helicopter crash aged 19, which affected his views on mortality. During his time in the military one of his nicknames was \"Iceman\", in reference to an incident in which he intercepted a number of NVA troops crossing a river. Jordan strongly disliked the nickname. In a 2007 blog post, he stated that he \"strangled that SOB, drove a stake through his heart, and buried him face down under a crossroad outside Saigon before coming home, because I knew that guy wasn't made to survive in a civilian environment.\" He preferred the nickname Ganesha he attained, as \"the remover of obstacles\". He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with \"V\" and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm.\nAfter returning from Vietnam in 1970, Jordan studied physics at The Citadel Military College of South Carolina. He graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science degree and began working for the U.S. Navy as a nuclear engineer. He designed tests and overhauled nuclear reactors for US naval vessels. In 1977 he fell during a walk between the dry dock and his office and faced a serious knee injury and an extended hospital stay. He found that he was bored by the work of other writers while in hospital, and believing he could do better, decided to begin writing himself.\nCareer.\nEarly works.\nJordan began writing in 1977. His first writing project was a fantasy novel entitled \"Warriors of the Altaii\", writing by hand over three and a half months and typing it up when he returned to work. He contacted Donald A. Wolheim at DAW Books and immediately received an offer, but after attempting to negotiate a minor detail the offer was rejected, citing his \"excessive demands\". Despite the lack of a publishing deal, he tendered his resignation from his nuclear engineering job- confident that he could write full time. \nA local bookstore owner put Jordan in touch with the editor Harriet McDougal, who read \"Altaii\". Instead of editing this early work she asked for a new story, which led Jordan to write \"The Fallon Blood\", published in 1980 by McDougal's personal imprint, Popham Press. Jordan began dating McDougal and his late 1970s \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game with her son Will would serve as inspiration for \"The Wheel of Time\".\nJordan wrote three books in the Fallon saga and planned it to be a longer series chronicling the history of the United States from the time of the Civil War to the Vietnam War. While the works sold fairly well, Jordan became bored after the third one and decided to explore other avenues. Jordan stopped using Popham Press in the early 1980s as he was aware that it was owned by McDougal and he was about to marry his \"only source of income\". With this in mind, his future books would be published by other companies while McDougal would continue to edit his works. He also wrote the western \"Cheyenne Raiders\" around this time, his only book to use a different editor.\n\"Conan the Barbarian\".\nTom Doherty at Tor Books obtained the rights to \"Conan the Barbarian\" and needed a novel very quickly. McDougal recommended Jordan because she knew he had written his first novel, \"Warriors of the Altaii\", in a very short time span. Jordan initially turned down the offer because he was concerned about writing in an established fictional universe from another author. He later accepted and enjoyed the project, though he found it difficult to be creative within the strict format rules of the books. Jordan would go on to write seven of these from 1982 to 1984.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So he thought I could write something fast, and he was right, and I liked it. It was fun writing something completely over the top, full of purple prose, and in a weak moment I agreed to do five more and the novelization of the second Conan movie. I've decided that those things were very good discipline for me. I had to work with a character and a world that had already been created and yet find a way to say something new about the character and the world. That was a very good exercise.\u2014\u200a\n\"The Wheel of Time\".\nOn the back of the successful Conan books, Doherty asked if he had any other book ideas, and Jordan discussed his plans for an epic fantasy series, of up to three books in length. Jordan's work on \"The Wheel of Time\" began in 1984 and ballooned in scope from the initial three book vision. The series would occupy much of his writing time for the remainder of his life. He completed 12 books in his lifetime, including the prequel \"New Spring\". Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments written solely by Jordan owing to the expansion of the scale of the series as a whole.\nDiagnosed with a terminal heart condition in the mid 2000s, he became concerned that he might not live to complete the series and compiled additional notes beyond those he already had so that another could finish the \"final\" book, \"A Memory of Light\". He shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died with this in mind. He maintained that in doing so the book would get published even if \"the worst actually happens\". After Jordan's death in September 2007, Brandon Sanderson took on that role, splitting the final book into three volumes, and completed the series in 2013.\nPersonal life.\nRobert Jordan was a history enthusiast and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and pipe-collecting. He described himself as a \"high church\" Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week. Politically, he described himself as a \"libertarian monarchist\". \nJordan's favorite authors were John D. MacDonald, Jane Austen, Louis L'Amour, Charles Dickens, Robert A. Heinlein, Mark Twain and Montaigne. He was a prodigious reader, reading around 400 books a year in the early 1990s, and his home library had over 14,000 books at the time of his death. \nJordan acknowledged in interviews that as a younger man he had been in a relationship with two women who would arrange a dating schedule between them. This inspired the non-monogamous relationships seen in his writing. Jordan later met the editor Harriet McDougal, whom he married in 1981. Among other material, McDougal edited Jordan's work.\nIllness and death.\nOn March 23, 2006, Jordan revealed that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis and that, with treatment, his median life expectancy was four years. In a separate weblog post, he encouraged his fans not to worry about him and stated that he intended to have a long and creative life. He began chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic during early April 2006. He participated in a study of the drug Revlimid, which had been approved recently for multiple myeloma but not yet tested for primary amyloidosis.\nJordan died on September 16, 2007. His funeral service was on September 19, 2007. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina. Jordan's papers can be found in the special collections of the College of Charleston. Access to some records including Jordan's correspondence papers is restricted, and will not be available for viewing until thirty years after his death (September 2037).\nPseudonyms.\nBorn Rigney jr., he published his works under pseodonyms or \"pen names\", of which Robert Jordan was his best known. He used different titles for different genres:\nJordan never published any books under his actual name. This was reserved for a hypothetical book about his experiences in the Vietnam War which he never wrote.\n He also claimed to have ghostwritten an \"international thriller\" that as of 2005 was still believed to have been written by someone else.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26371", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26371", "title": "Ratatoskr", "text": "Norse mythical animal\nIn Norse mythology, Ratatoskr (Old Norse, generally considered to mean \"drill-tooth\" or \"bore-tooth\") is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the eagles perched atop it and the serpent N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree. Ratatoskr is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Ratatoskr\" contains two elements: \"rata-\" and \"-toskr\". The element \"toskr\" is generally held to mean \"tusk\". Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson theorized that the \"rati-\" element means \"the traveller\". He says that the name of the legendary drill Rati may feature the same term. According to Vigf\u00fasson, \"Ratatoskr\" means \"tusk the traveller\" or \"the climber tusk.\"\nSophus Bugge theorized that the name \"Ratatoskr\" is a loanword from Old English meaning \"Rat-tooth.\" Bugge's basis hinges on the fact that the \"-toskr\" element of the compound does not appear anywhere else in Old Norse. Bugge proposed that the \"-toskr\" element is a reformation of the Old English word \"t\u016bsc\" (Old Frisian \"tusk\") and, in turn, that the element \"Rata-\" represents Old English \"r\u00e6t\" (\"rat\").\nAccording to Albert Sturtevant, \"[as] far as the element \"Rata-\" is concerned, Bugge's hypothesis has no valid foundation in view of the fact that the [Old Norse] word \"Rata\" (gen. form of \"Rati\"*) is used in \"H\u00e1v[am\u00e1l]\" (106, 1) to signify the instrument which Odin employed for \"boring\" his way through the rocks in quest of the poet's mead [...]\" and that \"\"Rati*\" must then be considered a native [Old Norse] word meaning \"The Borer, Gnawer\" [...]\".\nSturtevant says that Bugge's theory regarding the element \"-toskr\" may appear to be supported by the fact that the word does not appear elsewhere in Old Norse. However, Sturtevant says that the Old Norse proper name \"Tunne\" (derived from Proto-Norse \"*Tun\u00fe\u0113\") refers to \"a person who is characterized as having some peculiar sort of \"tooth\"\" and theorizes a Proto-Germanic form of \"-toskr\". Sturtevant concludes that \"the fact that the [Old Norse] word occurs only in the name \"Rata-toskr\" is no valid evidence against this assumption, for there are many [Old Norse] \"hapax legomena\" of native origin, as is attested by the equivalents in the Mod[ern] Scandinavian dialects.\" Modern scholars have accepted this etymology, listing the name \"Ratatoskr\" as meaning \"drill-tooth\" (Jesse Byock, Andy Orchard, Rudolf Simek) or \"bore-tooth\" (John Lindow).\nAttestations.\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", the god Odin (disguised as \"Gr\u00edmnir\") says that Ratatoskr runs up and down Yggdrasil bringing messages between the eagle perched atop it and N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr below it:\nRatatoskr is described in the \"Prose Edda\"'s \"Gylfaginning\"'s chapter 16, in which High states that\nAn eagle sits at the top of the ash, and it has knowledge of many things. Between its eyes sits the hawk called Vedrfolnir [...]. The squirrel called Ratatosk [...] runs up and down the ash. He tells slanderous gossip, provoking the eagle and Nidhogg.\nTheories.\nAccording to Rudolf Simek, \"the squirrel probably only represents an embellishing detail to the mythological picture of the world-ash in \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\"\". Hilda Ellis Davidson, describing the world tree, states the squirrel is said to gnaw at it\u2014furthering a continual destruction and re-growth cycle, and posits the tree symbolizes ever-changing existence. John Lindow points out that Yggdrasil is described as rotting on one side and as being chewed on by four harts and N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr, and that, according to the account in \"Gylfaginning\", it also bears verbal hostility in the fauna it supports. Lindow adds that \"in the sagas, a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is seldom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the mythology to a relatively insignificant animal\".\nRichard W. Thorington Jr. and Katie Ferrell theorize that \"the role of Ratatosk probably derived from the habit of European tree squirrels (\"Sciurus vulgaris\") to give a scolding alarm call in response to danger.

Of Scottish origin, reels are also an important part of the repertoire of the fiddle traditions of Britain, Ireland and North America. In Scottish country dancing, the reel is one of the four traditional dances, the others being the jig, the strathspey and the waltz, and is also the name of a dance figure.\nIn Irish dance, a reel is any dance danced to music in \"reel time\" (see below). In Irish stepdance, the reel is danced in soft shoes and is one of the first dances taught to students. There is also a treble reel, danced in hard shoes to reel music.\nHistory.\nThe reel is indigenous to Scotland. The earliest reference was in a trial of 1590, where the accused was reported to have \"daunced this reill or short dance.\" However, the form may go back to the Middle Ages. The name may be cognate with or relate to an Old Norse form, with Suio-Gothic \"rulla\", meaning \"to whirl.\" This became Anglo-Saxon \"hreol\" and Gaelic \"ruidhle\" or \"ruidhleadh\", which is the origin of the word now. \nAfter being introduced to Ireland in the late eighteenth century it thrived. Later it was introduced to North America by English, Scottish, and Irish colonists and immigrants. In the United States, reels remain central in the traditions of Anglo and African-American Old-time music and square dancing, as well as Cajun and Zydeco. In Canada, they are important parts of Cape Breton, Acadian, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and M\u00e9tis repertoires.\nReel music.\nReel music is notated in simple metre, most commonly either in or . For example, the same reel \"Rakish Paddy\" is notated in a time signature in \"O'Neill's Music of Ireland, New &amp; Revisited,\" but in time in \"English, Welsh, Scottish &amp; Irish Fiddle Tunes,\" with no change to the note lengths.\nAll reels consist largely of quaver (eighth note) movement with an accent on the first and third beats of the bar. A reel is distinguished from a hornpipe in two ways. Firstly it is played with even beats, without swing or dotted rhythm. Secondly it is played twice as fast, implied by the time signature. Like most dance music originating in the British Isles, reels are usually composed in binary form, meaning they have two parts (A and B); in most reels each part is repeated (AABB), but in others it is not (ABAB). Each part (A and B) typically has eight bars, which in turn are divisible into four-bar and two-bar phrases. (An exception is the \"auld reel\" of Shetland which tends to irregular structure and may have been influenced by the Norwegian halling.) A reel usually has 32 bars (with structure AABB), but there are other common structures such as 40 bar reels (often played for the introduction of the Eightsome Reel) and 64 bar reels (with structure AABBCCDD).\nReels are popular in the folk music of South West England. They crossed the Atlantic ocean with Irish and British immigration and thus entered the musical tradition of Atlantic and French-speaking Canada including that of Quebecers and Acadians. Reels are featured in many pieces by Quebec singers and bands, such as La Bolduc, La Bottine Souriante and even the more modern \"n\u00e9o-trad\" group Les Cowboys Fringants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the naval branch of the , existing from 1919 to 1935. In 1935, it became known as the \"Kriegsmarine\" (War Navy), a branch of the \"Wehrmacht\"; a change implemented by Adolf Hitler. Many of the administrative and organizational tenets of the were then carried over into the organization of the \"Kriegsmarine\".\n\"Vorl\u00e4ufige Reichsmarine\".\nThe (lit.\u2009'Provisional Reich Navy') was formed after the end of World War I from the Imperial German Navy.\nThe provisions of the Treaty of Versailles restricted the German Navy to 15,000 men and no submarines, while the fleet was limited to six pre-dreadnought battleships, six light cruisers, twelve destroyers, and twelve torpedo boats. Replacements for the outdated battleships were restricted to a maximum size of 10,000 tons.\n\"Reichsmarine\".\nThe was considered the armed naval force of the (Ministry of the Reichswehr) which was headed by a civilian minister appointed by the Weimar government. The senior most naval officer was known until 1920 as the (Chief of the Admiralty), after which the title changed to (Chief of the Naval Command).\nNaval headquarters.\nThe naval commander oversaw a headquarters office known as the which was headquartered in Berlin.

The fleet commander position was then left vacant, but the flag staff remained.\nThe purpose of the fleet command was to oversee the four major type commanders of German naval vessels. These commands were in turn responsible for the administration of various German ship classes to include equipment development, vessel deployments, and personnel assignment. Once at sea, operational control of the vessels switched to the commanders of the two main Naval Sea Stations. The four type commands were:\nNaval sea stations.\nThe did not maintain traditional at-sea fleets, but instead assigned two geographical areas (known as ) which oversaw all vessels operationally deployed in the North and Baltic Seas. Each naval station maintained a headquarters staff, general naval inspectorate, training department, artillery arsenal inspector, as well as a medical command unit. The naval stations also served as a senior officer for the commanders of the various German navy ports.\nShips and equipment.\nThe Treaty of Versailles limited the size and armament of the and prevented it from introducing new technologies. The restrictions were intended to prevent the German Navy from becoming a threat to the Allied powers.

{"id": "26378", "revid": "44360552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26378", "title": "Rift Valley fever", "text": "Human and livestock viral disease\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease of humans and livestock that can cause mild to severe symptoms. The mild symptoms may include: fever, muscle pains, and headaches which often last for up to a week. The severe symptoms may include: loss of sight beginning three weeks after the infection, infections of the brain causing severe headaches and confusion, and bleeding together with liver problems which may occur within the first few days. Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 50%.\nThe disease is caused by the RVF virus. It is spread by either touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered, drinking raw milk from an infected animal, or the bite of infected mosquitoes. Animals like cows, sheep, goats, and camels may be affected. In these animals it is spread mostly by mosquitoes. It does not appear that one person can infect another. The disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies against the virus or the virus itself in the blood.\nPrevention of the disease in humans is accomplished by vaccinating animals against the disease. This must be done before an outbreak occurs because if it is done during an outbreak it may worsen the situation. Stopping the movement of animals during an outbreak may also be useful, as may decreasing mosquito numbers and avoiding their bites. There is a human vaccine; however, as of 2010, it is not widely available. There is no specific treatment and medical efforts are supportive.\nOutbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia. Outbreaks usually occur during periods of increased rain which increases the number of mosquitoes. The disease was first reported among livestock in Rift Valley of Kenya in the early 1900s, and the virus was first isolated in 1931.\nSigns and symptoms.\nIn humans, the virus can cause several syndromes. Usually, they have either no symptoms or only a mild illness with fever, headache, muscle pains, and liver abnormalities. In a small percentage of cases (&lt; 2%), the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever syndrome, meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and tissues lining the brain), or affect the eye. Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised weakness, back pain, dizziness, and weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, people recover within two to seven days after onset. About 1% of people with the disease die of it. In livestock, the fatality level is significantly higher. Pregnant livestock infected with RVF abort virtually 100% of foetuses. An epizootic (animal disease epidemic) of RVF is usually first indicated by a wave of unexplained abortions.\nOther signs in livestock include vomiting and diarrhea, respiratory disease, fever, lethargy, anorexia, and sudden death in young animals.\nCause.\nVirology.\nThe virus belongs to the \"Bunyaviricetes\" class. This is a class of enveloped negative single-stranded RNA viruses. All bunyaviruses have an outer lipid envelope with two glycoproteins\u2014G(N) and G(C)\u2014required for cell entry. They deliver their genome into the host-cell cytoplasm via endocytosis of prepackaged virions .\nThe virus' G(C) protein has a class II membrane fusion protein architecture similar to that found in flaviviruses and alphaviruses. This structural similarity suggests that there may be a common origin for these viral families.\nThe virus' 11.5 kb tripartite genome is composed of single-stranded RNA. As a \"Phlebovirus,\" it has an ambisense genome. Its L and M segments are negative-sense, but its S segment is ambisense. These three genome segments code for six major proteins: L protein (viral polymerase), the two glycoproteins G(N) and G(C), the nucleocapsid N protein, and the nonstructural NSs and NSm proteins.\nTransmission.\nThe virus is transmitted through mosquito vectors, as well as through contact with the tissue of infected animals. Two species\u2014\"Culex tritaeniorhynchus\" and \"Aedes vexans\"\u2014are known to transmit the virus. Other potential vectors include \"Aedes caspius\", \"Aedes mcintosh\", \"Aedes ochraceus,\" \"Culex pipiens\", \"Culex antennatus\", \"Culex perexiguus\", \"Culex zombaensis\" and \"Culex quinquefasciatus\". Contact with infected tissue is considered to be the main source of human infections. The virus has been isolated from two bat species: the Peter's epauletted fruit bat (\"Micropteropus pusillus\") and the aba roundleaf bat (\"Hipposideros abae\"), which are believed to be reservoirs for the virus.\nPathogenesis.\nAlthough many components encoded by RVFV's RNA play an important role in the virus' pathology, the nonstructural protein encoded on the S segment (NSs) is the only component that has been found to directly affect the host. NSs is hostile and combative against the host interferon (IFNs) antiviral response. IFNs are essential for the immune system to fight off viral infections in a host. This inhibitory mechanism is believed to be due to several reasons, the first being, competitive inhibition of the formation of the transcription factor. On this transcription factor, NSs interacts with and binds to a subunit that is needed for RNA polymerase I and II. This interaction cause competitive inhibition with another transcription factor component and prevents the assembly process of the transcription factor complex, which results in the suppression of the host antiviral response. Transcription suppression is believed to be another mechanism of this inhibitory process. This occurs when an area of NSs interacts with and binds to the host's protein, SAP30 and forms a complex. This complex causes histone acetylation to regress, which is needed for transcriptional activation of the IFN promoter. This causes IFN expression to be obstructed. Lastly, NSs has also been known to affect regular activity of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R. This protein is involved in cellular antiviral responses in the host. When RVFV can enter the host's DNA, NSs forms a filamentous structure in the nucleus. This allows the virus to interact with specific areas of the host's DNA that relates to segregation defects and induction of chromosome continuity. This increases host infectivity and decreases the host's antiviral response.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis relies on viral isolation from tissues, or serological testing with an ELISA. Other methods of diagnosis include Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), cell culture, and IgM antibody assays. As of September 2016, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) has developed a product called Immunoline, designed to diagnose the disease in humans much faster than in previous methods.\nPrevention.\nA person's chances of becoming infected can be reduced by taking measures to decrease contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals and protect against mosquitoes and other bloodsucking insects. The use of mosquito repellents and bed nets are two effective methods. For persons working with animals in RVF-endemic areas, wearing protective equipment to avoid any exposure to blood or tissues of animals that may potentially be infected is an important protective measure. Potentially, establishing environmental monitoring and case surveillance systems may aid in the prediction and control of future RVF outbreaks.\nNo vaccines are currently available for humans. While vaccines have been developed for humans, it has only been used experimentally for scientific personnel in high-risk environments. Trials of several vaccines, such as NDBR-103 and TSI-GSD 200, are ongoing. Different types of vaccines for veterinary use are available. The killed vaccines are impractical in routine animal field vaccination because of the need for multiple injections. Live vaccines require a single injection but are known to cause birth defects and abortions in sheep and induce only low-level protection in cattle. The live-attenuated vaccine, MP-12, has demonstrated promising results in laboratory trials in domesticated animals, but more research is needed before the vaccine can be used in the field. The live-attenuated clone 13 vaccine was recently registered and used in South Africa. Alternative vaccines using molecular recombinant constructs are in development and show promising results.\nA vaccine has been conditionally approved for use in animals in the US. It has been shown that knockout of the NSs and NSm nonstructural proteins of this virus produces an effective vaccine in sheep as well.\nEpidemiology.\nRVF outbreaks occur across sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks occurring elsewhere infrequently. Outbreaks of this disease usually correspond with the warm phases of the EI Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation. During this time there is an increase in rainfall, flooding, and greenness of vegetation index, which leads to an increase in mosquito vectors. RVFV can be transmitted vertically in mosquitos, meaning that the virus can be passed from the mother to her offspring. During dry conditions, the virus can remain viable for many years in the egg. Mosquitos lay their eggs in water, where they eventually hatch. As water is essential for mosquito eggs to hatch, rainfall and flooding cause an increase in the mosquito population and an increased potential for the virus.\nThe first documented outbreak was identified in Kenya in 1931, in sheep, cattle, and humans; another severe outbreak in the country in 1950\u20131951 involved 100,000 deaths in livestock and an unrecorded number of humans with fever. An outbreak occurred in South Africa in 1974\u20131976, with more than 500,000 infected animals and the first deaths in humans. In Egypt in 1977\u201378, an estimated 200,000 people were infected and there were at least 594 deaths. In Kenya in 1998, the virus killed more than 400 people. Since then, there have been outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen (2000), East Africa (2006\u20132007), Sudan (2007), South Africa (2010), Uganda (2016), Kenya (2018), Mayotte (2018\u20132019), Kenya (2020\u20132021) and Burundi (2022).\nBiological weapon.\nRift Valley fever was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program in 1969.\nResearch.\nThe disease is one of several identified by WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic in a new plan developed after the Ebola epidemic for urgent research and development toward new diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These states meet certain criteria, such as being ruled by authoritarian or totalitarian governments that severely restrict human rights, sponsoring terrorism, or seeking to proliferate weapons of mass destruction. The term is used most by the United States (although the US State Department officially stopped using the term in 2000); in his speech at the United Nations (UN) in 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated this phrase. U.S. politicians have used the term to describe countries such as Iran, Ba'athist Syria, North Korea, Afghanistan, Cuba and Venezuela. However, the term has been applied to other countries, as well as to the United States itself.\nUsage by the United States.\nAs early as July 1985, President Ronald Reagan stated that \"we are not going to tolerate \u2026 attacks from outlaw states by the strangest collection of misfits, looney tunes, and squalid criminals since the advent of the Third Reich,\" but it fell to the Clinton administration to elaborate on this concept. In the 1994 issue of \"Foreign Affairs\", U.S. National Security Advisor Anthony Lake labelled five nations as \"rogue states\": North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein. He described these regimes as \"recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain outside the family but also assault its basic values\". Cuba was put on the list solely because of the political influence of the Cuban-American community and specifically that of the Cuban American National Foundation (pre-Jorge Mas Santos), whereas Syria and Pakistan avoided being added to the list because the United States hoped that Syria could play a constructive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process, and because Washington had long maintained close relations with Pakistan.\nThree other nations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Sudan, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, were treated as \"rogue states\" as well. The US State Department at times labelled Yugoslavia as a \"rogue state\" because its leader, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, had been accused of violating the rights of his nation's citizens, including but not limited to attempted genocide in Croatia and orchestrating the Srebrenica massacre in eastern Bosnia.\nThe United States employed several tools to isolate and punish \"rogue states\". Tough unilateral economic sanctions, often at congressional behest, were imposed on or tightened against Iran, Libya, Cuba, Sudan, and Afghanistan. After the conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991, the United States selectively used airpower against Iraq for years during the Iraqi no-fly zones to force them in complying with various United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding disarmament (i.e., Resolution 687) and human rights (i.e., Resolution 688). Cruise missiles were fired at Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for terrorist attacks against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. In March 1999, NATO launched a massive air-bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in response to the Yugoslav Army's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo.\nIn the last six months of the Clinton administration, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that the term \"rogue state\" would be abolished in June 2000, in favour of the term \"states of concern\", as three of the nations listed as \"rogue states\" (Libya, Iran, and North Korea) no longer met the conditions established to define a \"rogue state\".\nLibya was removed from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list in 2006 after achieving success through diplomacy. Relations with Libya also became more mutual following the eight month Libyan Civil War in 2011, which resulted in the National Transitional Council ousting longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from power.\nIn 2015, after the US reopened its embassy in Cuba and restarted diplomatic relations with the Cuban government, Cuba was removed from the list of State sponsors of terrorism and was no longer referred to as a \"rogue state\".\nMore recently, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump labelled Venezuela a \"rogue state\". During the 2017 UN general assembly, UN ambassador Nikki Haley called Venezuela a global threat and a \"dangerous narco-state\". Some figures of the Venezuelan government, like Vice President Tareck el Aissami and Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, were permanently banned from entering US territory, due to their involvement with human rights abuses and drug cartels. Later in 2017, the US government banned all high ranking Venezuelan government officials from entering US territory. Currently, due to the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, Nicolas Maduro's government (which controls Venezuela \"de facto\") is not recognized as legitimate by the United States or most other states in the Western Hemisphere, with the exceptions of Cuba, Dominica, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname.\nOn 19 June 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the People's Republic of China a \"rogue actor\" at the Virtual Copenhagen Democracy Summit, saying that \"General Secretary Xi Jinping has green-lighted a brutal campaign of repression against Chinese Muslims, a human rights violation on a scale we haven\u2019t seen since World War II.\" In addition, Pompeo cited China's handling of COVID-19, \"malicious cyber campaigns\" it conducted, and its treatment of Hong Kong citizens as reasons for labeling China as a rogue actor. After Russia invaded Ukraine, as Sino-Russian relations became increasingly close with establishment of North Korean\u2013Russian Partnership, this term was also used to refer to Russia in think tanks.\nLater terms.\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration returned to using a similar term. The concept of \"rogue states\" was replaced by the Bush administration with the concept of an \"Axis of Evil\", which encompassed Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. U.S. President George W. Bush first spoke of this \"Axis of Evil\" during his January 2002 State of the Union Address. More terms, such as \"Outposts of Tyranny\", would follow suit.\nBecause the U.S. government remains the most active proponent of the expression \"rogue state\", the term has received much criticism from those who disagree with American foreign policy. Both the concepts of \"rogue states\" and the \"Axis of Evil\" have been criticized by scholars, including philosopher Jacques Derrida and linguist Noam Chomsky, who considered it more or less a justification of imperialism and a useful word for propaganda. Some critics charge that \"rogue state\" merely means any state that is generally hostile to the U.S., or even one that opposes the U.S. without necessarily posing a wider threat. Others, such as author William Blum, argued that the term is also applicable to the U.S. and Israel. In his \"\", Blum claimed that the United States defines itself as a rogue state through its foreign policy.\nUnited States as a rogue state.\nSome critics of US foreign policy describe the United States as a rogue state. William Blum's 2000 book \"Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower\" suggests that US-led interventions around the world during and after the Cold War have threatened the world's peace. Noam Chomsky has also described the US as a rogue state after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. Its nuclear proliferation and large numbers of nuclear warheads (the second most in the world), sponsorship of terrorist or guerilla groups to overthrow opposing governments especially in Latin America, and violations of human rights in wartime are all suggested to be characteristics of a rogue state. The US has also passed a law threatening to invade The Hague if American officials or military personnel were to ever be prosecuted for war crimes called the American Service-Members' Protection Act.\nUsage by Turkey.\nOn 23 February 1999, Turkish President S\u00fcleyman Demirel described Greece as a \"rogue state\" because of its alleged support of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Demirel said \"Greece serves as a sanctuary for members of the PKK seeking shelter and provides training facilities and logistics to the terrorists.\"\nOn 28 June 2012, after the shooting down of a Turkish warplane by the Syrian Army during the Syrian civil war, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan declared Syria to be a \"rogue state\". In October 2020, Erdo\u011fan described Armenia as a rogue state, referring to the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. He used the words \"countries supporting rogue state Armenia in its occupation of Karabakh would have to face the common conscience of humanity\". Commentator Robert Ellis, writing in the British newspaper \"The Independent\" in 2016, claimed that Turkey under Erdo\u011fan risks \"being regarded as a rogue state\" due to its increasingly authoritarian government, the deterioration of the human rights in the country, the Turkish government's involvement in Syria and its alleged support of terrorist groups.\nSimilarly, Erdo\u011fan said after a cabinet meeting on 5 October 2020: \"It is not possible for humanity to attain permanent peace and tranquility without saving the world from rogue states and their rogue rulers. Especially in our region, the number of rogue states is quite high. These rogue states, dating back to Israel, Greek Administration of Cyprus and the Syrian regime, persecute their own citizens and destabilize the world.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It introduces the concept of dialecting: small, optimized, domain-specific languages for code and data, which is also the most notable property of the language according to its designer Carl Sassenrath:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although it can be used for programming, writing functions, and performing processes, its greatest strength is the ability to easily create domain-specific languages or dialects\u2014\u200a\nDouglas Crockford, known for his involvement in the development of JavaScript, has described Rebol as \"a more modern language, but with some very similar ideas to Lisp, in that it's all built upon a representation of data which is then executable as programs\" and as one of JSON's influences.\nOriginally, the language and its official implementation were proprietary and closed source, developed by REBOL Technologies. Following discussion with Lawrence Rosen, the Rebol version 3 interpreter was released under the Apache 2.0 license on December 12, 2012. Older versions are only available in binary form, and no source release for them is planned.\nRebol has been used to program Internet applications (both client- and server-side), database applications, utilities, and multimedia applications.\nEtymology.\nRebol was initially an acronym for Relative Expression Based Object Language written in all caps. To align with modern trends in language naming represented, e.g. by the change replacing historical name \"LISP\" by \"Lisp\", programmers ceased the practice of writing \"REBOL\" in all caps. Sassenrath eventually put the naming question to the community debate on his blog. In subsequent writing, Sassenrath adopted the convention of writing the language name as \"Rebol\".\nHistory.\nFirst released in 1997, Rebol was designed over a 20-year period by Carl Sassenrath, the architect and primary developer of AmigaOS, based on his study of denotational semantics and using concepts from the programming languages Lisp, Forth, Logo, and Self.\nDesign.\nEase of use.\nOne of the Rebol design principles is \"to do simple things in simple ways\". In the following example the \"Visual interface dialect\" is used to describe a simple Hello world program with a graphical user interface:\nview layout [text \"Hello world!\" button \"Quit\" [quit]]\nThis is how a similar example looks in R3-GUI:\nview [text \"Hello world!\" button \"Quit\" on-action [quit]]\nDialects.\nRebol domain-specific languages, called \"dialects\", are micro-languages optimized for a specific purpose. Dialects can be used to define business rules, graphical user interfaces or sequences of screens during the installation of a program. Users can define their own dialects, reusing any existing Rebol word and giving it a specific meaning in that dialect. Dialects are interpreted by functions processing Rebol blocks (or parsing strings) in a specific way.\nAn example of Rebol's dialecting abilities can be seen with the word codice_1. In the \"data exchange dialect\" codice_1 is just a word not having any specific meaning. In the \"do dialect\", codice_1 is a global variable referring to a native function passing back a function result value. In the \"visual interface dialect (VID)\", codice_1 is a keyword causing the layout engine to simulate a carriage return, moving the \"rendering pen\" down to the beginning of the next line.\nA Rebol interpreter with graphical abilities must understand and interpret many dialects. The table below lists the most important ones in order of significance.\nSyntax.\nRebol syntax is free-form, not requiring specific positioning. However, indentation is often used to better convey the structure of the text to human readers.\nSyntactic properties of different dialects may differ. The common platform for all Rebol dialects is the \"data exchange dialect\"; other dialects are usually derived from it. In addition to being the common platform for all dialects, the \"data exchange dialect\" is directly used to represent data and metadata, populate data structures, send data over Internet, and save them in data storage.\nIn contrast to programming languages like C, the \"data exchange dialect\" does not consist of declarations, statements, expressions or keywords. A valid \"data exchange dialect\" text stream is a tree data structure consisting of blocks (the root block is implicit, subblocks are delimited by square brackets), parens (delimited by round brackets), strings (delimited by double quotes or curly brackets suitable for multi-line strings; caret notation is used for unprintable characters), URLs, e-mail addresses, files, paths or other composite values. Unlike ALGOL blocks, Rebol blocks are composite values similar to quoted s-expressions in Lisp. The fact that code is written in the form of Rebol blocks makes the language homoiconic.\nBlocks as well as parens may contain other composite values (a block may contain subblocks, parens, strings, ...) or scalar values like words, set-words (words suffixed by the colon), get-words (words prefixed by the colon), lit-words (words prefixed by the apostrophe), numbers, money, characters, etc., separated by whitespace. Special characters are allowed in words, so codice_5 is a word unlike codice_6, which is a sequence of three words separated by spaces.\nComments may appear following the semicolon until the end of the line. Multi-line comments or comments not ignored by the lexical parser can be written using \"ordinary\" datatypes like multi-line strings.\nSemantics.\nBlocks containing domain-specific language can be submitted as arguments to specific \"evaluator\" functions.\ndo.\nThe most frequently used evaluator is the codice_7 function. It is used by default to interpret the text input to the interpreter console.\nThe \"do dialect\" interpreted by the codice_7 function, is an expression-oriented sublanguage of the \"data exchange dialect\". The main semantic unit of the language is the expression. In contrast to imperative programming languages descending from ALGOL, the \"do dialect\" has neither keywords, nor statements.\nWords are used as case-insensitive variables. Like in all dynamically typed languages, variables don't have an associated type, type is associated with values. The result, i.e. the evaluation of a word is returned, when a word is encountered by the codice_7 function. The set-word form of a word can be used for assignment. While not having statements, assignment, together with functions with side-effects can be used for imperative programming.\nSubblocks of the root block evaluate to themselves. This property is used to handle data blocks, for structured programming by submitting blocks as arguments to control functions like codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, etc., and for dialecting, when a block is passed to a specific interpreter function.\nA specific problem worth noting is that composite values, assigned to variables, are not copied. To make a copy, the value must be passed to the codice_13 function.\nThe codice_7 function normally follows a prefix style of evaluation, where a function processes the arguments that follow it. However, infix evaluation using infix operators exists too. Infix evaluation takes precedence over the prefix evaluation. For example,\n abs -2 + 3\nreturns 1, since the infix addition takes precedence over the computation of the absolute value. When evaluating infix expressions, the order of evaluation is left to right, no operator takes precedence over another. For example,\n2 + 3 * 4\nreturns 20, while an evaluation giving precedence to multiplication would yield 14. All operators have prefix versions. codice_15 usually evaluates arguments before passing them to a function. So, the below expression:\n print read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol\nfirst reads the Wikipedia Rebol page and then passes the result to the codice_16 function. Parentheses can be used to change the order of evaluation. Using prefix notation, the usage of parentheses in expressions can be avoided.\nThe simple precedence rules allow writing expressions without consulting a precedence table that would change to reflect inclusion of new operators, and also allow expressions to be changed from prefix to infix notation using simpler methods. As a downside, however, they can be a source of mistakes for users accustomed to the conventional notation used by most other languages and tools.\nparse.\nThe codice_17 function is preferably used to specify, validate, transform and interpret dialects. It does so by matching \"parse expressions\" at run time.\n\"Parse expressions\" are written in the \"parse dialect\", which, like the \"do dialect\", is an expression-oriented sublanguage of the \"data exchange dialect\". Unlike the \"do dialect\", the \"parse dialect\" uses keywords representing operators and the most important nonterminals, infix parsing operators don't have prefix equivalents and use precedence rules (\"sequence\" has higher precedence than \"choice\").\nActions can be included to be taken during the parsing process as well and the codice_17 function can be used to process blocks or strings. At the \"string parsing\" level codice_17 must handle the \"low level\" parsing, taking into account characters and delimiters. \"Block parsing\" is higher level, handling the scanning at the level of Rebol values.\nThe parse dialect belongs to the family of grammars represented by the top-down parsing language or the parsing expression grammar (PEG). The main similarity is the presence of the \"sequence\" and \"choice\" operators all the family members have. Parse dialect syntax and the similarities between the parse dialect and the PEG are illustrated by this transliteration of a PEG example that parses an arithmetic expression:\nDigit: charset [#\"0\" - #\"9\"]\nValue: [some Digit | \"(\" Expr \")\"]\nProduct: [Value any \"/\"] Value\nSum: [Product any \"-\"] Product\nExpr: Sum\nparse/all \"12+13\" Expr\nImplementations.\nThe official Rebol 2.7.8 implementation is available in several editions (\"/Core\", \"/View\", \"/Command\", \"/SDK\" and \"/IOS\"). Both \"/Core\" and \"/View\" editions are freely redistributable software.\nThe runtime environment is stored in a single executable file. \"Rebol/Core\" 2.7.8, the console edition, is about 300\u00a0KB and \"Rebol/View\" 2.7.8, the graphical user interface edition, is about 650\u00a0KB in size.\n\"Rebol/View\" provides platform-independent graphics and sound access, and comes with its own windowing toolkit and extensible set of styles (GUI widgets). Extended editions, such as \"Rebol/Command\" 2.7.8 or \"Rebol/SDK\" 2.7.8 require a paid license; they add features like ODBC data access, and the option to create standalone executable files.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(formerly Red Hat Software, Inc.) is an American software company that provides open source software products to enterprises and is a subsidiary of IBM. Founded in 1993, Red Hat has its corporate headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, with other offices worldwide.\nRed Hat has become associated to a large extent with its enterprise operating system Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With the acquisition of open-source enterprise middleware vendor JBoss, Red Hat also offers Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), an enterprise virtualization product. Red Hat provides storage, operating system platforms, middleware, applications, management products, support, training, and consulting services.\nRed Hat creates, maintains, and contributes to many free software projects. It has acquired the codebases of several proprietary software products through corporate mergers and acquisitions, and has released such software under open source licenses. As of \u00a02016[ [update]], Red Hat is the second largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel version 4.14 after Intel.\nOn October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion. The acquisition closed on July 9, 2019. It now operates as an independent subsidiary.\nHistory.\nIn 1993, Bob Young incorporated the ACC Corporation, a catalog business that sold Linux and Unix software accessories. In 1994, Marc Ewing created his own Linux distribution, which he named Red Hat Linux (associated with the time Ewing wore a red Cornell University lacrosse hat, given to him by his grandfather, while attending Carnegie Mellon University). Ewing released the software in October, and it became known as the Halloween release. Young bought Ewing's business in 1995, and the two merged to become Red Hat Software, with Young serving as chief executive officer (CEO).\nRed Hat went public on August 11, 1999, achieving\u2014at the time\u2014the eighth-biggest first-day gain in the history of Wall Street. Matthew Szulik succeeded Bob Young as CEO in December of that year. Bob Young went on to found the online print on demand and self-publishing company, Lulu in 2002.\nOn November 15, 1999, Red Hat acquired Cygnus Solutions. Cygnus provided commercial support for free software and housed maintainers of GNU software products such as the GNU Debugger and GNU Binutils. One of the founders of Cygnus, Michael Tiemann, became the chief technical officer of Red Hat and by 2008[ [update]] the vice president of open-source affairs. Later Red Hat acquired WireSpeed, C2Net, Hell's Kitchen Systems, and Akopia.\nIn February 2000, \"InfoWorld\" awarded Red Hat its fourth consecutive \"Operating System Product of the Year\" award for Red Hat Linux 6.1. Red Hat acquired Planning Technologies, Inc. in 2001 and AOL's iPlanet directory and certificate-server software in 2004.\nRed Hat moved its headquarters from Durham to North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus in Raleigh, North Carolina in February 2002. In the following month Red Hat introduced Red Hat Linux Advanced Server, later renamed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Dell, IBM, HP and Oracle Corporation announced their support of the platform.\nIn December 2005, \"CIO Insight\" magazine conducted its annual \"Vendor Value Survey\", in which Red Hat ranked #1 in value for the second year in a row. Red Hat stock became part of the NASDAQ-100 on December 19, 2005.\nRed Hat acquired open-source middleware provider JBoss on June 5, 2006, and JBoss became a division of Red Hat. On September 18, 2006, Red Hat released the Red Hat Application Stack, which integrated the JBoss technology and which was certified by other well-known software vendors. On December 12, 2006, Red Hat stock moved from trading on NASDAQ (RHAT) to the New York Stock Exchange (RHT). In 2007 Red Hat acquired MetaMatrix and made an agreement with Exadel to distribute its software.\nOn March 15, 2007, Red Hat released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and in June acquired Mobicents. On March 13, 2008, Red Hat acquired Amentra, a provider of systems integration services for service-oriented architecture, business process management, systems development, and enterprise data services.\nOn July 27, 2009, Red Hat replaced CIT Group in Standard and Poor's 500 stock index, a diversified index of 500 leading companies of the U.S. economy. This was reported as a major milestone for Linux.\nOn December 15, 2009, it was reported that Red Hat will pay US$ to settle a class action lawsuit related to the restatement of financial results from July 2004. The suit had been pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Red Hat reached the proposed settlement agreement and recorded a one-time charge of US$ for the quarter that ended Nov. 30.\nOn January 10, 2011, Red Hat announced that it would expand its headquarters in two phases, adding 540 employees to the Raleigh operation, and investing over US$. The state of North Carolina is offering up to US$ in incentives. The second phase involves \"expansion into new technologies such as software virtualization and technology cloud offerings\".\nOn August 25, 2011, Red Hat announced it would move about 600 employees from the N.C. State Centennial Campus to the Two Progress Plaza building. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on June 24, 2013, in the re-branded Red Hat Headquarters.\nIn 2012, Red Hat became the first one-billion dollar open-source company, reaching US$ in annual revenue during its fiscal year. Red Hat passed the $2 billion benchmark in 2015. As of February 2018[ [update]] the company's annual revenue was nearly $3 billion.\nOn October 16, 2015, Red Hat announced its acquisition of IT automation startup Ansible, rumored for an estimated US$100 million.\nIn June 2017, Red Hat announced Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure (RHHI) 1.0 software product.\nIn May 2018, Red Hat acquired CoreOS.\nRed Hat's links to branches of Israel's military and statements of support for Israeli associates has also led to some controversy and calls for boycott during the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\nIBM subsidiary.\nOn October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire Red Hat for US$34 billion, in one of its largest-ever acquisitions. The company will operate out of IBM's Hybrid Cloud division. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google reportedly also considered buying Red Hat.\nSix months later, on May 3, 2019, the US Department of Justice concluded its review of IBM's proposed Red Hat acquisition, and according to Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols \"essentially approved the IBM/Red Hat deal\". The acquisition was closed on July 9, 2019.\nFedora Project.\nRed Hat is the primary sponsor of the Fedora Project, a community-supported free software project that aims to promote the rapid progress of free and open-source software and content.\nBusiness model.\nRed Hat operates on a business model based on open-source software, development within a community, professional quality assurance, and subscription-based customer support. They produce open-source code so that more programmers can make adaptations and improvements.\nRed Hat sells subscriptions for the support, training, and integration services that help customers in using their open-source software products. Customers pay one set price for unlimited access to services such as Red Hat Network and up to 24/7 support.\nIn September 2014, however, CEO Jim Whitehurst announced that Red Hat was \"in the midst of a major shift from client-server to cloud-mobile\".\nRich Bynum, a member of Red Hat's legal team, attributes Linux's success and rapid development partially to open-source business models, including Red Hat's.\nPrograms and projects.\nOne Laptop per Child.\nRed Hat engineers worked with the One Laptop per Child initiative (a non-profit organization established by members of the MIT Media Lab) to design and produce an inexpensive laptop and try to provide every child in the world with access to open communication, open knowledge, and open learning. The XO-4 laptop, the last machine the project produced (in 2012), runs a slimmed-down version of Fedora 17 as its operating system.\nKVM.\nAvi Kivity began the development of KVM in mid-2006 at Qumranet, a technology startup company that was acquired by Red Hat in 2008.\nGNOME.\nRed Hat is the largest contributor to the GNOME desktop environment. It has several employees working full-time on Evolution, the official personal information manager for GNOME.\nsystemd.\nInit system and system/service manager for Linux systems.\nPulseAudio.\nNetwork-capable sound server program distributed via the freedesktop.org project.\nDogtail.\nDogtail, an open-source automated graphical user interface (GUI) test framework initially developed by Red Hat, consists of free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is written in Python.

Red Hat announced the release of Dogtail at the 2006 Red Hat Summit.\nMRG.\nRed Hat MRG is a clustering product intended for integrated high-performance computing (HPC). The acronym MRG stands for \"Messaging Realtime Grid\".\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG replaces the kernel of Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL, a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, to provide extra support for real-time computing, together with middleware support for message brokerage and scheduling workload to local or remote virtual machines, grid computing, and cloud computing.\nAs of 2011[ [update]], Red Hat works with the Condor High-Throughput Computing System community and also provides support for the software.\nThe Tuna performance-monitoring tool runs in the MRG environment.\nOpensource.com.\nRed Hat produced the online publication Opensource.com since January 20, 2010. The site highlights ways open-source principles apply in domains other than software development. The site tracks the application of open-source philosophy to business, education, government, law, health, and life.\nThe company originally produced a newsletter called Under the Brim. Wide Open magazine first appeared in March 2004, as a means for Red Hat to share technical content with subscribers regularly. The Under the Brim newsletter and Wide Open magazine merged in November 2004, to become \"Red Hat Magazine\". In January 2010, \"Red Hat Magazine\" became Opensource.com. In April 2023 Red Hat went through company layoffs and laid off the team maintaining Opensource.com.\nRed Hat Exchange.\nIn 2007, Red Hat announced that it had reached an agreement with some free software and open-source (FOSS) companies that allowed it to make a distribution portal called Red Hat Exchange, reselling FOSS software with the original branding intact. However, by 2010, Red Hat had abandoned the Exchange program to focus their efforts more on their Open Source Channel Alliance which began in April 2009.\nRed Hat build of Keycloak.\nRed Hat build of Keycloak (formerly known as Red Hat Single Sign-On) is a software product to allow single sign-on with Identity Management and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services.

Ceph's system offers disaster recovery and data redundancy through techniques such as replication, erasure coding, snapshots and storage cloning. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs.\nIn this way, administrators have a single, consolidated system that avoids silos and collects the storage within a common management framework. Ceph consolidates several storage use cases and improves resource utilization. It also lets an organization deploy servers where needed.\nOpenShift.\nRed Hat operates OpenShift, a cloud computing platform as a service, supporting applications written in Node.js, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaEE and more.\nOn July 31, 2018, Red Hat announced the release of Istio 1.0, a microservices management program used in tandem with the Kubernetes platform. The software purports to provide \"traffic management, service identity and security, policy enforcement and telemetry\" services in order to streamline Kubernetes use under the various Fedora-based operating systems. Red Hat's Brian Redbeard Harring described Istio as \"aiming to be a control plane, similar to the Kubernetes control plane, for configuring a series of proxy servers that get injected between application components\". Also Red Hat is the second largest contributor to Kubernetes code itself, after Google.\nOpenStack.\nRed Hat markets a version of OpenStack which helps manage a data center in the manner of cloud computing.\nCloudForms.\nRed Hat CloudForms provides management of virtual machines, instances and containers based on VMware vSphere, Red Hat Virtualization, Microsoft Hyper-V, OpenStack, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift. CloudForms is based on the ManageIQ project that Red Hat open sourced. Code in ManageIQ is from the over US$ acquisition of ManageIQ in 2012.\nCoreOS.\nContainer Linux (formerly CoreOS Linux) is a discontinued open-source lightweight operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed for providing infrastructure to clustered deployments. As an operating system, Container Linux provided only the minimal functionality required for deploying applications inside software containers, together with built-in mechanisms for service discovery and configuration sharing.\nLibreOffice.\nRed Hat contributed, with several software developers, to LibreOffice, a free and open-source office suite. However, in 2023, Red Hat announced they were not going to include LibreOffice in RHEL 10, citing the ability to download LibreOffice from Flatpak on RHEL desktops.\nOther FOSS projects.\nRed Hat also organises \"Open Source Day\" events where multiple partners show their open-source technologies.\nXorg.\nRed Hat is one of the largest contributors to the X Window System.\nWayland/Weston.\nStarted in 2008, by Red Hat developer Kristian H\u00f8gsberg, with the aim of replacing the X Windows System.\nUtilities and tools.\nSubscribers have access to:\nOver and above Red Hat's major products and acquisitions, Red Hat programmers have produced software programming-tools and utilities to supplement standard Unix and Linux software. Some of these Red Hat \"products\" have found their way from specifically Red Hat operating environments via open-source channels to a wider community. Such utilities include:\nThe Red Hat website lists the organization's major involvements in free and open-source software projects.\nCommunity projects under the aegis of Red Hat include:\nSubsidiaries.\nRed Hat Czech.\nRed Hat Czech s.r.o. is a research and development arm of Red Hat, based in Brno, Czech Republic. The subsidiary was formed in 2006 and has 1,180 employees (2019). Red Hat chose to enter the Czech Republic in 2006 over other locations due to the country's embrace of open-source. The subsidiary expanded in 2017 to a second location in the Brno Technology Park to accommodate an additional 350 employees.\nIn 2016, Red Hat Czech reported revenue of CZK 1,002\u00a0million (FY 2016), and net income of CZK 123\u00a0million (FY 2016), with assets of CZK 420\u00a0million (FY 2016)|CZK 325\u00a0million (FY 2015).\nThe group was named the \"Most progressive employer of the year\" in the Czech Republic in 2010, and the \"Best Employer in the Czech Republic\" for large scale companies in 2011 by Aon.\nRed Hat India.\nIn 2000, Red Hat created the subsidiary Red Hat India to deliver Red Hat software, support, and services to Indian customers. Colin Tenwick, former vice president and general manager of Red Hat EMEA, said Red Hat India was opened \"in response to the rapid adoption of Red Hat Linux in the subcontinent. Demand for open-source solutions from the Indian markets is rising and Red Hat wants to play a major role in this region.\" Red Hat India has worked with local companies to enable the adoption of open-source technology in both government and education.\nIn 2006, Red Hat India had a distribution network of more than 70 channel partners spanning 27 cities across India.

{"id": "26388", "revid": "43944218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26388", "title": "Reno, Nevada", "text": "City in Nevada, United States\nReno ( ) is a city in the northwest section of the U.S. state of Nevada, along the Nevada\u2013California border. It is the county seat and most populous city of Washoe County. Sitting in the High Eastern Sierra foothills, in the Truckee River valley, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, it is about northeast of Lake Tahoe. Known as \"The Biggest Little City in the World\", Reno is the 78th most populous city in the United States, the third most populous city in Nevada, and the most populous in Nevada outside the Las Vegas Valley. The city had a population of 264,165 at the 2020 census.\nThe city is named after Civil War Union major general Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in action during the American Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain, on Fox's Gap.\nReno is part of the Reno\u2013Sparks metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Nevada after the Las Vegas Valley. Known as Greater Reno, it includes Washoe, Storey, and Lyon Counties; the independent city and state capital Carson City; and parts of Placer and Nevada Counties in California. The Reno metro area (along with the neighboring city Sparks) occupies a valley colloquially known as the Truckee Meadows.\nFor much of the twentieth century, Reno saw a significant number of people seeking to take advantage of Nevada's relatively lax divorce laws and the city gained a national reputation as a divorce mill. Today, Reno is a tourist destination known for its casino gambling and proximity to Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada. The city is also home to the University of Nevada at Reno, the state's second-largest university by enrollment and the flagship campus of the University of Nevada system.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nArchaeological finds place the eastern border of the prehistoric Martis people in the Reno area. As early as the mid-1850s, a few pioneers settled in the Truckee Meadows, a relatively fertile valley through which the Truckee River made its way from Lake Tahoe to Pyramid Lake. In addition to subsistence farming, these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the California Trail, which followed the Truckee westward, before branching off towards Donner Lake, where the formidable obstacle of the Sierra Nevada began.\nGold was discovered in the vicinity of Virginia City in 1850, and a modest mining community developed, but the discovery of silver in 1859 at the Comstock Lode led to a mining rush, and thousands of emigrants left their homes, bound for the West, hoping to find a fortune.\nTo provide the necessary connection between Virginia City and the California Trail, Charles W. Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River in 1859. A small community that served travelers soon grew near the bridge. After two years, Fuller sold the bridge to Myron C. Lake, who continued to develop the community by adding a grist mill, kiln, and livery stable to the hotel and eating house. He renamed it \"Lake's Crossing\". Most of what is present-day western Nevada was formed as the Nevada Territory from part of Utah Territory in 1861.\nBy January 1863, the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) had begun laying tracks east from Sacramento, California, eventually connecting with the Union Pacific Railroad at Promontory, Utah, to form the First transcontinental railroad. Lake deeded land to the CPRR in exchange for its promise to build a depot at Lake's Crossing. In 1864, Washoe County was consolidated with Roop County, and Lake's Crossing became the county's largest town. Lake had earned himself the title \"founder of Reno\". Once the railroad station was established, the town of Reno officially came into being on May 9, 1868. CPRR construction superintendent Charles Crocker named the community after Major General Jesse Lee Reno, a Union officer killed in the Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain.\nIn 1871, Reno became the county seat of the newly expanded Washoe County, replacing the county seat in Washoe City. However, political power in Nevada remained with the mining communities, first Virginia City and later Tonopah and Goldfield.\nThe extension of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to Reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city's economy. In the following decades, Reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between Sacramento and Salt Lake City.\nAs the mining boom waned early in the 20th century, Nevada's centers of political and business activity shifted to the non-mining communities, especially Reno and Las Vegas. Nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world, after South Africa and Australia; the state yielded 6.9% of the world's supply in 2005 world gold production.\nThe Reno Arch was erected on Virginia Street in 1926 to promote the upcoming Transcontinental Highways Exposition of 1927. The arch included the words \"Nevada's Transcontinental Highways Exposition\" and the dates of the exposition. After the exposition, the Reno City Council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway, and Mayor E.E. Roberts asked the citizens of Reno to suggest a slogan for the arch. No acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered, and G.A. Burns of Sacramento was declared the winner on March 14, 1929, with \"Reno, the Biggest Little City in the World\".\nThe divorce capital of the world.\nIn the early twentieth century, Nevada became a popular destination for migratory divorce in an era when most states had highly restrictive laws on the subject. Legislation passed in 1931 completed the gradual reduction of the residency requirement from six months to six weeks, and Reno openly advertised itself as the \"Divorce Capital of the World\". Nevada's laws, which were fairly progressive for the time, allowed numerous grounds for divorce, and Reno's courts quickly gained a reputation for handling cases with both speed and sympathy for those seeking to \"untie the knot\". From the 1930s through the 1960s, Reno became synonymous with speedy divorce, often referred to colloquially as \"the six-week cure\". During these decades, the city's reputation drew thousands of divorcees annually, and they in turn became an important part of the local economy. These temporary residents flocked to hotels, boardinghouses, and hospitality ranches, many of which catered primarily to those waiting out the six-week residency requirement before their court date.\nNumerous local businesses openly courted these visitors, such as R. Herz &amp; Bro, a jewelry store that offered ring resetting services to the recently divorced and the luxurious El Cortez Hotel, which was built in part to accommodate the more affluent among Reno's six-week guests. The majority of those who came to Reno for divorce were women as Nevada did not require both parties in a divorce case to be present in court, and men often could not take that much time off from work. Although new \"residents\" seeking divorce were required to swear under oath that they intended to make Nevada their permanent home, most left soon after obtaining their divorce decree, which often occurred on the same day as the initial court hearing.\nIn addition to tens of thousands of ordinary people, Reno also became a major destination for celebrities and the very wealthy looking to end their marriages as quickly as possible. Some of the many famous personages who got divorced in Reno include Mary Pickford, Jack Dempsey, General Douglas MacArthur, Carole Lombard, Tallulah Bankhead, Adlai Stevenson II, Lana Turner, Nelson Rockefeller, Georges Simenon, Rita Hayworth, Gloria Vanderbilt and Cornelius Vanderbilt IV. The latter was married seven times and had five of his six divorces in Nevada. Mr. Vanderbilt was so taken with Reno that, unlike most migrant divorcees, he eventually settled there permanently.\nIn the 1939 film \"The Women\", Reno and its divorce culture serve as a backdrop to a significant part of the plot. Ernie Pyle once wrote in one of his columns, \"All the people you saw on the streets in Reno were obviously there to get divorces.\" In Ayn Rand's novel \"The Fountainhead\", published in 1943, the New York-based female protagonist tells a friend, \"I am going to Reno,\" which was understood as declaring their intention to get a divorce.\nThe divorce business eventually died out during the 1970s, as other states began relaxing their laws, and especially with the widespread introduction of no fault divorce.\nGambling and modern Reno.\nReno took a leap forward when the state of Nevada legalized open gambling on March 19, 1931, at the same time as it liberalized its divorce laws. The statewide push for legal Nevada gambling was led by Reno entrepreneur Bill Graham, who owned the Bank Club Casino in Reno, which was on Center Street. No other state offered legalized casino gaming like Nevada did in the 1930s, and casinos such as the Bank Club and Palace were popular. A few states had legal parimutuel horse racing, but no other state had legal casino gambling.\nWithin a few years, the Bank Club, owned by George Wingfield, Bill Graham, and Jim McKay, was the state's largest employer and the largest casino in the world. Wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits, along with his rent.\nAs the divorce industry declined, gambling became the major Reno industry. While gaming pioneers such as \"Pappy\" and Harold Smith of Harold's Club and Bill Harrah of the soon-to-dominate Harrah's Casino set up shop in the 1930s, the war years of the 1940s cemented Reno as the place to play for two decades. Beginning in the 1950s, the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation.\nAt 1:03\u00a0pm, on February 5, 1957, two explosions, caused by natural gas leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city, and an ensuing fire, destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of Sierra and First Streets along the Truckee River. The disaster killed two people and injured 49. The first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of Sierra Street (now the site of the Century Riverside), the second, across Sierra Street, now the site of the Palladio.\nThe presence of a main east\u2013west rail line, the emerging interstate highway system, a favorable state tax climate, and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods.\nIn the 1980s, Indian gaming rules were relaxed, and starting in 2000, Californian Native casinos began to cut into Reno casino revenues. Major new construction projects have been completed in the Reno and Sparks areas. A few new luxury communities were built in Truckee, California, about west of Reno on Interstate 80. Reno also is an outdoor recreation destination, due to its proximity to the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe, and numerous ski resorts in the region.\nIn 2018, the city officially changed its flag after a local contest was held. In recent years, the Reno metro area \u2212 spurred by large-scale investments from Greater Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area companies such as Amazon, Tesla, Panasonic, Microsoft, Apple, and Google \u2212 has become a new major technology center in the United States.\nGeography.\nGeology.\nReno is just east of the Sierra Nevada, on the western edge of the Great Basin at an elevation of about above sea level. Numerous faults exist throughout the region. Most of these are normal (vertical motion) faults associated with the extension of the earth's lithosphere and the uplift of the various mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada.\nIn February 2008, an earthquake swarm began to occur, lasting for several months, with the largest quake registering at magnitude 4.9, although some geologic estimates put it at 5.0. The earthquakes were centered on the Somersett community in western Reno near Mogul and Verdi. Many homes in these areas were damaged.\nThe unique high desert geological features cause many to \"describe Nevada as a rockhound's paradise ... access to millions of acres of government land\" allows geologists, miners, and amateur rockhounds in Nevada \"to hunt to your heart's content ... being able to find agate, opal, jasper, fossils, fluorescent minerals, obsidian, chalcedony, wonderstone, malachite, petrified wood, limb casts, and much more means paradise.\"\nEnvironmental considerations.\nThe Reno area is often subject to wildfires that cause property damage and sometimes loss of life. Roughly 80% of homes in the area have a risk of being impacted by wildfire. In August 1960, the Donner Ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days. In November 2011, arcing from powerlines caused a fire in Caughlin in southwest Reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one man. Just two months later, a fire in Washoe Drive sparked by fireplace ashes destroyed 29 homes and killed one woman. Around 10,000 residents were evacuated, and a state of emergency was declared. The fires came at the end of Reno's longest recorded dry spell. In September 2024, the Davis Fire burned heavily forested regions in Southwest Reno. Fourteen structures burned in the area, and twenty thousand people were evacuated.\nClimate.\nReno has a cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSk\"), bordering a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\") to the west. It experiences moderately cold winters and hot summers; it is influenced by the Sierra Nevada mountains to the west and the more arid Great Basin to the east. It is situated across a varied geographic landscape, which extends from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada into the Truckee River valley. While Reno experiences a rain shadow effect from the surrounding mountains, its western portions can receive three to four times as much precipitation as those extending eastward. Annual rainfall patterns in Reno adhere to a Mediterranean climate, with most precipitation occurring in fall, winter, and spring, followed by long, hot, dry summers. However, Reno's average annual rainfall is slightly lower than that of Californian cities more typically associated with Mediterranean climates. The area's low evapotranspiration stemming from its moderate annual average temperature also bears similarity to semi-arid climates found in Nevada's Great Basin.\nThe monthly daily average temperature ranges from in December to in July, with the diurnal temperature variation occasionally reaching in summer, still lower than much of the high desert to the east. There are 6.0 days of + highs, 65 days of + highs, 1.6 days with + lows, and 1.9 days with sub- lows annually; the temperature reaches or dips below the freezing point on 122 days, and does not rise above freezing on only 4.1 of those days. The record high temperature is , which occurred on July 10 and 11, 2002, again on July 5, 2007, and again on July 16, 2023. The record low temperature is , which occurred on January 21, 1916; the lowest temperature recorded at the airport is , which occurred on four occasions, most recently on February 7, 1989. In addition, the region is windy throughout the year; observers such as Mark Twain have commented about the \"Washoe Zephyr\", northwestern Nevada's distinctive wind.\nAnnual precipitation has ranged from in 1947 to in 2017. The most precipitation in one month was in January 1916, and the most precipitation in 24 hours was on January 28, 1903. At Reno\u2013Tahoe International Airport, where records go back to 1937, the most precipitation in one month was in January 2017, and the most precipitation in 24 hours was on January 21, 1943.\nMost rainfall occurs in winter and spring. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a \"Washoe Zephyr\", can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upward against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.\nWinter snowfall is usually light to moderate, but can be heavy on some days, averaging annually. Snowfall varies with the lowest amounts (roughly 19\u201323\u00a0inches annually) at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the airport at , while the foothills of the Carson Range to the west ranging from in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive two to three times as much annual snowfall. The mountains of the Virginia Range to the east, meanwhile, can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation, and around twice as much annual snowfall above . However, snowfall increases in the Virginia Range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the Carson Range to the west, because the Virginia Range is well within the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range. The most snowfall in Reno in one winter was in 1915\u20131916, with an astonishing in January, the most in a calendar month, as well as on January 17, the most in a calendar day; the most snowfall in a calendar year was in 1916.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 225,221 people, 90,924 households, and 51,112 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 102,582 housing units at an average density of . The city's racial makeup was 74.2% White, 2.9% African American, 1.3% Native American, 6.3% Asian, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 10.5% some other race, and 4.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 24.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 62.5% of the population in 2010, down from 88.5% in 1980.\nAt the 2010 census, there were 90,924 households, of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.4% were headed by married couples living together, 11.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.8% were non-families. 32.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.7% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43, and the average family size was 3.10.\nIn the city, the 2010 population was spread out, with 22.8% under the age of 18, 12.5% from 18 to 24, 28.2% from 25 to 44, 24.9% from 45 to 64, and 11.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.7 males.\nIn 2011, the city's estimated median household income was $44,846, and the median family income was $53,896. Males had a median income of $42,120 versus $31,362 for females. The city's per capita income was $25,041. About 9.6% of families and 14.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.1% of those under age 18 and 12.8% of those age 65 or over. The population was 180,480 at the 2000 census; in 2010, its population had risen to 225,221, making it the third-largest city in the state after Las Vegas and Henderson, and the largest outside Clark County. Reno lies north of the Nevada state capital, Carson City, and northeast of Lake Tahoe in a shrub-steppe environment. Reno shares its eastern border with the city of Sparks and is the larger of the principal cities of the Reno\u2013Sparks, Nevada Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a metropolitan area that covers Storey and Washoe counties. The MSA had a combined population of 425,417 at the 2010 census.\nThere is an Italian-American community in Reno.\nEconomy.\nUntil the 1960s, Reno was the gambling capital of the United States, but Las Vegas's rapid growth, American Airlines' 2000 buyout of Reno Air, and the growth of Native American gaming in California have reduced its gambling economy. Older casinos were torn down (Mapes Hotel, Fitzgerald's Nevada Club, Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, Harold's Club, Palace Club), the Flamingo Hilton and smaller casinos like the Comstock, Sundowner, Golden Phoenix, Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into residential units.\nBecause of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento while Las Vegas has historically served more tourists from Southern California and the Phoenix area.\nSeveral large local hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown core. These larger hotel casinos are the Atlantis, the Peppermill, and the Grand Sierra Resort. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by \"Casino Player\" and \"Nevada\" magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Reno began a $300\u00a0million Tuscan-themed expansion.\nReno holds several events throughout the year to draw tourists to the area. They include Hot August Nights (a classic car convention), Street Vibrations (a motorcycle fan gathering and rally), the Great Reno Balloon Race, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, bowling tournaments (held in the National Bowling Stadium), and the Reno Air Races.\nSeveral large commercial developments were constructed during the mid-2000s boom, such as The Summit in 2007 and Legends at Sparks Marina in 2008.\nReno is the location of the corporate headquarters for several companies, including Braeburn Capital, Hamilton, Server Technology, EE Technologies, Caesars Entertainment, and Port of Subs. Companies based in the Reno metropolitan area include Sierra Nevada Corporation and U.S. Ordnance. International Game Technology, Bally Technologies and GameTech have a development and manufacturing presence.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Greater Reno saw an influx of technology companies entering the area, following major initiatives and investments by investors from Seattle &amp; the Bay Area. The first one in 1999 was Amazon in Fernley. After the Great Recession, the state placed an increased focus on economic development. Thousands of new jobs were created.\nThe Tesla Gigafactory at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is one of the largest buildings in the country, purportedly covering 5.8 million square feet. Although it was originally Tesla's largest factory, it's since been superseded by Gigafactory Texas, which has 10 million square feet. It employs roughly 11,000 people, making Tesla larger than any employer in the city of Reno, though the Industrial Center is located just outside of the city. In 2023 Tesla announced a $3.6 billion expansion of the facility that would incorporate an additional four million square feet, including an all-new plant for Semis and a much larger one for battery development. The new facilities are expected to add up to 3,000 new Tesla employees to the region upon completion.\nThe arrival of several data centers at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is further diversifying a region that was best known for distribution and logistics outside gaming and tourism. Switch's new SUPERNAP campus at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is shaping up to be the largest data center in the world once completed. Apple is expanding its data center at the adjacent Reno Technology Park and recently built a warehouse on land in downtown Reno.\nThe greater Reno area also hosts distribution facilities for Amazon, Walmart, PetSmart and Zulily.\nTop employers.\nAccording to Reno's 2023 Fiscal Year Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nHealthcare.\nReno has several healthcare facilities. Many are affiliated with the University of Nevada Reno School of Medicine.\nArts and culture.\nReno has several museums. The Nevada Museum of Art is the only American Alliance of Museums (AAM) accredited art museum in Nevada and the largest collection of Land art. The National Automobile Museum contains 200 cars that were from the collection of William F. Harrah, including Elvis Presley's 1973 Cadillac Eldorado.\nReno also hosts several music venues, such as the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts, the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Reno Pops Orchestra. The Reno Youth Symphony Orchestra (YSO), affiliated with the Reno Philharmonic, gives talented youth the opportunity to play advanced music and perform nationwide. In 2016, they had the honor of performing at Carnegie Hall. A.V.A. Ballet Theatre is the resident ballet company of the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. All of their classical performances are with the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra.\nEvery July, Reno celebrates Artown, a visual and performing arts festival that lasts the entire month of July throughout the city. Along with performances, Artown partners with other institutions throughout the Reno Tahoe area to hold workshops, camps, and classes for all ages. All events are free of charge or low cost.\nIn August, the festival Hot August Nights is a major car festival in Reno across the city.\nIn September, Reno hosts several events including Northern Nevada Pride and The Great Reno Balloon Race.\nReno has a public library, a branch of the Washoe County Library System. The Downtown branch of the Washoe County Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\nSports.\nReno is home to the Reno Aces, the minor league baseball Triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks, playing in Greater Nevada Field, a downtown ballpark opened in 2009. Reno has hosted multiple professional baseball teams in the past, most under the Reno Silver Sox name. The Reno Astros, a former professional, unaffiliated baseball team, played at Moana Stadium until 2009.\nIn basketball, the Reno Bighorns of the NBA G League played at the Reno Events Center from 2008 to 2018. They were primarily an affiliate of the Sacramento Kings throughout its existence. The Sacramento Kings bought the team in 2016 and moved the franchise to become the Stockton Kings in 2018.\nReno is host to both amateur and professional combat sporting events such as mixed martial arts and boxing. The \"Fight of the Century\" between Jack Johnson and James J. Jeffries was held in Reno in 1910. Boxer Ray Mancini fought four of his last five fights in Reno against Bobby Chacon, Livingstone Bramble, H\u00e9ctor Camacho and Greg Haugen.\nReno expected to be the future home of an ECHL ice hockey team, named the Reno Raiders, but construction on a suitable arena never began. The franchise was dormant since 1998, when it was named the Reno Rage, and earlier the Reno Renegades, and played in the now-defunct West Coast Hockey League (WCHL). In 2016, Reno was removed from the ECHL's Future Markets page.\nThe Reno\u2013Tahoe Open is northern Nevada's only PGA Tour event, held at Montr\u00eaux Golf &amp; Country Club in Reno. As part of the FedEx Cup, the tournament follows 132 PGA Tour professionals competing for a share of the event's $3\u00a0million purse. The Reno-Tahoe Open Foundation has donated more than $1.8\u00a0million to local charities.\nReno has a college sports scene, with the Nevada Wolf Pack appearing in football bowl games and an Associated Press and Coaches Poll Top Ten ranking in basketball in 2018.\nIn 2004, the city completed a $1.5\u00a0million whitewater park on the Truckee River in downtown Reno, which hosts whitewater events throughout the year. The course runs Class 2 and 3 rapids with year-round public access. The north channel features more aggressive rapids, drop pools, and \"holes\" for rodeo kayak-type maneuvers. The milder south channel is set up as a kayak slalom course and a beginner area.\nReno is home to two roller derby teams, the Battle Born Derby Demons and the Reno Roller Girls. The Battle Born Derby Demons compete on flat tracks locally and nationally. They are the only Derby team locally to compete in a national Derby league.\nReno is the home of the National Bowling Stadium, which hosts the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) Open Championships every three years.\nParks and recreation.\nReno is home to a variety of recreational activities, including both seasonal and year-round. In the summer, Reno locals can be found near three major bodies of water: Lake Tahoe, the Truckee River, and Pyramid Lake. The Truckee River originates at Lake Tahoe and flows west to east through the center of downtown Reno before terminating at Pyramid Lake to the north. The river is a major part of Artown, held in the summer at Wingfield Park. Washoe Lake is a popular kite and windsurfing location because of its high wind speeds during the summer.\nSkiing and snowboarding are among the most popular winter sports and draw many tourists. There are 18 ski resorts (8 major resorts) as close as and as far as from the Reno\u2013Tahoe International Airport, including Northstar California, Sierra-at-Tahoe, Alpine Meadows, Palisades Tahoe, Sugar Bowl, Diamond Peak, Heavenly Mountain, and Mount Rose. Other popular Reno winter activities include snowshoeing, ice skating, and snowmobiling. There are many bike paths to ride in the summertime. Lake Tahoe hosts international bike competitions each summer.\nAir races.\nThe Reno Air Races, also known as the National Championship Air Races, are held each September at the Reno Stead Airport. 2023 will mark the final year for the races in Reno after 60 years, as a result of the Reno Tahoe Airport Authority's decision to sundown the event, citing growth around the airport, amongst other nonspecific concerns not stated by the RTAA.\nGovernment.\nReno has a democratic municipal government. The city council is the core of the government, with seven members. Six of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the primary by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The mayor serves as the at-large member representing the entire city. A second at-large position existed until the creation of the city\u2019s sixth ward in 2023. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.\nThere is an elected city attorney who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court and prosecutes misdemeanors.\nThe city's charter calls for a council-manager form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions: the city manager, who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the city clerk. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.\nIn 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body. Fifty-four\u00a0percent of voters approved of the ballot measure to inquire into consolidating the governments.\nFire department.\nThe Reno Fire Department (RFD) operates 15 fire stations.\nThe RFD provides all-risk emergency service to the City of Reno residents. All-risk emergency service is the national model of municipal fire departments, providing the services needed in the most efficient way possible.\nThe department provides paramedic-level service to the citizens and visitors of Reno.\nIn addition to responding to fires, the fire department also provides rescue capabilities for almost any type of emergency. This includes emergency medical care for the citizens, a hazardous materials team capable of identifying unknown materials and controlling a release disaster, and management of large-scale incidents.\nEducation.\nPublic schools.\nPublic education is provided by the Washoe County School District.\nPublic charter schools.\nReno has many charter schools, which include Academy for Career Education (ACE High School), serving grades 10\u201312, opened 2002; Alpine Academy Charter High School, serving grades 9\u201312, opened 2009; Bailey Charter Elementary School, serving grades K-6, opened 2001; Coral Academy of Science, serving grades K-12; Davidson Academy, serving grades 6\u201312, opened 2006; Doral Academy of Northern Nevada, serving grades K-8; High Desert Montessori School, serving grades PreK-7, opened 2002; I Can Do Anything Charter School, serving grades 9\u201312, opened 2000; Mariposa Language and Learning Academy, serving grades K-5; Mater Academy of Northern Nevada, serving grades K-8; Pinecrest Academy of Northern Nevada, serving grades K-8; Rainshadow Community Charter High School, serving grades 9\u201312, opened 2003; Sierra Nevada Academy Charter School, serving grades PreK-8, opened 1999; and TEAM A (Together Everyone Achieves More Academy), serving grades 9\u201312, opened 2004.\nPrivate schools.\nReno has a few private elementary schools such as Legacy Christian School, Excel Christian School, St. Nicholas Orthodox Academy, Lamplight Christian School, and Nevada Sage Waldorf School as well as private high schools, the largest of which are Bishop Manogue High School and Sage Ridge School.\nTransportation.\nRoads.\nReno was historically served by the Victory Highway and a branch of the Lincoln Highway. After the formation of the U.S. Numbered Highways system, U.S. Route 40 was routed along 4th Street through downtown Reno, before being replaced by Interstate 80. The primary north\u2013south highway through Reno is U.S. Route 395/Interstate 580.\nBus.\nThe Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County (RTC) has a bus system that provides intracity buses, intercity buses to Carson City, and an on-demand shuttle service for disabled persons. The system has its main terminal on 4th Street in downtown Reno and secondary terminals in Sparks and at Meadowood Mall in south Reno.\nNumerous shuttle and excursion services are offered connecting the Reno\u2013Tahoe International Airport to various destinations:\nGreyhound stops at a downtown terminal. Megabus stopped at the Silver Legacy Reno, but has since discontinued service to Reno.\nRail.\nReno was historically a stopover along the First transcontinental railroad; the modern Overland Route continues to run through Reno. Reno was additionally the southern terminus of the Nevada\u2013California\u2013Oregon Railway (NCO) and the northern terminus of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. Using the NCO depot and right of way, the Western Pacific Railroad also provided rail service to Reno. In the early 20th century, Reno also had a modest streetcar system. Downtown Reno has two historic train depots, the inactive Nevada-California-Oregon Railroad Depot and the active Amtrak depot at Reno station, originally built by the Southern Pacific Railroad.\nAmtrak provides daily passenger service to Reno via the \"California Zephyr\" at Reno station and via multiple Amtrak Thruway buses that connect to trains departing from Sacramento.\nAir.\nThe city is served by Reno\u2013Tahoe International Airport, with general aviation traffic handled by Reno Stead Airport. Reno\u2013Tahoe International Airport is the second busiest commercial airport in the state of Nevada after Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Reno was the hub and headquarters of the defunct airline Reno Air.\nUtilities.\nThe Truckee Meadows Water Authority provides potable water for the city. The Truckee River is the primary water source. It supplies Reno with of water a day during the summer, and of water per day in the winter. The two water treatment plants are Chalk Bluff and Glendale. The Chalk Bluff plant's main intakes are west of Reno and south of Verdi, with the water flowing through a series of flumes and ditches to the plant. Alternative intakes are below the plant along the banks of the Truckee River itself. The Glendale plant is alongside the river, and is fed by a rock and concrete rubble diversion dam a short distance upstream.\nSewage treatment for most of the Truckee Meadows region takes place at the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility at the eastern edge of the valley. Treated effluent returns to the Truckee River by way of Steamboat Creek, which also receives water from the historic Steamboat Ditch. In the 1990s, this capacity was increased from 20 to 30\u00a0million U.S. gallons (70 to 110\u00a0million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, nitrogen, and phosphorus, aggravating water-quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of Pyramid Lake. Local agencies working with the Environmental Protection Agency have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge. To accomplish this successful outcome, the DSSAM Model was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.\nNV Energy, formerly Sierra Pacific, provides electric power and natural gas. Power comes from multiple sources, including Tracy-Clark Station to the east, and the Steamboat Springs binary cycle power plants at the southern end of town.\nIn popular culture.\nMovies filmed in Reno include:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReno is featured in the post-apocalyptic roleplaying game \"Fallout 2\", as New Reno. It is also mentioned in the Johnny Cash song Folsom Prison Blues. The final two episodes of \"Knuckles\" had additional filming take place in Reno, as the episodes featured the city prominently.\nThis city is mentioned by the singer Miyeon from the K-Pop group i-dle in her solo song \"Reno\" featured with the South-Korean singer Scolde. This song was released as a single on October the 28th in 2025.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nReno's sister cities are:\nReno was previously twinned with these cities:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26390", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26390", "title": "Riemann integral", "text": "Basic integral in elementary calculus\nIn the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Riemann integral, created by Bernhard Riemann, was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval. It was presented to the faculty at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868. For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the fundamental theorem of calculus or approximated by numerical integration, or simulated using Monte Carlo integration.\nOverview.\nImagine you have a curve on a graph, and the curve stays above the x-axis between two points, a and b. The area under that curve, from a to b, is what we want to figure out. This area can be described as the set of all points (x, y) on the graph that follow these rules: a \u2264 x \u2264 b (the x-coordinate is between a and b) and 0 &lt; y &lt; f(x) (the y-coordinate is between 0 and the height of the curve f(x)). Mathematically, this region can be expressed in set-builder notation as\nformula_1\nTo measure this area, we use a Riemann integral, which is written as:\nformula_2\nThis notation means \u201cthe integral of f(x) from a to b,\u201d and it represents the exact area under the curve f(x) and above the x-axis, between x = a and x = b.\nThe idea behind the Riemann integral is to break the area into small, simple shapes (like rectangles), add up their areas, and then make the rectangles smaller and smaller to get a better estimate. In the end, when the rectangles are infinitely small, the sum gives the exact area, which is what the integral represents.\nIf the curve dips below the x-axis, the integral gives a signed area. This means the integral adds the part above the x-axis as positive and subtracts the part below the x-axis as negative. So, the result of formula_3 can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on how much of the curve is above or below the x-axis.\nDefinition.\nPartitions of an interval.\nA partition of an interval [\"a\", \"b\"] is a finite sequence of numbers of the form\nformula_4\nEach [\"xi\", \"x\"\"i\" + 1] is called a sub-interval of the partition. The mesh or norm of a partition is defined to be the length of the longest sub-interval, that is,\nformula_5\nA tagged partition \"P\"(\"x\", \"t\") of an interval [\"a\", \"b\"] is a partition together with a choice of a sample point within each sub-interval: that is, numbers \"t\"0, ..., \"t\"\"n\" \u2212 1 with \"ti\" \u2208 [\"xi\", \"x\"\"i\" + 1] for each i. The mesh of a tagged partition is the same as that of an ordinary partition.\nSuppose that two partitions \"P\"(\"x\", \"t\") and \"Q\"(\"y\", \"s\") are both partitions of the interval [\"a\", \"b\"]. We say that \"Q\"(\"y\", \"s\") is a refinement of \"P\"(\"x\", \"t\") if for each integer i, with \"i\" \u2208 [0, \"n\"], there exists an integer \"r\"(\"i\") such that \"xi\" \n \"y\"\"r\"(\"i\") and such that \"ti\" \n \"sj\" for some j with \"j\" \u2208 [\"r\"(\"i\"), \"r\"(\"i\" + 1)]. That is, a tagged partition breaks up some of the sub-intervals and adds sample points where necessary, \"refining\" the accuracy of the partition.\nWe can turn the set of all tagged partitions into a directed set by saying that one tagged partition is greater than or equal to another if the former is a refinement of the latter.\nRiemann sum.\nLet f be a real-valued function defined on the interval [\"a\", \"b\"]. The Riemann sum of f with respect to a tagged partition \"P\"(\"x\", \"t\") of [\"a\", \"b\"] is\nformula_6\nEach term in the sum is the product of the value of the function at a given point and the length of an interval. Consequently, each term represents the (signed) area of a rectangle with height \"f\"(\"ti\") and width \"x\"\"i\" + 1 \u2212 \"xi\". The Riemann sum is the (signed) area of all the rectangles.\nClosely related concepts are the \"lower and upper Darboux sums\". These are similar to Riemann sums, but the tags are replaced by the infimum and supremum (respectively) of f on each sub-interval:\nformula_7\nIf f is continuous, then the lower and upper Darboux sums for an untagged partition are equal to the Riemann sum for that partition, where the tags are chosen to be the minimum or maximum (respectively) of f on each subinterval. (When f is discontinuous on a subinterval, there may not be a tag that achieves the infimum or supremum on that subinterval.) The Darboux integral, which is similar to the Riemann integral but based on Darboux sums, is equivalent to the Riemann integral.\nRiemann integral.\nLoosely speaking, the Riemann integral is the limit of the Riemann sums of a function as the partitions get finer. If the limit exists then the function is said to be integrable (or more specifically Riemann-integrable). The Riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the Riemann integral by making the partition fine enough.\nOne important requirement is that the mesh of the partitions must become smaller and smaller, so that it has the limit zero. If this were not so, then we would not be getting a good approximation to the function on certain subintervals. In fact, this is enough to define an integral. To be specific, we say that the Riemann integral of f exists and equals s if the following condition holds:\nFor all \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0, there exists \"\u03b4\" &gt; 0 such that for any tagged partition \"x\"0, ..., \"xn\" and \"t\"0, ..., \"t\"\"n\" \u2212 1 whose mesh is less than \u03b4, we have\nformula_8\nUnfortunately, this definition is very difficult to use. It would help to develop an equivalent definition of the Riemann integral which is easier to work with. We develop this definition now, with a proof of equivalence following. Our new definition says that the Riemann integral of f exists and equals s if the following condition holds:\nFor all \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0, there exists a tagged partition \"y\"0, ..., \"ym\" and \"r\"0, ..., \"r\"\"m\" \u2212 1 such that for any tagged partition \"x\"0, ..., \"xn\" and \"t\"0, ..., \"t\"\"n\" \u2212 1 which is a refinement of \"y\"0, ..., \"ym\" and \"r\"0, ..., \"r\"\"m\" \u2212 1, we have\nformula_8\nBoth of these mean that eventually, the Riemann sum of f with respect to any partition gets trapped close to s. Since this is true no matter how close we demand the sums be trapped, we say that the Riemann sums converge to s. These definitions are actually a special case of a more general concept, a net.\nAs we stated earlier, these two definitions are equivalent. In other words, s works in the first definition if and only if s works in the second definition. To show that the first definition implies the second, start with an \u03b5, and choose a \u03b4 that satisfies the condition. Choose any tagged partition whose mesh is less than \u03b4. Its Riemann sum is within \u03b5 of s, and any refinement of this partition will also have mesh less than \u03b4, so the Riemann sum of the refinement will also be within \u03b5 of s.\nTo show that the second definition implies the first, it is easiest to use the Darboux integral. First, one shows that the second definition is equivalent to the definition of the Darboux integral; for this see the Darboux integral article. Now we will show that a Darboux integrable function satisfies the first definition. Fix \u03b5, and choose a partition \"y\"0, ..., \"ym\" such that the lower and upper Darboux sums with respect to this partition are within \"\u03b5\"/2 of the value s of the Darboux integral. Let\nformula_10\nIf \"r\" \n 0, then f is the zero function, which is clearly both Darboux and Riemann integrable with integral zero. Therefore, we will assume that \"r\" &gt; 0. If \"m\" &gt; 1, then we choose \u03b4 such that\nformula_11\nIf \"m\" \n 1, then we choose \u03b4 to be less than one. Choose a tagged partition \"x\"0, ..., \"xn\" and \"t\"0, ..., \"t\"\"n\" \u2212 1 with mesh smaller than \u03b4. We must show that the Riemann sum is within \u03b5 of s.\nTo see this, choose an interval [\"xi\", \"x\"\"i\" + 1]. If this interval is contained within some [\"yj\", \"y\"\"j\" + 1], then\nformula_12\nwhere mj and Mj are respectively, the infimum and the supremum of \"f\" on [\"yj\", \"y\"\"j\" + 1]. If all intervals had this property, then this would conclude the proof, because each term in the Riemann sum would be bounded by a corresponding term in the Darboux sums, and we chose the Darboux sums to be near s. This is the case when \"m\" \n 1, so the proof is finished in that case.\nTherefore, we may assume that \"m\" &gt; 1. In this case, it is possible that one of the [\"xi\", \"x\"\"i\" + 1] is not contained in any [\"yj\", \"y\"\"j\" + 1]. Instead, it may stretch across two of the intervals determined by \"y\"0, ..., \"ym\". (It cannot meet three intervals because \u03b4 is assumed to be smaller than the length of any one interval.) In symbols, it may happen that\nformula_13\n(We may assume that all the inequalities are strict because otherwise we are in the previous case by our assumption on the length of \u03b4.) This can happen at most \"m\" \u2212 1 times.\nTo handle this case, we will estimate the difference between the Riemann sum and the Darboux sum by subdividing the partition \"x\"0, ..., \"xn\" at \"y\"\"j\" + 1. The term \"f\"(\"ti\")(\"x\"\"i\" + 1 \u2212 \"xi\") in the Riemann sum splits into two terms:\nformula_14\nSuppose, without loss of generality, that \"ti\" \u2208 [\"yj\", \"y\"\"j\" + 1]. Then\nformula_15\nso this term is bounded by the corresponding term in the Darboux sum for yj. To bound the other term, notice that\nformula_16\nIt follows that, for some (indeed any) \"t\" \u2208 [\"y\"\"j\" + 1, \"x\"\"i\" + 1],\nformula_17\nSince this happens at most \"m\" \u2212 1 times, the distance between the Riemann sum and a Darboux sum is at most \"\u03b5\"/2. Therefore, the distance between the Riemann sum and s is at most\u00a0\u03b5.\nExamples.\nLet formula_18 be the function which takes the value 1 at every point. Any Riemann sum of f on [0, 1] will have the value 1, therefore the Riemann integral of f on [0, 1] is 1.\nLet formula_19 be the indicator function of the rational numbers in [0, 1]; that is, formula_20 takes the value 1 on rational numbers and 0 on irrational numbers. This function does not have a Riemann integral. To prove this, we will show how to construct tagged partitions whose Riemann sums get arbitrarily close to both zero and one.\nTo start, let \"x\"0, ..., \"xn\" and \"t\"0, ..., \"t\"\"n\" \u2212 1 be a tagged partition (each ti is between xi and \"x\"\"i\" + 1). Choose \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0. The ti have already been chosen, and we can't change the value of f at those points. But if we cut the partition into tiny pieces around each ti, we can minimize the effect of the ti. Then, by carefully choosing the new tags, we can make the value of the Riemann sum turn out to be within \u03b5 of either zero or one.\nOur first step is to cut up the partition. There are n of the ti, and we want their total effect to be less than \u03b5. If we confine each of them to an interval of length less than \"\u03b5\"/\"n\", then the contribution of each ti to the Riemann sum will be at least 0 \u00b7 \"\u03b5\"/\"n\" and at most 1 \u00b7 \"\u03b5\"/\"n\". This makes the total sum at least zero and at most \u03b5. So let \u03b4 be a positive number less than \"\u03b5\"/\"n\". If it happens that two of the ti are within \u03b4 of each other, choose \u03b4 smaller. If it happens that some ti is within \u03b4 of some xj, and ti is not equal to xj, choose \u03b4 smaller. Since there are only finitely many ti and xj, we can always choose \u03b4 sufficiently small.\nNow we add two cuts to the partition for each ti. One of the cuts will be at \"ti\" \u2212 \"\u03b4\"/2, and the other will be at \"ti\" + \"\u03b4\"/2. If one of these leaves the interval [0, 1], then we leave it out. ti will be the tag corresponding to the subinterval\nformula_21\nIf ti is directly on top of one of the xj, then we let ti be the tag for both intervals:\nformula_22\nWe still have to choose tags for the other subintervals. We will choose them in two different ways. The first way is to always choose a rational point, so that the Riemann sum is as large as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at least 1 \u2212 \"\u03b5\". The second way is to always choose an irrational point, so that the Riemann sum is as small as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at most \u03b5.\nSince we started from an arbitrary partition and ended up as close as we wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number s, so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is Lebesgue integrable. In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this is a fact that is beyond the reach of the Riemann integral.\nThere are even worse examples. formula_20 is equivalent (that is, equal almost everywhere) to a Riemann integrable function, but there are non-Riemann integrable bounded functions which are not equivalent to any Riemann integrable function. For example, let C be the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set, and let \"IC\" be its indicator function. Because C is not Jordan measurable, \"IC\" is not Riemann integrable. Moreover, no function g equivalent to \"IC\" is Riemann integrable: g, like \"IC\", must be zero on a dense set, so as in the previous example, any Riemann sum of g has a refinement which is within \u03b5 of 0 for any positive number\u00a0\u03b5. But if the Riemann integral of g exists, then it must equal the Lebesgue integral of \"IC\", which is 1/2. Therefore, g is not Riemann integrable.\nSimilar concepts.\nIt is popular to define the Riemann integral as the Darboux integral. This is because the Darboux integral is technically simpler and because a function is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is Darboux-integrable.\nSome calculus books do not use general tagged partitions, but limit themselves to specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions may appear to be integrable.\nOne popular restriction is the use of \"left-hand\" and \"right-hand\" Riemann sums. In a left-hand Riemann sum, \"ti\" \n \"xi\" for all i, and in a right-hand Riemann sum, \"ti\" \n \"x\"\"i\" + 1 for all i. Alone this restriction does not impose a problem: we can refine any partition in a way that makes it a left-hand or right-hand sum by subdividing it at each ti. In more formal language, the set of all left-hand Riemann sums and the set of all right-hand Riemann sums is cofinal in the set of all tagged partitions.\nAnother popular restriction is the use of regular subdivisions of an interval. For example, the nth regular subdivision of [0, 1] consists of the intervals\nformula_24\nAgain, alone this restriction does not impose a problem, but the reasoning required to see this fact is more difficult than in the case of left-hand and right-hand Riemann sums.\nHowever, combining these restrictions, so that one uses only left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums on regularly divided intervals, is dangerous. If a function is known in advance to be Riemann integrable, then this technique will give the correct value of the integral. But under these conditions the indicator function formula_20 will appear to be integrable on [0, 1] with integral equal to one: Every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number, so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers, and hence it will appear to always equal one. The problem with this definition becomes apparent when we try to split the integral into two pieces. The following equation ought to hold:\nformula_26\nIf we use regular subdivisions and left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums, then the two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1.\nAs defined above, the Riemann integral avoids this problem by refusing to integrate formula_27 The Lebesgue integral is defined in such a way that all these integrals are 0.\nProperties.\nLinearity.\nThe Riemann integral is a linear transformation; that is, if f and g are Riemann-integrable on [\"a\", \"b\"] and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are constants, then\nformula_28\nBecause the Riemann integral of a function is a number, this makes the Riemann integral a linear functional on the vector space of Riemann-integrable functions.\nIntegrability.\nA bounded function on a compact interval [\"a\", \"b\"] is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere (the set of its points of discontinuity has measure zero, in the sense of Lebesgue measure). This is the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Lebesgue-Vitali theorem (of characterization of the Riemann integrable functions). It has been proven independently by Giuseppe Vitali and by Henri Lebesgue in 1907, and uses the notion of measure zero, but makes use of neither Lebesgue's general measure or integral.\nThe integrability condition can be proven in various ways, one of which is sketched below.\nIn particular, any set that is at most countable has Lebesgue measure zero, and thus a bounded function (on a compact interval) with only finitely or countably many discontinuities is Riemann integrable. Another sufficient criterion to Riemann integrability over [\"a\", \"b\"], but which does not involve the concept of measure, is the existence of a right-hand (or left-hand) limit at \"every\" point in [\"a\", \"b\") (or (\"a\", \"b\"]).\nAn indicator function of a bounded set is Riemann-integrable if and only if the set is Jordan measurable. The Riemann integral can be interpreted measure-theoretically as the integral with respect to the Jordan measure.\nIf a real-valued function is monotone on the interval [\"a\", \"b\"] it is Riemann integrable, since its set of discontinuities is at most countable, and therefore of Lebesgue measure zero. If a real-valued function on [\"a\", \"b\"] is Riemann integrable, it is Lebesgue integrable. That is, Riemann-integrability is a \"stronger\" (meaning more difficult to satisfy) condition than Lebesgue-integrability. The converse does not hold; not all Lebesgue-integrable functions are Riemann integrable.\nThe Lebesgue\u2013Vitali theorem does not imply that all type of discontinuities have the same weight on the obstruction that a real-valued bounded function be Riemann integrable on [\"a\", \"b\"]. In fact, certain discontinuities have absolutely no role on the Riemann integrability of the function\u2014a consequence of the classification of the discontinuities of a function.\nIf \"f\"\"n\" is a uniformly convergent sequence on [\"a\", \"b\"] with limit f, then Riemann integrability of all \"f\"\"n\" implies Riemann integrability of f, and\nformula_29\nHowever, the Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem (on a monotone pointwise limit) does not hold for Riemann integrals. Thus, in Riemann integration, taking limits under the integral sign is far more difficult to logically justify than in Lebesgue integration.\nGeneralizations.\nIt is easy to extend the Riemann integral to functions with values in the Euclidean vector space formula_30 for any n. The integral is defined component-wise; in other words, if f = (\"f\"1, ..., \"f\"\"n\") then\nformula_31\nIn particular, since the complex numbers are a real vector space, this allows the integration of complex valued functions.\nThe Riemann integral is only defined on bounded intervals, and it does not extend well to unbounded intervals. The simplest possible extension is to define such an integral as a limit, in other words, as an improper integral:\nformula_32\nThis definition carries with it some subtleties, such as the fact that it is not always equivalent to compute the Cauchy principal value\nformula_33\nFor example, consider the sign function \"f\"(\"x\") \n sgn(\"x\") which is 0 at \"x\" \n 0, 1 for \"x\" &gt; 0, and \u22121 for \"x\" &lt; 0. By symmetry,\nformula_34\nalways, regardless of a. But there are many ways for the interval of integration to expand to fill the real line, and other ways can produce different results; in other words, the multivariate limit does not always exist. We can compute\nformula_35\nIn general, this improper Riemann integral is undefined. Even standardizing a way for the interval to approach the real line does not work because it leads to disturbingly counterintuitive results. If we agree (for instance) that the improper integral should always be\nformula_36\nthen the integral of the translation \"f\"(\"x\" \u2212 1) is \u22122, so this definition is not invariant under shifts, a highly undesirable property. In fact, not only does this function not have an improper Riemann integral, its Lebesgue integral is also undefined (it equals \u221e \u2212 \u221e).\nUnfortunately, the improper Riemann integral is not powerful enough. The most severe problem is that there are no widely applicable theorems for commuting improper Riemann integrals with limits of functions. In applications such as Fourier series it is important to be able to approximate the integral of a function using integrals of approximations to the function. For proper Riemann integrals, a standard theorem states that if \"fn\" is a sequence of functions that converge uniformly to f on a compact set [\"a\", \"b\"], then\nformula_37\nOn non-compact intervals such as the real line, this is false. For example, take \"fn\"(\"x\") to be \"n\"\u22121 on [0, \"n\"] and zero elsewhere. For all n we have:\nformula_38\nThe sequence (\"fn\") converges uniformly to the zero function, and clearly the integral of the zero function is zero. Consequently,\nformula_39\nThis demonstrates that for integrals on unbounded intervals, uniform convergence of a function is not strong enough to allow passing a limit through an integral sign. This makes the Riemann integral unworkable in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands.\nA better route is to abandon the Riemann integral for the Lebesgue integral. The definition of the Lebesgue integral is not obviously a generalization of the Riemann integral, but it is not hard to prove that every Riemann-integrable function is Lebesgue-integrable and that the values of the two integrals agree whenever they are both defined. Moreover, a function f defined on a bounded interval is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is bounded and the set of points where f is discontinuous has Lebesgue measure zero.\nAn integral which is in fact a direct generalization of the Riemann integral is the Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral.\nAnother way of generalizing the Riemann integral is to replace the factors \"x\"\"k\" + 1 \u2212 \"x\"\"k\" in the definition of a Riemann sum by something else; roughly speaking, this gives the interval of integration a different notion of length. This is the approach taken by the Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral.\nIn multivariable calculus, the Riemann integrals for functions from formula_40 are multiple integrals.\nComparison with other theories of integration.\nThe Riemann integral is unsuitable for many theoretical purposes. Some of the technical deficiencies in Riemann integration can be remedied with the Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral, and most disappear with the Lebesgue integral, though the latter does not have a satisfactory treatment of improper integrals. The gauge integral is a generalisation of the Lebesgue integral that is at the same time closer to the Riemann integral. \nThese more general theories allow for the integration of more \"jagged\" or \"highly oscillating\" functions whose Riemann integral does not exist; but the theories give the same value as the Riemann integral when it does exist.\nIn educational settings, the Darboux integral offers a simpler definition that is easier to work with; it can be used to introduce the Riemann integral. The Darboux integral is defined whenever the Riemann integral is, and always gives the same result. Conversely, the gauge integral is a simple but more powerful generalization of the Riemann integral and has led some educators to advocate that it should replace the Riemann integral in introductory calculus courses.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As an imaginary example of the concept, when encoding an image built up from colored dots, the sequence \"green green green green green green green green green\" is shortened to \"green x 9\". This is most efficient on data that contains many such runs, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, games, and animations. For files that do not have many runs, encoding them with RLE could increase the file size.\nRLE may also refer in particular to an early graphics file format supported by CompuServe for compressing black and white images, that was widely supplanted by their later Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).\nRLE also refers to a little-used image format in Windows 3.x that is saved with the file extension codice_1; it is a run-length encoded bitmap, and was used as the format for the Windows 3.x startup screen.\nHistory and applications.\nRun-length encoding (RLE) schemes were employed in the transmission of analog television signals as far back as 1967. In 1983, run-length encoding was patented by Hitachi. RLE is particularly well suited to palette-based bitmap images (which use relatively few colours) such as computer icons, and was a popular image compression method on early online services such as CompuServe before the advent of more sophisticated formats such as GIF. It does not work well on continuous-tone images (which use very many colours) such as photographs, although JPEG uses it on the coefficients that remain after transforming and quantizing image blocks.\nCommon formats for run-length encoded data include Truevision TGA, PackBits (by Apple, used in MacPaint), PCX and ILBM. The International Telecommunication Union also describes a standard to encode run-length colour for fax machines, known as T.45. That fax colour coding standard, which along with other techniques is incorporated into Modified Huffman coding, is relatively efficient because most faxed documents are primarily white space, with occasional interruptions of black.\nAlgorithm.\nRLE has a space complexity of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where n is the size of the input data.\nEncoding algorithm.\nRun-length encoding compresses data by reducing the physical size of a repeating string of characters. This process involves converting the input data into a compressed format by identifying and counting consecutive occurrences of each character. The steps are as follows:\nPython implementation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Imports and helper functions\ndef rle_encode(iterable, *, length_first=True):\n \u00bb&gt; \"\".join(rle_encode(\"AAAABBBCCDAA\"))\n '4A3B2C1D2A'\n \u00bb&gt; \"\".join(rle_encode(\"AAAABBBCCDAA\", length_first=False))\n 'A4B3C2D1A2'\n return (\n f\"{ilen(g)}{k}\" if length_first else f\"{k}{ilen(g)}\" # ilen(g): length of iterable g\n for k, g in groupby(iterable)\nDecoding algorithm.\nThe decoding process involves reconstructing the original data from the encoded format by repeating characters according to their counts. The steps are as follows:\nPython implementation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Imports\ndef rle_decode(iterable, *, length_first=True):\n \u00bb&gt; \"\".join(rle_decode(\"4A3B2C1D2A\"))\n 'AAAABBBCCDAA'\n \u00bb&gt; \"\".join(rle_decode(\"A4B3C2D1A2\", length_first=False))\n 'AAAABBBCCDAA'\n return chain.from_iterable(\n repeat(b, int(a)) if length_first else repeat(a, int(b))\n for a, b in batched(iterable, 2)\nExample.\nConsider a screen containing plain black text on a solid white background. There will be many long runs of white pixels in the blank space, and many short runs of black pixels within the text. A hypothetical scan line, with B representing a black pixel and W representing white, might read as follows:\n codice_2\nWith a run-length encoding (RLE) data compression algorithm applied to the above hypothetical scan line, it can be rendered as follows:\n codice_3\nThis can be interpreted as a sequence of twelve Ws, one B, twelve Ws, three Bs, etc., and represents the original 67 characters in only 18. While the actual format used for the storage of images is generally binary rather than ASCII characters like this, the principle remains the same. Even binary data files can be compressed with this method; file format specifications often dictate repeated bytes in files as padding space. However, newer compression methods such as DEFLATE often use LZ77-based algorithms, a generalization of run-length encoding that can take advantage of runs of strings of characters (such as codice_4).\nRun-length encoding can be expressed in multiple ways to accommodate data properties as well as additional compression algorithms. For instance, one popular method encodes run lengths for runs of two or more characters only, using an \"escape\" symbol to identify runs, or using the character itself as the escape, so that any time a character appears twice it denotes a run. On the previous example, this would give the following:\n codice_5\nThis would be interpreted as a run of twelve Ws, a B, a run of twelve Ws, a run of three Bs, etc. In data where runs are less frequent, this can significantly improve the compression rate.\nOne other matter is the application of additional compression algorithms. Even with the runs extracted, the frequencies of different characters may be large, allowing for further compression; however, if the run lengths are written in the file in the locations where the runs occurred, the presence of these numbers interrupts the normal flow and makes it harder to compress. To overcome this, some run-length encoders separate the data and escape symbols from the run lengths, so that the two can be handled independently. For the example data, this would result in two outputs, the string \"codice_6\" and the numbers (codice_7).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The nodes in a red-black tree hold an extra \"color\" bit, often drawn as red and black, which help ensure that the tree is always approximately balanced.\nWhen the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and \"repainted\" to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. The properties are designed such that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.\nThe (re-)balancing is not perfect, but guarantees searching in formula_1 time, where formula_2 is the number of entries in the tree. The insert and delete operations, along with tree rearrangement and recoloring, also execute in formula_1 time.\nTracking the color of each node requires only one bit of information per node because there are only two colors (due to memory alignment present in some programming languages, the real memory consumption may differ). The tree does not contain any other data specific to it being a red\u2013black tree, so its memory footprint is almost identical to that of a classic (uncolored) binary search tree.

These trees maintained all paths from root to leaf with the same number of nodes, creating perfectly balanced trees. However, they were not \"binary\" search trees. Bayer called them a \"symmetric binary B-tree\" in his paper and later they became popular as 2\u20133\u20134 trees or even 2\u20133 trees.\nIn a 1978 paper, \"A Dichromatic Framework for Balanced Trees\", Leonidas J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick derived the red\u2013black tree from the symmetric binary B-tree. The color \"red\" was chosen because it was the best-looking color produced by the color laser printer available to the authors while working at Xerox PARC. Another response from Guibas states that it was because of the red and black pens available to them to draw the trees.\nIn 1993, Arne Andersson introduced the idea of a right leaning tree to simplify insert and delete operations.\nIn 1999, Chris Okasaki showed how to make the insert operation purely functional. Its balance function needed to take care of only 4 unbalanced cases and one default balanced case.\nThe original algorithm used 8 unbalanced cases, but reduced that to 6 unbalanced cases. Sedgewick showed that the insert operation can be implemented in just 46 lines of Java.\nIn 2008, Sedgewick proposed the left-leaning red\u2013black tree, leveraging Andersson\u2019s idea that simplified the insert and delete operations. Sedgewick originally allowed nodes whose two children are red, making his trees more like 2\u20133\u20134 trees, but later this restriction was added, making new trees more like 2\u20133 trees. Sedgewick implemented the insert algorithm in just 33 lines, significantly shortening his original 46 lines of code.\nTerminology.\nThe black depth of a node is defined as the number of black nodes from the root to that node (i.e. the number of black ancestors). The black height of a red\u2013black tree is the number of black nodes in any path from the root to the leaves, which, by requirement 4, is constant (alternatively, it could be defined as the black depth of any leaf node).\nThe black height of a node is the black height of the subtree rooted by it. In this article, the black height of a null node shall be set to 0, because its subtree is empty as suggested by the example figure, and its tree height is also 0.\nProperties.\nIn addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the following must be satisfied by a \nSome authors, e.g. Cormen &amp; al., claim \"the root is black\" as fifth requirement; but not Mehlhorn &amp; Sanders or Sedgewick &amp; Wayne. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, this rule has little effect on analysis.\nThis article also omits it, because it slightly disturbs the recursive algorithms and proofs.\nAs an example, every perfect binary tree that consists only of black nodes is a red\u2013black tree.\nThe read-only operations, such as search or tree traversal, do not affect any of the requirements. In contrast, the modifying operations insert and easily maintain requirements 1 and 2, but with respect to the other requirements some extra effort must be made, to avoid introducing a violation of requirement 3, called a red-violation, or of requirement 4, called a black-violation.\nThe requirements enforce a critical property of red\u2013black trees: \"the path from the root to the farthest leaf is no more than twice as long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf\". The result is that the tree is height-balanced. Since operations such as inserting, deleting, and finding values require worst-case time proportional to the height formula_4 of the tree, this upper bound on the height allows red\u2013black trees to be efficient in the worst case, namely logarithmic in the number formula_2 of entries, i.e. formula_6 (a property which is shared by all self-balancing trees, e.g., AVL tree or B-tree, but not the ordinary binary search trees). For a mathematical proof see section Proof of bounds.\nRed\u2013black trees, like all binary search trees, allow quite efficient sequential access (e.g. in-order traversal, that is: in the order Left\u2013Root\u2013Right) of their elements. But they support also asymptotically optimal direct access via a traversal from root to leaf, resulting in formula_1 search time.\nAnalogy to 2\u20133\u20134 trees.\nRed\u2013black trees are similar in structure to 2\u20133\u20134 trees, which are B-trees of order 4. In 2\u20133\u20134 trees, each node can contain between 1 and 3 values and have between 2 and 4 children. These 2\u20133\u20134 nodes correspond to black node \u2013 red children groups in red-black trees, as shown in figure 1. It is not a 1-to-1 correspondence, because 3-nodes have two equivalent representations: the red child may lie either to the left or right. The left-leaning red-black tree variant makes this relationship exactly 1-to-1, by only allowing the left child representation. Since every 2\u20133\u20134 node has a corresponding black node, invariant 4 of red-black trees is equivalent to saying that the leaves of a 2\u20133\u20134 tree all lie at the same level.\nDespite structural similarities, operations on red\u2013black trees are more economical than B-trees. B-trees require management of vectors of variable length, whereas red-black trees are simply binary trees.\nApplications and related data structures.\nRed\u2013black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures that provide worst-case guarantees. For example, many data structures used in computational geometry are based on red\u2013black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler and epoll system call of the Linux kernel use red\u2013black trees.\nThe AVL tree is another structure supporting formula_1 search, insertion, and removal. AVL trees can be colored red\u2013black, and thus are a subset of red-black trees. The worst-case height of AVL is 0.720 times the worst-case height of red-black trees, so AVL trees are more rigidly balanced. The performance measurements of Ben Pfaff with realistic test cases in 79 runs find AVL to RB ratios between 0.677 and 1.077, median at 0.947, and geometric mean 0.910. The performance of WAVL trees lie in between AVL trees and red-black trees.\nRed\u2013black trees are also particularly valuable in functional programming, where they are one of the most common persistent data structures, used to construct associative arrays and sets that can retain previous versions after mutations. The persistent version of red\u2013black trees requires formula_1 space for each insertion or deletion, in addition to time.\nFor every 2\u20133\u20134 tree, there are corresponding red\u2013black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2\u20133\u20134 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red\u2013black trees. This makes 2\u20133\u20134 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red\u2013black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2\u20133\u20134 trees just before red\u2013black trees, even though 2\u20133\u20134 trees are not often used in practice.\nIn 2008, Sedgewick introduced a simpler version of the red\u2013black tree called the left-leaning red\u2013black tree by eliminating a previously unspecified degree of freedom in the implementation. The LLRB maintains an additional invariant that all red links must lean left except during inserts and deletes. Red\u2013black trees can be made isometric to either 2\u20133 trees, or 2\u20133\u20134 trees, for any sequence of operations. The 2\u20133\u20134 tree isometry was described in 1978 by Sedgewick. With 2\u20133\u20134 trees, the isometry is resolved by a \"color flip,\" corresponding to a split, in which the red color of two children nodes leaves the children and moves to the parent node.\nThe original description of the tango tree, a type of tree optimised for fast searches, specifically uses red\u2013black trees as part of its data structure.\nAs of Java 8, the HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store different elements with colliding hashcodes, a red\u2013black tree is used. This results in the improvement of time complexity of searching such an element from formula_10 to formula_11 where formula_12 is the number of elements with colliding hashes.\nImplementation.\nThe read-only operations, such as search or tree traversal, on a red\u2013black tree require no modification from those used for binary search trees, because every red\u2013black tree is a special case of a simple binary search tree. However, the immediate result of an insertion or removal may violate the properties of a red\u2013black tree, the restoration of which is called \"rebalancing\" so that red\u2013black trees become self-balancing.\nRebalancing (i.e. color changes) has a worst-case time complexity of formula_1 and average of formula_14, though these are very quick in practice. Additionally, rebalancing takes no more than three tree rotations (two for insertion).\nThis is an example implementation of insert and remove in C. Below are the data structures and the codice_1 helper function used in the insert and remove examples.\ntypedef enum Color: char { \n BLACK, \n RED \n} Color;\ntypedef enum Direction: char { \n LEFT, \n RIGHT \n} Direction;\n// red-black tree node\ntypedef struct Node {\n struct Node* parent; // null for the root node\n union {\n // Union so we can use -&gt;left/-&gt;right or -&gt;child[0]/-&gt;child[1]\n struct {\n struct Node* left;\n struct Node* right;\n struct Node* child[2];\n Color color;\n int key;\n} Node;\ntypedef struct {\n struct Node* root;\n} Tree;\nstatic Direction direction(const Node* N) {\n return N == N-&gt;parent-&gt;right ?

The proposal contains, for both insertion and removal, exactly one case that advances one black level closer to the root and loops, the other five cases rebalance the tree of their own. The more complicated cases are pictured in a diagram.\n For simplicity, the sample code uses the disjunction:\n codice_2\n and the conjunction:\n codice_3\n Thereby, it must be kept in mind that both statements are \"not\" evaluated in total, if codice_4. Then in both cases codice_5 is not touched (see Short-circuit evaluation).(The comment codice_6 is in accordance with requirement 2.)\n The related codice_7-statements have to occur far less frequently if the proposal is realised.\nInsertion.\nInsertion begins by placing the new (non-NULL) node, say N, at the position in the binary search tree of a NULL node whose in-order predecessor\u2019s key compares less than the new node\u2019s key, which in turn compares less than the key of its in-order successor.\nThe newly inserted node is temporarily colored red so that all paths contain the same number of black nodes as before.\nBut if its parent, say P, is also red then this action introduces a red-violation.\n// parent is optional\nvoid insert(Tree* tree, Node* node, Node* parent, Direction dir) {\n node-&gt;color = RED;\n node-&gt;parent = parent;\n if (!parent) {\n tree-&gt;root = node;\n return;\n parent-&gt;child[dir] = node;\n // rebalance the tree \n do {\n // Case #1\n if (parent-&gt;color == BLACK) {\n return; \n Node* grandparent = parent-&gt;parent;\n if (!grandparent) {\n // Case #4\n parent-&gt;color = BLACK;\n return;\n dir = direction(parent);\n Node* uncle = grandparent-&gt;child[1 - dir];\n if (!uncle || uncle-&gt;color == BLACK) {\n if (node == parent-&gt;child[1 - dir]) {\n // Case #5\n rotate_subtree(tree, parent, dir);\n node = parent;\n parent = grandparent-&gt;child[dir];\n // Case #6\n rotate_subtree(tree, grandparent, 1 - dir);\n parent-&gt;color = BLACK;\n grandparent-&gt;color = RED;\n return;\n \n // Case #2\n parent-&gt;color = BLACK;\n uncle-&gt;color = BLACK;\n grandparent-&gt;color = RED;\n node = grandparent;\n } while ((parent = node-&gt;parent));\n // Case #3\n return;\nThe rebalancing loop of the insert operation has the following invariants:\nInsert case 1.\nThe current node\u2019s parent P is black, so requirement 3 holds. Requirement 4 holds also according to the loop invariant.\nInsert case 2.\nIf both the parent P and the uncle U are red, then both of them can be repainted black and the grandparent G becomes red for maintaining requirement 4. Since any path through the parent or uncle must pass through the grandparent, the number of black nodes on these paths has not changed. However, the grandparent G may now violate requirement 3, if it has a red parent. After relabeling G to N the loop invariant is fulfilled so that the rebalancing can be iterated on one black level (= 2 tree levels) higher.\nInsert case 3.\nInsert case 2 has been executed for formula_17 times and the total height of the tree has increased by 1, now being h\u2009.\nThe current node N is the (red) root of the tree, and all RB-properties are satisfied.\nInsert case 4.\nThe parent P is red and the root.\nBecause N is also red, requirement 3 is violated. But after switching P\u2019s color the tree is in RB-shape.\nThe black height of the tree increases by 1.\nInsert case 5.\nThe parent P is red but the uncle U is black. The ultimate goal is to rotate the parent node P to the grandparent position, but this will not work if N is an \"inner\" grandchild of G (i.e., if N is the left child of the right child of G or the right child of the left child of G). A codice_9-rotation at P switches the roles of the current node N and its parent P. The rotation adds paths through N (those in the subtree labeled 2, see diagram) and removes paths through P (those in the subtree labeled 4). But both P and N are red, so requirement 4 is preserved. Requirement 3 is restored in case 6.\nInsert case 6.\nThe current node N is now certain to be an \"outer\" grandchild of G (left of left child or right of right child). Now codice_13-rotate at G, putting P in place of G and making P the parent of N and G. G is black and its former child P is red, since requirement 3 was violated. After switching the colors of P and G the resulting tree satisfies requirement 3. Requirement 4 also remains satisfied, since all paths that went through the black G now go through the black P.\nBecause the algorithm transforms the input without using an auxiliary data structure and using only a small amount of extra storage space for auxiliary variables it is in-place.\nRemoval.\nRemoval of a black non-root leaf.\nThe complex case is when N is not the root, colored black and has no proper child (\u21d4 only NULL children).\nIn the first iteration, N is replaced by NULL.\nvoid remove(Tree* tree, Node* node) {\n Node* parent = node-&gt;parent;\n Node* sibling;\n Node* close_nephew;\n Node* distant_nephew;\n Direction dir = direction(node);\n parent-&gt;child[dir] = NULL;\n goto start_balance;\n do {\n dir = direction(node);\nstart_balance:\n sibling = parent-&gt;child[1 - dir];\n distant_nephew = sibling-&gt;child[1 - dir];\n close_nephew = sibling-&gt;child[dir];\n if (sibling-&gt;color == RED) {\n // Case #3\n rotate_subtree(tree, parent, dir);\n parent-&gt;color = RED;\n sibling-&gt;color = BLACK;\n sibling = close_nephew;\n distant_nephew = sibling-&gt;child[1 - dir];\n if (distant_nephew &amp;&amp; distant_nephew-&gt;color == RED) {\n goto case_6;\n close_nephew = sibling-&gt;child[dir];\n if (close_nephew &amp;&amp; close_nephew-&gt;color == RED) {\n goto case_5;\n // Case #4\n sibling-&gt;color = RED;\n parent-&gt;color = BLACK;\n return;\n if (distant_nephew &amp;&amp; distant_nephew-&gt;color == RED) {\n goto case_6;\n if (close_nephew &amp;&amp; close_nephew-&gt;color == RED) {\n goto case_5;\n if (!parent) {\n // Case #1\n return;\n if (parent-&gt;color == RED) {\n // Case #4\n sibling-&gt;color = RED;\n parent-&gt;color = BLACK;\n return;\n // Case #2\n sibling-&gt;color = RED;\n node = parent;\n } while (parent = node-&gt;parent);\ncase_5:\n rotate_subtree(tree, sibling, 1 - dir);\n sibling-&gt;color = RED;\n close_nephew-&gt;color = BLACK;\n distant_nephew = sibling;\n sibling = close_nephew;\ncase_6:\n rotate_subtree(tree, parent, dir);\n sibling-&gt;color = parent-&gt;color;\n parent-&gt;color = BLACK;\n distant_nephew-&gt;color = BLACK;\n return;\nThe rebalancing loop of the delete operation has the following invariant:\nDelete case 1.\nThe current node N is the new root. One black node has been removed from every path, so the RB-properties are preserved.\nThe black height of the tree decreases by 1.\nDelete case 2.\nP, S, and S\u2019s children are black. After painting S red all paths passing through S, which are precisely those paths \"not\" passing through N, have one less black node. Now all paths in the subtree rooted by P have the same number of black nodes, but one fewer than the paths that do not pass through P, so requirement 4 may still be violated. After relabeling P to N the loop invariant is fulfilled so that the rebalancing can be iterated on one black level (= 1 tree level) higher.\nDelete case 3.\nThe sibling S is red, so P and the nephews C and D have to be black. A codice_9-rotation at P turns S into N\u2019s grandparent.\nThen after reversing the colors of P and S, the path through N is still short one black node. But N now has a red parent P and after the reassignment a black sibling S, so the transformations in cases 4, 5, or 6 are able to restore the RB-shape.\nDelete case 4.\nThe sibling S and S\u2019s children are black, but P is red. Exchanging the colors of S and P does not affect the number of black nodes on paths going through S, but it does add one to the number of black nodes on paths going through N, making up for the deleted black node on those paths.\nDelete case 5.\nThe sibling S is black, S\u2019s close child C is red, and S\u2019s distant child D is black. After a codice_13-rotation at S the nephew C becomes S\u2019s parent and N\u2019s new sibling. The colors of S and C are exchanged.\nAll paths still have the same number of black nodes, but now N has a black sibling whose distant child is red, so the constellation is fit for case D6. Neither N nor its parent P are affected by this transformation, and P may be red or black ( in the diagram).\nDelete case 6.\nThe sibling S is black, S\u2019s distant child D is red. After a codice_9-rotation at P the sibling S becomes the parent of P and S\u2019s distant child D. The colors of P and S are exchanged, and D is made black. The whole subtree still has the same color at its root S, namely either red or black ( in the diagram), which refers to the same color both before and after the transformation. This way requirement 3 is preserved. The paths in the subtree not passing through N (i.o.w. passing through D and node 3 in the diagram) pass through the same number of black nodes as before, but N now has one additional black ancestor: either P has become black, or it was black and S was added as a black grandparent. Thus, the paths passing through N pass through one additional black node, so that requirement 4 is restored and the total tree is in RB-shape.\nBecause the algorithm transforms the input without using an auxiliary data structure and using only a small amount of extra storage space for auxiliary variables it is in-place.\nProof of bounds.\nFor formula_19 there is a red\u2013black tree of height formula_4 with\nnodes (formula_21 is the floor function) and there is no red\u2013black tree of this tree height with fewer nodes\u2014therefore it is minimal.Its black height is \u2009 formula_22 \u2009 (with black root) or for odd formula_4 (then with a red root) also \u2009 formula_24\nFor a red\u2013black tree of a certain height to have minimal number of nodes, it must have exactly one longest path with maximal number of red nodes, to achieve a maximal tree height with a minimal black height. Besides this path all other nodes have to be black. If a node is taken off this tree it either loses height or some RB property.\nThe RB tree of height formula_25 with red root is minimal. This is in agreement with\n formula_26\nA minimal RB tree (RB\"h\" in figure 2) of height formula_27 has a root whose two child subtrees are of different height. The higher child subtree is also a minimal RB tree, RB\"h\"\u20131, containing also a longest path that defines its height formula_28; it has formula_29 nodes and the black height formula_30 The other subtree is a perfect binary tree of (black) height formula_31 having formula_32 black nodes\u2014and no red node. Then the number of nodes is by induction\nThe graph of the function formula_33 is convex and piecewise linear with breakpoints at formula_34 where formula_35 The function has been tabulated as formula_36 A027383(\"h\"\u20131) for formula_37 \nThe inequality formula_39 leads to formula_40, which for odd formula_4 leads to\n formula_42.\nSo in both, the even and the odd case, formula_4 is in the interval\nwith formula_44 being the number of nodes.\nA red\u2013black tree with formula_2 nodes (keys) has tree height formula_46\nSet operations and bulk operations.\nIn addition to the single-element insert, delete and lookup operations, several set operations have been defined on red\u2013black trees: union, intersection and set difference. Then fast \"bulk\" operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations, \"Split\" and \"Join\". With the new operations, the implementation of red\u2013black trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable. In order to achieve its time complexities this implementation requires that the root is allowed to be either red or black, and that every node stores its own black height.\n If the two trees have the same black height, \"Join\" simply creates a new node with left subtree \"t\"1, root k and right subtree \"t\"2. If both \"t\"1 and \"t\"2 have black root, set k to be red. Otherwise k is set black. \n If the black heights are unequal, suppose that \"t\"1 has larger black height than \"t\"2 (the other case is symmetric). \"Join\" follows the right spine of \"t\"1 until a black node c, which is balanced with \"t\"2. At this point a new node with left child c, root k (set to be red) and right child \"t\"2 is created to replace c. The new node may invalidate the red\u2013black invariant because at most three red nodes can appear in a row. This can be fixed with a double rotation. If double red issue propagates to the root, the root is then set to be black, restoring the properties. The cost of this function is the difference of the black heights between the two input trees.\n For some applications, \"Split\" also returns a Boolean value denoting if x appears in the tree. The cost of \"Split\" is formula_47 order of the height of the tree. This algorithm actually has nothing to do with any special properties of a red\u2013black tree, and may be used on any tree with a \"join\" operation, such as an AVL tree.\nThe join algorithm is as follows:\n function joinRightRB(TL, k, TR):\n if (TL.color=black) and (TL.blackHeight=TR.blackHeight):\n return Node(TL,\u27e8k,red\u27e9,TR)\n T'=Node(TL.left,\u27e8TL.key,TL.color\u27e9,joinRightRB(TL.right,k,TR))\n if (TL.color=black) and (T'.right.color=T'.right.right.color=red):\n T'.right.right.color=black;\n return rotateLeft(T')\n return T' /* T''[recte T'] */\n function joinLeftRB(TL, k, TR):\n /* symmetric to joinRightRB */\n function join(TL, k, TR):\n if TL.blackHeight&gt;TR.blackHeight:\n T'=joinRightRB(TL,k,TR)\n if (T'.color=red) and (T'.right.color=red):\n T'.color=black\n return T'\n if TR.blackHeight&gt;TL.blackHeight:\n /* symmetric */\n if (TL.color=black) and (TR.color=black):\n return Node(TL,\u27e8k,red\u27e9,TR)\n return Node(TL,\u27e8k,black\u27e9,TR)\nThe split algorithm is as follows:\n function split(T, k):\n if (T = NULL) return (NULL, false, NULL)\n if (k = T.key) return (T.left, true, T.right)\n if (k &lt; T.key):\n (L',b,R') = split(T.left, k)\n return (L',b,join(R',T.key,T.right))\n (L',b,R') = split(T.right, k)\n return (join(T.left,T.key,L'),b,T.right)\nThe union of two red\u2013black trees \"t\"1 and \"t\"2 representing sets A and B, is a red\u2013black tree t that represents \"A\" \u222a \"B\". The following recursive function computes this union:\n function union(t1, t2):\n if t1 = NULL return t2\n if t2 = NULL return t1\n (L1,b,R1)=split(t1,t2.key)\n proc1=start:\n TL=union(L1,t2.left)\n proc2=start:\n TR=union(R1,t2.right)\n wait all proc1,proc2\n return join(TL, t2.key, TR)\nHere, \"split\" is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less its input key, one holding the greater keys. (The algorithm is non-destructive, but an in-place destructive version exists also.)\nThe algorithm for intersection or difference is similar, but requires the \"Join2\" helper routine that is the same as \"Join\" but without the middle key. Based on the new functions for union, intersection or difference, either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the red\u2013black tree. Since \"Split\" calls \"Join\" but does not deal with the balancing criteria of red\u2013black trees directly, such an implementation is usually called the \"join-based\" implementation.\nThe complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is formula_48 for two red\u2013black trees of sizes formula_12 and formula_50. This complexity is optimal in terms of the number of comparisons. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed in parallel with a parallel depth formula_51. When formula_52, the join-based implementation has the same computational directed acyclic graph (DAG) as single-element insertion and deletion if the root of the larger tree is used to split the smaller tree.\nParallel algorithms.\nParallel algorithms for constructing red\u2013black trees from sorted lists of items can run in constant time or formula_53 time, depending on the computer model, if the number of processors available is asymptotically proportional to the number formula_2 of items where formula_55. Fast search, insertion, and deletion parallel algorithms are also known.\nThe join-based algorithms for red\u2013black trees are parallel for bulk operations, including union, intersection, construction, filter, map-reduce, and so on.\nParallel bulk operations.\nBasic operations like insertion, removal or update can be parallelised by defining operations that process bulks of multiple elements. It is also possible to process bulks with several basic operations, for example bulks may contain elements to insert and also elements to remove from the tree.\nThe algorithms for bulk operations aren't just applicable to the red\u2013black tree, but can be adapted to other sorted sequence data structures also, like the 2\u20133 tree, 2\u20133\u20134 tree and (a,b)-tree. In the following different algorithms for bulk insert will be explained, but the same algorithms can also be applied to removal and update. Bulk insert is an operation that inserts each element of a sequence formula_56 into a tree formula_57.\nJoin-based.\nThis approach can be applied to every sorted sequence data structure that supports efficient join- and split-operations.\nThe general idea is to split I and T in multiple parts and perform the insertions on these parts in parallel.\nNote that in Step 3 the constraints for splitting I assure that in Step 5 the trees can be joined again and the resulting sequence is sorted.\nThe pseudo code shows a simple divide-and-conquer implementation of the join-based algorithm for bulk-insert.\nBoth recursive calls can be executed in parallel.\nThe join operation used here differs from the version explained in this article, instead join2 is used, which misses the second parameter k.\n bulkInsert(T, I, k):\n I.sort()\n bulklInsertRec(T, I, k)\n bulkInsertRec(T, I, k):\n if k = 1:\n forall e in I: T.insert(e)\n else\n m := \u230asize(I) / 2\u230b\n (T1, _, T2) := split(T, I[m])\n bulkInsertRec(T1, I[0 .. m], \u2308k / 2\u2309)\n || bulkInsertRec(T2, I[m + 1 .. size(I) - 1], \u230ak / 2\u230b)\n T \u2190 join2(T1, T2)\nExecution time.\nSorting I is not considered in this analysis.\nThis can be improved by using parallel algorithms for splitting and joining.\nIn this case the execution time is formula_69.\nPipelining.\nAnother method of parallelizing bulk operations is to use a pipelining approach.\nThis can be done by breaking the task of processing a basic operation up into a sequence of subtasks.\nFor multiple basic operations the subtasks can be processed in parallel by assigning each subtask to a separate processor.\nExecution time.\nSorting I is not considered in this analysis.\nAlso, formula_85 is assumed to be smaller than formula_86, otherwise it would be more efficient to construct the resulting tree from scratch.\nReferences and notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26400", "revid": "36624617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26400", "title": "Retroactive continuity", "text": "Revision of existing facts in succeeding works of fiction\nRetroactive continuity, or retcon for short, is a literary device in fictional story telling whereby facts and events established through the narrative are adjusted, ignored, supplemented, or contradicted by a subsequently published work that recontextualizes or breaks continuity with the former.\nThere are various motivations for applying retroactive continuity, including:\nRetcons are used by authors to increase their creative freedom, on the assumption that the changes are unimportant to the audience compared to the new story that can be told. Retcons can be diegetic or nondiegetic. For instance, by using time travel or parallel universes, an author may diegetically reintroduce a popular character they had previously killed off. More subtle and nondiegetic methods would be ignoring or expunging minor plot points to remove narrative elements the author does not have interest in writing.\nRetcons are common in pulp fiction, and especially in comic books by long-established publishers such as DC and Marvel. The long history of popular titles and the number of writers who contribute stories can often create situations that demand clarification or revision. Retcons also appear in manga, soap operas, serial dramas, movie sequels, cartoons, television shows, professional wrestling angles, video games, radio series, role-playing games, and other forms of serial fiction.\nOrigins.\nAn early published use of the phrase \"retroactive continuity\" is found in theologian E. Frank Tupper's 1973 book \"The Theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg\": \"Pannenberg's conception of retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past, that the future is not basically a product of the past.\"\nA printed use of \"retroactive continuity\" referring to the altering of history in a fictional work is in \"All-Star Squadron\" #18 (February 1983) from DC Comics. The series was set on DC's Earth-Two, an alternative universe in which Golden Age comic characters age in real time. \"All-Star Squadron\" was set during World War II on Earth-Two; as it was in the past of an alternative universe, all its events had repercussions on the contemporary continuity of the DC multiverse. Each issue changed the history of the fictional world in which it was set. In the letters column, a reader remarked that the comic \"must make you [the creators] feel at times as if you're painting yourself into a corner\", and, \"Your matching of Golden Age comics history with new plotlines has been an artistic (and I hope financial!) success.\" Writer Roy Thomas responded, \"we like to think that an enthusiastic ALL-STAR booster at one of Adam Malin's Creation Conventions in San Diego came up with the best name for it a few months back: 'Retroactive Continuity'. Has kind of a ring to it, don't you think?\"\nTypes.\nAddition.\nRetcons sometimes do not contradict previously established facts but instead fill in missing background details, usually to support current plot points. Thomas referred to \"retroactive continuity\" in this sense, as a purely additive process that did not undo any previous work; such additions were common in \"All-Star Squadron\". Kurt Busiek took a similar approach with \"Untold Tales of Spider-Man\", a series which told stories that specifically fit between issues of the original \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" series, sometimes explaining discontinuities between those earlier stories. John Byrne used a similar structure with \"\". Possibly the earliest Marvel Comics example of new stories placed between long-established stories was the 1977\u20131978 magazine \"The Rampaging Hulk\". In \"The Godfather Part II\", the character Frank Pentangeli is introduced as an old friend of the family though he is not referenced in the first film; similarly Don Altobello is one of the \"old time\" Dons, though he is not mentioned until \"The Godfather Part III\". Neither addition affects the plot line of the previous films. The addition, in later seasons, of an attic to the family's home in \"Full House\" stands as a similar additive example.\nA similar concept is that of secret history, in which the events of a story occur within the bounds of already-established events (especially real-world ones), revealing different interpretations of the events. Some of Tim Powers' novels use secret history, such as \"Last Call\", which suggests that Bugsy Siegel's actions were due to his being a modern-day Fisher King.\nAlan Moore's additional information about the Swamp Thing's origins \u2013 revealing that Swamp Thing was not actually scientist Alec Holland converted into a plant, but actually a plant that had absorbed Holland's body and consciousness so that it merely thought it was Holland \u2013 did not contradict or change any of the events depicted in the character's previous appearances, but instead changed the reader's interpretation of them. Such additions and reinterpretations are very common in \"Doctor Who\".\nAlteration.\nRetcons sometimes add information that seemingly contradicts previous information. This frequently takes the form of a character who was shown to have died but is later revealed to have somehow survived. This is a common practice in horror films, which may end with the death of a monster that goes on to appear in one or more sequels. The technique is so common in superhero comics that the term \"comic book death\" has been coined for it.\nAn early example of this type of retcon is the return of Sherlock Holmes, whom writer Arthur Conan Doyle apparently killed off in \"The Final Problem\" in 1893, only to bring him back, in large part because of readers' responses, with \"The Empty House\" in 1903.\nThe character Zorro was retconned early in his existence. In the original 1919 novel, \"The Curse of Capistrano\", Zorro ends his adventures by revealing his identity, a plot point that was carried over to the 1920 film adaptation \"The Mark of Zorro\". In order to have further stories starring Zorro, author Johnston McCulley kept all the elements of his original story, but retroactively ignored its ending.\nOne notable example is Isaac Asimov\u2019s 1950 fixup novel \"I, Robot\", a collection of science fiction short stories originally published in \"Super Science Stories\" and \"Astounding Science Fiction\" from 1940 to 1950. Compiled into a single publication by Gnome Press in 1950, the collection features a framing sequence in which the stories are told to a reporter by Dr. Susan Calvin, chief robopsychologist at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. Changes necessary to fit the new version included the name of the company (originally the Finmark Robot Corporation), new, earlier references to the Three Laws of Robotics, and new interpolated scenes featuring Dr. Calvin herself.\nThe TV series \"Dallas\" annulled its entire ninth season as just the dream of one of its characters, Pam Ewing. Writers did this to offer a supposedly plausible reason for the major character of Bobby Ewing, who had died onscreen at the end of season eight, to be still alive when actor Patrick Duffy wanted to return to the series. This season is sometimes referred to as the \"Dream Season\" and was referred to humorously in later TV series such as \"Family Guy\" and \"Community\" as a \"gas-leak year\". Other series such as \"St. Elsewhere\", \"Newhart\", and \"Roseanne\" employed the same technique.\nSubtraction.\nUnpopular stories are sometimes later ignored by publishers, and effectively erased from a series' continuity. Later stories may contradict the previous ones or explicitly establish that they never happened. In television, when a character is subtracted with a retcon, this is often known as \"Chuck Cunningham syndrome,\" after a character from the series \"Happy Days\" that was retconned out of existence shortly through the series run, or \"going to Mandyville,\" after Mandy Hampton, a character that suffered a similar fate in \"The West Wing\".\nNotable examples of subtractive retconning include \"\" (2019)\",\" which is a sequel to the first two \"Terminator\" films and ignores the events of every other film in the franchise, and \"Halloween\" (2018), which is a sequel to only the original film and disregards all the other sequels.\nStories that involve time travel can be used to undo the events of poorly received installments. After ' (2006) faced criticism for abruptly killing off characters such as Cyclops and Jean Grey, its sequel, ' (2014), features the character Wolverine traveling back in time to 1973 to prevent an assassination that, if carried out, would lead to mutant extinction. The result of this is a new timeline where Jean and Cyclops never died.\nRelated concepts.\nRetroactive continuity is similar to, but not the same as, plot inconsistencies introduced accidentally or through lack of concern for continuity; retconning, by comparison, is done deliberately. For example, the ongoing continuity contradictions on episodic TV series such as \"The Simpsons\" (in which the timeline of the family's history must be continually shifted forward to explain why they are not getting any older) reflects intentionally lost continuity, not genuine retcons. However, in series with generally tight continuity, retcons are sometimes created after the fact to explain continuity errors. Such was the case in \"The Flintstones\", where Wilma Flintstone was mistakenly given two separate maiden names over the course of the series: \"Pebble\" and \"Slaghoople\".\nThough the term \"retcon\" did not yet exist when George Orwell wrote \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that \"Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally\" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change \"all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs\" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. \"Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.\" See historical revisionism (negationism).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Risks can come from various sources (i.e, threats) including uncertainty in international markets, political instability, dangers of project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustaining of life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause. Retail traders also apply risk management by using fixed percentage position sizing and risk-to-reward frameworks to avoid large drawdowns and support consistent decision-making under pressure.\nTwo types of events are analyzed in risk management: risks and opportunities. Negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities. Risk management standards have been developed by various institutions, including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, actuarial societies, and International Organization for Standardization. Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, engineering, industrial processes, financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety. Certain risk management standards have been criticized for having no measurable improvement on risk, whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seems to increase.\nStrategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat. The opposite of these strategies can be used to respond to opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).\nAs a professional role, a risk manager will \"oversee the organization's comprehensive insurance and risk management program, assessing and identifying risks that could impede the reputation, safety, security, or financial success of the organization\", and then develop plans to minimize and/or mitigate any negative (financial) outcomes. Risk analysts support the technical side of the organization's risk management approach: once risk data has been compiled and evaluated, analysts share their findings with their managers, who use those insights to decide among possible solutions. \nSee also Chief Risk Officer, internal audit, and .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIntroduction.\nRisk is defined as the possibility that an event will occur that adversely affects the achievement of an objective. Uncertainty, therefore, is a key aspect of risk. Risk management appears in scientific and management literature since the 1920s. It became a formal science in the 1950s, when articles and books with \"risk management\" in the title also appear in library searches. Most of research was initially related to finance and insurance. One popular standard clarifying vocabulary used in risk management is \"ISO Guide 31073:2022\", \"Risk management \u2014 Vocabulary\".\nIdeally in risk management, a prioritization process is followed. Whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest probability of occurring are handled first. Risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be tricky, and organisation has to balance resources used to mitigate between risks with a higher probability but lower loss, versus a risk with higher loss but lower probability. Opportunity cost represents a unique challenge for risk managers. It can be difficult to determine when to put resources toward risk management and when to use those resources elsewhere. Again, ideal risk management optimises resource usage (spending, manpower etc), and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.\nRisks vs. opportunities.\nOpportunities first appear in academic research or management books in the 1990s. The first PMBoK Project Management Body of Knowledge draft of 1987 doesn't mention opportunities at all.\nModern project management school recognize the importance of opportunities. Opportunities have been included in project management literature since the 1990s, e.g. in PMBoK, and became a significant part of project risk management in the years 2000s, when articles titled \"opportunity management\" also begin to appear in library searches. Opportunity management thus became an important part of risk management.\nModern risk management theory deals with any type of external events, positive and negative. Positive risks are called \"opportunities\". Similarly to risks, opportunities have specific mitigation strategies: exploit, share, enhance, ignore.\nIn practice, risks are considered \"usually negative\". Risk-related research and practice focus significantly more on threats than on opportunities. This can lead to negative phenomena such as target fixation.\nMethod.\nFor the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order:\nThe Risk management knowledge area, as defined by the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBoK, consists of the following processes:\nPrinciples.\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) identifies the following principles for risk management:\nMild versus wild risk.\nBenoit Mandelbrot distinguished between \"mild\" and \"wild\" risk and argued that risk assessment and management must be fundamentally different for the two types of risk. Mild risk follows normal or near-normal probability distributions, is subject to regression to the mean and the law of large numbers, and is therefore relatively predictable. Wild risk follows fat-tailed distributions, e.g., Pareto or power-law distributions, is subject to regression to the tail (infinite mean or variance, rendering the law of large numbers invalid or ineffective), and is therefore difficult or impossible to predict. A common error in risk assessment and management is to underestimate the wildness of risk, assuming risk to be mild when in fact it is wild, which must be avoided if risk assessment and management are to be valid and reliable, according to Mandelbrot.\nProcess.\nAccording to the standard \"ISO 31000\", \"Risk management \u2013 Guidelines\", the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:\nEstablishing the context.\nThis involves:\nIdentification.\nAfter establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of problems and those of competitors (benefit), or with the problem's consequences.\nSome examples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.\nWhen either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.\nThe chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:\nAssessment.\nOnce risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. \nThese quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the risk management plan.\nEven a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts. Take the \"turnpike\" example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity. Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.\nThe fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: \"Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude.\"\nRisk options.\nRisk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:\nLater research has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.\nIn business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs (cost\u2013benefit analysis).\nPotential risk treatments.\nPlanning for risk management uses four essential techniques. Under the acceptance technique, the business intentionally assumes risks without financial protections in the hopes that possible gains will exceed prospective losses. The transfer approach shields the business from losses by shifting risks to a third party, frequently in exchange for a fee, while the third-party benefits from the project. By choosing not to participate in high-risk ventures, the avoidance strategy avoids losses but also loses out on possibilities. Last but not least, the reduction approach lowers risks by implementing strategies like insurance, which provides protection for a variety of asset classes and guarantees reimbursement in the event of losses.\nOnce risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:\nIdeal use of these risk control strategies may not be possible. Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), Defense Acquisition University, calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer. This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.\nSimilarly to risks, opportunities have specific mitigation strategies: exploit, share, enhance, ignore.\nRisk avoidance.\nThis includes not performing an activity that could present risk. Refusing to purchase a property or business to avoid legal liability is one such example. Avoiding airplane flights for fear of hijacking. Avoidance may seem like the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed. Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits. Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.\nRisk reduction.\nRisk reduction or \"optimization\" involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring. For example, sprinklers are designed to put out a fire to reduce the risk of loss by fire. This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable. Halon fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a strategy.\nAcknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By effectively applying Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management standards, organizations can achieve tolerable levels of residual risk.\nModern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally. Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project. By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.\nOutsourcing could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks. For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself. This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center. Also, implanting controls can also be an option in reducing risk. Controls that either detect causes of unwanted events prior to the consequences occurring during use of the product, or detection of the root causes of unwanted failures that the team can then avoid. Controls may focus on management or decision-making processes. All these may help to make better decisions concerning risk.\nRisk sharing.\nBriefly defined as \"sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk.\"\nThe term 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk-sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice, if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such, in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a \"transfer of risk.\" However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses \"transferred\", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policyholder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policyholder then some compensation may be payable to the policyholder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.\nMethods of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk-retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group upfront, but instead, losses are assessed to all members of the group.\nRisk retention.\nRisk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs. True self-insurance falls in this category. Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default. This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible. War is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured. Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk. This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.\nRisk management plan.\nSelect appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.\nThe risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions. There are four basic steps of risk management plan, which are threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, impact assessment and risk mitigation strategy development.\nAccording to ISO/IEC 27001, the stage immediately after completion of the risk assessment phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled. Mitigation of risks often means selection of security controls, which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the \nstandard have been selected, and why.\nImplementation.\nImplementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks. Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.\nReview and evaluation of the plan.\nInitial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.\nRisk analysis results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: \nAreas.\nEnterprise.\nEnterprise risk management (ERM) defines risk as those possible events or circumstances that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question, \nwhere the impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment. \nThere are various defined frameworks here, where every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure \"contingency\" if the risk becomes a \"liability\").\nManagers thus analyze and monitor both the internal and external environment facing the enterprise, addressing business risk generally, and any impact on the enterprise achieving its strategic goals.\nERM thus overlaps various other disciplines - operational risk management, financial risk management etc. - but is differentiated by its strategic and long-term focus. ERM systems usually focus on safeguarding reputation, acknowledging its significant role in comprehensive risk management strategies.\nFinance.\nAs applied to finance, risk management concerns the techniques and practices for measuring, monitoring and controlling the market- and credit risk (and operational risk) on a firm's balance sheet, due to a bank's credit and trading exposure, or re a fund manager's portfolio value; for an overview see .\nContractual risk management.\nThe concept of \"contractual risk management\" emphasises the use of risk management techniques in contract deployment, i.e. managing the risks which are accepted through entry into a contract. Norwegian academic Petri Keskitalo defines \"contractual risk management\" as \"a practical, proactive and systematical contracting method that uses contract planning and governance to manage risks connected to business activities\". In an article by Samuel Greengard published in 2010, two US legal cases are mentioned which emphasise the importance of having a strategy for dealing with risk:\nGreengard recommends using industry-standard contract language as much as possible to reduce risk as much as possible and rely on clauses which have been in use and subject to established court interpretation over a number of years.\nCustoms.\nCustoms risk management is concerned with the risks which arise within the context of international trade and have a bearing on safety and security, including the risk that illicit drugs and counterfeit goods can pass across borders and the risk that shipments and their contents are incorrectly declared. The European Union has adopted a Customs Risk Management Framework (CRMF) applicable across the union and throughout its member states, whose aims include establishing a common level of customs control protection and a balance between the objectives of safe customs control and the facilitation of legitimate trade. Two events which prompted the European Commission to review customs risk management policy in 2012-13 were the September 11 attacks of 2001 and the 2010 transatlantic aircraft bomb plot involving packages being sent from Yemen to the United States, referred to by the Commission as \"the October 2010 (Yemen) incident\".\nEnterprise security.\nESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise's mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader's role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance\nMedical devices.\nFor medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the US FDA. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2019, Medical Devices\u2014The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management. Guidance on the application of the standard is available via ISO/TR 24971:2020.\nThe European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three \"(informative)\" Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD. These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced \"as far as possible\", and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).\nTypical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include hazard analysis, fault tree analysis (FTA), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), hazard and operability study (HAZOP), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a spreadsheet program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.\nThrough a draft guidance, the FDA has introduced another method named \"Safety Assurance Case\" for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.\nProject management.\nProject risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition. At the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor's projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see Analysis of Alternatives). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:\nMegaprojects (infrastructure).\nMegaprojects (sometimes also called \"major programs\") are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts. Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management.\nNatural disasters.\nIt is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is a 2015 international accord that has set goals and targets for disaster risk reduction in response to natural disasters. There are regular International Disaster and Risk Conferences in Davos to deal with integral risk management.\nSeveral tools can be used to assess risk and risk management of natural disasters and other climate events, including geospatial modeling, a key component of land change science. This modeling requires an understanding of geographic distributions of people as well as an ability to calculate the likelihood of a natural disaster occurring.\nWilderness.\nThe management of risks to persons and property in wilderness and remote natural areas has developed with increases in outdoor recreation participation and decreased social tolerance for loss. Organizations providing commercial wilderness experiences can now align with national and international consensus standards for training and equipment such as ANSI/NASBLA 101-2017 (boating), UIAA 152 (ice climbing tools), and European Norm 13089:2015 + A1:2015 (mountaineering equipment). The Association for Experiential Education offers accreditation for wilderness adventure programs. The Wilderness Risk Management Conference provides access to best practices, and specialist organizations provide wilderness risk management consulting and training.\nThe text Outdoor Safety \u2013 Risk Management for Outdoor Leaders, published by the New Zealand Mountain Safety Council, provides a view of wilderness risk management from the New Zealand perspective, recognizing the value of national outdoor safety legislation and devoting considerable attention to the roles of judgment and decision-making processes in wilderness risk management.\nOne popular models for risk assessment is the Risk Assessment and Safety Management (RASM) Model developed by Rick Curtis, author of The Backpacker's Field Manual. The formula for the RASM Model is: Risk = Probability of Accident \u00d7 Severity of Consequences. The RASM Model weighs negative risk\u2014the potential for loss, against positive risk\u2014the potential for growth.\nInformation technology.\nIT risk is a risk related to information technology. This is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports. \"Cybersecurity is tied closely to the advancement of technology. It lags only long enough for incentives like black markets to evolve and new exploits to be discovered. There is no end in sight for the advancement of technology, so we can expect the same from cybersecurity.\"\nISACA's \"Risk IT\" framework ties IT risk to enterprise risk management. Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) evaluates risks and their safeguards and considers the interests of all parties potentially affected by those risks.\nIT risk management includes \"incident handling\", an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the SANS Institute, it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.\nOperations.\nOperational risk management (ORM) is the oversight of operational risk, including the risk of loss resulting from: inadequate or failed internal processes and systems; human factors; or external events. Given the nature of operations, ORM is typically a \"continual\" process, and will include ongoing risk assessment, risk decision making, and the implementation of risk controls.\nPetroleum and natural gas.\nFor the offshore oil and gas industry, operational risk management is regulated by the safety case regime in many countries. Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC (International Association of Drilling Contractors) publish guidelines for Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as bow-tie diagrams (see Network theory in risk assessment). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.\nPharmaceutical sector.\nThe principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of microbiological contamination in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.\nSupply chain.\nSupply chain risk management (SCRM) aims at maintaining supply chain continuity in the event of scenarios or incidents which could interrupt normal business and hence profitability. Risks to the supply chain range from everyday to exceptional, including unpredictable natural events (such as tsunamis and pandemics) to counterfeit products, and reach across quality, security, to resiliency and product integrity. Mitigation of these risks can involve various elements of the business including logistics and cybersecurity, as well as the areas of finance and operations.\nTravel.\nTravel risk management is concerned with how organisations assess the risks to their staff when travelling, especially when travelling overseas. In the field of international standards, ISO 31030:2021 addresses good practice in travel risk management.\nThe Global Business Travel Association's education and research arm, the GBTA Foundation. found in 2015 that most businesses covered by their research employed travel risk management protocols aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of their business travelers. Six key principles of travel risk awareness put forward by the association are preparation, awareness of surroundings and people, keeping a low profile, adopting an unpredictable routine, communications and layers of protection. Traveler tracking using mobile tracking and messaging technologies had by 2015 become a widely used aspect of travel risk management.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26408", "revid": "800198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26408", "title": "Rainer Maria Rilke", "text": "Austrian poet and writer (1875\u20131926)\nRen\u00e9 Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke (4 December 1875\u00a0\u2013 29 December 1926), known as Rainer Maria Rilke, was an Austrian poet and novelist. Acclaimed as an idiosyncratic and expressive poet, he is widely recognized as a significant writer in the German language. His work is viewed by critics and scholars as possessing undertones of mysticism, exploring themes of subjective experience and disbelief. His writings include one novel, several collections of poetry, several volumes of correspondence and a few early novellas.\nRilke travelled extensively throughout Europe, finally settling in Switzerland, which provided the inspiration for many of his poems. While Rilke is best known for his contributions to German literature, he also wrote in French. Among English-language readers, his best-known works include two poetry collections: \"Duino Elegies\" (') and \"Sonnets to Orpheus\" ('), a semi-autobiographical novel \"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\" ('), and a collection of ten letters published posthumously \"Letters to a Young Poet\" ('). In the later 20th century, his work found new audiences in citations by self-help authors and frequent quotations in television shows, books and motion pictures.\nBiography.\nEarly life (1875\u20131896).\nHe was born Ren\u00e9 Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke in Prague, capital of Kingdom of Bohemia (then ruled by Austria-Hungary, now capital of the Czech Republic). His father, Josef Rilke (1838\u20131906), found employment as a railway official after an unsuccessful military career. His mother, Sophie (\"Phia\") Entz (1851\u20131931), was from a well-to-do family in Prague, the Entz-Kinzelbergers, who lived at Herrengasse (Pansk\u00e1) 8, where Ren\u00e9 spent many of his early years.\nHis childhood was not always a happy one, and the relationship between Phia and her only son was colored by her mourning for an earlier infant daughter who died within one week. During Rilke's early years, Phia acted as if she sought to recover the lost daughter by treating Rilke as if he were a girl. According to Rilke, he had to wear \"fine clothes\" and \"was a plaything [for his mother], like a big doll\". His parents' marriage ended in 1884.\nHis parents enrolled the poetically and artistically talented youth in a military academy in Sankt P\u00f6lten, Lower Austria. He attended classes from 1886 until 1891, but left due to illness. He then moved to Linz, and entered a trade school. During this time he lived with Hans Drouot (publisher and owner of the printing and publishing company Jos. Feichtingers Erben) at Graben 19 on the 3rd floor.\nExpelled in May 1892, the 16-year-old returned to Prague, where, for three years, he was tutored for the university entrance exam, which he passed in 1895. He took classes in literature, art history, and philosophy in Prague, until 1896 when he left school and moved to Munich.\nMunich and Saint Petersburg.\nRilke met and fell in love with the widely travelled and intellectual woman of letters Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9 in 1897 in Munich. He changed his first name from \"Ren\u00e9\" to \"Rainer\" at Salom\u00e9's urging because she thought that name to be more masculine, forceful and Germanic. His relationship with this married woman, with whom he undertook two extensive trips to Russia, lasted until 1900. Even after their separation, Salom\u00e9 continued to be Rilke's most important confidante until the end of his life. Having trained from 1912 to 1913 as a psychoanalyst with Sigmund Freud, she shared her knowledge of psychoanalysis with Rilke.\nIn 1898, Rilke undertook a journey of several weeks to Italy. The following year he travelled with Lou and her husband, Friedrich Carl Andreas, to Moscow where he met the novelist Leo Tolstoy. Between May and August 1900, a second journey to Russia, accompanied only by Lou, again took him to Moscow and Saint Petersburg, where he met the family of Boris Pasternak and Spiridon Drozhzhin, a peasant poet. Author Anna A. Tavis cites the cultures of Bohemia and Russia as the key influences on Rilke's poetry and consciousness.\nIn 1900, Rilke stayed at the artists' colony at Worpswede. (Later, his portrait would be painted by the proto-expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, whom he got to know at Worpswede.) It was here that he got to know the sculptor Clara Westhoff, whom he married the following year. Their daughter Ruth (1901\u20131972) was born in December 1901.\nParis (1902\u20131910).\nIn the summer of 1902, Rilke left home and travelled to Paris to write a monograph on the sculptor Auguste Rodin. Before long his wife left their daughter with her parents and joined Rilke there. The relationship between Rilke and Clara Westhoff continued for the rest of his life; a mutually-agreed-upon effort towards a divorce was bureaucratically hindered by the fact that Rilke was a Catholic, albeit a non-practising one.\nAt first, Rilke had a difficult time in Paris, an experience that he called upon in the first part of his only novel, \"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\". At the same time his encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved with the sculpture of Rodin and then the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne. For a time, he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation and, under this influence, Rilke dramatically transformed his poetic style from the subjective and sometimes incantatory language of his earlier work into something quite new in European literature. The result was the \"New Poems\", famous for the \"thing-poems\" expressing Rilke's rejuvenated artistic vision. During these years, Paris increasingly became the writer's main residence.\nThe most important works of the Paris period were \"Neue Gedichte\" (\"New Poems\") (1907), \"Der Neuen Gedichte Anderer Teil\" (\"Another Part of the New Poems\") (1908), the two \"Requiem\" poems (1909), and the novel \"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\", started in 1904 and completed in January 1910.\nDuring the later part of this decade, Rilke spent extended periods in Ronda, the famous bullfighting centre in southern Spain, where he kept a permanent room at the Hotel Reina Victoria from December 1912 to February 1913.\nDuino and the First World War (1911\u20131919).\nBetween October 1911 and May 1912, Rilke stayed at the Castle Duino, near Trieste, home of Princess Marie of Thurn und Taxis. There, in 1912, he began the poem cycle called the \"Duino Elegies\", which would remain unfinished for a decade because of a long-lasting creativity crisis. Rilke had developed an admiration for El Greco as early as 1908, so he visited Toledo during the winter of 1912/13 to see his paintings. It has been suggested that El Greco's manner of depicting angels influenced the conception of the angel in the \"Duino Elegies\". The outbreak of World War I surprised Rilke during a stay in Germany. He was unable to return to Paris, where his property was confiscated and auctioned. He spent the greater part of the war in Munich. From 1914 to 1916 he had a turbulent affair with the painter Lou Albert-Lasard. Rilke was called up at the beginning of 1916 and had to undertake basic training in Vienna. Influential friends interceded on his behalf\u00a0\u2013 he was transferred to the War Records Office and discharged from the military on 9 June 1916. He returned to Munich, interrupted by a stay at Hertha Koenig's manor Gut Bockel in Westphalia. The traumatic experience of military service, a reminder of the horrors of the military academy, almost completely silenced him as a poet.\nSwitzerland and Muzot (1919\u20131926).\nOn 11 June 1919, Rilke travelled from Munich to Switzerland. He met Polish-German painter Baladine Klossowska, with whom he was in a relationship to his death in 1926. The outward motive was an invitation to lecture in Zurich, but the real reason was the wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up his work on the \"Duino Elegies\" once again. The search for a suitable and affordable place to live proved to be very difficult. Among other places, Rilke lived in Soglio, Locarno and Berg am Irchel. It was only in mid-1921 that he was able to find a permanent residence in the Ch\u00e2teau de Muzot in the commune of Veyras, close to Sierre in Valais. In an intense creative period, Rilke completed the \"Duino Elegies\" in several weeks in February 1922. Before and after this period, Rilke rapidly wrote both parts of the poem cycle \"Sonnets to Orpheus\" containing 55 entire sonnets. Together, these two have often been taken as constituting the high points of Rilke's work. In May 1922, Rilke's patron Werner Reinhart bought and renovated Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free.\nDuring this time, Reinhart introduced Rilke to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, the Australian violinist Alma Moodie. Rilke was so impressed with her playing that he wrote in a letter: \"What a sound, what richness, what determination. That and the \"Sonnets to Orpheus\", those were two strings of the same voice. And she plays mostly Bach! Muzot has received its musical christening...\"\nFrom 1923 on, Rilke increasingly struggled with health problems that necessitated many long stays at a sanatorium in Territet near Montreux on Lake Geneva. His long stay in Paris between January and August 1925 was an attempt to escape his illness through a change in location and living conditions. Despite this, numerous important individual poems appeared in the years 1923\u20131926 (including \"Gong\" and \"Mausoleum\"), as well as his abundant lyrical work in French. His book of French poems \"Vergers\" was published in 1926.\nIn 1924, Erika Mitterer began writing poems to Rilke, who wrote back with approximately 50 poems of his own and called her verse a \"Herzlandschaft\" (landscape of the heart). This was the only time Rilke had a productive poetic collaboration throughout all his work. Mitterer visited Rilke in November 1925. In 1950 her \"Correspondence in Verse\" with Rilke was published and received much praise.\nRilke supported the Russian Revolution in 1917 as well as the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919. He became friends with Ernst Toller and mourned the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg, Kurt Eisner, and Karl Liebknecht. He confided that of the five or six newspapers he read daily, those on the far left came closest to his own opinions. He developed a reputation for supporting left-wing causes and thus, out of fear for his own safety, became more reticent about politics after the Bavarian Republic was crushed by the right-wing Freikorps. In January and February 1926, Rilke wrote three letters to the Mussolini-adversary Aurelia Gallarati Scotti in which he praised Benito Mussolini and described fascism as a healing agent.\nDeath and burial.\nShortly before his death, Rilke's illness was diagnosed as leukemia. He suffered ulcerous sores in his mouth, pain troubled his stomach and intestines, and he struggled with increasingly low spirits. Open-eyed, he died in the arms of his doctor on 29 December 1926, in the Valmont Sanatorium in Switzerland. He was buried on 2 January 1927, in the Raron cemetery to the west of Visp.\nRilke had chosen as his own epitaph this poem:\n&lt;poem lang=\"de\" style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\"&gt;Rose, oh reiner Widerspruch, Lust,\nNiemandes Schlaf zu sein unter soviel\nLidern.&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\"&gt;Rose, o pure contradiction, desire\nto be no one's sleep beneath so many\nlids.&lt;/poem&gt;\nA myth developed surrounding his death and roses. It was said: \"To honour a visitor, the Egyptian beauty Nimet Eloui Bey, Rilke gathered some roses from his garden. While doing so, he pricked his hand on a thorn. This small wound failed to heal, grew rapidly worse, soon his entire arm was swollen, and his other arm became affected as well\", and so he died.\nWritings.\n\"The Panther\".\n\"The Panther\" was an influential poem describing life from the perspective of an animal in a zoo, which focused more on its cage than on humans, one of the first to do so, part of an early counter-movement against anthropomorphic views of animals and nature along with individuals such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, a writer of perspectives of creatures such as jellyfish and ticks, a man who he corresponded with, and poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal who wrote from the perspective of a man who had language become like 'rotten mushrooms' in his mouth.\n\"The Book of Hours\".\nRilke's three complete cycles of poems that constitute \"The Book of Hours\" (\"\") were published by Insel Verlag in April 1905. These poems explore the Christian search for God and the nature of Prayer, using symbolism from Saint Francis and Rilke's observation of Orthodox Christianity during his travels to Ukraine in the early years of the twentieth century.\n\"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\".\nRilke wrote his only novel, \"\" (translated as \"The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\"), while living in Paris, completing the work in 1910. The narrative takes the form of a rambling novelette filled with poetic language and contains, among other things, a retelling of the prodigal son tale, a striking description of death by illness, an ode to the joys of roaming free during childhood, a chilling description of how people wear false faces with others, and a snarky comment about the weirdness of neighbors.\nThis semi-autobiographical novel adopts the style and technique that became associated with Expressionism which entered European fiction and art in the early 20th century. He was inspired by Sigbj\u00f8rn Obstfelder's work \"A Priest's Diary\" and Jens Peter Jacobsen's novel \"Niels Lyhne\" (1880) which traces the fate of an atheist in a merciless world. Rilke addresses existential themes, profoundly probing the quest for individuality and the significance of death and reflecting on the experience of time as death approaches. He draws considerably on the writings of Nietzsche, whose work he came to know through Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9. His work also incorporates impressionistic techniques that were influenced by C\u00e9zanne and Rodin (to whom Rilke was secretary in 1905\u20131906). He combines these techniques and motifs to conjure images of mankind's anxiety and alienation in the face of an increasingly scientific, industrial and reified world.\n\"Duino Elegies\".\nRilke began writing the elegies in 1912 while a guest of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855\u20131934) at Duino Castle, near Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. During this ten-year period, the elegies languished incomplete for long stretches of time as Rilke suffered frequently from severe depression, some of which was caused by the events of World War I and his conscripted military service. Aside from brief episodes of writing in 1913 and 1915, Rilke did not return to the work until a few years after the war ended. With a sudden, renewed inspiration\u00a0\u2013 writing in a frantic pace he described as \"a savage creative storm\"\u00a0\u2013 he completed the collection in February 1922 while staying at Ch\u00e2teau de Muzot in Veyras, in Switzerland's Rh\u00f4ne Valley. After their publication and his death shortly thereafter, the \"Duino Elegies\" were quickly recognized by critics and scholars as Rilke's most important work.\nThe \"Duino Elegies\" are intensely religious, mystical poems that weigh beauty and existential suffering. The poems employ a rich symbolism of angels and salvation but not in keeping with typical Christian interpretations. Rilke begins the first elegy in an invocation of philosophical despair, asking: \"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?\" () and later declares that \"every angel is terrifying\" (\"Jeder Engel ist schrecklich\"). While labelling of these poems as \"elegies\" would typically imply melancholy and lamentation, many passages are marked by their positive energy and \"unrestrained enthusiasm\". Together, the \"Duino Elegies\" are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke's \"ontological torment\" and an \"impassioned monologue about coming to terms with human existence\" discussing themes of \"the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness\u00a0... man's loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet\".\n\"Sonnets to Orpheus\".\nWith news of the death of Wera Knoop (1900\u20131919), his daughter's friend, Rilke was inspired to create and set to work on \"Sonnets to Orpheus\". In 1922, between February 2 and 5, he completed the first section of 26 sonnets. For the next few days, he focused on the \"Duino Elegies\", completing them on the evening of February 11. Immediately thereafter, he returned to work on the \"Sonnets\" and completed the following section of 29 sonnets in less than two weeks. Throughout the \"Sonnets\", Wera is frequently referenced, both directly by name and indirectly in allusions to a \"dancer\" and the mythical Eurydice. Although Rilke claimed that the entire cycle was inspired by Wera, she appears as a character in only one of the poems. He insisted, however, that \"Wera's own figure\u00a0... nevertheless governs and moves the course of the whole.\"\nThe sonnets' contents are, as is typical of Rilke, highly metaphorical. The character of Orpheus (whom Rilke refers to as the \"god with the lyre\") appears several times in the cycle, as do other mythical characters such as Daphne. There are also biblical allusions, including a reference to Esau. Other themes involve animals, peoples of different cultures, and time and death.\n\"Letters to a Young Poet\".\nIn 1929, writer Franz Xaver Kappus (1883\u20131966) published a collection of ten letters that (then between 27\u201332 year old) Rilke had written to him over the course of 6 years, beginning when Kappus was a 19-year-old officer cadet studying at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt, where he had a professor who had taught Rilke at the boarding Military Middleschool (Milit\u00e4r-Unterrealschule) in St.-P\u00f6lten over 15 years earlier (from 1886-1891); (before Rilke dropped out of the officer's education after a year in Military highschool). Between 1902 and 1908, the young Kappus had written Rilke when he was uncertain about his future as a military officer or as a poet. Initially he sought Rilke's advice as to the quality of his poetry and whether he ought to pursue writing as a career. While he declined to comment much on Kappus's writings, Rilke advised Kappus on how a poet should feel, love and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process and were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of \"Das Stunden-Buch\" (\"The Book of Hours\") and \"Das Buch der Bilder\" (\"The Book of Images\").\nStyle and themes.\nRilke extensively engaged with metaphors, metonymy and contradictions in his poetry and prose to convey disbelief and a crisis of faith. Figures from Greek mythology, such as Apollo, Hermes and Orpheus, recur as motifs in his poems and are depicted in original interpretations that often double as analogies for his experiences. Rilke's poems also feature figures of angels, famously described in the \"Duino Elegies\" as \"terrifying\" (\"\"); he also occasionally explored the crisis of his Catholic faith, including in his little-known 1898 poem \"Visions of Christ\", where he depicted Mary Magdalene as the mother of Jesus' child.\nLegacy.\nRilke is one of the best-selling poets in the United States. In popular culture, Rilke is frequently quoted or referenced in television shows, motion pictures, music and other works when these works discuss the subject of love or angels. His work is often described as \"mystical\" and has been quoted and referenced by self-help authors. Rilke has been reinterpreted \"as a master who can lead us to a more fulfilled and less anxious life\".\nRilke's work has influenced several poets and writers, including William H. Gass, Galway Kinnell, Sidney Keyes, Stephen Spender, Robert Bly, W. S. Merwin, John Ashbery, novelist Thomas Pynchon and the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. British poet W. H. Auden (1907\u20131973) has been described as \"Rilke's most influential English disciple\" and he frequently \"paid homage to him\" or used the imagery of angels in his work.\nThe U.S. rock music band Rainer Maria was named after Rilke.\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLetters.\nCollected letters\nOther volumes of letters\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26410", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26410", "title": "Conversion therapy", "text": "Pseudoscientific attempts to change sexual orientation or gender identity\nConversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of attempting to change an individual's sexual orientation, romantic orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to align with heterosexual and cisgender norms. Conversion therapy is ineffective at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity and frequently causes significant long-term psychological harm. The position of current evidence-based medicine and clinical guidance is that homosexuality, bisexuality, and gender variance are natural and healthy aspects of human sexuality and gender identity.\nConversion therapy often consists of methods that involve, but are not limited to, talk therapy, aversion therapy, brain surgery, chemical castration, surgical castration, hypnosis, psychoanalysis, corrective rape, and various religious practices, including prayer and exorcism.\nWhen performed today, conversion therapy may constitute fraud, and when performed on minors, a form of child abuse. It has been described by experts as torture; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; and contrary to human rights.\nMany jurisdictions around the world have passed laws against conversion therapy.\nTerminology.\nMedical professionals and activists consider \"conversion therapy\" a misnomer, as it does not constitute a legitimate form of therapy. Alternative terms include \"sexual orientation change efforts\" (SOCE) and \"gender identity change efforts\" (GICE). Together, and more commonly referred to as \"sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts\" (SOGICE), or \"sexual orientation and gender identity or expression change efforts\" (SOGIECE).\nAccording to researcher Douglas C. Haldeman, SOCE and GICE should be considered together because both rest on the assumption \"that gender-related behavior consistent with the individual's birth sex is normative and anything else is unacceptable and should be changed\". The American Psychological Association stated in a 2021 resolution that some parts of SOCE also met their definition of GICE, and \"intense focus\" on gender-normative \"conformity is a frequent characteristic of SOCE\".\n\"Reparative therapy\" may refer to conversion therapy in general, or to a subset thereof. Some sources prefer the term \"conversion practices\" to \"conversion therapy\", on the grounds that the practices in question are not actually therapeutic.\nAdvocates of conversion therapy do not necessarily use the term either, instead using phrases such as \"healing from sexual brokenness\" and \"struggling with same-sex attraction\".\nEvolving phraseology.\nA common term found throughout conversion therapy practices is \"same-sex attraction\" with various phrases or words connected to it.\nThe term \"same-sex attraction disorder\" (SSAD), or sometimes \"same-sex attachment disorder\" was coined by Richard Fitzgibbon in the 1990s as a replacement for the term gay and the \"ex-gay movement\" and subsequently popularized in the 2000's by Richard A. Cohen who authored the book \"Coming Out Straight\" in which he details the phrase and invented \"diagnosis\" that tried to pathologize homosexuality as a condition, concluding that \"Homosexuality is a Same-Sex Attachment Disorder.\" The term was picked up by the ex-gay movement in scripts such as \"I used to be gay, but I don't think of myself as gay anymore. Now I just experience same-sex attraction.\"\nA 2020 report by ILGA tracking bans on conversion therapy worldwide explained that in many countries where \"conversion therapy\" has been banned, \"proponents had to reshape and adapt the way in which they present and offer their 'treatment'.\" The report further explains that many proponents of \"conversion therapy\" now try to expressly distance themselves from the term \"conversion therapy\" or saying they support homosexuality or gender variance and referring to their alternative terminology as being something different. The report describes this effort to \"make these pseudo-scientific practices 'a constant moving target'.\"\nThe report listed a series of currently common terms used by proponents of \"conversion therapy\" for their \"services\" to provide assistance with \"unwanted same-sex attraction\"; promoting a \"healthy sexuality\", addressing \"sexual brokenness\"; helping clients explore their \"gender confusion\".\nIn 2022, the \"Global Project Against Hate and Extremism\" (GPAHE) began tracking terms related to conversion therapy online in a report titled \"Conversion Therapy Online: The Ecosystem\". \nThe report documents practices, techniques and phraseology used by groups providing \"conversion therapy\" under various names to refer to the practice itself, as well as common phrases such as \"same-sex attracted\" in relation to conversion therapy targeted at LGBTQ people, in particular gay men and transgender people.\nIn January 2024, GPAHE published an updated report for 2023, highlighting that many social media platforms and search engines are still serving a lot of content related to conversion therapy. Listing examples, using the search term \"overcoming same-sex attraction\" on YouTube led to results from religious and non-religious groups serving videos targeting gay and transgender people, such as videos titled \"Former LGBTQers Testify: If You No Longer Want to be Gay or Transgender, You Don't Have to Be.\"\nIn 2022, GPAHE also started creating an ongoing tracking project on organizations connected to the promotion of \"conversion therapy\" practices online titled \"Conversion Therapy Online: The Players\" to document the actors involved in these activities and show the interconnectedness. \nThe report highlights some larger groups at the center of these efforts such as London-based International Federation for Therapeutic and Counseling Choice (IFTCC), chaired by Mike Davidson, founder of related Core Issues Trust (CIT) and several other organizations involved. IFTCC has been hosting annual conferences since its inception in 2015 with the purpose to connect individuals \"seeking help with 'same-sex attraction' and 'gender confusion'\" with therapists.\nHistory.\nSexual orientation change efforts (SOCE).\nThe term \"homosexual\" was coined by German-speaking Hungarian writer Karl Maria Kertbeny and was in circulation by the 1880s. Into the middle of the twentieth century, competing views of homosexuality were advanced by psychoanalysis versus academic sexology. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, viewed homosexuality as a form of arrested development. Later psychoanalysts followed Sandor Rado, who argued that homosexuality was a \"phobic avoidance of heterosexuality caused by inadequate early parenting\". This line of thinking was popular in psychiatric models of homosexuality based on the prison population or homosexuals seeking treatment. In contrast, sexology researchers such as Alfred Kinsey argued that homosexuality was a normal variation in human development. In 1970, gay activists confronted the American Psychiatric Association, persuading the association to reconsider whether homosexuality should be listed as a disorder. The APA delisted homosexuality in 1973, which contributed to shifts in public opinion on homosexuality.\nDespite their lack of scientific backing, some socially or religiously conservative activists continued to argue that if one person's sexuality could be changed, homosexuality was not a fixed class such as race. Borrowing from discredited psychoanalytic ideas about the cause of homosexuality, some of these individuals offered conversion therapy. In 2001, conversion therapy attracted attention when Robert L. Spitzer published a non-peer-reviewed study asserting that some homosexuals could change their sexual orientation. Many researchers made methodological criticisms of the study, and Spitzer later repudiated his own study.\nGender identity change efforts (GICE).\nGender Identity Change Efforts (GICE) refer to practices of healthcare providers and religious counselors with the goal of attempting to alter a person's gender identity or expression to conform to social norms. Examples include aversion therapy, cognitive restructuring, and psychoanalytic and talk therapies. Western medical-model narratives have historically favored a binary gender model and pathologizing gender diversity and non-conformity. This aided the development and proliferation of GICE.\nEarly interventions were rooted in psychoanalytic hypotheses. Robert Stoller advanced the theory that gender-nonconforming behavior and expression in children assigned male at birth (AMAB) was caused by being overly close to their mother. Richard Green continued his research; his methods for altering behavior included having the father spend more time with the child and mother less, expecting both to exhibit stereotypical gender roles, and having them praise their child's masculine behaviors, and shame their feminine and gender-nonconforming ones. These interventions resulted in depression in the children and feelings of betrayal from parents that the treatments failed.\nIn the 1970s, UCLA psychologist Richard Green recruited Ole Ivar Lovaas to adapt the techniques of applied behavior analysis (ABA) to attempt to prevent children from becoming transsexual. Deemed the \"Feminine Boy Project\", the treatments used operant conditioning to reward gender-conforming behaviors, and punish gender non-conforming behaviors.\nKenneth Zucker at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health adopted Richard Green's methods, but narrowed the scope to attempting to prevent the child from identifying as transgender by modifying gender behavior and presentation to conform to the expectations of the assigned gender at birth, which he dubbed the \"living in your own skin\" model. His model used the same interventions as Green with the addition of psychodynamic therapy.\nBans on conversion therapy.\nIn 2020, the United Nations Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity (IESOGI) published a \"Report on conversion therapy\", which documented global practices on conversion therapy against LGBTQ individuals. \nIn the report, the UN IESOGI called for a global ban on \"conversion therapy\", as an umbrella term describing various interventions practiced to \"cure\" people, and to \"convert\" them from non-heterosexual to heterosexual, and from trans or gender diverse to cisgender. The report highlighted a 2015 US court case from New Jersey, \"\"Ferguson v JONAH\"'\", in which a jury unanimously found the defendants guilty of fraud, claiming they were providing \"services that could significantly reduce or eliminate same-sex attraction.\"\nMotivations.\nA frequent motivation for adults who pursue conversion therapy is religious beliefs that disapprove of same-sex relations, such as evangelical Christianity, Orthodox Judaism, and conservative interpretations of Islam. These adults prioritize maintaining a good relationship with their family and religious community.\nAdolescents who are pressured by their families into undergoing conversion therapy also typically come from a conservative religious background. Youth from families with low socioeconomic status are also more likely to undergo conversion therapy.\nTheories and techniques.\nAs societal attitudes toward homosexuality have become more accepting over time, the harshest conversion therapy methods, such as aversion therapy, have become less common. Secular conversion therapy is offered less frequently due to the demedicalization of homosexuality and bisexuality, and religious practitioners have become predominant.\nAversion therapy.\nAversion therapy used on homosexuals and bisexuals included electric shock and nausea-inducing drugs during presentation of same-sex erotic images. Cessation of the aversive stimuli was typically accompanied by the presentation of opposite-sex erotic images, with the objective of strengthening heterosexual feelings. Another method used is the covert sensitization method, which involves instructing recipients to imagine vomiting or receiving electric shocks. Proponents often write that only single-case studies have been conducted to support their methods and that their results cannot be generalized. For example, Haldeman writes that behavioral conditioning studies tend to decrease homosexual feelings but do not increase heterosexual feelings, citing Rangaswami's \"Difficulties in arousing and increasing heterosexual responsiveness in a homosexual: A case report\", published in 1982, as typical in this respect. Other methods of aversion therapy, in addition to electric shock, included ice baths, freezing, burning via metal coils, and hard labor. The intent was for the subject to associate homosexual feelings with pain and thus result in them being reduced. These methods have been concluded to be ineffective.\nAversion therapy was developed in Czechoslovakia between 1950 and 1962 and in the British Commonwealth from 1961 into the mid-1970s. In the context of the Cold War, Western psychologists ignored the poor results of their Czechoslovak counterparts who had concluded that aversion therapy was not effective by 1961 and recommended decriminalization of homosexuality instead. Some men in the United Kingdom were offered the choice between prison and undergoing aversion therapy. It was also offered to a few British women, but was never the standard treatment for either homosexual men or women.\nIn the 1970s, behaviorist Hans Eysenck was one of the main advocates of counterconditioning with malaise-inducing drugs and electric shock for homosexuals. He wrote that this therapy was successful in nearly 50% of cases. However, his studies were disputed. Behavior therapists, including Eysenck, used aversive methods. This led to a protest against Eysenck by gay activist Peter Tatchell at a London Medical Group Symposium in 1972. Tatchell said that the therapy promoted by Eysenck was a form of torture. Tatchell denounced Eysenck's form of behavioral therapy as causing depression and suicidal ideation and completion among gay men who were subjected to it.\nBrain surgery.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, American neurologist Walter Jackson Freeman II popularized the so-called ice-pick lobotomy as a treatment for homosexuality. He personally performed more than 3,000 lobotomies across 23 US states, of which 2,500 used his transorbital method, despite the fact that he had no formal surgical training. Freeman was banned from performing psychosurgery in 1967.\nIn West Germany, a type of brain surgery usually involving destruction of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was done on some homosexual men during the 1960s and 1970s. The practice was criticized by sexologist Volkmar Sigusch.\nCastration and transplantation.\nIn early twentieth-century Germany, experiments were carried out in which homosexual men were subjected to unilateral orchiectomy and testicles of heterosexual men were transplanted. These operations were a complete failure.\nSurgical castration of homosexual men was widespread in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. SS leader Heinrich Himmler ordered homosexual men to be sent to concentration camps because he did not consider a time-limited prison sentence sufficient to eliminate homosexuality. Although theoretically voluntary, some homosexuals were subject to severe pressure and coercion to agree to castration. There was no lower age limit: some boys as young as 16 were castrated. Those who agreed to castration after a Paragraph 175 conviction were exempted from being transferred to a concentration camp after completing their legal sentence. Some concentration camp prisoners were also subjected to castration. An estimated 400 to 800 men were castrated. Endocrinologist Carl Vaernet attempted to change homosexual concentration camp prisoners' sexual orientations by implanting a pellet that released testosterone. Most of the victims, non-consenting prisoners at the Buchenwald concentration camp, died shortly thereafter.\nAn unknown number of men were castrated in West Germany, and chemical castration was used in other Western countries, notably against Alan Turing in the United Kingdom.\nEx-gay/ex-trans ministries.\nEx-gay ministries are religious groups that attempt to use religion to eliminate or change queer individuals' sexual orientation. The ex-gay umbrella organization Exodus International in the United States ceased activities in June 2013, and the three-member board issued a statement repudiating its aims and apologizing for the harm its pursuit had caused to queer people. Ex-trans organizations often overlap with ex-gay organizations, frequently portraying trans identity as inherently sinful or against God's design and pathologizing gender variance as the result of trauma, social contagion, or \"gender ideology\".\nHypnosis.\nHypnosis has been used in conversion therapy since the 19th century, first employed by Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. In 1967, Canadian psychiatrist Peter Roper published a case study of treating 15 homosexual individuals\u2014some of whom would probably be considered bisexual by modern standards\u2014with hypnosis. Allegedly, eight showed \"marked improvement\" (they reportedly lost sexual attraction towards the same sex altogether), four showed mild improvements (decrease of \"homosexual tendencies\"), and three exhibited no improvement after hypnotic treatment. He concluded that \"hypnosis may well produce more satisfactory results than those obtainable by other means\", depending on the hypnotic susceptibility of the subjects.\nPsychoanalysis.\nHaldeman writes that psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality is exemplified by the work of Irving Bieber and colleagues in \"Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals\". They advocated long-term therapy aimed at resolving the unconscious childhood conflicts that they considered responsible for homosexuality. Haldeman notes that Bieber's methodology has been criticized because it relied upon a clinical sample, the description of the outcomes was based upon subjective therapist impression, and follow-up data were poorly presented. Bieber reported a 27% success frequency from long-term therapy, but only 18% of those deemed successful were exclusively homosexual initially, while 50% had been bisexual. In Haldeman's view, this makes even Bieber's unimpressive claims of success misleading.\nHaldeman discusses other psychoanalytic studies of attempts to change homosexuality. Curran and Parr's \"Homosexuality: An analysis of 100 male cases\", published in 1957, reported no significant increase in heterosexual behavior. Mayerson and Lief's \"Psychotherapy of homosexuals: A follow-up study of nineteen cases\", published in 1965, reported that half of the 19 subjects included were exclusively heterosexual in behavior four and a half years after treatment; its outcomes were based on patient self-report and had no external validation. In Haldeman's view, those participants in the study who reported change were bisexual at the outset, and its authors wrongly interpreted the capacity for heterosexual sex as a change of sexual orientation.\nReparative therapy.\nThe term \"reparative therapy\" has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy generally, but according to Jack Drescher, it more correctly refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists Elizabeth Moberly and Joseph Nicolosi. \nFor example, he wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The pursuit of fulfillment through same-sex eroticism is spurred by the fearful anticipation that their masculine self-assertion will inevitably fail and result in humiliation.\nThe term \"reparative\" refers to Nicolosi's postulate that same-sex attraction is a person's unconscious attempt to \"self-repair\" feelings of inferiority. After California banned conversion practices, Nicolosi argued that \"reparative therapy\" did not attempt to change sexual orientation directly but instead encouraged exploration into its underlying causes, which he believed was often childhood trauma.\nA phone study by Robert Spitzer reported that \"about 66 percent of the men respondents and 44 percent of the women were able to function as heterosexuals after the therapy,\" while conceding that \"his subjects did not constitute a study population representative of the gay and lesbian population in the U.S.\"\nMarriage therapy.\nPrevious editions of the World Health Organization's ICD included sexual relationship disorder, in which a person's sexual orientation or gender identity makes it difficult to form or maintain a relationship with a sexual partner. The belief that their sexual orientation causes problems in their relationship may lead some to turn to a marriage therapist for help to change their sexual orientation. Sexual relationship disorder was removed from ICD-11 after the Working Group on Sexual Disorders and Sexual Health determined that its inclusion was unjustified.\nGender exploratory therapy.\nGender exploratory therapy (GET) is a form of conversion therapy characterized by requiring mandatory extended talk therapy attempting to find pathological roots for gender dysphoria while simultaneously delaying social and medical transition and viewing it as a last resort. Practitioners propose that their patients' dysphoria is caused by factors such as homophobia, social contagion, sexual trauma, and autism. Some practitioners avoid using their patients' chosen names and pronouns while questioning their identification. Commenting on GET in 2022, bioethicist Florence Ashley argued that its framing as an undirected exploration of underlying psychological issues bore similarities to conversion practices, such as \"reparative\" therapy. States that have banned gender-affirming care for minors in the United States have called expert witnesses to argue that exploratory therapy should be the alternative treatment.\nThere are no known empirical studies examining psychosocial or medical outcomes following gender exploratory therapy. Concerns have been raised that by not providing an estimated length of time for the therapy, the delays in medical interventions may compound mental suffering in transgender youth, while the gender-affirming care model already promotes gender identity exploration\u2014without favoring any particular identity\u2014and individualized care. GET proponents deny this.\nIn 2017, Richard Green published a legal strategy that called for circumventing bans on conversion therapy by labelling the practice \"gender identity exploration or development\". Multiple groups now exist worldwide to promote gender exploratory therapy and have been successful in influencing legal discussions and clinical guidance in some regions. The Gender Exploratory Therapy Association (GETA) asserts that \"psychological approaches should be the first-line treatment for all cases of gender dysphoria\", that medical interventions for transgender youth are \"experimental and should be avoided if possible\", and that social transitioning is \"risky\". All of GETA's leaders are members of Genspect, a \"gender-critical\" group that promotes GET and argues that gender-affirming care should not be available to those under 25. In late 2023, GETA changed its name to \"Therapy First\".\nGETA also shares a large overlap with the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine (SEGM), which promotes GET as first-line treatment for those under 25. GETA co-founder Lisa Marchiano stated US President Joe Biden's executive order safeguarding trans youth from conversion therapy would have a \"chilling effect\" on GET practices. GETA also opposed Biden's Title IX changes protecting trans students from discrimination, stating allowing trans youth in restrooms would harm the mental health of their peers. The American College of Pediatricians, a small group aligned with the Christian Right, has cited numerous studies from SEGM to support the claim that 'gender exploratory therapy' is necessary to restore transgender people's \"biological integrity\".\nEffects and evaluation.\nThere is a scientific consensus that conversion therapy is ineffective at changing a person's sexual orientation.\nConversion therapy can cause significant, long-term psychological harm. This includes significantly higher rates of depression, substance abuse, and other mental health issues in individuals who have undergone conversion therapy than their peers who did not, including a suicide attempt rate nearly twice that of those who did not. \nAfter conversion therapy has failed to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, participants often feel increased shame that they already felt over their sexual orientation or gender identity.\nModern-day practitioners of conversion therapy\u2014primarily from a conservative religious viewpoint\u2014disagree with current evidence-based medicine and clinical guidance that does not view homosexuality and gender variance as unnatural or unhealthy. Advocates of conversion therapy rely heavily on testimonials and retrospective self-reports as evidence of effectiveness. Studies purporting to validate the effectiveness of efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity have been criticized for methodological flaws.\nAccording to Bailey et al., claims of successful conversion therapy rely upon self reports of success, however these are unreliable and lack objective evidence, and participants in conversion therapy \"may be especially susceptible to believing and reporting that therapy has succeeded regardless of its true effectiveness\". According to Bailey et al. measures of men's genital arousal patterns could provide relevant evidence to the efficacy of conversion therapy, however existing studies have not supported its effectiveness. For example, a study by Kurt Freund used penile phallometric testing and found that clients\u2019 reported changes in sexual orientation were not supported; and research by Conrad and Wincze (1976) showed that arousal measurements also failed to support claims of success. According to Bailey, although individuals may choose not to act upon their sexual attractions, \"there is no good evidence, however, that sexual orientation can be changed with therapy\".\nIn 2020, ILGA World published a world survey and report \"Curbing Deception\" listing consequences and life-threatening effects by associating specific public testimonies with different types of methods used to practice conversion therapies.\nA 2022 study estimated that conversion therapy of youth in the United States cost $650.16 million annually with an additional $9.5 billion in associated costs such as increased suicide and substance abuse. Youth who undergo conversion therapy from a religious provider have more negative mental health outcomes than those who had consulted a licensed healthcare provider.\nLegal status.\nSome jurisdictions have criminal bans on the practice of conversion therapy, including Canada, Ecuador, France, Germany, Malta, Mexico and Spain. In other countries, including Albania, Brazil, Chile, Vietnam and Taiwan, medical professionals are barred from practicing conversion therapy.\nIn some states, lawsuits against conversion therapy providers for fraud have succeeded, but in other jurisdictions those claiming fraud must prove that the perpetrator was intentionally dishonest. Thus, a provider who genuinely believes conversion therapy is effective could not be convicted.\nConversion therapy on minors may amount to child abuse.\nHuman rights.\nIn 2020, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims released an official statement that conversion therapy is torture. The same year, UN Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, said that conversion therapy practices are \"inherently discriminatory, that they are cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that depending on the severity or physical or mental pain and suffering inflicted to the victim, they may amount to torture\". He recommended that it should be banned across the world. In 2021, Ilias Trispiotis and Craig Purshouse argue that conversion therapy violates the prohibition against degrading treatment under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, leading to a state obligation to prohibit it. In February 2023 Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, qualified those practices as \"irreconcilable with several guarantees under the European Convention on Human Rights\" and having no place in a human rights-based society urging the Member States of the Council of Europe to ban them for both adults and minors, later in July 2023 she advocated for clear actions during a public hearing at the European Parliament studying different approaches to legally ban \"conversion therapies\" in the European Union. In September 2024 it was reported that the European Union is considering banning \"conversion therapies\" across its Member States, while a European Citizens' Initiative that started collecting signatures in May 2024 is also calling on the European Commission to outlaw such practices.\nIn media.\nEfforts to change sexual orientation have been depicted and discussed in popular culture and various media. Some examples include: \"Boy Erased\", \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\", \"Book of Mormon\" musical, \"Ratched\", and documentary features \"Pray Away, Homotherapy: A Religious Sickness.\"\nMedical views.\nNational health organizations around the world have uniformly denounced and criticized sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts. They state that there has been no scientific demonstration of \"conversion therapy's\" efficacy. They find that conversion therapy is ineffective, risky and can be harmful. Anecdotal claims of cures are counterbalanced by assertions of harm, and the American Psychiatric Association, for example, cautions ethical practitioners under the Hippocratic oath to do no harm and to refrain from attempts at conversion therapy. Furthermore, they state that conversion therapy is harmful and that it often exploits individuals' guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide.\nThere is also concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy can cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about gender identity, sexual orientation, and the ability of LGBT people to lead happy, healthy lives. Various medical bodies prohibit their members from practicing conversion therapy.\nPublic opinion.\nOpinion polls have found that conversion therapy bans enjoy popular support among the U.S. population. Surveys in three states (Florida, New Mexico and Virginia) show support varying between 60% and 75%. According to a 2014 national poll, only 8% of the U.S. population believed conversion therapies to be successful.\nA 2020 survey carried out on US adults found majority support for banning conversion therapy for minors. 18% of respondents said it should be legal for minors, 56% said it should be illegal for minors, and 26% said they did not know.Table 1 The survey also found that LGB contact was positively associated with opposition to conversion therapy.\nA 2022 YouGov poll found majority support in England, Scotland, and Wales for a conversion therapy ban for both sexual orientation and gender identity, with opposition ranging from 13 to 15 percent.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More explicitly, if \"R\" and \"S\" are rings, then a ring homomorphism is a function \"f\" : \"R\" \u2192 \"S\" that preserves addition, multiplication and multiplicative identity; that is,\n formula_1\nfor all \"a\", \"b\" in \"R\".\nThese conditions imply that additive inverses and the additive identity are also preserved (see Group homomorphism).\nIf, in addition, \"f\" is a bijection, then its inverse \"f\"\u22121 is also a ring homomorphism. In this case, \"f\" is called a ring isomorphism, and the rings \"R\" and \"S\" are said to be \"isomorphic\". From the standpoint of ring theory, isomorphic rings have exactly the same properties.\nIf \"R\" and \"S\" are rngs, then the corresponding notion is that of a rng homomorphism, defined as above except without the third condition \"f\"(1\"R\") = 1\"S\". A rng homomorphism between (unital) rings need not be a ring homomorphism.\nThe composition of two ring homomorphisms is a ring homomorphism. It follows that the rings form a category with ring homomorphisms as morphisms (see \"Category of rings\").\nIn particular, one obtains the notions of ring endomorphism, ring isomorphism, and ring automorphism.\nProperties.\nLet \"f\" : \"R\" \u2192 \"S\" be a ring homomorphism.

Consider the two maps \"g\"1 and \"g\"2 from Z[\"x\"] to \"R\" that map \"x\" to \"r\"1 and \"r\"2, respectively; \"f\" \u2218 \"g\"1 and \"f\" \u2218 \"g\"2 are identical, but since \"f\" is a monomorphism this is impossible.\nHowever, surjective ring homomorphisms are vastly different from epimorphisms in the category of rings. For example, the inclusion Z \u2286 Q with the identity mapping is a ring epimorphism, but not a surjection. However, every ring epimorphism is also a strong epimorphism, the converse being true in every category.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\nFounded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit. The honorific title 'Real' is Spanish for \"Royal\" and was bestowed by Alfonso XIII in 1920. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 78,297-capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and the most followed sports club across social media. It was estimated to be worth $6.6\u00a0billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club. In 2024, it became the first football club to make \u20ac1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue. The Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s\".\nReal Madrid is one of the most successful football clubs in the world and the most decorated club in Europe. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga. In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint-record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine world championships. Madrid has been ranked joint first a record number of times in the IFFHS Club World Ranking. In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.\nAs one of the three founding members of La Liga never relegated from the top division, Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" with Barcelona and \"El Derbi Madrile\u00f1o\" with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time. Real Madrid is known for its \"Gal\u00e1cticos\" policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team. In 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million) from Manchester United; he became the club's and history's all-time top goal-scorer. In addition to signing star players, Real Madrid develops homegrown talent through its academy, \"La F\u00e1brica\", which has produced notable graduates such as Ra\u00fal, Iker Casillas, and Dani Carvajal, and has supplied the highest number of players to Europe's top five leagues.\nReal Madrid was recognized as the greatest football club of the 20th century, receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. Real Madrid has the highest number of participations in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League (55), a tournament in which they hold the records for most wins, draws and goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (\"three-peat\") in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League twice, achieving this in 1956-58 and 2016-18, and is the only club to win \"La D\u00e9cima\". In 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognized as such by Guinness World Records. Real Madrid is the first club across all Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions. As of September\u00a02025,[ [update]] Real Madrid are ranked 1st in UEFA club rankings, and first over 2013\u201323 coefficient.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1902\u20131943).\nReal Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the \"Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza\", which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded \"(Sociedad) Sky Football\" in 1897, commonly known as \"La Sociedad\" (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa.\nIn 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, \"Nueva Sociedad de Football\" (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from \"Sky Football\". Among the dissenters were Juli\u00e1n Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padr\u00f3s and Carlos Padr\u00f3s, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, \"Sky\" was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".\nOn 6 March 1902, after a new board presided by Juan Padr\u00f3s had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded. The Padr\u00f3s brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of \"Al Capricho\", the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padr\u00f3s had met on one of his trips.\nThree years after its founding, in 1905, \"Madrid FC\" won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Mel\u00e9ndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the \"Campo de O'Donnell\" in 1912. In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.\nIn 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona. Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931\u201332 season and retained it the following year.\nOn 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11\u20131 in the second leg of the Copa del General\u00edsimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.\nThe first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3\u20130. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fern\u00e1ndez had allowed for Barcelona, with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper \"Ya\" reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain\". Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel.\nBarcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Mir\u00f3 rarely approached his line\u2014when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: \"Reds! Separatists!\"... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"\nReal Madrid went 2\u20130 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito Garc\u00eda after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's Jos\u00e9 Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized\", while \u00c1ngel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'\". Madrid made it 8\u20130 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.\nAccording to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11\u20131 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\" Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u and unprecedented success (1943\u20131978).\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u became president of Real Madrid in 1943. Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol (now known as the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former \"Real Madrid Amateurs\" player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera\", known today as La F\u00e1brica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.\nIn 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of \"L'\u00c9quipe\", Bernab\u00e9u, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel) and Guszt\u00e1v Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernab\u00e9u's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7\u20133 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953\u201354 to 1968\u201369, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961\u201365, and finishing runners-up a further three times.\nThe club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2\u20131 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition. This team became known as the Y\u00e9-y\u00e9. The name \"Y\u00e9-y\u00e9\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for \"Marca\" and impersonated the Beatles. The Y\u00e9-y\u00e9 generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962 and 1964. In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups. The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970\u201371 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2\u20131 in a replay. On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament. The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in memory of its former president.\nBernab\u00e9u had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.\nQuinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980\u20132000).\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Casillas\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Helguera\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Karanka\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Campo\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Salgado\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Roberto Carlos\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; McManaman\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Redondo (C)\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Anelka\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ra\u00fal\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Morientes\n 2000 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\nIn the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sports journalist Julio C\u00e9sar Iglesias gave to this generation the name \"La Quinta del Buitre\" (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butrague\u00f1o. The other four members were Manolo Sanch\u00eds, Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez, M\u00edchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With \"La Quinta del Buitre\" (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porl\u00e1n \"Chendo\" and Mexican striker Hugo S\u00e1nchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, \"La Quinta del Buitre\" split up after Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez, Emilio Butrague\u00f1o and M\u00edchel left the club.\nIn 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatovi\u0107, Davor \u0160uker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Ra\u00fal, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1\u20130 in the final with a goal from Mijatovi\u0107.\nIn November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999\u20132000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Ra\u00fal. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents M\u00edchel Salgado and Iv\u00e1n Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3\u20130 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Ra\u00fal. This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.\nFlorentino P\u00e9rez era (2000\u20132006).\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; C\u00e9sar\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Hierro (c)\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Helguera\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Salgado\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Roberto Carlos\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Figo\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Solari\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Zidane\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ra\u00fal\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Morientes\n 2002 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\nIn July 2000, Florentino P\u00e9rez was elected club president. He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's \u20ac270\u00a0million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled P\u00e9rez to victory was the signing of Lu\u00eds Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the \"Gal\u00e1cticos\" team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Lu\u00eds Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the \"Zidanes y Pavones\" policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.\nThe few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when P\u00e9rez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque. Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea. \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team\", stated Zidane. Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.\nThe 2005\u201306 season began with the promise of several new signings: J\u00falio Baptista (\u20ac24\u00a0million), Robinho (\u20ac30\u00a0million), and Sergio Ramos (\u20ac27\u00a0million). However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0\u20133 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in November 2005. Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6\u20131 to Real Zaragoza, a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4\u20130 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino P\u00e9rez resigned.\nRam\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n era (2006\u20132009).\nRam\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign. The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernab\u00e9u while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0\u20131 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0\u20133 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3\u20131 win and their first league title since 2003. Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007\u201308, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0\u20135 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u with a humiliating 2\u20136 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Bar\u00e7a that went on to win the treble.\nSecond Florentino P\u00e9rez era (2009\u2013present).\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino P\u00e9rez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline. P\u00e9rez continued with the \"Gal\u00e1cticos\" policy pursued in his first term, buying Kak\u00e1 from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of \u00a356\u00a0million, and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for \u00a380\u00a0million. Real Madrid spent in excess of \u20ac261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the \"Second Gal\u00e1cticos\". The 2009\u201310 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks, although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018\u201319.\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010. In the 2010\u201311 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Bar\u00e7a in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002\u201303. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four \"Cl\u00e1sicos\" were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1\u20131 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1\u20130 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second \"Gal\u00e1ctico\" era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2\u20130 away victory and a 1\u20131 home draw). Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall. They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season, losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3\u20133 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3\u20134 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.\nReal Madrid started the 2012\u201313 season by winning the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Bar\u00e7a in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3\u20134 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 1\u20132 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the \"Blaugrana\" six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modri\u0107 from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of \u00a333\u00a0million. After a loss to Atl\u00e9tico in the Copa del Rey final, P\u00e9rez announced the departure of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".\n\"La D\u00e9cima\" and Champions League dominance.\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Casillas (C)\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ramos\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Varane\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Carvajal\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Coentr\u00e3o\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Khedira\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Modri\u0107\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Di Mar\u00eda\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Bale\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ronaldo\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Benzema\n 2014 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup, with a front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo (dubbed BBC)\nOn 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at \u20ac100\u00a0million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, \"Los Blancos\" had already secured the Copa del Rey \u2013 against rivals Barcelona \u2013 in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5\u20130 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4\u20131 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La D\u00e9cima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth\", ). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.\nAfter winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodr\u00edguez. In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently\", while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"\nAfter a slow start to the 2014\u201315 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Bar\u00e7a in the 2005\u201306 season. In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2\u20130 in the final. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2\u20133 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.\nOn 3 June 2015, Rafael Ben\u00edtez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015\u201316 season, signing a three-year contract. Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3\u20132 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0\u20134 home loss in the first \"Cl\u00e1sico\" of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6\u20130 vs Espanyol, 8\u20130 vs Malm\u00f6, 10\u20132 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3\u20131 first leg win at C\u00e1diz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president P\u00e9rez. In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Ben\u00edtez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams. Ben\u00edtez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role. Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2\u20131 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0\u20132, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3\u20130 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process. Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5\u20133 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid after a 1\u20131 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Und\u00e9cima\".\nReal Madrid began their 2016\u201317 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4\u20132 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3\u20133 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6\u20133 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1\u20132 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3\u20134 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duod\u00e9cima\". The 2016\u201317 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017\u201318 season.\nReal kicked off the 2017\u201318 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2\u20131 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3\u20131 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and then defeated Bar\u00e7a 2\u20130 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" matches and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Gr\u00eamio 1\u20130 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3\u20131 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the \"Second Gal\u00e1ctico Era\" that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the \"Blaugrana\" boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.\nFollowing Ronaldo's departure.\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them. The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported \u20ac117 million. Madrid began their 2018\u201319 campaign by losing to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2\u20134 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1\u20135 loss to Barcelona in \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari. On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4\u20131 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles. However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1\u20134 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1\u20134 (3\u20135 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club. Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001\u201302 and 1999\u20132000 respectively.\nIn the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jovi\u0107, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than \u20ac350 million. On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final to win their eleventh title. After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total. From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020\u201321 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u underwent extensive renovations.\nFurther domestic success and \"La Decimocuarta\".\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Courtois\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Milit\u00e3o\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Alaba\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Carvajal\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Mendy\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Casemiro\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Modri\u0107\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Kroos\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Valverde\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Vin\u00edcius Jr.\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Benzema (C)\n 2022 UEFA Champions League final starting lineup\nZidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season, with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021\u201322 season. On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a. As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid. In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time, defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain, defending champions and favourites Chelsea, Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City, all in dramatic fashion, and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites, in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for \"Los Blancos\", their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge. Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358, and 2016\u201317). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.\nEven more success and \"La Decimoquinta\".\nAfter a highly successful 2021\u201322 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio R\u00fcdiger and French midfielder Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022\u201323 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022\u201323 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5\u20131 on aggregate.\nIn 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda G\u00fcler and Fran Garc\u00eda. Meanwhile, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Ra\u00fal and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after the season.\nThe 2023\u201324 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4\u20131, taking revenge of the previous year's 3\u20130 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011\u201312 100 points season. In the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties.\nIn the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2\u20132 draw, while the second match in the Bernab\u00e9u was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1\u20130. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2\u20130, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2023\u201324 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history. On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3\u20130.\nDespite high expectations, Madrid endured a disappointing 2024\u201325 season, finishing as runners-up in all 3 domestic competitions to FC Barcelona. They suffered a 5\u20132 defeat to Bar\u00e7a in the 2025 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final and were edged out 3\u20132 after extra time in the 2024-25 Copa del Rey final. The season also saw a humbling Champions League quarter-final exit, as Real Madrid were eliminated by Arsenal 5\u20131 on aggregate.\nFollowing these setbacks, Real Madrid announced that Carlo Ancelotti would depart as manager at the end of the season. Across his two seasons, he won 15 titles, making him the most successful manager in the club's history. To improve the squad, Real Madrid secured two significant signings ahead of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup: English full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool and Spanish centre-back Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth.\nOn 25 May 2025, former player and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso was appointed as Real Madrid manager on a three-year contract. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup marked his professional managerial debut, with Real Madrid drawing 1\u20131 against Al-Hilal before suffering a 4\u20130 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-final. After the Club World Cup, Madrid finalized the signings of two other players: \u00c1lvaro Carreras from Benfica and Franco Mastantuono from River Plate, registering the latter as a Castilla player.\nCrests and colours.\nCrests.\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.\nThe first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle. The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid\", meaning \"Royal\". Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself \"Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol\".\nWith the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile. In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well. In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name \"Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol\". The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.\nColours.\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season in 1926 that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padr\u00f3s in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the 1926 Copa del Rey by Barcelona with a 1\u20135 defeat in Madrid and a 2\u20130 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.\nReal's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth \u20ac70 million per year. In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026. In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of \u00a3850 million (\u20ac1 billion), with the club earning \u00a359 million (\u20ac64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.\nKit deal.\n\"Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.\"\nGrounds.\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years. After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000\u00a0spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamart\u00edn, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United. In this stadium, which hosted 22,500\u00a0spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title. Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u decided that the Chamart\u00edn was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947. Initially knows as \"Nuevo Chamart\u00edn\", the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernab\u00e9u in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day. The first match at the Bernab\u00e9u was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with \"Los Blancos\" winning 3\u20131 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.\nThe capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion. Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998\u201399 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions. The current capacity of the ground is 81,044. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.\nThe Bernab\u00e9u has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals. The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line. On 14 November 2007, the Bernab\u00e9u was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.\nOn 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6\u20131, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground. For the latter part of the 2019\u201320 season and throughout the 2020\u201321 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.\nThe latest renovation of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000. Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed. The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.\nRecords and statistics.\nRa\u00fal holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741\u00a0appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725\u00a0appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710\u00a0times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725\u00a0appearances. With\u00a063 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\nCristiano Ronaldo (2009\u20132018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches. Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (1953\u20131964), Santillana (1971\u20131988), Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s (1958\u20131966), Hugo S\u00e1nchez (1985\u20131992), Karim Benzema (2009\u20132023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Ra\u00fal (1994\u20132010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014\u201315), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di St\u00e9fano's 49\u00a0goals in 58\u00a0matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Ra\u00fal in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iv\u00e1n Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.\nOfficially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is 80,000. Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023\u201324) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960\u201365 and 1985\u201390). With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.\nThe club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers)\u00a0goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955\u201356 to 1969\u201370. Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014\u201315 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pel\u00e9, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.\nIn June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million). The fee of \u20ac77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kak\u00e1 from Milan for \u20ac67 million (\u00a365 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around \u20ac100 million. In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of \u20ac100,759,418. Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported \u20ac115 million. The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for \u20ac117 million.\nSupport.\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000. To become a season ticket holder one must first be a \"socio\", or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800\u00a0\"pe\u00f1as\" (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernab\u00e9u. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.\nReal Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called \"Ultras Sur\" supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio \"Irriducibili\" fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. Florentino P\u00e9rez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernab\u00e9u and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernab\u00e9u faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernab\u00e9u and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.\nQuestioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\". Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio Garc\u00eda, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Cl\u00e1sico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.\nRivalries.\nEl Cl\u00e1sico.\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (\"El Cl\u00e1sico\"). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 104 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as of June 2025.\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\". During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto \"M\u00e9s que un club\" (\"English: More than a club\") because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.\nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939\u201375) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del General\u00edsimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del General\u00edsimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11\u20131 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del General\u00edsimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernab\u00e9u's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernab\u00e9u, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as minister of foreign affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Di St\u00e9fano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di St\u00e9fano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di St\u00e9fano play the 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954\u201355 and 1956\u201357 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to \"Los Blancos\", signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di St\u00e9fano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.\nDi St\u00e9fano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959\u201360 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960\u201361. Ahead of the 1973\u201374 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record \u00a3920,000 from Ajax. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world. A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition. In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Ra\u00fal silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet. In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernab\u00e9u. Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016. In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \u2013 with his name and number facing them. Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Bar\u00e7a's fans with his name and number facing them.\nEl Derbi madrile\u00f1o.\nThe club's nearest neighbour is Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atl\u00e9tico was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2\u20131. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamart\u00edn. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2\u20131. After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atl\u00e9tico became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atl\u00e9tico became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had\". Thus, Atl\u00e9tico fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la verg\u00fcenza del pa\u00eds\" \u2013 \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" \u2013 and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).\nThe rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2\u20131 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, while Atl\u00e9tico won 1\u20130 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2\u20131. Atl\u00e9tico, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach Jos\u00e9 Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del General\u00edsimo finals in 1960 and 1961. In the 1970s, Atl\u00e9tico again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atl\u00e9tico calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites). By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aqu\u00ed no jugar\u00e1 ning\u00fan negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\"). Atl\u00e9tico's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calder\u00f3n (the stadium that Atl\u00e9tico Madrid used until the 2016\u201317 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atl\u00e9tico have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city. In fact, the Atl\u00e9tico crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region).\nBetween 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atl\u00e9tico offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atl\u00e9tico became the first team to beat Real at the Bernab\u00e9u in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atl\u00e9tico in more recent times has been favourable. A high point came in the 2002\u201303 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4\u20130 victory at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n. Atl\u00e9tico's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013\u201314, Real and Atl\u00e9tico were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4\u20131 comeback victory in extra time. On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n, a 4\u20130 loss. On 28 May 2016, Real and Atl\u00e9tico again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.\nEl Viejo Cl\u00e1sico.\nA further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Cl\u00e1sico (\"the old classic\"), so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903. Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by \"El Cl\u00e1sico\".\nAthletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players, have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the \"Lions\" won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005\u201306 to 2016\u201317. However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.\nEuropean rivalries.\nBayern Munich.\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times. Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws), with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings. Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\nDuring the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011\u201312 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3\u20133 on aggregate (Bayern won 3\u20131 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013\u201314 edition with Real Madrid winning 5\u20130 on aggregate, and again in 2017\u201318 with the Spanish club progressing 4\u20133; both times they went on to win the competition.\nJuventus.\nAnother match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).\nTheir first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961\u201362 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3\u20131 in a replay held in Paris. At the quarter-final stage in 1995\u201396, Juventus prevailed 2\u20131 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy. In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1\u20130. They met again in the 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4\u20133 on aggregate. By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the \"Bianconeri\" in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record \u20ac77 million deal.\nThe teams met again in the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2\u20131 at home and drawing 2\u20132 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player \u00c1lvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3\u20132 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid. They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4\u20131.\nThe latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017\u201318 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4\u20133 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3\u20130 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline. Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick, and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time, he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a \u20ac117 million fee.\nFinances and ownership.\nIt was under Florentino P\u00e9rez's first presidency (2000\u20132006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club. The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovil\u00edstica de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Lu\u00eds Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site. The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.\nThe sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of \u20ac270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts. Although P\u00e9rez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.\nBy September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at \u20ac951 million (\u00a3640\u00a0million / $1.285\u00a0billion), only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at \u20ac1.333 billion (\u00a3900 million). In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide. In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.\nA study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\" In 2010, \"Forbes\" evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around \u20ac992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008\u201309 season. According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of \u20ac401 million in the same period, ranking first.\nAlong with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money, and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership. The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2010, the club had 60,000 \"socios\". At the end of the 2009\u201310 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of \u20ac244.6 million, \u20ac82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of \u20ac170 million after the 2010\u201311 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of \u20ac190 million.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Real Madrid made \u20ac150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football. Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million. For the 2010\u201311 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled \u20ac169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona; furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, \"Forbes\" listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3\u00a0billion. Real Madrid was valued at \u20ac3.47\u00a0billion ($4.1\u00a0billion) in 2018, and in the 2016\u201317 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of \u20ac674.6\u00a0million. In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was \u00a38.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona. In 2022, \"Forbes\" listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.\nReal Madrid became the first football club to generate over \u20ac1 billion in revenue in the 2023\u201324 season, according to the Deloitte Football Money League 2025.\nPopular culture.\nReal Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the \"Goal!\" football movie trilogy, \"\" (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Mu\u00f1ez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005\u201306 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Mu\u00f1ez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, M\u00edchel Salgado, J\u00falio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iv\u00e1n Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Santiago Ca\u00f1izares. In the film, both Florentino P\u00e9rez and Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano presented the fictional player Mu\u00f1ez to the club after his signing.\n\"Real, The Movie\" is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on \"gal\u00e1cticos\" such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Ra\u00fal, Lu\u00eds Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase.\nThe book \"White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid\" by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled \"Legends\", and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid\", was released as the first single from the album.\nReal Madrid TV.\nReal Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. It can also be watched via the Real Madrid app.\n\"Hala Madrid\".\n\"Hala Madrid\" is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the \"Madridistas Fan Club\" card holders. The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans). The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.\nVideo games.\nReal Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times.\nIn 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being \"Real Madrid: The Game\", which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay.\nPlayers.\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.\nCurrent squad.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;: \"As of 2 September 2025\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nReserve and Academy teams.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPersonnel.\nCurrent technical staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nManagement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He appeared to his disciples, calling the apostles to the Great Commission of forgiving sin and baptizing repenters, and ascended to Heaven.\nFor the Christian tradition, the bodily resurrection was the restoration to life of a transformed body powered by spirit, as described by Paul and the gospel authors, that led to the establishment of Christianity. In Christian theology, the resurrection of Jesus is \"the central mystery of the Christian faith.\" It provides the foundation for that faith, as commemorated by Easter, along with Jesus's life, death and sayings. For Christians, his resurrection is the guarantee that all the Christian dead will be resurrected at Christ's (second coming). The resurrection is seen as a theological affirmation that intersects with history as a precondition for understanding the historical Jesus, his suffering, and vindication.\nSecular and liberal Christian scholarship asserts that religious experiences, such as the visionary appearances of Jesus and an inspired reading of the biblical texts, gave the impetus to the belief in the exaltation of Jesus as a \"fulfillment of the scriptures,\" and a resumption of the missionary activity of Jesus's followers. Scholars differ on the historicity of Jesus' burial and the empty tomb. Scholars of Jesus as a historical figure tend to generally avoid the topic, since many see resurrection as a matter of faith, or lack thereof, and outside of the scope of historical study.\nEaster is the main Christian festival celebrating the resurrection of Jesus, symbolizing God's redemption and rooted in Passover traditions. The resurrection is widely depicted in Christian art and connected to relics like the Shroud of Turin, which some believe bears a miraculous image of Jesus. Judaism teaches that Jesus' body was stolen and he did not rise. Gnosticism holds that only the soul is resurrected. Islam generally teaches that Jesus was not crucified but directly ascended to God; however Ahmadiyya Islam believes that Jesus survived the crucifixion and carried on his mission elsewhere.\nBiblical accounts.\nThe conviction that Jesus was raised from the dead is found in the earliest evidence of Christian origins.\nPaul and the first Christians.\nThe moment of resurrection itself is not described in any of the canonical gospels, but all four contain passages in which Jesus is portrayed as predicting his death and resurrection, or contain allusions that \"the reader will understand\". The New Testament writings do not contain any descriptions of a resurrection but rather accounts of an empty tomb and appearances of Jesus.\nOne of the letters sent by Paul the Apostle to one of the early Greek churches, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, contains one of the earliest Christian creeds referring to post-mortem appearances of Jesus, and expressing the belief that he was raised from the dead, namely 1 Corinthians 15:3\u20138. It is widely accepted that this creed predates Paul and the writing of First Corinthians. Scholars have contended that in his presentation of the resurrection, Paul refers to this as an earlier authoritative tradition, transmitted in a rabbinic style, that he received and has passed on to the church at Corinth. Geza Vermes writes that the creed is \"a tradition he [Paul] has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus\". The creed's ultimate origins are probably within the Jerusalem apostolic community, having been formalised and passed on within a few years of the resurrection. Hans Grass argues for an origin in Damascus, and according to Paul Barnett, this creedal formula, and others, were variants of the \"one basic early tradition that Paul \"received\" in Damascus from Ananias in about 34 [AD]\" after his conversion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the Jerusalem (Church), from which Paul received this creed, the phrase \"died for our sins\" probably was an apologetic rationale for the death of Jesus as being part of God's plan and purpose, as evidenced in the scriptures. For Paul, it gained a deeper significance, providing \"a basis for the salvation of sinful Gentiles apart from the Torah\". The phrase \"died for our sins\" was derived from Isaiah, especially 53:4\u201311, and 4 Maccabees, especially 6:28\u201329. \"Raised on the third day\" is derived from Hosea 6:1\u20132:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPaul, writing to the members of the church at Corinth, said that Jesus appeared to him in the same fashion in which he appeared to the earlier witnesses. In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul described \"a man in Christ [presumably Paul himself] who ... was caught up to the third heaven\", and while the language is obscure, a plausible interpretation is that the man believed he saw Jesus enthroned at the right hand of God.\nThe many Pauline references affirming his belief in the resurrection include:\nGospels and Acts.\nJesus is described as the \"firstborn from the dead\", , the first to be raised from the dead, thereby acquiring the \"special status of the firstborn as the preeminent son and heir\". His resurrection is also the guarantee that all the Christian dead will be resurrected at Christ's .\nAfter the resurrection, Jesus is portrayed as calling the apostles to the Great Commission, as described in Matthew 28:16\u201320, Mark 16:14\u201318, Luke 24:44\u201349, Acts 1:4\u20138, and John 20:19\u201323, in which the disciples receive the call \"to let the world know the good news of a victorious Saviour and the very presence of God in the world by the spirit\". According to these texts, Jesus says that they \"will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you\", that \"repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in [the Messiah's] name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem\", and that \"if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained\".\nThe shorter version of the Gospel of Mark ends with the discovery of the empty tomb by Mary Magdalene, Salome, and \"Mary the mother of James\". A young man in a white robe at the site of the tomb announced to them that Jesus has risen, and instructed them to \"tell Peter and the disciples that he will meet them in Galilee, 'just as he told you'\" (Mark 16).\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, an angel appeared to Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb, telling her that Jesus is not there because he has been raised from the dead, and instructing her to tell the other followers to go to Galilee, to meet Jesus. Jesus then appeared to Mary Magdalene and \"the other Mary\" at the tomb; and next, based on Mark 16:7, Jesus appeared to all the disciples on a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus claimed authority over heaven and earth, and commissioned the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world. In this message, the end times are delayed \"to bring the world to discipleship\".\nIn the Gospel of Luke, \"the women who had come with him from Galilee\" come to his tomb, which they find empty. Two angelic beings appeared to announce that Jesus is not there but has been raised. Jesus then appeared to two followers on their way to Emmaus, who notify the eleven remaining Apostles, who respond that Jesus has appeared to Peter. While they were describing this, Jesus appeared again, explaining that he is the messiah who was raised from the dead according to the scriptures \"and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem\". In Luke\u2013Acts (two works from the same author) he then ascended into heaven, his rightful home.\nIn Acts of the Apostles, Jesus appeared to the apostles for forty days and commanded them to stay in Jerusalem, after which Jesus ascended to heaven, followed by the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost and the missionary task of the early church.\nJewish-Hellenistic background.\nJewish.\nIn Judaism, the idea of resurrection first emerges in the 3rd century BC Book of Watchers and in the 2nd century BC Book of Daniel, the later possibly as a belief in the resurrection of the soul alone, which was then developed by the Pharisees as a belief in bodily resurrection, an idea completely alien to the Greeks. Josephus tells of the three main Jewish sects of the 1st century AD, that the Sadducees held that both soul and body perished at death; the Essenes that the soul was immortal but the flesh was not; and the Pharisees that the soul was immortal and that the body would be resurrected to house it. Of these three positions, Jesus and the early Christians appear to have been closest to that of the Pharisees. Steve Mason notes that for the Pharisees, \"the new body is a special, holy body\", which is different from the old body, \"a view shared to some extent by the ex-Pharisee Paul (1. Cor. 15:35ff)\".\nThe evidence from Jewish texts and from tomb inscriptions points to a more complex reality: for example, when the author of the Book of Daniel wrote that \"many of those sleeping in the dust shall awaken\", religion scholar Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8 believes he probably had in mind a rebirth as angelic beings (metaphorically described as stars in God's Heaven, stars having been identified with angels from early times); such a rebirth would rule out a bodily resurrection, as angels were believed to be fleshless. Other scholars hold that Daniel exposes a belief in a bodily resurrection. Other texts range from the traditional Old Testament view that the soul would spend eternity in the underworld, to a metaphorical belief in the raising of the spirit. Most avoided defining what resurrection might imply, but a resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief. As Outi Lehtipuu states, \"belief in resurrection was far from being an established doctrine\" of Second Temple Judaism.\nGreco-Roman.\nThe Greeks traditionally held that a number of men and women gained physical immortality as they were translated to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or literally right under the ground. As such, some scholars have attempted to trace resurrection beliefs in pagan traditions concerning death and bodily disappearances and setting the Jesus tradition within a more Greco-Roman context. Such scholars have argued that the empty tomb narrative and subsequent appearances of Jesus are best understood as literary motifs within the context of Greek literary works that exhibit similar narratives in Greek mythology.\nHowever, there is no evidence that the portrayal of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels (the three earliest gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke) was directly influenced by pagan mythology in any significant way. Rather, it is widely agreed that the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels is deeply influenced by Jewish tradition. The earliest followers of Jesus were devout Jews who abhorred Paganism, and would have been unlikely to shape their accounts of their founder on pagan myths. According to Bart Ehrman, most of the alleged parallels between Jesus and pagan deities only exist in the modern imagination, and there are no \"accounts of others who were born to virgin mothers and who died as an atonement for sin and then were raised from the dead\". The attitudes towards resurrection were generally negative among pagans. For example, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but by his father Apollo's request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.\nAccording to historian of religion Jonathan Z. Smith, modern scholars hold that \"dying and rising gods\" trope is incorrect since early sources on numerous gods show that gods who have died, do not resurrect or even go through rebirth. Furthermore, claims of dying and resurrected gods is based on dubious reconstructions of later sources since early indigenous sources never make such claims, and there is no clear instance of a dying and rising deity.\nFrom Hellenistic times on, some Greeks held that the soul of a meritorious man could be translated into a god in the process of apotheosis (divinization) which then transferred them to a special place of honour. Successors of Alexander the Great made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East through coins bearing his image, a privilege previously reserved for gods. The idea was adopted by the Roman emperors, and in the Imperial Roman concept of apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor was replaced by a new and divine one as he ascended into heaven. These stories proliferated in the middle to late first century.\nThe apotheosised dead remained recognisable to those who met them, as when Romulus appeared to witnesses after his death, but as the biographer Plutarch (c.\u2009AD 46\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009120) explained of this incident, while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens \"only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled\".\nHistoricity of the burial and empty tomb narratives.\nContemporary scholarship on the historical Jesus has often avoided the question of the resurrection, treating it as a theological rather than historical matter, a tendency Bockmuehl argues weakens the methodological rigor and completeness of such research.\nScholars differ on the historicity of the empty tomb story and the relation between the burial stories and the postmortem appearances. Scholars also differ on whether Jesus received a decent burial. Points of contention are (1) whether Jesus's body was taken off the cross before sunset or left on the cross to decay, (2) whether his body was taken off the cross and buried specifically by Joseph of Arimathea, or by the Sanhedrin or a group of Jews in general, and (3) whether he was entombed (and if so, what kind of tomb) or buried in a common grave.\nWith regard to the question of what produced the faith that Jesus was raised from the dead, Schroter and Jacobi state that the assumption of the empty tomb, and the view that the disciples were convinced they saw Jesus risen from the dead, finds wide support in New Testament scholarship. Challenges such as Gerd Ludemanns, who argues that the tomb was not really empty but takes the stories of Jesus's appearances as describing real events, explaining them as subjective visions, remain a minority. Yet they also note that \"The question about the historicity of the empty tomb [...] cannot be answered.\" They say that the empty tomb does not seem to be the factor that produces faith in the resurrection, but rather functions as a narrative link between crucifixion and resurrection.\nBurial.\nAn often noted argument in favour of a decent burial before sunset is the Jewish custom, based on Deuteronomy 21:22\u201323, which says the body must not be left exposed overnight, but must be buried that day. This is also attested in the Temple Scroll of the Essenes, and in Josephus' \"Jewish War\" 4.5.2\u00a7317, describing the burial of crucified Jewish insurgents before sunset. Reference is made to the Digesta, a Roman Law Code from the 6th century AD, which contains material from the 2nd century AD, stating that \"the bodies of those who have been punished are only buried when this has been requested and permission granted\". Burial of people who were executed by crucifixion is also attested by archaeological finds from Jehohanan, a body of an apparently crucified man with a nail in the heel which could not be removed who was buried in a tomb.\nContra a decent burial, Martin Hengel has argued that Jesus was buried in disgrace as an executed criminal who died a shameful death, a view which is \"now widely accepted and has become entrenched in scholarly literature\". John Dominic Crossan argued that Jesus's followers did not know what happened to the body. According to Crossan, Joseph of Arimathea is \"a total Markan creation in name, in place, and in function\", arguing that Jesus's followers inferred from Deut. 21:22\u201323 that Jesus was buried by a group of law-abiding Jews, as described in Acts 13:29.\nNew Testament scholar Dale Allison writes that this story was adapted by Mark, turning the group of Jews into a specific person. Roman practice was often to leave the body on the stake, denying an honourable or family burial, stating that \"the dogs were waiting.\" Archaeologist Byron McCane argues that it was customary to dispose of the dead immediately, yet concludes that \"Jesus was buried in disgrace in a criminal's tomb\". British New Testament scholar Maurice Casey also notes that \"Jewish criminals were supposed to receive a shameful and dishonourable burial\", and argues that Jesus was indeed buried by Joseph of Arimathea, but in a tomb for criminals owned by the Sanhedrin. He therefore rejects the empty tomb narrative as legendary.\nNew Testament historian Bart D. Ehrman writes that it cannot be known what happened to Jesus's body; he doubts that Jesus had a decent burial, and also thinks that it is doubtful that Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea specifically. According to Ehrman, \"what was originally a vague statement that the unnamed Jewish leaders buried Jesus becomes a story of one leader in particular, who is named, doing so\". Ehrman gives three reasons for doubting a decent burial. Referring to Hengel and Crossan, Ehrman argues that crucifixion was meant \"to torture and humiliate a person as fully as possible\", and the body was normally left on the stake to be eaten by animals. Ehrman further argues that criminals were usually buried in common graves; and Pilate had no concern for Jewish sensitivities, which makes it unlikely that he would have allowed Jesus to be buried.\nA number of Christian authors have rejected the criticisms, taking the Gospel accounts to be historically reliable. Dale Allison, reviewing the arguments of Crossan and Ehrman, finds their assertions strong, but \"find[s] it likely that a man named Joseph, probably a Sanhedrist, from the obscure Arimathea, sought and obtained permission from the Roman authorities to make arrangements for Jesus's hurried burial\". James Dunn states that \"the tradition is firm that Jesus was given a proper burial (Mark 15.42\u201347 pars.), and there are good reasons why its testimony should be respected\".\nDunn argues that the burial tradition is \"one of the oldest pieces of tradition we have\", referring to 1 Cor. 15.4; burial was in line with Jewish custom as prescribed by Deut. 21:22\u201323 and confirmed by Josephus \"War\"; cases of burial of crucified persons are known, as attested by the Yehohanan burial; Joseph of Arimathea \"is a very plausible historical character\"; and \"the presence of the women at the cross and their involvement in Jesus's burial can be attributed more plausibly to early oral memory than to creative story-telling\". Craig A. Evans refers to Deut. 21:22\u201323 and Josephus to argue that the entombment of Jesus accords with Jewish sensitivities and historical reality. Evans also notes that \"politically, too, it seems unlikely that, on the eve of Passover, a holiday that celebrates Israel's liberation from foreign domination, Pilate would have wanted to provoke the Jewish population\" by denying Jesus a proper burial.\nAccording to religion professor John Granger Cook, there are historical texts that mention mass graves, but they contain no indication of those bodies being dug up by animals. There is no mention of an open pit or shallow graves in any Roman text. There are a number of historical texts outside the gospels showing the bodies of the crucified dead were buried by family or friends. Cook writes that \"those texts show that the narrative of Joseph of Arimethaea's burial of Jesus would be perfectly comprehensible to a Greco-Roman reader of the gospels and historically credible\".\nEmpty tomb.\nSkepticism about the empty tomb narrative.\nEarly on, the stories about the empty tomb were met with skepticism. The Gospel of Matthew already mentions stories that the body was stolen from the grave. Other suggestions, not supported in mainstream scholarship, are that Jesus had not really died on the cross, was lost due to natural causes, or was replaced by an impostor.\nThe belief that Jesus did not really die on the cross but only appeared to do so is found in a wide variety of early texts, and probably has its historical roots in the earliest stages of Christianity. According to Israeli religion scholar Gedaliahu Stroumsa, this idea came first, and later, docetism broadened to include Jesus was a spirit without flesh. It is probable these were present in the 1st century, as it is against such doctrines that the author of 1 and 2 John seems to argue.\nThe absence of any reference to the story of Jesus's empty tomb in the Pauline epistles and the Easter kerygma (preaching or proclamation) of the earliest church has led some scholars to suggest that Mark invented it. Allison, however, finds this argument from silence unconvincing. Most scholars believe that the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John contain two independent attestations of an empty tomb, which in turn suggests that both used already-existing sources and appealed to a commonly held tradition, though Mark may have added to and adapted that tradition to fit his narrative. Other scholars have argued that instead, Paul presupposes the empty tomb, specifically in the early creed passed down in 1 Corinthians 15. Christian biblical scholars have used textual critical methods to support the historicity of the tradition that \"Mary of Magdala had indeed been the first to see Jesus\", most notably the Criterion of Embarrassment in recent years. According to Dale Allison, the inclusion of women as the first witnesses to the risen Jesus \"once suspect, confirms the truth of the story\".\nEmpty tomb and resurrection appearances.\nN. T. Wright emphatically and extensively argues for the reality of the empty tomb and the subsequent appearances of Jesus, reasoning that as a matter of \"inference\" both a bodily resurrection and later bodily appearances of Jesus are far better explanations for the empty tomb and the 'meetings' and the rise of Christianity than are any other theories, including those of Ehrman. Raymond E. Brown concurred, stating \"...in my judgment, the evidence for the bodily resurrection of Jesus is strong...\", and critiqued skeptical objections. James DG Dunn writes that the majority of scholars of the Bible believe that the evidence shows that the Resurrection of Jesus is historical. Dale Allison argues for an empty tomb that was later followed by visions of Jesus by the Apostles and Mary Magdalene, while also accepting the historicity of the resurrection. While he acknowledges contradictions in the Gospels' narratives, he argues that they agree on the important themes and that the differences are inconsequential when judging the historical event as a whole. Allison has endorsed David Graieg's work on the Resurrection appearances, which also argues that early Christians remembered Jesus as having physically risen from the dead. Using a methodology based on memory theory, Graieg argues that Paul in First Corinthians remembered Jesus as having bodily risen from the dead and that the resurrection was of core importance to early Christians. Graieg argues that Jesus physically rose from the dead and that he was remembered by Christians as having risen in a metamorphized form.\nReligion professor Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8 points to how the notion of an empty tomb would fit with the ancient Greek beliefs that any case of immortalization always required absolute physical continuity. A vanished body could consequently be an indication of someone having been made immortal, as seen for instance in the case of Aristaeus, the Trojan prince Ganymede, and princess Orithyia of Athens, whose mysterious disappearances were seen as the result of their being swept away to a physically immortal existence by the gods, Heracles whose lack of bodily remains after his funeral pyre was considered proof of his physical immortalization, and Aristeas of Proconnesus who was held to have reappeared after his body vanished from a locked room, which Endsj\u00f8 interprets as something like a resurrection.\nJ. D. Atkins argues that the narratives of Jesus contacting the disciples physically in Luke and John are not apologetic responses to docetism, and Siniscalchi suggests the gospels reliably preserved memory of the earliest appearance traditions. Jorg Frey also argues against applying docetism to first century works. Smith argues that Mark has integrated two traditions, which were first separate, on the disappearance (from the tomb, interpreted as being taken to heaven) and appearance (post-mortem appearances), into one Easter narrative. According to G\u00e9za Vermes, the story of the empty tomb developed independently from the stories of the post-resurrection appearances, as they are never directly coordinated to form a combined argument. While the coherence of the empty tomb narrative is questionable, it is \"clearly an early tradition\". Vermes notes that the story of the empty tomb conflicts with notions of a spiritual resurrection. According to Vermes, \"[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John)\". Ehrman rejects the story of the empty tomb, and argues that \"an empty tomb had nothing to do with it ... an empty tomb would not produce faith\". Ehrman argues that the empty tomb was needed to underscore the physical resurrection of Jesus.\nNature of the resurrection body.\nG\u00e9za Vermes notes that the story of the empty tomb conflicts with notions of a spiritual resurrection. According to Vermes, \"[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John)\".\nBoth Ware and Cook argue, primarily from Paul's terminology and the contemporary Jewish, pagan and cultural understanding of the nature of resurrection, that Paul held to a physically resurrected body (\"s\u014dma\"), restored to life, but animated by spirit (\"pneumatikos\") instead of soul (\"psuchikos\"), just like the later Gospel accounts. The nature of this resurrected body is a matter of debate. In 1 Corinthians 15:44, Paul uses the phrase \"spiritual body\" (\"s\u014dma pneumatikos\"), which has been explained as a \"Spirit-empowered body\", but also as a \"celestial body\", made of a finer material than the flesh.\nIn the Epistle to the Philippians Paul describes how the body of the resurrected Christ is utterly different from the one he wore when he had \"the appearance of a man\", and holds out a similar glorified state, when Christ \"will transform our lowly body\", as the goal of the Christian life \u2013 \"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God\" (I Corinthians 15:50), and Christians entering the kingdom will be \"putting off the body of the flesh\" (Colossians 2:11). Paul opposed the notion of a purely spiritual resurrection, as propagated by some Christians in Corinth, which he addresses in 1 Corinthians. The developing Gospel tradition emphasized the material aspects to counter this spiritual interpretation.\nPaul's views of a bodily resurrection went against the thoughts of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was what they wanted to avoid \u2013 given that, for them, the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit.\nJames Dunn notes that there is a great difference between Paul's resurrection appearance, and the appearances described in the Gospels. Where \"Paul's seeing was visionary ... , 'from heaven'\", in contrast, the Gospel accounts have a \"massive realism\" to them, as seen for example in Luke having Jesus insisting that he was of \"flesh and bones\", and John having Jesus asking Thomas to touch his wounds. Dunn contends that the \"massive realism' ... of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty \u2013 and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate\". According to Dunn, most scholars explain this as a \"legendary materialization\" of the visionary experiences, \"borrowing the traits of the earthly Jesus\". Yet, according to Dunn, there was both \"a tendency away from the physical ... and a reverse tendency towards the physical\". The tendency towards the material is most clear, but there are also signs for the tendency away from the physical, and \"there are some indications that a more physical understanding was current in the earliest Jerusalem community\".\nSignificance in Christianity.\nFoundation of Christian faith.\nIn Christian theology, the death, resurrection, and exaltation of Jesus are the most important events, and the foundation of the Christian faith. The Nicene Creed states: \"On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures\". According to Terry Miethe, a Christian philosopher at Oxford University, the question \"'Did Jesus rise from the dead?' is the most important question regarding the claims of the Christian faith.\" According to John R. Rice, a Baptist evangelist, the resurrection of Jesus was part of the plan of salvation and redemption by atonement for man's sin. According to the Roman Catechism of the Catholic Church, the resurrection of Jesus causes and is the model of the resurrection of all the dead, as well as the cause and model of repentance, which the catechism calls \"spiritual resurrection\". Summarizing its traditional analysis, the Catholic Church states in its Catechism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although the Resurrection was an historical event that could be verified by the sign of the empty tomb and by the reality of the apostles' encounters with the risen Christ, still it remains at the very heart of the mystery of faith as something that transcends and surpasses history.\nFor orthodox Christians, including a number of scholars, the resurrection of Jesus is taken to have been a concrete, material resurrection of a transformed body. Scholars such as Craig L. Blomberg and Mike Licona argue there are sufficient arguments for the historicity of the resurrection.\nIn secular and liberal Christian scholarship, the post-resurrection appearances are often interpreted as being subjective visionary experiences in which Jesus's presence was felt, as articulated in the vision theory of Jesus's appearances. In the 21st century, modern scholars such as Gerd L\u00fcdemann have proposed that Peter had a vision of Jesus, due to severe grief and mourning. Ehrman notes that \"Christian apologists sometimes claim that the most sensible historical explanation for these visions is that Jesus [physically] appeared to the disciples\".\nFirst \"ekkl\u0113sia\".\nThe belief in the resurrection by Jesus's early followers formed the proclamation of the first \"ekkl\u0113sia\" (lit.\u2009'assembly'). The \"visions of the resurrected/exalted Christ\" reinforced the impact Jesus and his ministry had on his early followers, and interpreted in a scriptural framework they gave the impetus to Christ-devotion and the belief in the exaltation of Jesus. Jesus's death was interpreted in light of the scriptures as a redemptive death, being part of God's plan. The subsequent appearances led to the resumption of the missionary activity of Jesus's followers, with Peter assuming the leadership role in the first \"ekkl\u0113sia\" (which formed the basis for the Apostolic succession).\nIn the \"Antiquities of the Jews\", a 1st-century account of Jewish history by Josephus, believers of the resurrection are discussed. However, this reference to the resurrection is widely believed to have been added by a Christian interpolator. Within the non-canonical literature of Gospel of Peter, there is a retelling of the resurrection of Jesus.\nUshering in the last days.\nJesus's followers expected God's Kingdom to come soon, and Jesus's resurrection was the first event of the Endtime. As Borg and Crossan note, \"For Mark the kingdom of God is already here because the Son of Man is already present\".\nExaltation and Christology.\nChrist-devotion.\nThe New Testament writings contend that the resurrection was \"the beginning of His exalted life\" as Christ and Lord. Jesus is the \"firstborn of the dead\", \"pr\u014dtotokos\", the first to be raised from the dead, thereby acquiring the \"special status of the firstborn as the preeminent son and heir\". Gregory Beale writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHurtado notes that soon after his death, Jesus was called Lord (\"Kyrios\"), which \"associates him in astonishing ways with God\". The term Lord reflected the belief that God had exalted Jesus to a divine status \"at God's 'right hand'\". The worship of God as expressed in the phrase \"call upon the name of the Lord [\"Yahweh\"]\" was also applied to Jesus, invocating his name \"in corporate worship and in the wider devotional pattern of Christian believers (e.g., baptism, exorcism, healing)\".\nAccording to Hurtado, powerful religious experiences were an indispensable factor in the emergence of Christ-devotion. Those experiences \"seem to have included visions of (and/or ascents to) God's heaven, in which the glorified Christ was seen in an exalted position\". Those experiences were interpreted in the framework of God's redemptive purposes, as reflected in the scriptures, in a \"dynamic interaction between devout, prayerful searching for, and pondering over, scriptural texts and continuing powerful religious experiences\". This initiated a \"new devotional pattern unprecedented in Jewish monotheism\", that is, the worship of Jesus next to God, giving Jesus a central place because his ministry, and its consequences, had a strong impact on his early followers. Revelations, including those visions, but also inspired and spontaneous utterances, and \"charismatic exegesis\" of the Jewish scriptures, convinced them that this devotion was commanded by God.\nEhrman notes that both Jesus and his early followers were apocalyptic Jews, who believed in the bodily resurrection, which would start when the coming of God's Kingdom was near. According to Ehrman, \"the disciples' belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences\", arguing that visions usually have a strong persuasive power, but also noting that the Gospel-accounts record a tradition of doubt about the appearances of Jesus. Ehrman's \"tentative suggestion\" is that only a few followers had visions, including Peter, Paul and Mary. They told others about those visions, convincing most of their close associates that Jesus was raised from the dead, but not all of them. Eventually, these stories were retold and embellished, leading to the story that all disciples had seen the risen Jesus. The belief in Jesus's resurrection radically changed their perceptions, concluding from his absence that he must have been exalted to heaven, by God himself, exalting him to an unprecedented status and authority.\nWhile the vision theory has gained support among critical scholars since the last quarter of the 20th century, conservative Christian scholars who believe in a bodily resurrection reject the visionary theories in favor of a literal interpretation of the textual accounts of a physical resurrection.\nLow and High Christology.\nIt has long been argued that the New Testament writings contain two different Christologies, namely a \"low\" or adoptionist Christology, and a \"high\" or \"incarnation Christology\". The \"low Christology\" or \"adoptionist Christology\" is the belief \"that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead\", thereby raising him to \"divine status\", as in Romans 1:4. The other early Christology is \"high Christology\", which is \"the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father's will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come\", and from where he appeared on earth. The chronology of the development of these early Christologies is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship.\nAccording to the \"evolutionary model\" c.q. \"evolutionary theories\", as proposed by Bousset, followed by Brown, the Christological understanding of Christ developed over time, from a low Christology to a high Christology, as witnessed in the Gospels. According to the evolutionary model, the earliest Christians believed that Jesus was a human who was exalted, c.q. adopted as God's Son, when he was resurrected, signalling the nearness of the Kingdom of God, when all dead would be resurrected and the righteous exalted. Later beliefs shifted the exaltation to his baptism, birth, and subsequently to the idea of his eternal existence, as witnessed in the Gospel of John. Mark shifted the moment of when Jesus became the son to the baptism of Jesus, and later still Matthew and Luke shifted it to the moment of the divine conception, and finally John declared that Jesus had been with God from the beginning: \"In the beginning was the Word\".\nSince the 1970s, the late datings for the development of a \"high Christology\" have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this \"High Christology\" existed already before the writings of Paul. This \"incarnation Christology\" or \"high Christology\" did not evolve over a longer time, but was a \"big bang\" of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.\nAccording to Ehrman, these two Christologies existed alongside each other, calling the \"low Christology\" an \"adoptionist Christology\", and the \"high Christology\" an \"incarnation Christology\". While adoptionism was declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century, it was adhered to by the Ebionites, who regarded Jesus as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and his virgin birth, and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. They revered James the brother of Jesus (James the Just); and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. They show strong similarities with the earliest form of Jewish Christianity, and their specific theology may have been a \"reaction to the law-free Gentile mission\".\nIn the \"pre-existence\" Christology, Christ's resurrection and exaltation was a restoration of the exalted status he already had, but had not grasped at, as described in Philippians 2:6\u201311.\nRedemptive death.\nJesus's death was interpreted as a redemptive death \"for our sins\", in accordance with God's plan as contained in the Jewish scriptures. The significance lay in \"the theme of divine necessity and fulfilment of the scriptures\", not in the later Pauline emphasis on \"Jesus's death as a sacrifice or an expiation for our sins\". For the early Jewish Christians, \"the idea that Messiah's death was a necessary redemptive event functioned more as an apologetic explanation for Jesus's crucifixion\" \"proving that Jesus's death was no surprise to God\".\nCall to missionary activity.\nThe New Testament accounts describe the resurrected Jesus calling his followers to missionary activity in what has been traditionally labelled as the Great Commission, where he instructs them to \"make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit\".\nAccording to Dunn, the appearances to the disciples have \"a sense of obligation to make the vision known\". Helmut Koester states that the stories of the resurrection were originally epiphanies in which the disciples were called to a ministry by the risen Jesus, and were later used as evidence of the event. Biblical scholar G\u00e9za Vermes argues that the resurrection is to be understood as a reviving of the self-confidence of the followers of Jesus, under the influence of the Spirit, \"prompting them to resume their apostolic mission\". According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, Peter convinced the other disciples that the resurrection of Jesus signalled that the end-times were near and God's Kingdom was coming, when the dead would rise again, as evidenced by Jesus. This revitalized the disciples, starting off their new mission.\nLeadership of Peter.\nPeter claimed forcefully that Jesus appeared to him, and legitimised by Jesus's appearance he assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem \"ekkl\u0113sia\" mentioned by Paul. He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord\", which may explain why the early texts contain scarce information about Peter. According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, Peter was the first who saw Jesus, noting that Peter and Mary both had appearance-experiences, but arguing that the tradition of Mary's appearance is a later development, and her appearance probably was not the first.\nAccording to Christian proto-orthodoxy, Peter was the first to who Jesus appeared, and therefore the rightful leader of the Church. The resurrection forms the basis of the Apostolic succession and the institutional power of orthodoxy, as the heirs of Peter, to whom Jesus appeared, and is described as \"the rock\" on which the church will be built. Though the Gospels, and Paul's letters, describe appearances to a greater number of people, only the appearances to the Twelve Apostles count as lending authority and Apostolic succession.\nPaul \u2013 participation in Christ.\nThe appearance of Jesus to Paul convinced him that Jesus was the risen Lord and Christ, who commissioned him to be an apostle to the Gentiles. According to Newbigin, \"Paul presents himself not as the teacher of a new theology but as the messenger commissioned by the authority of the Lord himself to announce a new fact \u2013 namely that in the ministry, death and resurrection of Jesus God has acted decisively to reveal and effect his purpose of redemption for the whole world\". The teachings of the apostle Paul form a key element of the Christian tradition and theology. Fundamental to Pauline theology is the connection between Christ's resurrection, and redemption. In 1 Corinthians 15:13\u201314, 15:17, and 15:20\u201322, Paul writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain ... If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile ... But Christ really has been raised from the dead. He is the first of all those who will rise. Death came because of what a man did. Rising from the dead also comes because of what a man did. Because of Adam, all people die. So because of Christ, all will be made alive.\nThe \"kerygma\" of 1 Corinthians 15:3 states that \"Christ died for our sins\"- The meaning of that \"kerygma\" is a matter of debate, and open to multiple interpretations. Traditionally, this \"kerygma\" is interpreted as meaning that Jesus's death was an atonement or ransom for, or propitiation or expiation of, God's wrath against humanity because of their sins. With Jesus's death, humanity was freed from this wrath. In the classical Protestant understanding, which has dominated the understanding of Paul's writings, humans partake in this salvation by faith in Jesus Christ; this faith is a grace given by God, and people are justified by God through Jesus Christ and faith in Him.\nMore recent scholarship has raised several concerns regarding these interpretations. According to E. P. Sanders, who initiated the so-called \"New Perspective on Paul\", Paul saw the faithful redeemed by participation in Jesus's death and rising. Though \"Jesus's death substituted for that of others and thereby freed believers from sin and guilt\", a metaphor derived from \"ancient sacrificial theology\", the essence of Paul's writing is not in the \"legal terms\" regarding the expiation of sin, but the act of \"participation in Christ through dying and rising with him\". According to Sanders, \"those who are baptized into Christ are baptized into his death, and thus they escape the power of sin ... he died so that the believers may die with him and consequently live with him\". Just as Christians share in Jesus's death in baptism, so they will share in his resurrection. James F. McGrath notes that Paul \"prefers to use the language of participation. One died for all, so that all died. This is not only different from substitution, it is the opposite of it\".\nPaul insists that salvation is received by the grace of God; according to Sanders, this insistence is in line with Judaism of c.\u2009200 BC\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009AD 200, which saw God's covenant with Israel as an act of grace of God. Observance of the Law is needed to maintain the covenant, but the covenant is not earned by observing the Law, but by the grace of God.\nChurch Fathers \u2013 atonement.\nThe Apostolic Fathers, discussed the death and resurrection of Jesus, including Ignatius (50\u2013115), Polycarp (69\u2013155), and Justin Martyr (100\u2013165). The understanding of the Greek Fathers of the death and resurrection of Jesus as an atonement is the \"classic paradigm\" of the Church Fathers, who developed the themes found in the New Testament.\nDuring the first millennium AD, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus's satisfaction theory of atonement. The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and Satan, and thus death, by giving his own life as a ransom sacrifice to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil, and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\" over sinful souls in the afterlife, due to the fall of man and inherited sin.\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by Irenaeus (c. 130\u2013c. 202), who was an outspoken critic of Gnosticism, but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview. In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the Demiurge, a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by gnosis (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the Logos, \"the very mind of the supreme God\", who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurge, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurge, and liberating humankind. In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while Justin Martyr had already equated Jesus and the Logos.\nOrigen (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ. He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.\nLate Antiquity and early Middle Ages.\nFollowing the conversion of Constantine and the Edict of Milan in 313, the ecumenical councils of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on Christology, helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of the resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography and its use within Liturgy.\nBelief in bodily resurrection was a constant note of the Christian church in antiquity. Augustine of Hippo accepted it at the time of his conversion in 386. Augustine defended resurrection, and argued that given that Christ has risen, there is resurrection of the dead. Moreover, he argued that the death and resurrection of Jesus was for the salvation of man, stating: \"to achieve each resurrection of ours, the savior paid with his single life, and he pre-enacted and presented his one and only one by way of sacrament and by way of model\".\nThe 5th-century theology of Theodore of Mopsuestia provides an insight into the development of the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection. The crucial role of the sacraments in the mediation of salvation was well accepted at the time. In Theodore's representation of the Eucharist, the sacrificial and salvific elements are combined in the \"One who saved us and delivered us by the sacrifice of Himself\". Theodore's interpretation of the Eucharistic rite is directed towards the triumph over the power of death brought about by the resurrection.\nThe emphasis on the salvific nature of the resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint John of Damascus wrote that: \"...\u00a0When he had freed those who were bound from the beginning of time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for us the way to resurrection\" and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.\nPresent-day.\nThorwald Lorenzen finds \"a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits\". He writes that among some Christians, ministers and professors, it seems to have become \"a cause for embarrassment or the topic of apologetics\". The idea of a bodily resurrection remains controversial.\nAccording to psychiatrist and author Adrian Warnock, many Christians neglect the resurrection because of their understandable preoccupation with the Cross.\nDenominations.\nRoman Catholic Church.\nThe resurrection of Jesus is the good news that the Roman Catholic Church proclaims: \"the revelation in Jesus Christ of God's mercy to sinners\". The importance of the resurrection is connected to the incarnation of Jesus: by becoming incarnate God has assumed every human unto himself, for his humanity is made of every human (just as a temple is made of stones), and by resurrecting himself God has also resurrected every human.\nBy rising from the dead, Jesus is the beginning of the resurrection of the dead on Judgment Day and the beginning of the spiritual resurrection (justification or \"new life\") of sinners, since Jesus is the first human resurrected by God, as the head of the human race as God incarnate, whereby in him all people have already been resurrected and justified, since his resurrection is the principle of the resurrection of the dead and justification of sinners.\nThe resurrection is a historical yet transcendent event. The historical resurrection transcends spacetime by affecting every human, from Adam and Eve's repentance after the fall to the resurrection of Lazarus (who returned to an earthly life) to the conversion of Saint Paul to the resurrection of the dead on Judgment Day.\nBy rising from the dead, Jesus shows what the risen bodies of the saints (i.e., justified sinners) will be like. From the moment of his incarnation, Jesus's soul experienced the beatific vision, because he is true God and true man, and from the moment of his resurrection Jesus's body shared in his soul's experience of the beatific vision. At the resurrection, Jesus's whole humanity was deified, and so, shares in the personal mode of existence of the Second Person of the Trinity. Deification includes four properties: impassibility (freedom from evil, i.e., temptation, sin, suffering, error, inconvenience, boredom, Satan, and death), subtility (freedom from restraint by the laws of science, which includes shapeshifting, teleportation, time travel, control over nature, and superhuman senses and prowess), agility (one's body will not act faster than one's mind or give in to emotion and impulse, for the body will be as obedient to the soul as the soul is to God), and clarity (resplendent beauty and the five crowns).\nEaster.\nEaster is the preeminent Christian feast that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus, and according to Susan J. White is \"clearly the earliest Christian festival\". According to James Dunn, \"In Easter we celebrate man become God ... that in the death and resurrection of Christ God has broken the stranglehold of human selfishness, has proved the enduring and conquering strength of divine love\". According to Thorwald Lorenzen, the first Easter led to a shift in emphasis from faith \"in God\" to faith \"in Christ\". According to Raymond Harfgus Taylor, Easter \"focuses upon the consummation of the redemptive act of God in the death/resurrection of Jesus Christ\".\nEaster is linked to the Passover and Exodus from Egypt recorded in the Old Testament through the Last Supper and crucifixion that preceded the resurrection. According to the New Testament, Jesus gave the Passover meal a new meaning, as he prepared himself and his disciples for his death in the upper room during the Last Supper. He identified the loaf of bread and cup of wine as his body soon to be sacrificed and his blood soon to be shed. 1 Corinthians 5:7 states, \"Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast\u00a0\u2013 as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed\"; this refers to the Passover requirement to have no yeast in the house and to the allegory of Jesus as the Paschal lamb. The Jewish feast of First-fruits is regarded by dispensationalists as foreshadowing its fulfilment in the resurrection of Jesus based on 1 Corinthians 15:20 \"But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep\".\nWhilst the fact that the crucifixion is remembered on Good Friday and Easter celebrated two days later may appear to contradict biblical accounts that Jesus rose on the third day, in Semitic tradition any part of a 24-hour period could be called \"a day and a night\".\nIn Christian art.\nIn the Catacombs of Rome, artists indirectly hinted at the resurrection by using images from the Old Testament such as the fiery furnace and Daniel in the lions' den. Depictions prior to the 7th century generally showed secondary events such as the Myrrhbearers at the tomb of Jesus to convey the concept of the resurrection. An early symbol of the resurrection was the wreathed Chi Rho (Greek letters representing the word \"Khristos\" or \"Christ\"), whose origin traces to the victory of emperor Constantine I at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312, which he attributed to the use of a cross on the shields of his soldiers. Constantine used the Chi Rho on his standard and his coins showed a labarum with the Chi Rho killing a serpent.\nThe use of a wreath around the Chi Rho symbolizes the victory of the resurrection over death, and is an early visual representation of the connection between the crucifixion of Jesus and his triumphal resurrection, as seen in the 4th-century sarcophagus of Domitilla in Rome. Here, in the wreathed Chi Rho the death and Resurrection of Christ are shown as inseparable, and the Resurrection is not merely a happy ending tucked at the end of the life of Christ on earth. Given the use of similar symbols on the Roman military banner, this depiction also conveyed another victory, namely that of the Christian faith: the Roman soldiers who had once arrested Jesus and marched him to Calvary now walked under the banner of a resurrected Christ.\nThe cosmic significance of the resurrection in Western theology goes back to Saint Ambrose, who in the 4th century said that \"The universe rose again in Him, the heaven rose again in Him, the earth rose again in Him, for there shall be a new heaven and a new earth\". This theme developed gradually in the West, later than in the East where the resurrection had been linked from an earlier date to redemption and the renewal and rebirth of the whole world. In art, this was symbolized by combining the depictions of the resurrection with the Harrowing of Hell in icons and paintings. A good example is from the Chora Church in Istanbul, where John the Baptist, Solomon and other figures are also present, depicting that Christ was not alone in the resurrection. The depiction sequence at the 10th-century Hosios Loukas shows Christ as he pulls Adam from his tomb, followed by Eve, signifying the salvation of humanity after the resurrection.\n \"For a Commons gallery see\": \nRelics.\nThe resurrection of Jesus has long been central to the Christian faith and appears within diverse elements of the Christian tradition, from feasts to artistic depictions to religious relics. In Christian teachings, the sacraments derive their saving power from the passion and resurrection of Christ, upon which the salvation of the world entirely depends.\nAn example of the interweaving of the teachings on the resurrection with Christian relics is the application of the concept of \"miraculous image formation\" at the moment of resurrection to the Shroud of Turin. Christian authors have stated the belief that the body around whom the shroud was wrapped was not merely human, but divine, and that the image on the shroud was miraculously produced at the moment of resurrection. Quoting Pope Paul VI's statement that the shroud is \"the wonderful document of His Passion, Death and Resurrection, written for us in letters of blood\" author Antonio Cassanelli argues that the shroud is a deliberate divine record of the five stages of the Passion of Christ, created at the moment of resurrection.\nViews of other religions.\nGroups such as Jews, Muslims, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and other non-Christians, as well as some liberal Christians, dispute whether Jesus actually rose from the dead. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues.\nJudaism.\nChristianity split from Judaism in the 1st century AD, and the two faiths have differed in their theology since. According to the \"Toledot Yeshu\", the body of Jesus was removed on the same night by a gardener named Juda, after hearing the disciples planned to steal the body of Jesus. However, \"Toledot Yeshu\" is not considered either canonical or normative within rabbinic literature. Van Voorst states that \"Toledot Yeshu\" is a medieval document set without a fixed form which is \"most unlikely\" to have reliable information about Jesus. The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the \"Toledot Yeshu\" has no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.\nGnostics.\nSome Gnostics did not believe in a literal physical resurrection. \"For the gnostic any resurrection of the dead was excluded from the outset; the flesh or substance is destined to perish. 'There is no resurrection of the flesh, but only of the soul', say the so-called Archontics, a late gnostic group in Palestine\".\nIslam.\nMuslims believe that \u02bf\u012as\u0101 (Jesus) son of Mariam (Mary) was a holy prophet with a divine message. The Islamic perspective is that Jesus was not crucified and will return to the world at the end of times. \"But All\u0101h raised him up to Himself. And All\u0101h is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise\". The Quran says in Surah An-Nisa [Ch 004: Verse 157] \"And because of their saying, 'We killed Messiah \u02bf\u012as\u0101, son of Maryam, the Messenger of All\u0101h',\u00a0\u2013 but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts\".\nAhmadiyya.\nAhmadi Muslims believe that, as Jesus is the Messiah to the Children of Israel his objective was to gather their following. For this reason, Ahmadis believe that Jesus survived the crucifixion, as supported by the Qur'an, as a death on the cross would be a cursed one, supported by the Bible. This belief is held as Jesus had other \"sheep\" to tend to.\nAfter surviving the crucifixion, Jesus and his mother migrated to another land where he continued his mission.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26415", "revid": "46834214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26415", "title": "Rube Foster", "text": "American baseball player (1879\u20131930)\nAndrew \"Rube\" Foster (September 17, 1879 \u2013 December 9, 1930) was an American baseball player, manager, and executive in the Negro leagues. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981.\nFoster is considered by sports historians to have been one of the best pitchers of the 1900s. He is known for founding and managing the Chicago American Giants, one of the most successful black baseball teams of the pre-integration era. Most notably, he organized the Negro National League, the first long-lasting professional league for African-American ballplayers, which operated from 1920 to 1931. He is known as the \"father of Black Baseball.\"\nFoster adopted his longtime nickname, \"Rube\", as his official middle name later in life.\nEarly years.\nFoster was born in La Grange, Texas, on September 17, 1879. His father, also named Andrew, was a minister and elder of the local African Methodist Episcopal Church. Foster started his professional career with the Waco Yellow Jackets, an independent black team, in 1897 and played for the Hot Springs Arlingtons in 1901. Over the next few years he gradually built up a reputation among white and black fans alike, until he was signed by Frank Leland's Chicago Union Giants, a team in the top ranks of black baseball, in 1902. He was released after a slump and signed with a white semipro team based in Otsego, Michigan\u2014Bardeen's Otsego Independents. According to Phil Dixon's American Baseball Chronicles: Great Teams, The 1905 Philadelphia Giants, Volume III: \"In completing the summer of 1902 with Otsego's multi-ethnic team\u2014the only multi-race team with which he would ever regularly perform\u2014Foster is reported to have pitched twelve games. He finished with a documented record of eight wins and four losses along with eighty-two documented strikeouts. Ironically, strikeout totals for five games in which he appeared were not recorded. If found, the totals would likely show that Foster struck out more than one-hundred batters for Otsego. In the seven games where details exist, Foster averaged eleven strikeouts per outing.\" Toward the end of the season, he joined the Cuban X-Giants of Philadelphia, perhaps the best team in black baseball. The 1903 season saw Foster establish himself as the X-Giants' pitching star. In a postseason series for the eastern black championship, the X-Giants defeated Sol White's Philadelphia Giants five games to two, with Foster himself winning four games.\nAccording to various accounts, including his own, Foster acquired the nickname \"Rube\" after defeating star Philadelphia Athletics left-hander Rube Waddell in a postseason exhibition game played sometime between 1902 and 1905. A newspaper story in the Trenton (NJ) \"Times\" from July 26, 1904, contains the earliest known example of Foster being referred to as \"Rube,\" indicating that the supposed meeting with Waddell must have taken place earlier than that. Recent research has uncovered a game played on August 2, 1903, in which Foster met and defeated Waddell while the latter was playing under an assumed name for a semipro team in New York City.\nFoster, now a star, jumped to the Philadelphia Giants for the 1904 season. Legend has it that John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants, hired Foster to teach the young Christy Mathewson the \"fadeaway\", or screwball, though historians have cast doubt on this story. During the 1904 season, Foster won 20 games against all competition (including two no-hitters) and lost six. In a rematch with Foster's old team, the Cuban X-Giants, he won two games and batted .400 in leading the Philadelphia Giants to the black championship.\nIn 1905, Foster\u2014by his own account several years later\u2014compiled a fantastic record of 51\u20134 (though recent research has confirmed only a 25\u20133 record) and led the Giants to another series championship, this time over the Brooklyn Royal Giants. The \"Philadelphia Telegraph\" wrote that \"Foster has never been equalled in a pitcher's box.\" The following season, the Philadelphia Giants helped form the International League of Independent Professional Ball Players, composed of both all-black and all-white teams in the Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, areas.\nLeland Giants.\nIn 1907, Foster's manager Sol White published his \"Official Baseball Guide: History of Colored Baseball\", with Foster contributing an article on \"How to Pitch.\" However, before the season began, he and several other stars (including, most importantly, the outfielder Pete Hill) left the Philadelphia Giants for the Chicago Leland Giants, with Foster named playing manager. Under his leadership, the Lelands won 110 games (including 48 straight) and lost only ten, and took the Chicago City League pennant. The following season the Lelands tied a national championship series with the Philadelphia Giants, each team winning three games.\nFoster suffered a broken leg in July 1909, but rushed himself back into the lineup in time for an October exhibition series against the Chicago Cubs. Foster, pitching the second game, squandered a 5\u20132 lead in the ninth inning, then lost the game on a controversial play when a Cubs runner stole home while Foster was arguing with the umpire. The Lelands lost the series, three games to nothing. The Lelands also lost the unofficial western black championship to the St. Paul Colored Gophers.\nIn 1910, Foster wrested legal control of the team from its founder, Frank Leland. He proceeded to put together the team he later considered his finest. He signed John Henry Lloyd away from the Philadelphia Giants; along with Hill, second baseman Grant Johnson, catcher Bruce Petway, and pitchers Frank Wickware and Pat Dougherty, Lloyd sparked the Lelands to a 123\u20136 record (with Foster himself contributing a 13\u20132 record on the mound).\nChicago American Giants.\nThe following season, Foster established a partnership with white businessman John M. Schorling. The White Sox had just moved into Comiskey Park, and Schorling arranged for Foster's team to use the vacated South Side Park, at 39th and Wentworth. Settling into their new home (now called Schorling's Park), the Lelands became the Chicago American Giants. For the next four seasons, the American Giants claimed the western black baseball championship, though they lost a 1913 series to the Lincoln Giants for the national championship.\nBy 1915, Foster's first serious rival in the midwest had emerged: C. I. Taylor's Indianapolis ABCs, who claimed the western championship after defeating the American Giants four games to none in July. One of the victories was a forfeit called after a brawl between the two teams broke out. After the series, Foster and Taylor engaged in a public dispute about that game and the championship. In 1916, both teams again claimed the western title. The continued wrangling led to calls for a black baseball league to be formed, but Foster, Taylor, and the other major clubs in the midwest were unable to come to any agreement.\nBy this time, Foster was pitching very little, compiling only a 2\u20132 record in 1915. His last recorded outing on the mound was in 1917; from this time he became purely a bench manager. As a manager and team owner, Foster was a disciplinarian. He asserted control over every aspect of the game, and set a high standard for personal conduct, appearance, and professionalism among his players. Given Schorling Park's huge dimensions, Foster developed a style of play that emphasized speed, bunting, place hitting, power pitching, and defense. He was also considered a great teacher, and many of his players themselves eventually became managers, including Pete Hill, Bruce Petway, Bingo DeMoss, Dave Malarcher, Sam Crawford, Poindexter Williams, and many others.\nIn 1919, Foster helped Tenny Blount finance a new club in Detroit, the Stars. He also transferred several of his veteran players there, including Hill, who was to manage the new team, and Petway. He may have been preparing the way for the formation, the following year, of the Negro National League (NNL).\nNegro National League.\nIn 1920, Foster, Taylor, and the owners of six other midwestern clubs met in the spring to form a professional baseball circuit for African-American teams. Foster, as president, controlled league operations, while remaining owner and manager of the American Giants. He was periodically accused of favoring his own team, especially in matters of scheduling (the Giants in the early years tended to have a disproportionate number of home games) and personnel: Foster seemed able to acquire whatever talent he needed from other clubs, such as Jimmie Lyons, the Detroit Stars' best player in 1920, who was transferred to the American Giants for 1921, or Foster's own younger brother, Bill, who joined the American Giants unwillingly when Rube forced the Memphis Red Sox to give him up in 1926. His critics believed he had organized the league primarily for purposes of booking games for the American Giants. With a stable schedule and reasonably solvent opponents, Foster was able to improve receipts at the gate. It is also true that when opposing clubs lost money, he was known to help them meet payroll, sometimes out of his own pocket.\nHis American Giants won the new league's first three pennants before being overtaken by the Kansas City Monarchs in 1923. In the same year the Hilldale Club and Bacharach Giants, the most important eastern clubs, pulled out of an agreement with the NNL and founded their own league, the Eastern Colored League (ECL). The ECL raided the older circuit for players, Foster's own ace pitcher Dave Brown among them. Eventually the two leagues reached an agreement to respect one another's contracts and to play a world series.\nAfter two years of finishing behind the Monarchs, Foster \"cleaned house\" in spring 1925, releasing several veterans (including Lyons and pitchers Dick Whitworth and Tom Williams). On May 26, Foster was nearly asphyxiated by a gas leak in Indianapolis. Though he recovered and returned to his team, his behavior grew erratic from then on. Foster had instituted a split-season format, and his American Giants finished third in both halves.\nThe year 1926 saw him complete his team's reshaping, leaving only a handful of veterans from the championship squads of 1920 to 1922. The club finished third in the season's first half, but Foster would never finish the second. Over the years, \"Foster grew increasingly paranoid. Took to carrying a revolver with him everywhere he went.\" Suffering from serious delusions, including one where he believed he was about to receive a call to pitch in the World Series, he was institutionalized midway through the 1926 season at an asylum in Kankakee, Illinois.\nThe American Giants and the NNL lived on\u2014in fact, led by Dave Malarcher, the Giants won the pennant and World Series in both 1926 and 1927\u2014but the league clearly suffered in the absence of Foster's leadership. Foster died in 1930, never having recovered his sanity, and a year later the league he had founded fell apart.\nFoster is interred in Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois. Thousands attended his funeral in Bronzeville, Chicago, including \"an overflow crowd of 3,000 people who 'stood in the snow and rain.' At his funeral, his coffin was closed, according to attendees, \"at the usual hour a ballgame ends.\"\nLegacy.\nIn 1981, Foster was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He was the first representative of the Negro leagues elected as a pioneer or executive.\nAround 1999, the City of Chicago included Foster in its Chicago Tribute series of historical markers around the city. A marker about Foster was erected at the corner of Pershing Road (39th Street) and Wentworth Avenue, next to the Wentworth Gardens housing complex, at the location of South Side Park, where Foster's Giants played until 1941. The marker was still standing but faded and hard to read as of 2023.\nOn December 30, 2009, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it planned to issue a pair of postage stamps in June honoring Negro leagues Baseball. On July 17, 2010, the Postal Service issued a se-tenant pair of 44-cent, first-class, U.S. commemorative postage stamps, to honor the all-black professional baseball leagues that operated from 1920 to about 1960. One of the stamps depicts Foster, along with his name and the words \"NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL\". The stamps were formally issued at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, during the celebration of the museum's twentieth anniversary.\nThe Negro Leagues Baseball Museum hosts the annual Andrew \"Rube\" Foster Lecture, in September.\nIn 2021, Rube Foster was posthumously inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.\nOn November 10, 2021, the United States Mint announced the designs for the 2022 Negro Leagues Centennial Commemorative coins, with Foster featured on the $5 gold half eagle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26416", "revid": "35135219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26416", "title": "Ring Lardner", "text": "American writer (1885\u20131933)\nRinggold Wilmer Lardner (March 6, 1885 \u2013 September 25, 1933) was an American sports columnist and short story writer best known for his satirical writings on sports, marriage, and the theatre. His contemporaries\u2014Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, and F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2014all professed strong admiration for his writing, and author John O'Hara directly attributed his understanding of dialogue to him.\nEarly life.\nRing Lardner was born in Niles, Michigan, the son of wealthy parents, Henry and Lena Phillips Lardner. He was the youngest of nine children. Lardner's name came from a cousin of the same name. The cousin had been named by Lardner's uncle, Rear Admiral James L. Lardner, who had decided to name his son after a friend, Rear Admiral Cadwalader Ringgold, who was from a distinguished military family. Lardner never liked his given name and abbreviated it to Ring, although he named one of his sons Ringgold Jr.\nIn childhood he wore a brace for his deformed foot until he was eleven. He had a passion for baseball, the stage, and music. He later attended the Armour Institute in Chicago.\nCareer.\nSyndicated writing.\nLardner started his writing career as a sports columnist, finding work with the newspaper \"South Bend Times\" in 1905. In 1907, he relocated to Chicago, where he got a job with the \" Inter-Ocean\". Within a year, he quit to work for the \"Chicago Examiner\", and then for the \"Tribune\". Two years later, Lardner was in St. Louis, writing the humorous baseball column \"Pullman Pastimes\" for Taylor Spink and \"The Sporting News\". Some of this work was the basis for his book \"You Know Me Al\". Within three months, he was an employee of the \"Boston American\".\nIn 1913, Lardner returned to the \"Chicago Tribune\", which became the home newspaper for his syndicated column \"In the Wake of the News\" (started by Hugh Keough, who had died in 1912). The column appeared in more than 100 newspapers, and is still published in the \"Tribune\". Lardner's \"Tribune\" and syndicated writing was not exclusively sports-related: his dispatches from/near the World War One front were collected in the book \"My Four Weeks in France\", and his immersive coverage of the 1920 Democratic Convention resulted in Lardner receiving 0.5 votes on the 23rd ballot.\nBooks and stories.\nIn 1916, Lardner published his first successful book, \"You Know Me Al\", an epistolary novel written in the form of letters by \"Jack Keefe\", a bush-league baseball player, to a friend back home. The letters made much use of the fictional author's idiosyncratic vernacular. It had initially been published as six separate but interrelated short stories in \"The Saturday Evening Post\", causing some to classify the book as a collection of stories, others as a novel. Like most of Lardner's stories, \"You Know Me Al\" employs satire.\nJournalist Andrew Ferguson wrote that \"Ring Lardner thought of himself as primarily a sports columnist whose stuff wasn't destined to last, and he held to that absurd belief even after his first masterpiece, \"You Know Me Al\", was published in 1916 and earned the awed appreciation of Virginia Woolf, among other very serious, unfunny people.\" Ferguson termed the book one of the top five pieces of American humor writing.\nSarah Bembrey has written about a singular event in Lardner's sportswriting experience: \"In 1919 something happened that changed his way of reporting about sports and changed his love for baseball. This was the Black Sox scandal when the Chicago White Sox sold out the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Ring was exceptionally close to the White Sox and felt he was betrayed by the team. After the scandal, Ring always wrote about sports as if there were some kink to the outcome.\" Lardner's last fictional baseball writing was collected in the book \"Lose with a Smile\" (1933).\nLardner later published such stories as \"Haircut\", \"Some Like Them Cold\", \"The Golden Honeymoon\", \"Alibi Ike\", and \"A Day with Conrad Green\". He also continued to write follow-up stories to \"You Know Me Al\", with the protagonist of that book, the headstrong, egotistical but gullible Jack Keefe, experiencing various ups and downs in his major league career and in his personal life. Private Keefe's World War I training camp letters home to his friend Al were collected in the book \"Treat 'Em Rough: Letters From Jack the Kaiser Killer\". The sequel, \"The Real Dope\", followed Keefe overseas to the trenches in France. He then returned home to pitch for the 1919 Chicago White Sox, but the sequence of stories closed with Keefe being traded to the Philadelphia A's before the 1919 World Series\u2014Jack Keefe, whatever his flaws, would not be involved in the Black Sox scandal. Lardner returned to the character when he wrote the continuity for a daily \"You Know Me Al\" comic strip that ran from 1922 to 1925.\nTheatre and music.\nLardner also had a lifelong fascination with the theatre, although his only Broadway three-act successes were the thrice-filmed \"Elmer, the Great\", co-written with George M. Cohan, and \"June Moon\", a comedy authored with Broadway veteran George S. Kaufman. Lardner also wrote skits for the Ziegfeld Follies and a series of brief nonsense plays that ridiculed the conventions of the theatre, using zany humor and outrageous, impossible stage directions, such as \"The curtain is lowered for seven days to denote the lapse of a week.\"\nHe was a dedicated composer and lyricist: both his first (\"Zanzibar\" (1903)) and last (\"June Moon\" (1929)) published stage works included several Lardner tunes. He wrote at least one recorded song for Bert Williams, co-wrote one for Nora Bayes, and provided the lyrics for the song \"That Old Quartet\" (1913) by Nathaniel D. Mann. Other collaborators of note included Aubrey Stauffer, Jerome Kern on \"Very Good Eddie\" (1915), and Vincent Youmans\u2014with whom he toiled on the Ziegfeld\u2013Marilyn Miller\u2013Asstores musical \"Smiles\" (1930).\nLegacy.\nLardner's books were published by Maxwell Perkins, who also edited Lardner's most important contemporaries, including Fitzgerald who, unlike Hemingway, also became Lardner's friend. Although Lardner held his own short stories in low regard\u2014he did not save copies and had to get them from the magazines that had first published them to compile a book\u2014Lardner influenced several of his more famous peers:\nPersonal life.\nLardner married Ellis Abbott of Goshen, Indiana, in 1911. They had four sons who each became writers. John Lardner, born in 1912, was a newspaperman, sports columnist, and magazine writer. Ring's second born, James Lardner, worked as a newspaperman before he was killed in the Spanish Civil War fighting with the International Brigades. In 1939, James was remembered with the book \"Somebody Had to Do Something. A Memorial to James Phillips Lardner\", a book that printed 500-copies. It was financed by the James Lardner Memorial Fund and featured contributions by Ernest Hemingway, Ring Lardner Jr., Jay Allen, Don Jesus Hernandez, El Campesino, Dolores Ibarruri, Vincent Sheean and drawings by Castelao. Ring Lardner's third son, Ring Lardner Jr., was an Academy Award-winning screenwriter who was blacklisted after the Second World War as one of the Hollywood Ten, screenwriters who were incarcerated for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer questions posed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). His book, \"The Lardners, My Family Remembered\" (), is a source of information on his father. The youngest, David Lardner, worked for \"The New Yorker\" as a general reporter and war correspondent before he was killed by a landmine near Aachen, Germany on October 19, 1944, less than one month after his arrival in Europe.\nLardner died on September 25, 1933, at the age of 48 in East Hampton, New York, of a heart attack due to complications from tuberculosis.\nLardner's grand-nephew is George Lardner Jr., a journalist at \"The Washington Post\" from 1963 and a 1993 Pulitzer Prize winner.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26417", "revid": "48832709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26417", "title": "River Clyde", "text": "River in Scotland\nThe River Clyde (, ) is a major river of western Scotland and the third-longest in the country at about in length. Its river network extends to 4,244\u00a0km and drains a basin of 1,903\u00a0km2, expanding to 3,854\u00a0km2 when the Clyde estuary system with the Kelvin, White Cart, Black Cart and Leven is included. Around 1.79\u00a0million people, 33.8% of Scotland's population, live within this catchment. The river rises in the Lowther Hills and flows north-west through South Lanarkshire and Glasgow before entering the Firth of Clyde. \nFrom the late 18th century the upper estuary and river through Glasgow were systematically engineered using groynes, longitudinal training walls and continuous dredging, and by removing rocky obstructions such as a large part of the Elderslie Rock. This was done to enable ocean-going access and support Glasgow's rise as a world centre of shipbuilding and marine engineering in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nSince the late 20th century commercial deep-water functions have migrated down the estuary to naturally deep sites at Greenock, Finnart and Hunterston, while the upper river corridor has seen major regeneration in Glasgow. Environmental quality has improved from historic industrial lows, though legacy contaminants and periodic low-oxygen episodes in the outer firth have been reported.\nEtymology.\nThe earliest attested form of the name \"Clyde\" is , recorded by the 2nd-century geographer Ptolemy in his \"Geographia\" (Book II, Chapter 3, \u00a72). The river appears as in the work of the Roman historian Tacitus, referring to the Firth of Clyde in his account of Agricola's campaigns (\"Agricola\", ch. 23). Among Brittonic-speaking inhabitants, the river was known as or , forms preserved in the medieval names \"Alt Clut\" (\"Rock of the Clyde\", i.e. Dumbarton) and \"Ystrad Clud\" (\"Valley of the Clyde\", Strathclyde). The modern form \"Clyde\" derives from these Brittonic names, later passing through Gaelic as . W. J. Watson, Alan G. James, and Ranko Matasovi\u0107 connect the hydronym with a Common Brittonic or Proto-Celtic root \"Clout\u0101\" / \"Cl\u014dt\u0101\" associated with \"washing\" or \"cleansing\"; compare the Indo-European root \"kl\u016b\"- \"wash, clean\", also seen in Latin \"clu\u0113re\" \"to cleanse, purify\". Modern Scottish place-name authorities likewise interpret as \"the cleanser\" or \"the pure one.\" Watson argued in 1926 that was originally the name of a river goddess personifying the Clyde. Later writers on Celtic religion, such as James MacKillop, note this as a plausible but speculative interpretation, consistent with the wider tradition of rivers in Celtic Europe being associated with female tutelary deities, however no direct inscriptions or contemporary evidence for a goddess named Clota survive.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nHumans have settled along the Clyde since the Paleolithic era. Artifacts dating from 12,000 BC have been found near Biggar, a rural town close to the river. Biggar is home to an archeological site at which Britain's most ancient artifacts have been unearthed. Prehistoric canoes, used by ancient peoples for transport or trade, have been found in the river. There are a number of Mesolithic sites along the Clyde, especially in the Upper Clyde Valley. Permanent settlements and structures, including what is believed to be a temple to moon gods in Govan, were constructed in the area during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Celtic art, language, and other aspects of culture began spreading to the area from the south during this period, and prehistoric artifacts suggest that, by around 1000 BCE, they had become the dominant cultural influences there.\nAncient history.\nBefore the legions of the Roman Empire arrived in southern Scotland, the river and surrounding area had been settled by the Brythonic-speaking Damnonii tribe. It has been suggested that a Damnonii town called \"Cathures\" was located there and was the precursor to modern Glasgow. The Damnonii tribe originally likely distributed power among individual chiefdoms, but at some point before 500 AD the political framework was a British culture of Welsh speakers that was politically unified and formed a centralised kingdom known as Alt Clut, representing the power centre at Dunbarton Rock.\nNone of the documentary or archaeological evidence from the period when the Roman legions arrived suggests that battles took place in the area. Therefore the Roman legions and Damnonii tribespeople are assumed to have been on good terms and to have co-operated by means of trade and the exchange of military information. The Romans did, however, construct several forts () in the area, notably on the banks of the Clyde. These include Castledykes, Bothwellhaugh, and Old Kilpatrick and Bishopton. The Romans also constructed several roads along the river, both small ones and larger ones designed to be used as trade routes and to carry entire legions. The Antonine Wall, which lies only a few miles from the river, was constructed later by the Romans as a means of defending the area against invasion by the Picts. Despite the strategic location and flat terrain of Glasgow and the surrounding Clyde basin, no Roman civilian settlement was ever constructed. Instead, the region may have functioned as a frontier zone between the Roman province known as Britannia Inferior and the Caledonians, an indigenous group that was hostile to the Romans.\nKingdom of Strathclyde.\nStrathclyde was founded as an independent unified British kingdom, quite some centuries after the Roman occupation of Britain. The kingdom's core territory and much of its arable land was located around the Clyde basin in the area traditionally associated with Alt Clut. The kingdom was ruled from its original capital, the near impenetrable Alt Clut fortress (Dumbarton Rock), which was situated on the river and overlooked much of the estuary. This fortress was noteworthy enough to have been referred to at the time in several letters and poems about Sub-Roman Britain, written by Gildas and others. Strathclyde remained a powerful kingdom during the early medieval period in Britain. It was also a reservoir of native Welsh culture: Its territory expanded along the Clyde Vae Southern Uplands and Ayrshire, and eventually southwards into Cumbria. \nGovan Old Parish Church originated in the 5th or 6th century. In the 7th century, Saint Mungo established a new Christian community on the banks of the Molendinar Burn, a tributary of the Clyde, potentially replacing Cathures if this is assumed to have occupied the same locus. This community was the beginnings of what would become the city of Glasgow. Several villages along the Clyde that were founded in or before this period have endured to this day, and have grown to become towns, including \"Llanerc\" (Lanark), \"Cadzow\" (Hamilton), and \"Rhynfrwd\" (Renfrew). The fortress of Altclut fell in the Siege of Dumbarton of 870 AD, when a force of Norse-Irish raiders from the Kingdom of Dublin sacked it. After that, the kingdom, now politically weakened, possibly moved its capital to Govan. However, it never fully recovered, and in the 11th century it was annexed by the Kingdom of Alba. It did however retain some autonomy under the Church of Glasgow, which became the secular successors of much of the territory when it was treated as a Principality of the Scottish Crown.\nMedieval and early modern history.\nIn the 13th century, Glasgow, then still a small town, built its first bridge over the river Clyde. This was an important step in its ability to eventually grow into a city. The establishment, in the 15th century, of both the University of Glasgow and the Archdiocese of Glasgow, vastly increased the importance of the town within Scotland. From the early modern period onwards, the Clyde began to be used commercially as a trade route; trade between Glasgow and the rest of Europe became commonplace. In the centuries that followed, the Clyde became increasingly vital to both Scotland and Britain as a major trade route for exporting and importing resources.\nPort authority.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Clyde Navigation Trust was initially formed in 1840 by the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Clyde Navigation Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. cxviii), and then reconstituted under the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Clyde Navigation Consolidation Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. cxlix). The &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Clyde Port Authority Confirmation Act 1965 (c. xlv) replaced the Clyde Navigation Trust with the Clyde Port Authority from 1 January 1966, which has since been renamed to 'Clydeport', and was privatisated in 1992. In 2003 it was acquired by Peel Holdings.\nCourse.\nThe Clyde is formed by the confluence of two streams, the Daer Water (the headwaters of which are dammed to form the Daer Reservoir) and the Potrail Water. The Southern Upland Way crosses both streams before they meet at Watermeetings (grid reference ) to form the River Clyde proper. At this point, the Clyde is only from Tweed's Well, the source of the River Tweed, and is about the same distance from Annanhead Hill, the source of the River Annan. From there, it meanders northeastward before turning to the west, where its flood plain serves as the site of many major roads in the area, then reaches the town of Lanark, where the late 17th- and early 18th-century industrialists David Dale and Robert Owen built mills and the model settlement of New Lanark on the banks of the Clyde. The mills harnessed the power of the Falls of Clyde, the most spectacular of which is Cora Linn. A hydroelectric power station still generates 11MW of electricity there today, although the mills have now become a museum and World Heritage Site.\nThe river then makes its way northwest, past the towns of Wishaw to the east of it and Larkhall to the west of it. The river's surroundings here become increasingly suburban. Between the towns of Motherwell and Hamilton, the course of the river has been altered to create an artificial loch within Strathclyde Park. Part of the original course can still be seen: It lies between the island and the eastern shore of the loch. The river then flows through Blantyre and Bothwell, where the ruined Bothwell Castle stands on a defensible promontory.\nAs it flows past Uddingston and into the southeastern part of Glasgow, the river begins to widen, meandering through Cambuslang, Rutherglen, and Dalmarnock, and past Glasgow Green. From the Tidal Weir westwards, the river is tidal: a mix of fresh and salt water.\nOver three centuries the river has been engineered and widened as it passes through Glasgow city centre towards the open sea. Shipping and shipbuilding developed in Glasgow and its neighbouring industrial burghs of Govan and Partick; with the Clyde, including its lower reaches, becoming for a time the leading centre of world shipbuilding. \nThe river then flows west, out of Glasgow, past Renfrew, under the Erskine Bridge, and past Dumbarton on the northern shore and the sandbank at Ardmore Point between Cardross and Helensburgh. Opposite, on the southern shore, is the last remaining Lower Clyde shipyard, at Port Glasgow. The river continues on past the port of Greenock to the Tail of the Bank, where the river merges into the Firth of Clyde. Here at the mouth of the Clyde, there is currently a significant ecological problem of oxygen depletion in the water column.\nHydrology and hydraulics.\nDischarge and catchment.\nThe Clyde drains a mixed upland, agricultural and urban catchment. The upper moorland basin consists of rough grazing and forestry, the middle catchment of arable and pastoral farming, and the lower catchment is heavily urbanised. At Daldowie on the upper tidal Clyde, long-term records (1963\u20132019) give a mean annual discharge of 48.3\u00a0m3/s, with a maximum recorded flow of 560.5\u00a0m3/s on 24 January 2018. Much of the river's surface water quality is rated 'Moderate', ranging from 'High' in upland tributaries to 'Bad' in some urban tributaries, while groundwater quality is rated 'Poor' in both upland and urban areas under the Water Framework Directive.\nTide and estuary dynamics.\nThe Clyde estuary is semi-diurnal and strongly mixed. The principal lunar constituent M2 is dominant, but shallow-water harmonics (M4, M6) in the upper river make the tide notably non-sinusoidal at Glasgow, with a characteristic double flood peak. Modern tide-gauge records show that M2 amplitude increases from the outer firth to Greenock and upriver, and that low-frequency non-tidal variability is highly coherent between Greenock and Glasgow. Phase relationships suggest the system often behaves as a standing wave basin rather than a progressive wave, consistent with the storage-area interpretation long used in Clyde engineering design. For the wider firth, tide\u2013surge interactions and external forcing from the Irish Sea modulate currents and energy fluxes.\nTidal limit and control.\nWithin the city, the Clyde Tidal Weir at Glasgow Green marks the practical upper tidal limit and separates the fluvial reach from the estuary for water-level management.\nIndustrial growth.\nThe economic prosperity that the Clyde made possible at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution was due to the location of Glasgow, as a port facing the Americas. Tobacco and cotton trade began to drive this economic engine in the early 18th century. However, an obstacle to further economic growth soon became evident: the Clyde was too shallow for the largest ocean-going ships to navigate into it, so cargo had to be transferred, at Greenock or Port Glasgow, to smaller ships that could sail upstream into Glasgow itself.\nDeepening the Upper Clyde.\nIn 1768, John Golborne advised that the river should be made narrower and the scour increased by constructing rubble jetties and dredging sandbanks and shoals. Another obstacle to navigation that had to be solved was that the river divided into two shallow channels by the Dumbuck shoal near Dumbarton. After James Watt's 1769 report describing this problem, a jetty was constructed at Longhaugh Point to block off the southern channel. This turned out to be insufficient to solve the problem, so in 1773, a training wall called the Lang Dyke was built on the Dumbuck shoal to stop water flowing over into the southern channel of the river.\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, hundreds of jetties were built out from the banks of the river between Dumbuck and the Broomielaw quay in Glasgow proper. In some cases, this construction had the effect of deepening the river, because the increased flow of the newly constrained water wore away the river bottom. In other cases, dredging was required to deepen the river.\nIn the mid-19th century, engineers took on the task of dredging the Clyde much more extensively. They removed millions of cubic feet of silt to deepen and widen the channel. The major stumbling block encountered by that project was a massive geological intrusion known as Elderslie Rock. Because that rock increased the project's difficulty, the work was not completed until the 1880s. Around this time, the Clyde became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw and James Kay, who were interested in painting scenes that depicted the new industrial era and the modern world.\nShipbuilding and marine engineering.\nThe completion of the dredging was well-timed, because the channel finally became navigable all the way from Greenock to Glasgow just when the steelwork industry had begun to grow in the city. Shipbuilding replaced trade as the major activity on the river, and shipbuilding companies started rapidly establishing themselves there. The Clyde soon gained a reputation for being the best location for shipbuilding in the British Empire, and grew to become the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. The term \"Clydebuilt\" became an industry symbol of high quality, and the river's shipyards were given contracts to build prestigious ocean-going liners, as well as warships. The \"Queen Mary\" and, in later years, the \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" were built in the town of Clydebank.\nBetween 1712, when the Scott family's shipyard was built at Greenock, and the present day, over 25,000 ships have been built on the River Clyde, its firth, and its tributaries, the River Kelvin and the River Cart, by many boatyards, including those at Maryhill and Kirkintilloch on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal, and Blackhill on the Monkland Canal. Over the same time period, it is estimated that more than 300 firms have engaged in shipbuilding on Clydeside, although probably at most 30 to 40 firms were operating at any given time.\nThe shipbuilding firms became household names on Clydeside, and even around the world to some extent. These included, among many others, John Brown &amp; Company of Clydebank, Denny of Dumbarton, Scott of Greenock, Lithgows of Port Glasgow, Simon and Lobnitz of Renfrew, Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons of Linthouse, Fairfield of Govan, Inglis of Pointhouse, Barclay Curle of Whiteinch, Connell and Yarrow of Scotstoun. Almost as famous were the engineering firms that supplied the machinery needed to drive these vessels, including the boilers, pumps, and steering gear, including Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Hastie's and Kincaid's of Greenock, Rowan's of Finnieston, Weir's of Cathcart, Howden's of Tradeston, and Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Renfrew.\nOne shipyard that was known as a 'Clyde' shipyard was not actually located on any of the Clyde's waterways: Alley &amp; MacLellan's Sentinel Works in Jessie Street at Polmadie is around half a mile distant from the Clyde. It is said to have constructed over 500 vessels, many of which were assembled and then 'knocked down' to kit form for despatch to a remote location, such as \"Chauncy Maples\". Clyde shipbuilding reached its peak in the years just before World War I: It is estimated that, in the year 1913 alone, over 370 ships were completed.\nYachting and yachtbuilding.\nThe first recorded Clyde racing yacht, a 46-ton cutter, was built by Scotts of Greenock in 1803. The pre-eminent Scottish yacht designer William Fyfe did not start designing yachts until 1807. The first yacht club on the Clyde was the Northern Yacht Club, which was established in 1824 and received its royal charter in 1831. The club was founded to organise and encourage the sport of yacht racing. By 1825, Scottish and Irish clubs were racing against each other on the Clyde. By the mid-19th century, yachting and yacht building had become widely popular.\nThe Clyde became famous worldwide for its significant contribution to yachting and yachtbuilding, and was the home of many notable designers: William Fife III, Alfred Mylne, G. L. Watson, E. McGruer, and David Boyd. It was also home to many famous yacht yards.\nRobertson's Yard started repairing boats in a small workshop at Sandbank in 1876, and went on to become one of the foremost wooden boat builders on the Clyde. The 'golden years' of Robertson's yard were in the early 20th century, when they started building classic racing yachts. More than 55 boats were built by Robertson's in preparation for World War I, and the yard remained busy even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as many wealthy businessmen developed a passion for yacht racing on the Clyde. During World War II, the yard was devoted to Admiralty work, producing large, high-speed Fairmile Marine motor boats (motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats). After the war, the yard built the successful one-class Loch Longs and two challengers for the America's Cup, designed by David Boyd: \"Sceptre\" (1958) and \"Sovereign\" (1964). Because of difficult business conditions in 1965, the yard turned to doing GRP production work (mainly building Pipers and Etchells), and it closed in 1980. During its 104-year history, Robertson's Yard built 500 boats, many of which are still sailing today.\nTwo other notable boatyards on the Clyde were Silvers, which operated from 1910 to 1970, and McGruers, which operated from 1910 to 1973. They were situated on the Rosneath peninsula on the banks of the Gare Loch, within half a mile of each other. McGruers built over 700 boats. Both yards built many widely-known and classic yachts, some of which are still sailing today.\nGlasgow Humane Society.\nThe Glasgow Humane Society is responsible for the safety and preservation of life on Glasgow's waterways. Founded in 1790, it is the oldest lifesaving organisation in the world.\nShipbuilding decline.\nDuring and immediately after World War II, the Clyde's importance as a major industrial centre rapidly declined. During the war, the Luftwaffe singled out Clydebank for bombing, and its buildings sustained heavy damage. In the immediate postwar period, the sharp reduction in warship orders was initially balanced by a prolonged boom in merchant shipbuilding. But by the end of the 1950s, other countries had begun to establish well-capitalised and highly productive shipbuilding centres that were able to outcompete many of the European shipbuilding yards. Several Clydeside yards booked a series of loss-making contracts in the hope of weathering the storm, but their unprofitable circumstances continued for too long, and by the mid-1960s they faced potential collapse. Harland and Wolff's Linthouse yard went under, and Fairfields of Govan faced bankruptcy. The government tried to limit the decline by creating the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders consortium, but the consortium became mired in controversy and collapsed in 1971. After that, James Callaghan's Labour government implemented the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 (c. 3), which nationalised most of the Clyde's shipyards and grouped them with other major British shipyards, such as the firm British Shipbuilders.\nToday, two major shipyards on the Upper Clyde remain in operation. They are both owned by a naval defence contractor, BAE Systems Surface Ships, which specialises in the design and construction of technologically advanced warships for the Royal Navy and other navies around the world. The two yards are the former Yarrow yard at Scotstoun, and Fairfields at Govan. In addition, the King George V Dock is operated by the Clyde Port Authority. Ferguson Shipbuilders, at Port Glasgow on the Lower Clyde, is now owned by the Scottish government. It is the last survivor of the many shipyards that once dominated Port Glasgow and Greenock. Its core business is now the construction of car ferries.\nRegeneration.\nMajor regeneration schemes include those in the 1970s of forming Strathclyde Country Park, lying between Hamilton and Motherwell, as part of motorway developments; the establishment of the Glasgow Garden Festival 1988 as part of the re-use of city docklands and associated industrial uses led by the Scottish Development Agency in the 1980s and early 90s. \nThe Clyde Waterfront Regeneration project from 2008 aims to continue this approach of finding new uses and attracting new investment, from Glasgow Green to Dumbarton. Residents and tourists come back to the riverside, especially in Glasgow, where vast former docklands have given way to housing and amenities on the banks in the city. Examples of public amenities and attractions include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, the Glasgow Science Centre, and the Riverside Museum. Merchant shipping has largely moved west, closer to deeper water at Greenock, and 20 miles beyond that, south, to Hunterston. The river's water is increasingly used for recreation now that industrial uses have diminished.\nThe Clyde Walkway, originating at Glasgow's Custom House Quay in the 1970s, and completed eastward in 2005, is a foot-and mountain-bike path that follows the course of the Clyde between Glasgow and New Lanark. Scottish Natural Heritage has designated it one of Scotland's Great Trails.\nPollution.\nThe British Geological Survey has identified and evaluated organic chemical pollutants in the sediment of the Clyde estuary.&lt;ref name=\"Chemical Signatures of the Anthropocene in the Clyde Estuary, UK: Sediment hosted Pb, 207/206Pb, Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Pollution Records.\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Surface sediments from the Glasgow reaches of the Clyde and Cuningar to Milton, were previously found to contain polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from 630\u00a0\u03bcg/kg to 23,711\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the range of 5 to 130.5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, which puts these sediments in the range classified as \"non-toxic.\" However, a later study showed PCB concentrations as high as 5,797\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, which is above published threshold levels for such chlorinated compounds. A comparison between individual PAH compounds that have different thermal stabilities shows that the source of PAH pollution in the Clyde is different in different parts of the river. PAH in the inner Clyde (Cuningar to Milton) are from combustion sources (vehicle exhaust, coal burning), whereas PAH in the outer Clyde are from petroleum spills.\nThe amount and type of sedimentary pollution in the Clyde reflects the area's industrial history. In order to assess how the nature of the pollutants has changed over time, from 1750 to 2002, seven sediment cores of one metre's depth were collected, and dated using lead concentrations and changing lead isotope ratios. The sediments showed a long but declining history of coal usage and, beginning around the 1950s, an increasing reliance on petroleum fuels. The decline of hydrocarbon pollution was followed by the appearance of PCB concentrations in the 1950s. Total PCB concentration levels peaked in the period 1965 to 1977, and declined beginning in the 1990s. The Polmadie Burn, which flows into the Clyde at Richmond Park, remains heavily contaminated by hexavalent chromium, to the extent it turned bright green in 2019, and yellow in 2021.\nAlthough pollution from heavy industry and power generation has been decreasing, there is evidence that human-made pollution from new synthetic compounds in electrical products and textiles has been increasing. The amounts of 16 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) compounds used as flame retardants in televisions, computers, and furniture upholstery were measured in sediment cores collected from six sites between Princes Dock and Greenock. Comparison of the amounts of PBDE compounds revealed a decline in certain compounds, in line with the European ban on production of mixtures containing environmentally harmful PBDE with eight and nine bromine atoms. At the same time, there was an increase in the amounts of the less harmful mixture, composed of ten bromine atoms.\nHeat pumps.\nThe River Clyde, or more accurately the Clyde Estuary, has significant potential as a heat source. The flow rate downstream alone is around 50 m3/s.\nIn 2020, West Dunbartonshire Council deployed a river source heat pump scheme in the area called Queens Quay. It is the first large heat pump scheme in Britain to deliver at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The heat pumps were supplied by Star Refrigeration Ltd, who manufactured them in their Glasgow factory. The project was delivered by Vital Energi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Solutions of the equation are also called roots or zeros of the polynomial on the left side.\nThe theorem states that each rational solution &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; written in lowest terms (that is, \"p\" and \"q\" are relatively prime), satisfies:\nThe rational root theorem is a special case (for a single linear factor) of Gauss's lemma on the factorization of polynomials. The integral root theorem is the special case of the rational root theorem when the leading coefficient is\u00a0\"an\"\u00a0=\u00a01.\nApplication.\nThe theorem is used to find all rational roots of a polynomial, if any. It gives a finite number of possible fractions which can be checked to see if they are roots. If a rational root \"x\" = \"r\" is found, a linear polynomial (\"x\" \u2013 \"r\") can be factored out of the polynomial using polynomial long division, resulting in a polynomial of lower degree whose roots are also roots of the original polynomial.\nCubic equation.\nThe general cubic equation\nformula_4\nwith integer coefficients has three solutions in the complex plane. If the rational root test finds no rational solutions, then the only way to express the solutions algebraically uses cube roots. But if the test finds a rational solution \"r\", then factoring out (\"x\" \u2013 \"r\") leaves a quadratic polynomial whose two roots, found with the quadratic formula, are the remaining two roots of the cubic, avoiding cube roots.\nProofs.\nElementary proof.\nLet formula_5 with formula_6 \nSuppose \"P\"(\"p\"/\"q\") = 0 for some coprime \"p\", \"q\" \u2208 \u2124:\nformula_7\nTo clear denominators, multiply both sides by \"q\"\"n\": \nformula_8\nShifting the \"a\"0 term to the right side and factoring out p on the left side produces:\nformula_9\nThus, p divides \"a\"0\"qn\". But p is coprime to q and therefore to \"qn\", so by Euclid's lemma p must divide the remaining factor \"a\"0.\nOn the other hand, shifting the \"a\"\"n\" term to the right side and factoring out q on the left side produces:\nformula_10\nReasoning as before, it follows that q divides \"an\".\nProof using Gauss's lemma.\nShould there be a nontrivial factor dividing all the coefficients of the polynomial, then one can divide by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients so as to obtain a primitive polynomial in the sense of Gauss's lemma; this does not alter the set of rational roots and only strengthens the divisibility conditions. That lemma says that if the polynomial factors in Q[\"X\"], then it also factors in Z[\"X\"] as a product of primitive polynomials. Now any rational root \"p\"/\"q\" corresponds to a factor of degree 1 in Q[\"X\"] of the polynomial, and its primitive representative is then \"qx\" \u2212 \"p\", assuming that \"p\" and \"q\" are coprime. But any multiple in Z[\"X\"] of \"qx\" \u2212 \"p\" has leading term divisible by \"q\" and constant term divisible by \"p\", which proves the statement. This argument shows that more generally, any irreducible factor of \"P\" can be supposed to have integer coefficients, and leading and constant coefficients dividing the corresponding coefficients of\u00a0\"P\".\nExamples.\nFirst.\nIn the polynomial\nformula_11\nany rational root fully reduced should have a numerator that divides 1 and a denominator that divides 2. Hence the only possible rational roots are \u00b11/2 and \u00b11; since neither of these equates the polynomial to zero, it has no rational roots.\nSecond.\nIn the polynomial\nformula_12\nthe only possible rational roots would have a numerator that divides 6 and a denominator that divides 1, limiting the possibilities to \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, and \u00b16. Of these, 1, 2, and \u20133 equate the polynomial to zero, and hence are its rational roots (in fact these are its only roots since a cubic polynomial has only three roots).\nThird.\nEvery rational root of the polynomial\nformula_13\nmust be one of the 8 numbers\nformula_14\nThese 8 possible values for x can be tested by evaluating the polynomial. It turns out there is exactly one rational root, which is formula_15 \nHowever, these eight computations may be rather tedious, and some tricks allow to avoid some of them.\nFirstly, if formula_16 all terms of P become negative, and their sum cannot be 0; so, every root is positive, and a rational root must be one of the four values formula_17\nOne has formula_18 So, 1 is not a root. Moreover, if one sets \"x\" = 1 + \"t\", one gets without computation that formula_19 is a polynomial in t with the same first coefficient 3 and constant term 1. The rational root theorem implies thus that a rational root of Q must belong to formula_20 and thus that the rational roots of P satisfy formula_21 This shows again that any rational root of P is positive, and the only remaining candidates are 2 and 2/3.\nTo show that 2 is not a root, it suffices to remark that if formula_22 then formula_23 and formula_24 are multiples of 8, while formula_25 is not. So, their sum cannot be zero.\nFinally, only formula_26 needs to be computed to verify that it is a root of the polynomial.\nFourth.\nIf formula_27 and formula_28 are integers (formula_29), then both formula_30 and formula_31 must be integer.\nConsider the quadratic equation whose roots are formula_30 and formula_31:\nformula_34\nSimplify the coefficients:\nThus, the equation becomes: formula_38where:\nApply the rational root theorem:\nformula_27 given to be integers (formula_29), i.e. formula_30 and formula_31 are rational. If formula_45 is a rational root of the equation, then formula_46 is an integer factor of the formula_47 coefficient, i.e. of formula_48. Thus, formula_49. Thus, the rational root is an integer. Thus, formula_30 and formula_31 are integers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26427", "revid": "31876559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26427", "title": "Round Table", "text": "Table in the Arthurian legend\nThe Round Table (; ; ; ) is King Arthur's famed table in the Arthurian legend, around which he and his knights congregate. As its name suggests, it has no head, implying that everyone who sits there has equal status, unlike conventional rectangular tables where participants order themselves according to rank. The table was first described in 1155 by Wace, who relied on previous depictions of Arthur's fabulous retinue. The symbolism of the Round Table developed over time; by the close of the 12th century, it had come to represent the chivalric order associated with Arthur's court, the Knights of the Round Table.\nOrigins.\nThough the Round Table is not mentioned in the earliest accounts, tales of King Arthur having a marvellous court made up of many prominent warriors are ancient. Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (composed c. 1136) says that, after establishing peace throughout Britain, Arthur \"increased his personal entourage by inviting very distinguished men from far-distant kingdoms to join it.\" The code of chivalry so important in later medieval romance figures in it as well, as Geoffrey says Arthur established \"such a code of courtliness in his household that he inspired peoples living far away to imitate him.\" \nArthur's court was well known to Welsh storytellers; in the romance \"Culhwch and Olwen\", the protagonist Culhwch invokes the names of 225 individuals affiliated with Arthur. The fame of Arthur's entourage became so prominent in Welsh tradition that in the later additions to the Welsh Triads, the formula tying named individuals to \"Arthur's Court\" in the triad titles began to supersede the older \"Island of Britain\" formula. Though the code of chivalry crucial to later continental romances dealing with the Round Table is mostly absent from the Welsh material, some passages of \"Culhwch and Olwen\" seem to reference it. For instance, Arthur explains the ethos of his court, saying \"[w]e are nobles as long as we are sought out: the greater the bounty we may give, the greater our nobility, fame and honour.\"\nThough no Round Table appears in the early Welsh texts, Arthur is associated with various items of household furniture. The earliest of these is Saint Carannog's mystical floating altar in that saint's 12th-century \"Vita\". In the story Arthur has found the altar and tries unsuccessfully to use it as a table; he returns it to Carannog in exchange for the saint ridding the land of a meddlesome dragon. Elements of Arthur's household figure into local topographical folklore throughout Britain as early as the early 12th century, with various landmarks being named \"Arthur's Seat\", \"Arthur's Oven\", and \"Arthur's Bed-chamber\". \nA henge at Eamont Bridge near Penrith, Cumbria, is known as \"King Arthur's Round Table\". The still-visible Roman amphitheatre at Caerleon has been associated with the Round Table, and it has been suggested as a possible source for the legend. Following archaeological discoveries at the Roman ruins in Chester, some writers suggested that the Chester Roman Amphitheatre was the true prototype of the Round Table; however, the English Heritage Commission, acting as consultants to a History Channel documentary in which the claim was made, stated that there was no archaeological basis to the story.\nLegend.\nThe Round Table first appeared in Wace's \"Roman de Brut\", a Norman language adaptation of Geoffrey's \"Historia\" finished in 1155. Wace says Arthur created the Round Table to prevent quarrels among his barons, none of whom would accept a lower place than the others. Layamon added to the story when he adapted Wace's work into the Middle English \"Brut\" in the early 13th century, saying that the quarrel between Arthur's vassals led to violence at a Yuletide feast. In response, a Cornish carpenter built an enormous but easily transportable Round Table to prevent further dispute. Wace claims he was not the source of the Round Table; both he and Layamon credited it instead to the Bretons. Some scholars have doubted this claim, while others believe it may be true. There is some similarity between the chroniclers' description of the Round Table and a custom recorded in Celtic stories, in which warriors sit in a circle around the king or lead warrior, in some cases feuding over the order of precedence as in Layamon. There is a possibility that Wace, contrary to his own claims, derived Arthur's round table not from any Breton source, but rather from medieval biographies of Charlemagne\u2014notably Einhard's \"Vita Caroli\" and Notker the Stammerer's \"De Carolo Magno\"\u2014in which the king is said to have possessed a round table decorated with a map of Rome.\nThe Round Table takes on new dimensions in the romances of the late 12th and early 13th century, where it becomes a symbol of the famed order of chivalry which flourishes under Arthur. In Robert de Boron's \"Merlin\", written around 1200, the magician Merlin creates the Round Table in imitation of the table of the Last Supper and of Joseph of Arimathea's Grail Table. Made of silver, the Grail Table was used by the followers of Arimathea after he created it as directed by a vision of Christ, and was taken by him to Avalon (later identified with Glastonbury Tor, but this connection was not mentioned by Robert). This version of the Round Table, here made for Arthur's father Uther Pendragon rather than Arthur himself, has twelve seats and one empty place to mark the betrayal of Judas; this seat, must remain empty until the coming of the knight who will achieve the Grail. The Didot \"Perceval\", a prose continuation of Robert's work, takes up the story as the knight Perceval sits in the seat and initiates the Grail quest.\nThe prose cycles of the 13th century, the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) Cycle and the Post-Vulgate Cycle, further adapt the chivalric attributes of the Round Table but make it and its fellowship much larger, with many more seats and usually dozens of members at any given time. Here it is the perfect knight Galahad, rather than Percival, who assumes the empty seat, now called the Siege Perilous. Galahad's arrival marks the start of the Grail quest as well as the end of the Arthurian era. In these works the Round Table is kept by King Leodegrance of Cameliard after Uther's death; Arthur inherits it when he marries Leodegrance's daughter Guinevere. Other versions treat the Round Table differently, for instance Arthurian works from Italy like \"La Tavola Ritonda\" (\"The Round Table\") often distinguish between the knights of the \"Old Table\" of Uther's time and those of Arthur's \"New Table\". In the Post-Vulgate, the Table is eventually destroyed by King Mark during his invasion of Logres after the deaths of Arthur and almost all of the Knights, many of whom in fact had killed each other, especially in internal conflicts at the end of the cycle. \nRound Table tournaments.\nDuring the Middle Ages, festivals called Round Tables were celebrated throughout Europe in imitation of Arthur's court. These events featured jousting, dancing, and feasting, and in some cases attending knights assumed the identities of Arthur's entourage.\nWinchester Round Table.\nThe Winchester Round Table is a large tabletop hanging in Winchester Castle and bearing the names of various knights of Arthur's court, was probably created for a Round Table tournament. The table is in diameter and weighs . The current paintwork is late; it was done by order of King Henry VIII of England. The table itself is considerably older; dendrochronology calculates the date of construction to 1250\u20131280\u2014during the reign of Edward I of England\u2014using timbers that were felled over a period of years. Edward was an Arthurian enthusiast who attended at least five Round Tables and hosted one himself in 1299, which may have been the occasion for the creation of the Winchester Round Table. Martin Biddle, from an examination of Edward's financial accounts, links it instead with a tournament King Edward held near Winchester on 20 April 1290, to mark the betrothal of one of his daughters. The Green and white colours represents the Welsh Livery used by the Tudor dynasty.\nHistorical Round Table of Edward III.\nOn 22 January 1344, after a tournament at Windsor Castle, King Edward III of England (r. 1327\u20131377) swore an oath to restore the Order of the Round Table to the same as that of King Arthur. Receiving agreement from the earls and knights present, Edward announced that the order's first meeting would take place during Pentecost. The plan never came to fruition, but the new Order of the Garter carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Cr\u00e9cy campaign (1346\u20131347) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian chivalric ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward, especially at the time of the institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early 15th-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter. However, the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a Round Table game in an overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
