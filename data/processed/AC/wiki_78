Superoxide is produced as a by-product of oxygen metabolism and, if not regulated, causes many types of cell damage. Hydrogen peroxide is also damaging and is degraded by other enzymes such as catalase. Thus, SOD is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all living cells exposed to oxygen. One exception is \"Lactobacillus plantarum\" and related lactobacilli, which use intracellular manganese to prevent damage from reactive O2-.\nChemical reaction.\nSODs catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide:\n2H+ + 2O2\u2212 \u2192 O2 + H2O2\nIn this way, O2\u2212 is converted into two less damaging species.\nThe general form, applicable to all the different metal\u2212coordinated forms of SOD, can be written as follows:\nThe reactions by which SOD\u2212catalyzed dismutation of superoxide for Cu,Zn SOD can be written as follows:\nwhere M = Cu (n=1); Mn (n=2); Fe (n=2); Ni (n=2) only in prokaryotes.\nIn a series of such reactions, the oxidation state and the charge of the metal cation oscillates between n and n+1: +1 and +2 for Cu, or +2 and +3 for the other metals.\nTypes.\nGeneral.\nIrwin Fridovich and Joe McCord at Duke University discovered the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase in 1968. SODs were previously known as a group of metalloproteins with unknown function; for example, CuZnSOD was known as erythrocuprein (or hemocuprein, or cytocuprein) or as the veterinary anti-inflammatory drug \"Orgotein\". Likewise, Brewer (1967) identified a protein that later became known as superoxide dismutase as an indophenol oxidase by protein analysis of starch gels using the phenazine-tetrazolium technique.\nThere are three major families of superoxide dismutase, depending on the protein fold and the metal cofactor: the Cu/Zn type (which binds both copper and zinc), Fe and Mn types (which bind either iron or manganese), and the Ni type (which binds nickel).\nIn higher plants, SOD isozymes have been localized in different cell compartments. Mn-SOD is present in mitochondria and peroxisomes. Fe-SOD has been found mainly in chloroplasts but has also been detected in peroxisomes, and CuZn-SOD has been localized in cytosol, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and apoplast.\nHuman.\nThere are three forms of superoxide dismutase present in humans, in all other mammals, and most chordates. SOD1 is located in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria, and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), whereas the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc, whereas SOD2, the mitochondrial enzyme, has manganese in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).\nPlants.\nIn higher plants, superoxide dismutase enzymes (SODs) act as antioxidants and protect cellular components from being oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can form as a result of drought, injury, herbicides and pesticides, ozone, plant metabolic activity, nutrient deficiencies, photoinhibition, temperature above and below ground, toxic metals, and UV or gamma rays. To be specific, molecular O2 is reduced to O2- (a ROS called superoxide) when it absorbs an excited electron released from compounds of the electron transport chain. Superoxide is known to denature enzymes, oxidize lipids, and fragment DNA. SODs catalyze the production of O2 and H2O2 from superoxide (O2-), which results in less harmful reactants.\nWhen acclimating to increased levels of oxidative stress, SOD concentrations typically increase with the degree of stress conditions. The compartmentalization of different forms of SOD throughout the plant makes them counteract stress very effectively. There are three well-known and -studied classes of SOD metallic coenzymes that exist in plants. First, Fe SODs consist of two species, one homodimer (containing 1\u20132 g Fe) and one tetramer (containing 2\u20134 g Fe). They are thought to be the most ancient SOD metalloenzymes and are found within both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Fe SODs are most abundantly localized inside plant chloroplasts, where they are indigenous. Second, Mn SODs consist of a homodimer and homotetramer species each containing a single Mn(III) atom per subunit. They are found predominantly in mitochondrion and peroxisomes. Third, Cu-Zn SODs have electrical properties very different from those of the other two classes. These are concentrated in the chloroplast, cytosol, and in some cases the extracellular space. Note that Cu-Zn SODs provide less protection than Fe SODs when localized in the chloroplast.\nBacteria.\nHuman white blood cells use enzymes such as NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide and other reactive oxygen species to kill bacteria. During infection, some bacteria (e.g., \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\") therefore produce superoxide dismutase to protect themselves from being killed.\nBiochemistry.\nSOD out-competes damaging reactions of superoxide, thus protecting the cell from superoxide toxicity.\nThe reaction of superoxide with non-radicals is spin-forbidden. In biological systems, this means that its main reactions are with itself (dismutation) or with another biological radical such as nitric oxide (NO) or with a transition-series metal. The superoxide anion radical (O2-) spontaneously dismutes to O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) quite rapidly (~105 M\u22121s\u22121 at pH 7). SOD is necessary because superoxide reacts with sensitive and critical cellular targets. For example, it reacts with the NO radical, and makes toxic peroxynitrite.\nBecause the uncatalysed dismutation reaction for superoxide requires two superoxide molecules to react with each other, the dismutation rate is second-order with respect to initial superoxide concentration. Thus, the half-life of superoxide, although very short at high concentrations (e.g., 0.05 seconds at 0.1mM) is actually quite long at low concentrations (e.g., 14 hours at 0.1 nM). In contrast, the reaction of superoxide with SOD is first order with respect to superoxide concentration. Moreover, superoxide dismutase has the largest \"k\"cat/\"K\"M (an approximation of catalytic efficiency) of any known enzyme (~7 billion M\u22121s\u22121), this reaction being limited only by the frequency of collision between itself and superoxide. That is, the reaction rate is \"diffusion-limited\".\nThe high efficiency of superoxide dismutase seems necessary: even at the subnanomolar concentrations achieved by the high concentrations of SOD within cells, superoxide inactivates the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase, can poison energy metabolism, and releases potentially toxic iron. Aconitase is one of several iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases in metabolic pathways shown to be inactivated by superoxide.\nEvolution.\nThe phylogenetic relationships among superoxide dismutases (SODs) are one of many genetic components that have been used to help reconstruct an early timeline of events and predict the evolutionary descent of species, individuals, or genes from a common ancestor over time. Around the period of Earth's transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions about 2.4 billion years ago (bya), the evolution of SOD enzymes crucially allowed organisms to overcome the effects of oxidative stress following the surge of molecular oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere (Miller 2012). However, evidence suggests that the origination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) took place as early as 4.1 to 3.5 bya (Inupakutika \"et al.\" 2016). For the first aerobic organisms, survival depended largely on their ability to defend against ROS. For this reason, it is relevant to understand the environmental constraints that allowed such protective defense enzymes to evolve.\nThe Great Oxidation Event.\nAtmospheric and oceanic compositions have drastically changed since the formation of early Earth. One significant event, the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), marked the period of time in which oxygen became a major component of Earth's atmosphere and surface ocean. However, the physical or biochemical drivers responsible for the transition from a reducing to oxidizing environment remains up for debate (Olejarz \"et al.\" 2021). To date, the evolution of cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial photosynthesis is commonly accepted as the primary driver of oxygen production, alongside several physical events behaving as proximal drivers of environmental state change (Kasting 2013; Inupakutika \"et al.\" 2016).\nSelective Pressure and Enzyme Evolution.\nThe atmospheric accumulation of highly reactive O2 likely exercised a strong selective pressure against anaerobic organisms, and led to the adaptive evolution of oxygen utilization in metabolism (Boden \"et al\". 2021). The process of oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic respiration permitted a 400-fold increase in energy extraction efficiency per mole glucose as compared to anaerobic respiration. Although the increased yield of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a common form of cellular energy currency, was metabolically beneficial, the tradeoff between efficiency and risk to the metabolic machinery grew more prominent. Behaving as the terminal electron acceptor during cellular respiration, the high rate of O2 electron flux is accompanied by an increased risk of ROS formation, which can induce irreversible damage to cellular organelles and their processes (Case 2017). In response to the accumulation of the hazardous metabolic byproducts of aerobic respiration, biological systems evolved various strategies to counteract O2 toxicity. \nThe Rise of Antioxidants.\nDuring the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, phylogenetic investigations suggest that SODs are ancient molecules, which were likely selected for before the GOE. While it is intuitively assumed that antioxidants emerged during the GOE to defend against O2 reactivity and toxicity caused by the accelerated oxygenation of the atmosphere, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of antioxidant systems from ancient organisms suggests that antioxidant enzymes including SODs may have originated long before the surge of atmospheric and oceanic O2 (Wolfe-Simon \"et al\". 2005; Inupakutika \"et al.\" 2016).\nNecessity of ROS-Defense Mechanisms.\nThe oxidizing capacity of O2 makes it a highly efficient final electron acceptor for several biological processes, producing more energy per mole substrate relative to other available electron acceptors during aerobic respiration (Boden \"et al.\" 2021). On the other hand, its high reactivity also contributes to the uncontrolled removal of electrons, which underlies pathological cell damage through the propagation of highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules. \nSuperoxide (O2\u2022\u2212) is the most common reactive free-radical formed by the univalent reduction of O2. While they are known to exhibit beneficial roles in some cellular processes, superoxide free radicals also possess the ability to initiate a cascade of ROS and free-radical species formation in biological systems. As a consequence, the unrestrained and potentially lethal accumulation of ROS threatens to damage many biomolecules: lipids, proteins, DNA, and host cells. Additionally, oxidative stress in excess is understood to participate in the dysregulation of cellular processes and disease development (Zewen \"et al.\" 2018). \nTo maintain a balance of intracellular superoxide, organisms have developed strategies to protect against overexposure. One such mechanism functions to catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, which is accomplished by SOD enzymes.\nIndependent Evolution of SOD Families.\nStudies examining the phylogenetic distribution of SODs support the proposal that the major physiological function of SOD is to act as a protective mechanism among oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the formation of superoxide free radicals (McCord \"et al.\" 1971). Although the enzyme is functionally limited to the conversion of superoxide radicals into less toxic oxygen-containing molecules, methodological approaches utilizing phylogenetic and structural protein analysis suggest that three SOD isoforms have evolved independently to combat superoxide accumulation. Each enzyme family is characterized by a distinct 3D structure, amino acid sequence, and with regard to the metal-binding cofactor(s) used to support its structural stability and catalytic activity (Case 2017): either manganese (MnSOD), nickel (NiSOD), or both copper and zinc (Miller 2012). An additional family utilizing an iron cofactor (FeSOD) has also been identified, which is evolutionarily related to MnSOD (Wolfe-Simon \"et al.\" 2005). The evolution of metalliform diversity can likely be explained by changes in heavy metal bioavailability that took place during large compositional changes of the earth's early atmosphere and oceans.\nFe/MnSODs.\nSODs containing Fe (FeSOD), Mn (MnSOD), or may contain either (Fe/MnSOD) are believed to have been the earliest SOD isoforms among life on early earth. During this time, Fe and Mn would have been highly bioavailable. The differences between the oxidation and reduction potentials of each metal is thought to have been advantageous to organism survival, allowing them to exist in environments with varying O2 concentration and metal availability.\nCuZnSODs.\nThe most modern SOD family is believed to utilize both Cu and Zn ions (CuZnSOD). The absence of CuZnSODs from archaeal and protist genomes coupled with the post-GOE increased bioavailability of Cu and Zn suggests that the development of this isoform took place at a later period in evolutionary time (Banci \"et al.\" 2005; Wilkinson \"et al.\" 2006).\nNiSODs.\nThe family of Ni-containing SODs (NiSOD) is less understood. Evidence suggests that these isoforms are largely distributed among marine bacteria and algae (Wolfe-Simon \"et al.\" 2005; Dupont \"et al.\" 2008). The evolution of NiSOD is currently predicted to have occurred around the time of the GOE when a decrease in aquatic bioavailability of Fe took place.\nStability and folding mechanism.\nSOD1 is an extremely stable protein. In the holo form (both copper and zinc bound) the melting point is &gt; 90\u00a0\u00b0C. In the apo form (no copper or zinc bound) the melting point is ~60\u00a0\u00b0C. By differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), holo SOD1 unfolds by a two-state mechanism: from dimer to two unfolded monomers. In chemical denaturation experiments, holo SOD1 unfolds by a three-state mechanism with observation of a folded monomeric intermediate.\nPhysiology.\nSuperoxide is one of the main reactive oxygen species in the cell. As a consequence, SOD serves a key antioxidant role. The physiological importance of SODs is illustrated by the severe pathologies evident in mice genetically engineered to lack these enzymes. Mice lacking SOD2 die several days after birth, amid massive oxidative stress. Mice lacking SOD1 develop a wide range of pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, an acceleration of age-related muscle mass loss, an earlier incidence of cataracts, and a reduced lifespan. Mice lacking SOD3 do not show any obvious defects and exhibit a normal lifespan, though they are more sensitive to hyperoxic injury. Knockout mice of any SOD enzyme are more sensitive to the lethal effects of superoxide-generating compounds, such as paraquat and diquat (herbicides).\n\"Drosophila\" lacking SOD1 have a dramatically shortened lifespan, whereas flies lacking SOD2 die before birth. Depletion of SOD1 and SOD2 in the nervous system and muscles of \"Drosophila\" is associated with reduced lifespan. The accumulation of neuronal and muscular ROS appears to contribute to age-associated impairments. When overexpression of mitochondrial SOD2 is induced, the lifespan of adult \"Drosophila\" is extended.\nAmong black garden ants (\"Lasius niger\"), the lifespan of queens is an order of magnitude greater than of workers despite no systematic nucleotide sequence difference between them. The \"SOD3\" gene was found to be the most differentially over-expressed in the brains of queen vs worker ants. This finding raises the possibility of an important role of antioxidant function in modulating lifespan.\nSOD knockdowns in the worm \"C. elegans\" do not cause major physiological disruptions. However, the lifespan of \"C. elegans\" can be extended by superoxide/catalase mimetics suggesting that oxidative stress is a major determinant of the rate of aging.\nKnockout or null mutations in SOD1 are highly detrimental to aerobic growth in the budding yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and result in a dramatic reduction in post-diauxic lifespan. In wild-type \"S. cerevisiae\", DNA damage rates increased 3-fold with age, but more than 5-fold in mutants deleted for either the \"SOD1\" or \"SOD2\" genes. Reactive oxygen species levels increase with age in these mutant strains and show a similar pattern to the pattern of DNA damage increase with age. Thus it appears that superoxide dismutase plays a substantial role in preserving genome integrity during aging in \"S. cerevisiae\".\nSOD2 knockout or null mutations cause growth inhibition on respiratory carbon sources in addition to decreased post-diauxic lifespan.\nIn the fission yeast \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", deficiency of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 accelerates chronological aging.\nSeveral prokaryotic SOD null mutants have been generated, including \"E. coli\". The loss of periplasmic CuZnSOD causes loss of virulence and might be an attractive target for new antibiotics.\nRole in disease.\nMutations in the first SOD enzyme (SOD1) can cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a form of motor neuron disease). The most common mutation in the U.S. is A4V, while the most intensely studied is G93A. Inactivation of SOD1 causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Diminished SOD3 activity has been linked to lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Superoxide dismutase is not expressed in neural crest cells in the developing fetus. Hence, high levels of free radicals can cause damage to them and induce dysraphic anomalies (neural tube defects).\nMutations in SOD1 can cause familial ALS (several pieces of evidence also show that wild-type SOD1, under conditions of cellular stress, is implicated in a significant fraction of sporadic ALS cases, which represent 90% of ALS patients.), by a mechanism that is presently not understood, but not due to loss of enzymatic activity or a decrease in the conformational stability of the SOD1 protein. Overexpression of SOD1 has been linked to the neural disorders seen in Down syndrome. In patients with thalassemia, SOD will increase as a form of compensation mechanism. However, in the chronic stage, SOD does not seem to be sufficient and tends to decrease due to the destruction of proteins from the massive reaction of oxidant-antioxidant.\nIn mice, the extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3, ecSOD) contributes to the development of hypertension. Inactivation of SOD2 in mice causes perinatal lethality.\nMedical uses.\nSupplementary superoxide dimutase has been suggested as a treatment to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants who are born preterm, however, the effectiveness of his treatment is not clear.\nResearch.\nSOD has been used in experimental treatment of chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel conditions. SOD may ameliorate cis-platinum-induced nephrotoxicity (rodent studies). As \"Orgotein\" or \"ontosein\", a pharmacologically-active purified bovine liver SOD, it is also effective in the treatment of urinary tract inflammatory disease in man. For a time, bovine liver SOD even had regulatory approval in several European countries for such use. This was cut short by concerns about prion disease.\nAn SOD-mimetic agent, TEMPOL, is currently in clinical trials for radioprotection and to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis. TEMPOL and similar SOD-mimetic nitroxides exhibit a multiplicity of actions in diseases involving oxidative stress.\nThe synthesis of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase is initiated in plants with the activation of genes associated with stress conditions for plants. The most common stress conditions can be injury, drought or soil salinity. Limiting this process initiated by the conditions of strong soil salinity can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration.\nCosmetic uses.\nSOD may reduce free radical damage to skin\u2014for example, to reduce fibrosis following radiation for breast cancer. Studies of this kind must be regarded as tentative, however, as there were not adequate controls in the study including a lack of randomization, double-blinding, or placebo. Superoxide dismutase is known to reverse fibrosis, possibly through de-differentiation of myofibroblasts back to fibroblasts.\nCommercial sources.\nSOD is commercially obtained from marine phytoplankton, bovine liver, horseradish, cantaloupe, and certain bacteria. For therapeutic purpose, SOD is usually injected locally. There is no evidence that ingestion of unprotected SOD or SOD-rich foods can have any physiological effects, as all ingested SOD is broken down into amino acids before being absorbed. However, ingestion of SOD bound to wheat proteins could improve its therapeutic activity, at least in theory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like a set, it contains members (also called \"elements\", or \"terms\"). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the \"length\" of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function from natural numbers (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position. The notion of a sequence can be generalized to an indexed family, defined as a function from an \"arbitrary\" index set.\nFor example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter \"M\" first and \"Y\" last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be \"finite\", as in these examples, or \"infinite\", such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...).\nThe position of an element in a sequence is its \"rank\" or \"index\"; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. In mathematical analysis, a sequence is often denoted by letters in the form of formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3, where the subscript \"n\" refers to the \"n\"th element of the sequence; for example, the \"n\"th element of the Fibonacci sequence \"formula_4\" is generally denoted as \"formula_5\".\nIn computing and computer science, finite sequences are usually called \"strings\", \"words\" or \"lists,\" with the specific technical term chosen depending on the type of object the sequence enumerates and the different ways to represent the sequence in computer memory. Infinite sequences are called \"streams\".\nThe empty sequence\u00a0(\u00a0) is included in most notions of sequence. It may be excluded depending on the context.\nExamples and notation.\nA sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order. Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying functions, spaces, and other mathematical structures using the convergence properties of sequences. In particular, sequences are the basis for series, which are important in differential equations and analysis. Sequences are also of interest in their own right, and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of prime numbers.\nThere are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences. One way to specify a sequence is to list all its elements. For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7). This notation is used for infinite sequences as well. For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers is written as (1, 3, 5, 7, ...). Because notating sequences with ellipsis leads to ambiguity, listing is most useful for customary infinite sequences which can be easily recognized from their first few elements. Other ways of denoting a sequence are discussed after the examples.\nExamples.\nThe prime numbers are the natural numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors but 1 and themselves. Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...). The prime numbers are widely used in mathematics, particularly in number theory where many results related to them exist.\nThe Fibonacci numbers comprise the integer sequence in which each element is the sum of the previous two elements. The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).\nOther examples of sequences include those made up of rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers. The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...), for instance, approaches the number 1. In fact, every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers (e.g. via its decimal expansion, also see \"completeness of the real numbers\"). As another example, \u03c0 is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...), which is increasing. A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of \u03c0, that is, (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...). Unlike the preceding sequence, this sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by inspection.\nOther examples are sequences of functions, whose elements are functions instead of numbers.\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences comprises a large list of examples of integer sequences.\nIndexing.\nOther notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of \u03c0. One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the \"n\"th term as a function of \"n\", enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the set of values that \"n\" can take. For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as formula_6. The sequence of squares could be written as formula_7. The variable \"n\" is called an index, and the set of values that it can take is called the index set.\nIt is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as individual variables. This yields expressions like formula_8, which denotes a sequence whose \"n\"th element is given by the variable formula_1. For example:\nformula_10\nOne can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. formula_11 could be a different sequence than formula_8. One can even consider a sequence of sequences: formula_13 denotes a sequence whose \"m\"th term is the sequence formula_14.\nAn alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values. For example, the notation formula_15 denotes the ten-term sequence of squares formula_16. The limits formula_17 and formula_18 are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the supremum or infimum of such values, respectively. For example, the sequence formula_19 is the same as the sequence formula_8, and does not contain an additional term \"at infinity\". The sequence formula_21 is a bi-infinite sequence, and can also be written as formula_22.\nIn cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off. That is, one simply writes formula_23 for an arbitrary sequence. Often, the index \"k\" is understood to run from 1 to \u221e. However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in\nformula_24\nIn some cases, the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred. In these cases, the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements. For instance, the sequence of squares of odd numbers could be denoted in any of the following ways.\nMoreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the natural numbers. In the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence formula_30, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.\nDefining a sequence by recursion.\nSequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using recursion. This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.\nTo define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule, called \"recurrence relation\" to construct each element in terms of the ones before it. In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by successive applications of the recurrence relation.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a simple classical example, defined by the recurrence relation\nformula_31\nwith initial terms formula_32 and formula_33. From this, a simple computation shows that the first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.\nA complicated example of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation is Recam\u00e1n's sequence, defined by the recurrence relation\nformula_34\nwith initial term formula_35\nA \"linear recurrence with constant coefficients\" is a recurrence relation of the form\nformula_36\nwhere formula_37 are constants. There is a general method for expressing the general term formula_1 of such a sequence as a function of n; see Linear recurrence. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, one has formula_39 and the resulting function of n is given by Binet's formula.\nA holonomic sequence is a sequence defined by a recurrence relation of the form \nformula_40\nwhere formula_41 are polynomials in n. For most holonomic sequences, there is no explicit formula for expressing formula_1 as a function of n. Nevertheless, holonomic sequences play an important role in various areas of mathematics. For example, many special functions have a Taylor series whose sequence of coefficients is holonomic. The use of the recurrence relation allows a fast computation of values of such special functions.\nNot all sequences can be specified by a recurrence relation. An example is the sequence of prime numbers in their natural order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).\nFormal definition and basic properties.\nThere are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (\"e.g.\", exact sequence) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.\nDefinition.\nIn this article, a sequence is formally defined as a function whose domain is an interval of integers. This definition covers several different uses of the word \"sequence\", including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions of these kinds of sequences). However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of natural numbers. This narrower definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice. Another disadvantage is that, if one removes the first terms of a sequence, one needs reindexing the remainder terms for fitting this definition. In some contexts, to shorten exposition, the codomain of the sequence is fixed by context, for example by requiring it to be the set formula_43 of real numbers, the set formula_44 of complex numbers, or a topological space.\nAlthough sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, that is, \"an\" rather than \"a\"(\"n\"). There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the lowest input (often 1) is called the \"first element\" of the sequence, the value at the second smallest input (often 2) is called the \"second element\", etc. Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. \"f\", a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as formula_45, or just as formula_46 Here \"A\" is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.\nSequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces. An important generalization of sequences is the concept of nets. A net is a function from a (possibly uncountable) directed set to a topological space. The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.\nFinite and infinite.\nThe length of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.\nA sequence of a finite length is a finite sequence. A finite sequence of length \"n\" is also called an \"n\"-tuple. Finite sequences include the empty sequence, denoted (\u00a0), that has no elements.\nNormally, the term \"infinite sequence\" refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other; such a sequence has a first element, but no final element, and are called singly infinite sequence or a one-sided infinite sequence when disambiguation is needed. In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions\u2014i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element\u2014is called a bi-infinite sequence, two-way infinite sequence, or doubly infinite sequence. A function from formula_47 the set of \"all\" integers, into a set, for example the sequence of all even integers ( ..., \u22124, \u22122, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... ), is bi-infinite. This sequence could be denoted formula_48.\nIncreasing and decreasing.\nA sequence is said to be \"monotonically increasing\" if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it. For example, the sequence formula_49 is monotonically increasing if and only if formula_50 for all formula_51 If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (&gt;) the previous term then the sequence is called strictly monotonically increasing. A sequence is monotonically decreasing if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and is strictly monotonically decreasing if each is strictly less than the previous. If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a monotone sequence. This is a special case of the more general notion of a monotonic function.\nThe terms nondecreasing and nonincreasing are often used in place of \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" in order to avoid any possible confusion with \"strictly increasing\" and \"strictly decreasing\", respectively.\nBounded.\nIf the sequence of real numbers (\"an\") is such that all the terms are less than some real number \"M\", then the sequence is said to be bounded from above. In other words, this means that there exists \"M\" such that for all \"n\", \"an\" \u2264 \"M\". Any such \"M\" is called an \"upper bound\". Likewise, if, for some real \"m\", \"an\" \u2265 \"m\" for all \"n\" greater than some \"N\", then the sequence is bounded from below and any such \"m\" is called a \"lower bound\". If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be bounded.\nSubsequences.\nA subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...). The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted. However, the relative positions are preserved.\nFormally, a subsequence of the sequence formula_52 is any sequence of the form formula_53, where formula_54 is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.\nOther types of sequences.\nSome other types of sequences that are easy to define include:\nLimits and convergence.\nAn important property of a sequence is \"convergence\". If a sequence converges, it converges to a particular value known as the \"limit\". If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is convergent. A sequence that does not converge is divergent.\nInformally, a sequence has a limit if the elements of the sequence become closer and closer to some value formula_55 (called the limit of the sequence), and they become and remain \"arbitrarily\" close to formula_55, meaning that given a real number formula_57 greater than zero, all but a finite number of the elements of the sequence have a distance from formula_55 less than formula_57.\nFor example, the sequence formula_60 shown to the right converges to the value 0. On the other hand, the sequences formula_61 (which begins 1, 8, 27, ...) and formula_62 (which begins \u22121, 1, \u22121, 1, ...) are both divergent.\nIf a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique. This value is called the limit of the sequence. The limit of a convergent sequence formula_63 is normally denoted formula_64. If formula_63 is a divergent sequence, then the expression formula_64 is meaningless.\nFormal definition of convergence.\nA sequence of real numbers formula_63 converges to a real number formula_55 if, for all formula_69, there exists a natural number formula_70 such that for all formula_71 we have \nformula_72\nIf formula_63 is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that formula_74 denotes the complex modulus, i.e. formula_75. If formula_63 is a sequence of points in a metric space, then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression formula_77 is replaced by the expression formula_78, which denotes the distance between formula_1 and formula_55.\nApplications and important results.\nIf formula_63 and formula_82 are convergent sequences, then the following limits exist, and can be computed as follows:\nMoreover:\nCauchy sequences.\nA Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in metric spaces, and, in particular, in real analysis. One particularly important result in real analysis is \"Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences\":\nA sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.\nIn contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by formula_101 and formula_102 is Cauchy, but has no rational limit (cf. ). More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an irrational number is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.\nMetric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called complete metric spaces and are particularly nice for analysis.\nInfinite limits.\nIn calculus, it is common to define notation for sequences which do not converge in the sense discussed above, but which instead become and remain arbitrarily large, or become and remain arbitrarily negative. If formula_1 becomes arbitrarily large as formula_104, we write\nformula_105\nIn this case we say that the sequence diverges, or that it converges to infinity. An example of such a sequence is \"a\"\"n\" = \"n\".\nIf formula_1 becomes arbitrarily negative (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as formula_104, we write\nformula_108\nand say that the sequence diverges or converges to negative infinity.\nSeries.\nA series is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence. That is, it is an expression of the form formula_109 or formula_110, where formula_63 is a sequence of real or complex numbers. The partial sums of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the \"N\"th partial sum of the series formula_109 is the number\nformula_113\nThe partial sums themselves form a sequence formula_114, which is called the sequence of partial sums of the series formula_109. If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series formula_109 is convergent, and the limit formula_117 is called the value of the series. The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write formula_118.\nUse in other fields of mathematics.\nTopology.\nSequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of metric spaces. For instance:\nSequences can be generalized to nets or filters. These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.\nProduct topology.\nThe topological product of a sequence of topological spaces is the cartesian product of those spaces, equipped with a natural topology called the product topology.\nMore formally, given a sequence of spaces formula_119, the product space\nformula_120\nis defined as the set of all sequences formula_121 such that for each \"i\", formula_122 is an element of formula_123. The canonical projections are the maps \"pi\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Xi\" defined by the equation formula_124. Then the product topology on \"X\" is defined to be the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections \"pi\" are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.\nAnalysis.\nWhen discussing sequences in analysis, one will generally consider sequences of the form\nformula_125\nwhich is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by natural numbers.\nA sequence may start with an index different from 1 or 0. For example, the sequence defined by \"xn\" = 1/log(\"n\") would be defined only for \"n\" \u2265 2. When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices large enough, that is, greater than some given \"N\".\nThe most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of real or complex numbers. This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some vector space. In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often function spaces. Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some topological space.\nSequence spaces.\nA sequence space is a vector space whose elements are infinite sequences of real or complex numbers. Equivalently, it is a function space whose elements are functions from the natural numbers to the field \"K\", where \"K\" is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in \"K\", and can be turned into a vector space under the operations of pointwise addition of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are linear subspaces of this space. Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a norm, or at least the structure of a topological vector space.\nThe most important sequences spaces in analysis are the \u2113\"p\" spaces, consisting of the \"p\"-power summable sequences, with the \"p\"-norm. These are special cases of L\"p\" spaces for the counting measure on the set of natural numbers. Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or null sequences form sequence spaces, respectively denoted \"c\" and \"c\"0, with the sup norm. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence, under which it becomes a special kind of Fr\u00e9chet space called an FK-space.\nLinear algebra.\nSequences over a field may also be viewed as vectors in a vector space. Specifically, the set of \"F\"-valued sequences (where \"F\" is a field) is a function space (in fact, a product space) of \"F\"-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.\nAbstract algebra.\nAbstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.\nFree monoid.\nIf \"A\" is a set, the free monoid over \"A\" (denoted \"A\"*, also called Kleene star of \"A\") is a monoid containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of \"A\", with the binary operation of concatenation. The free semigroup \"A\"+ is the subsemigroup of \"A\"* containing all elements except the empty sequence.\nExact sequences.\nIn the context of group theory, a sequence\nformula_126\nof groups and group homomorphisms is called exact, if the image (or range) of each homomorphism is equal to the kernel of the next:\nformula_127\nThe sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.\nA similar definition can be made for certain other algebraic structures. For example, one could have an exact sequence of vector spaces and linear maps, or of modules and module homomorphisms.\nSpectral sequences.\nIn homological algebra and algebraic topology, a spectral sequence is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations. Spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences, and since their introduction by Jean Leray\u00a0(1946), they have become an important research tool, particularly in homotopy theory.\nSet theory.\nAn ordinal-indexed sequence is a generalization of a sequence. If \u03b1 is a limit ordinal and \"X\" is a set, an \u03b1-indexed sequence of elements of \"X\" is a function from \u03b1 to \"X\". In this terminology an \u03c9-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.\nComputing.\nIn computer science, finite sequences are called lists. Potentially infinite sequences are called streams. Finite sequences of characters or digits are called strings.\nStreams.\nInfinite sequences of digits (or characters) drawn from a finite alphabet are of particular interest in theoretical computer science. They are often referred to simply as \"sequences\" or \"streams\", as opposed to finite \"strings\". Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of bits (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}). The set \"C\" = {0, 1}\u221e of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the Cantor space.\nAn infinite binary sequence can represent a formal language (a set of strings) by setting the \"n\"\u2009th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the \"n\"\u2009th string (in shortlex order) is in the language. This representation is useful in the diagonalization method for proofs.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1976, he co-founded Apple Computer with his early business partner Steve Jobs. Through his work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution.\nIn 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple\u00a0I150 into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year. He was the primary designer of the Apple II, introduced in 1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers, while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply.\nWith human\u2013computer interface expert Jef Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident. After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first programmable universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued several other business and philanthropic ventures throughout his career, focusing largely on technology in K\u201312 schools, which involved a 1990 initiative to place computers in schools in the former Soviet Union.\nHe has received numerous awards and honors for his work in philanthropy and the tech industry, including an induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2000. As of June 2024, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since stepping down in 1985. In recent years, he has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial efforts dealing in areas such as GPS and telecommunications, flash memory, technology and pop culture conventions, technical education, ecology, satellites and more. In addition to his American citizenship, Wozniak is also a Polish and Serbian citizen.\nEarly life.\nStephen Gary Wozniak was born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California.181327 His mother, Margaret Louise Wozniak (n\u00e9e Kern) (1923\u20132014), was from Washington state, and his father, Francis Jacob \"Jerry\" Wozniak (1925\u20131994) of Michigan,18 was an engineer for the Lockheed Corporation.1 Wozniak graduated from Homestead High School in 1968, in Cupertino, California.25 Steve has one brother, Mark, a former tech executive who lives in Menlo Park. He also has one sister, Leslie, who attended Homestead High School in Cupertino. She is a grant adviser at Five Bridges Foundation, which helps at-risk youths in San Francisco. Leslie said it was her mother who introduced activism to her and her siblings.\nThe name on Wozniak's birth certificate is \"Stephan Gary Wozniak\", but his mother said that she intended it to be spelled \"Stephen\", which is what he uses.18 Wozniak is of Polish and German ancestry. In the early 1970s, Wozniak's blue box design earned him the nickname \"Berkeley Blue\" in the phreaking community. Wozniak has credited watching \"Star Trek\" and attending \"Star Trek\" conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his starting Apple Computer. In his autobiography, \"iWoz\", he also credits the Tom Swift Jr. books as an inspiration for becoming an engineer.\nCareer.\nPre-Apple.\nIn 1969, Wozniak returned to the San Francisco Bay Area after being expelled from the University of Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking the university's computer system. He re-enrolled at De Anza College in Cupertino before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971.1 In June of that year, for a self-taught engineering project, Wozniak designed and built his first computer with his friend Bill Fernandez.1 \nPredating useful microprocessors, screens, and keyboards, and using punch cards and only 20 TTL chips donated by an acquaintance, they named it \"Cream Soda\" after their favorite beverage. A newspaper reporter stepped on the power supply cable and blew up the computer, but it served Wozniak as \"a good prelude to my thinking 5 years later with the Apple I and Apple II computers\". Before focusing his attention on Apple, he was employed at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he designed calculators. It was during this time that he dropped out of Berkeley and befriended Steve Jobs.\nWozniak was introduced to Jobs by Fernandez, who attended Homestead High School with Jobs in 1971. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at HP, where Wozniak, too, was employed, working on a mainframe computer.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We first met in 1971 during my college years, while he was in high school. A friend said, 'you should meet Steve Jobs because he likes electronics, and he also plays pranks.' So he introduced us.\u2014\u200a\nTheir first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read an article titled \"Secrets of the Little Blue Box\" from the October 1971 issue of \"Esquire\", and started to build his own \"blue boxes\" that enabled one to make long-distance phone calls at no cost. Jobs, who handled the sales of the blue boxes, managed to sell some two hundred of them for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak. Jobs later told his biographer that if it had not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, \"there wouldn't have been an Apple.\"\nIn 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California. He was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game \"Breakout\". According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, Atari offered $100 () for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using RAM for the brick representation. Whilst a lack of scoring or coin mechanisms made Woz's prototype unusable, Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak's share was thus $350 (). Wozniak did not learn about the actual $5,000 bonus () until ten years later. While dismayed, he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.\nIn 1975, Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that would eventually make him famous, the Apple I. With the Apple I, Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto\u2013based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other custom Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.\nZaltair.\nWozniak also created the fictional computer Zaltair. Adam Schoolsky and Randy Wigginton helped him to pull it off at the West Coast Computer Conference. It was a parody of the Altair 8800 computer, which was very popular at the time. Steve Wozniak thought of the name because:The company Zilog had come out with a compatible processor, which they called the Z-80. A few companies using this chip were establishing brands based on Z words. Like ComputerZ or Z-Node or the like.As a joke, Wozniak decided to print \"20,000 brochures\" (according to YouTube video \"Rare video of Steve Wozniak from 1984 talking about computing, joining Apple and the Mac\" filmed at a Cleveland computer club meeting) of a fake product called the 'Zaltair' with a lot of \"superlative descriptions of a computer that solved every problem in the world\". It advertised, among other things, a new version of the BASIC programming language called \"BAZIC\", with the ability to \"define your own language... a feature we call perZonality\".\nTo help make the ad believable, he included fake trademarks and a shipping label for MITS, the company manufacturing the Altair. Wozniak did not think that this would be an issue, as he had \"made sure in advance that MITS would not be at the show.\" However, it later turned out that a representative from MITS was attending, and had been taking large amounts of their fake brochures. He also made sure the article had a fake quote from Ed Roberts, then president of MITS, which spelled out the name of a rival company, Processor Technology, when looking at the first letter of every word, further ensuring that the article was not traced back to him.\nSteve Jobs, Wozniak's close friend at the time, received a copy of the brochure. He fell for it, and even \"took pride that the Apple II stacked up well against the Zaltair in the comparison chart\". However, he, like many others, did not realize Wozniak had created the brochure until \"Woz gave him a framed copy of the brochure as a birthday gift\" in 1985.\nApple formation and success.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wozniak designed Apple's first products, the Apple I and II computers and he helped design the Macintosh \u2014 because he wanted to use them and they didn't exist.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Everything I did at Apple that was an A+ job and that took us places, I had two things in my favor\u00a0... I had no money [and] I had had no training.\u2014\u200a\nBy March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer. He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the computer. Wozniak originally offered the design to HP while working there, but was denied by the company on five occasions. Jobs then advised Wozniak to start a business of their own to build and sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandchildren that they had had their own company. To raise the money they needed to build the first batch of the circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator while Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.\nOn April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed the Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) along with administrative supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose participation in the new venture was short-lived. The two decided on the name \"Apple\" shortly after Jobs returned from Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent on an apple orchard there.\nAfter the company was formed, Jobs and Wozniak made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club to give a presentation of the fully assembled version of the Apple I. Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop in Mountain View, California, called the Byte Shop, saw the presentation and was impressed by the machine. Terrell told Jobs that he would order 50 units of the Apple I and pay $500 () each on delivery, but only if they came fully assembled, as he was not interested in buying bare printed circuit boards.7\nTogether the duo assembled the first boards in Jobs's parents' Los Altos home; initially in his bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in the garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and computer games that he had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\". They sold their first 50 system boards to Terrell later that year.\nIn November 1976, Jobs and Wozniak received substantial funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer named Mike Markkula.10 At the request of Markkula, Wozniak resigned from his job at HP and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's Apple I was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards. With expansion cards, the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in BASIC. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 CPU (MOS 6502) on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM, and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. Apple's first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and display\u2014all components that had to be provided by the user. Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.\nAfter the success of the Apple I, Wozniak designed the Apple II, the first personal computer with the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built in. Inspired by \"the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games\", Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a US$ chip, while colors in the PAL system are achieved by \"accident\" when a dot occurs on a line, and he says that to this day he has no idea how it works. During the design stage, Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak threatened that Jobs should \"go get himself another computer\", they decided to go with eight slots. Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the April 1977 West Coast Computer Faire. Wozniak's first article about the Apple II was in \"Byte\" magazine in May 1977. It became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers in the world. Wozniak also designed the Disk II floppy disk drive, released in 1978 specifically for use with the Apple II to replace the slower cassette tape storage.\nIn 1980, Apple went public to instant and significant financial profitability, making Jobs and Wozniak both millionaires. The Apple II's intended successor, the Apple III, released the same year, was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. According to Wozniak, the Apple III \"had 100 percent hardware failures\", and that the primary reason for these failures was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects.\nDuring the early design and development phase of the original Macintosh, Wozniak had a heavy influence over the project along with Jef Raskin, who conceived the computer. Later named the \"Macintosh 128k\", it would become the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. The Macintosh would also go on to introduce the desktop publishing industry with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that in 1981, \"Steve [Jobs] really took over the project when I had a plane crash and wasn't there.\"\nPlane crash and temporary leave from Apple.\nOn February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC which Wozniak was piloting (and not qualified to operate) crashed soon after takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The airplane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, broke through two fences, and crashed into an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers\u2014then-fianc\u00e9e Candice Clark, her brother Jack Clark, and Jack's girlfriend, Janet Valleau\u2014were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for the following five weeks from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember his name while in the hospital or the things he did for a time after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games were what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.\nWozniak did not immediately return to Apple after recovering from the airplane crash, seeing it as a good reason to leave. \"Infinite Loop\" characterized this time: \"Coming out of the semi-coma had been like flipping a reset switch in Woz's brain. It was as if in his thirty-year old body he had regained the mind he'd had at eighteen before all the computer madness had begun. And when that happened, Woz found he had little interest in engineering or design. Rather, in an odd sort of way, he wanted to start over fresh.\"\nUC Berkeley and US Festivals.\nLater in 1981, after recovering from the plane crash, Wozniak re-enrolled at UC Berkeley to complete his Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences degree that he started there in 1971 (and which he would finish in 1986). Because his name was well known at this point, he enrolled under the name Rocky Raccoon Clark, which is the name listed on his diploma, although he did not officially receive his degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences until 1987.\nIn May 1982 and 1983, Wozniak, with help from professional concert promoter Bill Graham, founded the company Unuson, an abbreviation of \"unite us in song\", which sponsored two US Festivals, with \"US\" pronounced like the pronoun, not as initials. Initially intended to celebrate evolving technologies, the festivals ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music, computers, television, and people. After losing several million dollars on the 1982 festival, Wozniak stated that unless the 1983 event turned a profit, he would end his involvement with rock festivals and get back to designing computers. Later that year, Wozniak returned to Apple product development, desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.\nReturn to Apple product development.\nStarting in the mid-1980s, as the Macintosh experienced slow but steady growth, Apple's corporate leadership, including Steve Jobs, increasingly disrespected its flagship cash cow Apple II series\u2014and Wozniak along with it. The Apple II division\u2014other than Wozniak\u2014was not invited to the Macintosh introduction event, and Wozniak was seen kicking the dirt in the parking lot. Although Apple II products provided about 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or its employees, a typical situation that frustrated Wozniak.\nFinal departure from Apple workforce.\nEven with the success he had helped to create at Apple, Wozniak believed that the company was hindering him from being who he wanted to be, and that it was \"the bane of his existence\". He enjoyed engineering, not management, and said that he missed \"the fun of the early days\". As other talented engineers joined the growing company, he no longer believed he was needed there. By early 1985, Wozniak left Apple again and sold most of his stock. Media coverage attributed his departure to disagreements with Apple management, quoting his statement that Apple had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\", but Wozniak later objected to this portrayal and stated that he left primarily because he was excited to start CL 9 and recapture the fun of developing a new technology.266\nThe Apple II platform financially carried the company well into the Macintosh era of the late 1980s; it was made semi-portable with the Apple IIc of 1984, and was extended, with some input from Wozniak, by the 16-bit Apple IIGS of 1986, and was discontinued altogether when the Apple IIe was discontinued on November 15, 1993 (although the Apple IIe card, which allowed compatible Macintosh computers to run Apple II software and use certain Apple II peripherals, was produced until May 1995).\nPost-Apple.\nAfter his career at Apple, Wozniak founded CL 9 in 1985, which developed and brought the first programmable universal remote control to market in 1987, called the \"CORE\". Beyond engineering, Wozniak's second lifelong goal had always been to teach elementary school because of the important role teachers play in students' lives. Eventually, he did teach computer classes to children from the fifth through ninth grades, and teachers as well. Unuson continued to support this, funding additional teachers and equipment.\nIn 2001, Wozniak founded Wheels of Zeus (WOZ) to create wireless GPS technology to \"help everyday people find everyday things much more easily\". In 2002, he joined the board of directors of Ripcord Networks, Inc., joining Apple alumni Ellen Hancock, Gil Amelio, Mike Connor, and Wheels of Zeus co-founder Alex Fielding in a new telecommunications venture. Later the same year he joined the board of directors of Danger, Inc., the maker of the Hip Top.\nIn 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak founded Acquicor Technology, a holding company for acquiring technology companies and developing them, with Apple alumni Hancock and Amelio. From 2009 through 2014 he was chief scientist at Fusion-io. In 2014 he became chief scientist at Primary Data, which was founded by some former Fusion-io executives. Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC) is an annual pop culture and technology convention at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. The convention was co-founded by Wozniak and Rick White, with Trip Hunter as CEO. Wozniak announced the annual event in 2015 along with Marvel legend Stan Lee. In October 2017, Wozniak founded Woz U, an online educational technology service for independent students and employees. As of December 2018, Woz U was licensed as a school with the Arizona state board.\nThough permanently leaving Apple as an active employee in 1985, Wozniak chose to never remove himself from the official employee list, and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews. Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role, estimated in 2006 to be US$ per year. He is also an Apple shareholder. He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs's death in October 2011. However, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close as they used to be. \nIn a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh \"failed\" under Steve Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He called the Apple Lisa group the team that had kicked Jobs out, and that Jobs liked to call the Lisa group \"idiots for making [the Lisa computer] too expensive\". To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was \"weak\", \"lousy\" and \"still at a fairly high price\". \"He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there\", says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley \"who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away\".\nAt the end of 2020, Wozniak announced the launch of a new company helmed by him, Efforce. Efforce is described as a marketplace for funding ecologically friendly projects. It used a WOZX cryptocurrency token for funding and blockchain to redistribute the profit to token holders and businesses engaged on the platform. In September 2021, it was reported that Wozniak was also starting a company alongside co-founder Alex Fielding named Privateer Space to address the problem of space debris. Privateer Space debuted the first version of its space traffic monitoring software on March 1, 2022. In 2024, Wozniak sued YouTube in respect to a scam that was being circulated on the platform using his likeness. Later, he won after a San Jose appeals court ruled YouTube was liable for failing to combat it.\nInventions.\nWozniak is listed as the sole inventor on the following Apple patents:\nOther.\nIn 1990, Wozniak helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, providing some of the organization's initial funding and serving on its founding Board of Directors. He is the founding sponsor of the Tech Museum, Silicon Valley Ballet and Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose.\nViews on artificial superintelligence.\nIn March 2015, Wozniak stated that he had originally dismissed Ray Kurzweil's opinion that machine intelligence would outpace human intelligence. But within several decades, Wozniak had changed his mind: { Wozniak stated that he had started to identify a contradictory sense of foreboding about artificial intelligence, while still supporting the advance of technology.\nBy June 2015, Wozniak changed his mind again, stating that a superintelligence takeover would be good for humans: {\nIn 2016, Wozniak changed his mind again, stating that he no longer worried about the possibility of superintelligence emerging because he is skeptical that computers will be able to compete with human \"intuition\": \"A computer could figure out a logical endpoint decision, but that's not the way intelligence works in humans\". Wozniak added that if computers do become superintelligent, \"they're going to be partners of humans over all other species just forever\". \nWozniak signed a 2023 from the Future of Life Institute calling for \"all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4\". In an interview to the BBC in May 2023 Wozniak said that AI may make scams more difficult to detect, noting that \"AI is so intelligent it's open to the bad players, the ones that want to trick you about who they are\".\nPersonal life.\nWozniak lives in Los Gatos, California. He applied for Australian citizenship in 2012, and has stated that he would like to live in Melbourne, Australia, in the future. Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname \"Woz\", or \"The Woz\"; he has also been called \"The Wonderful Wizard of Woz\" and \"The Second Steve\" (in regard to his early business partner and longtime friend, Steve Jobs). \"WoZ\" (short for \"Wheels of Zeus\") is the name of a company he founded in 2002; it closed in 2006.\nWozniak describes his impetus for joining the Freemasons in 1979 as being able to spend more time with his then-wife, Alice Robertson, who belonged to the Order of the Eastern Star, associated with the Masons. He was initiated in 1979 at Charity Lodge No. 362 in Campbell, California, now part of Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 292 in Los Gatos. Today he is no longer involved: \"I did become a Freemason and know what it's about but it doesn't really fit my tech/geek personality. Still, I can be polite to others from other walks of life. After our divorce was filed I never attended again but I did contribute enough for a lifetime membership.\"\nWozniak was married to slalom canoe gold-medalist Candice Clark from June 1981 to 1987. They have three children together, the youngest being born after their divorce was finalized. After a high-profile relationship with actress Kathy Griffin, who described him on \"Tom Green's House Tonight\" in 2008 as \"the biggest techno-nerd in the Universe\", Wozniak married Janet Hill, his current spouse. On his religious views, Wozniak has called himself an \"atheist or agnostic\".\nHe is a member of a Segway Polo team, the \"Silicon Valley Aftershocks\", and is considered a \"super fan\" of the NHL ice hockey team San Jose Sharks. In 1998, he co-authored with Larry Wilde \"The Official Computer Freaks Joke Book\". In 2006, he co-authored with Gina Smith his autobiography, \"iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It\". The book made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nWozniak has discussed his personal disdain for money and accumulating large amounts of wealth. He told \"Fortune\" magazine in 2017, \"I didn't want to be near money, because it could corrupt your values\u00a0... I really didn't want to be in that super 'more than you could ever need' category.\" He also said that he only invests in things \"close to his heart\". When Apple first went public in 1980, Wozniak offered $10\u00a0million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do. In 2017, Wozniak received a Polish citizenship and visited Poland to meet with government and technology industry representatives and to visit his father\u2019s [ancestral] hometown.\nHe has the condition prosopagnosia (face blindness). Wozniak has expressed support for the right to repair movement. In July 2021, he made a Cameo video in response to right to repair activist Louis Rossmann, in which he described the issue as something that has \"really affected me emotionally\", and credited Apple's early breakthroughs to open technology of the 1970s. In November 2023, Wozniak suffered a minor stroke while preparing to speak at a conference in Mexico City. He was hospitalized briefly before returning home. Wozniak became a Serbian citizen in December 2023. He said that he and his wife Janet, who is also getting a passport, will promote Serbia while living in the U.S.\nHonors and awards.\nBecause of his lifetime of achievements, multiple organizations have given Wozniak awards and recognition, including:\nHonorary degrees.\nFor his contributions to technology, Wozniak has been awarded a number of Honorary Doctoral degrees, which include the following:\nIn media.\nWozniak has been mentioned, represented, and interviewed numerous times in media from the founding of Apple to the present.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many of their neighbours were, like them, speakers of West Germanic dialects, including both the Franks and Thuringians to the south, and the coastal Frisians and Angles to the north who were among the peoples who were originally referred to as \"Saxons\" in the context of early raiding and settlements in Roman Britain and Gaul. To their east were Obotrites and other Slavic-speaking peoples.\nThe political history of these continental Saxons is unclear until the 8th century and the conflict between their semi-legendary hero Widukind and the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. They do not appear to have been politically united until the generations of conflict leading up to that defeat, before which they were reportedly ruled by regional \"satraps\". Previous Frankish rulers of Austrasia, both Merovingian and Carolingian, fought numerous campaigns against Saxons, both in the west near the Lippe, Ems and Weser, and further east, near Thuringia and Bohemia, including the area which later medieval sources referred to as \"North Swabia\". Charlemagne conquered all the Saxons after winning the long Saxon Wars (772\u2013804 AD) and forced them to convert to Christianity, annexing Saxony into the Carolingian domain. Under the Carolingian Franks, Saxony became a single duchy, fitting it within the basic political structure of the later Holy Roman Empire. The early rulers of this Duchy of Saxony expanded their territories\u2014and therefore those of the Holy Roman Empire\u2014to the east, at the expense of Slavic-speaking Wends. \nLong before any clear historical mention of Saxony as a state, the name \"Saxons\" was also used to refer to coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from north of the Rhine, in a similar sense to the much later term \"Viking\". These early raiders and settlers included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, and the term Saxon was not at that time a term for any specific tribe. \nEarlier still, there is a single possible classical reference to a smaller and much earlier Saxon tribe in the second century AD, but the interpretation of this text (\"Axones\" in most surviving manuscripts) is disputed. For historians who accept this record, the original Saxon tribe lived north of the mouth of the Elbe, close to the probable homeland of the Angles, in the part of later Saxony which came to be known later as Nordalbingia.\nToday the Saxons of Germany no longer form a distinctive ethnic group or country, but their name lives on in the names of several regions and states of Germany, including Lower Saxony () which includes most of the original duchy. Their language evolved into Low German which was the \"lingua franca\" of the Hanseatic League, but has faced a long and gradual decline since the Late Medieval period as a literary, administrative and, to a significant extent, cultural language in favor of Dutch and German.\nTerminology.\nThe name of the Saxons has traditionally been said to derive from a kind of knife used in this period and called a in Old English and in Old High German. The term \"Saxon\" was first definitely used in written records to describe coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from regions north of the Rhine using boats. At this time, the term had a similar sense to the much later term \"Viking\". These early raiders and settlers called Saxons included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, whose countries stretched from what is now the Netherlands to what is now Denmark, and included coastal parts of the territory which came to be called Saxony. It has been proposed that these coastal Saxons, who were strongly associated with the Anglo-Saxons of England, should be seen as distinct from the later Saxons of Carolingian times, although they were referred to by the same name, and were clearly related peoples. This has been compared to the later evolution of modern European terms referring to the \"Dutch people\" of the Netherlands, and the \"Deutschen\", or Germans, of neighbouring Germany. \nSignificant numbers of these early Saxons settled within the empire, in what later became northern France and England. England, rather than Saxony, was sometimes written of as the Saxon homeland. To avoid confusion, later writers in the 8th century such as Bede and the author of the \"Ravenna Cosmography\" referred to the Saxons of Saxony in Germany as the \"old Saxons\", and their country as \"old Saxony\", and this differentiation is still often used by historians today when discussing this period. In contrast, the settlers once called Saxons in England became part of a new Old English-speaking nation, now commonly referred to as the Anglo-Saxons, or simply \"the English\". This brought together local Romano-British populations, Saxons, and other migrants from the same North Sea region, including Frisians, Jutes, and Angles. The Angles are the source of the term \"English\" which became the more commonly used collective term. The term \"Anglo-Saxon\", combining the names of the Angles and the Saxons, also came into use by the 8th century, initially in the work of Paul the Deacon, to distinguish the Germanic-speaking inhabitants of Britain from continental Saxons. However, both the Saxons of Britain and those of Old Saxony in northern Germany long continued to be referred to as \"Saxons\" in an indiscriminate manner.\nPossible mention in Ptolemy (2nd century AD).\nPtolemy's \"Geographia\", written in the 2nd century, is sometimes considered to contain the first mention of the Saxons. Some copies of this text mention a tribe called \"Saxones\" in the area just to the north of the lower Elbe, and there were also three islands north of the Elbe's mouth which were called the Saxon islands. However, other versions refer to the same tribe as \"Axones\". Some scholars such as Mathias Springer have proposed that this may be a misspelling of the tribe that Tacitus in his \"Germania\" called \"Aviones\". According to this theory, \"Saxones\" was the result of later scribes trying to correct a name that meant nothing to them. On the other hand, Sch\u00fctte, in his analysis of such problems in \"Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe\", believed that \"Saxones\" is correct. He notes that the loss of first letters occurs in numerous places in various copies of Ptolemy's work, and also that the manuscripts without \"Saxones\" are generally inferior overall. According to Liccardo \"Even though the reference is found in a section of the \"Geographia\" difficult to interpret, the scholarly consensus considers this passage to be genuine\". \nFor the majority of scholars who accept the existence of Saxons in Ptolemy, their reappearance as a much more important and widespread people in third century records is nonetheless remarkable.\nSaxon raiders (3rd and 4th centuries).\nThe first clear and undisputed contemporary uses of the Saxon name come from the 4th century, but some of these refer to events in the 3rd century. After Ptolemy, the next oldest mention of the Saxons is the \"Laterculus Veronensis\" from about 314 AD, which mentions the Saxons in a list of barbarian peoples who had come under the power of the empire at different points in time. Within this list they are clearly distinguished from neighbouring groups including the Chamavi and Franci. In contrast, the term Saxon does not appear in any of the 3rd century Latin panegyrics.\nEutropius, a 4th century Roman historian, claimed that Saxon and Frankish raiders had attacked the North Sea coast near Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 285, when Carausius was posted there to defend against them. However, it is very likely that Saxon was a new term he was using anachronistically. The \"Panegyrici Latini\", which were written soon after those events, instead mention Franks, Chamavi and Frisians, but not Saxons, indicating that these and possibly others entered the Rhine and Scheldt deltas within the empire and held control of it for decades. The panegyrics seem to imply that the Chamavi and Frisians were types of Franks at this time, rather than Saxons. The area was brought under Roman governance by Constantius Chlorus, who settled many of the conquered in underpopulated parts of Gaul. Constantius also defeated the rebel Carausius in Britain, and his Roman forces are said to have slaughtered barbarian mercenaries there and \"those who lately imitated the barbarian in their mode of dress and flowing red hair\". \nIt is not clear when the Roman military structure known as the ('Saxon Shore') was first built or referred to with this name. It was composed of nine forts stretching around the south-eastern corner of England. On the other side of the English Channel two coastal military commands were created, over the \"Tractus Armoricanus\" in what is now Brittany and Normandy, and the coast of Belgica Secunda in what later became Flanders and Picardy. The \"Notitia Dignitatum\" of about 400 shows that it existed by that time and also lists the existence of a Saxon military unit (an \"Ala\") in the Roman military, which was stationed in what is now Lebanon and northern Israel. This already existed by 363 when Julian used them in Arabia against the Persian empire. Roman military accessories are found in northern Germany in the 4th and 5th centuries apparently indicating the return of soldiers who had served the empire. \nBefore becoming emperor himself Julian the Apostate mentioned the Saxons in a speech as close allies of the rebel emperor Magnentius in 350. Julian described the Saxons and Franks as kinsmen of Magnentius, living \"beyond the Rhine and on the shores of the western sea\". In 357/8 Julian apparently came into conflict with Saxons when he campaigned in the Rhine regions against Alemanni, Franks, and Saxons. The late 5th century historian Zosimus reported the involvement of the Saxons, \"who exceed all the barbarians in those regions, in courage, strength and hardiness\". They sent out, according to Zosimus, the \"Quadi\", a part of the Saxons, against the Roman lands but they were blocked by the Franks who resided near them. These \"Quadi\" therefore used boats to get around the Franks, and made it to Batavia (Betuwe) in the Rhine delta. Scholars generally believe the name \"Quadi\" to be a mistake, perhaps by a copyist. Based upon other more contemporary reports of these campaigns it appears he was referring to the Chamavi, who were however normally listed as Franks. This implies that the term \"Saxon\" was probably not a clear ethnic distinction at this time, but perhaps rather designated groups who attacked by boat. \nSeveral more records mentioning 4th century Saxons can be dated:\nIn many cases the Saxons were associated with using boats for their raids, although the first mentions also involve attacks within the Rhine-Maas delta region. Special mentions of the fearful 4th-century Saxon coastal surprise attacks were made not only by Ammianus, but also by the poet Claudian.\n5th century.\nIn the 5th century, many records link Saxons with Britain and Gaul, although a rough description of the homeland of these Saxons was given by Hilarion who says the Frankish homeland lay between the Saxons and Alemanni, placing them therefore north of the Franks. It is likely that the term Saxon was still mainly being used to describe northern raiders in general, and not a specific people. Writing in the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century, Procopius describes only three large nations living in \"Brittia\", Angles, Frisians, and Britons, and he does not mention Saxons at all. The reputation for shocking coastal raids continued. In the late 5th century a dramatic description of Saxon raiding was written by Sidonius Apollinaris writing to a friend who was assigned to a coastal defensive post in Saintonge near Bordeaux.\nEarly in this period it is believed that Roman general Stilicho campaigned in Britain and northern Gaul and reorganized the defences against the Saxons. Later in his career a series of crises in Italy, Gaul, Iberia and North Africa meant that military resources were not available for Britain. According to the \"Chronica Gallica of 452\", which was probably written in present day southern France, Britain was ravaged by Saxon invaders in 409 or 410. The Romano-British citizens reportedly expelled their Roman officials during this period and never again re-joined the Roman Empire. Procopius states that after the overthrow of Constantine III in 411, \"the Romans never succeeded in recovering Britain, but it remained from that time under tyrants.\"\nIn 441\u2013442, Saxons are mentioned in the \"Chronica Gallica of 452\" which says that the \"British provinces, which to this time had suffered various defeats and misfortunes, are reduced to Saxon rule\". 6th-century British historian Gildas apparently knew of these same events from his grandparents' generation. According to Gildas a Saxon force based in the east of Britain (Bede writing in the 8th century believed they were based on the Isle of Thanet) were invited as \"foederati\" to Britain, in order to help defend against raids by Picts and Scots. They revolted over their pay and plundered the whole country, initiating a long war which the Romano-British eventually won. However, Britain was divided into corrupt \"tyrannies\". There are very few records of the period, but by the time of Bede most of England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.\nIn what is now France, during the 460s, an apparent fragment of a chronicle preserved in the \"History of the Franks\" of Gregory of Tours, gives a confusing report about a number of battles involving one \"Adovacrius\", who led a group of Saxons based upon islands somewhere near the Loire. He took hostages at Anger in France, but his force was subsequently retaken by Roman and Frankish forces led by Childeric I, a Frank. A \"great war was waged between the Saxons and the Romans but the Saxons, turning their backs, with the Romans pursuing, lost many of their men to the sword. Their islands were captured and ravaged by the Franks, many people being killed.\" Though there is no consensus, many historians believe that this Adovacrius may be the same person as Odoacer, the future king of Italy, who is mentioned in the same part of Gregory's text as a person who subsequently allied with Childeric to fight Alemanni in Italy.\nMerovingian period.\nIn comparison to mentions of the early Saxons raiders and settlers in Britain or Gaul, there are few mentions of the Saxons in Germany before the 8th century. Interpretation of the records is also complicated not only by the continuing references to the other Saxons, but also because the Saxons living in present day Germany probably weren't originally unified within one Saxon political entity. It is therefore not clear whether some early continental \"Saxons\" could also sometimes have come under other designations such as Warini, Frisians or Thuringians. Nevertheless some records during Merovingian times are clearly about Saxons living within what is now Northern Germany, north of the Franks.\nThere were also Saxon populations in this period who were living in neither England, nor what would become Saxony. \nThe Saxons and the Arnulfings.\nThe continental Saxons appear to have become consolidated by the end of the eighth century, partly as a result of interaction with the powerful Frankish kingdoms. The ancestors of Charlemagne, the Arnulfings, took control of the neighbouring Austrasian kingdom of the Franks and sought to assert power over the peoples to the east including not only the Bavarians, Swabians and Thuringians, which were long under Frankish rule, but also the Saxons and Frisians. They also pressured the Saxons and Frisians to convert to Christianity. In 804 the emperor Charlemagne conquered the Saxons, and incorporated the Saxons into the Frankish empire as a Stem Duchy, similar to the older ones although there is no evidence that it had previously been a single kingdom. The Duchy of Saxony (804\u20131296) covered Westphalia, Eastphalia, Angria and Nordalbingia, which is roughly equivalent to Holstein, the southern part of modern-day Schleswig-Holstein state, now bordering on Denmark.\nCharlemagne's Saxon Wars.\nThe Saxons were conquered by Charlemagne after a long series of annual campaigns, the Saxon Wars (772\u2013804). With defeat came enforced baptism and conversion as well as the union of the Saxons with the rest of the Frankish empire. Their sacred tree or pillar, a symbol of Irminsul, was destroyed. Charlemagne deported 10,000 Nordalbingian Saxons to Neustria and gave their largely vacant lands in Wagria (approximately modern Pl\u00f6n and Ostholstein districts) to the loyal king of the Abotrites. Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, says on the closing of this grand conflict:\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the king; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\nThe Saxons long resisted becoming Christians and being incorporated into the orbit of the Frankish kingdom. In 776 the Saxons promised to convert to Christianity and vow loyalty to the king, but, during Charlemagne's campaign in Hispania (778), the Saxons advanced to Deutz on the Rhine and plundered along the river. This was an oft-repeated pattern when Charlemagne was distracted by other matters. A couple hundred years after the Charlemagne's conversion wars, Christianized Saxons joined the People's Crusade, with some possibly traveling through the Rhineland and an attested Saxon-Bohemian regiment dispersed by the Kingdom of Hungary around 1096.\nThe Duchy of Saxony.\nUnder Carolingian rule, the Saxons were reduced to tributary status. There is evidence that the Saxons, as well as Slavic tributaries such as the Abodrites and the Wends, often provided troops to their Carolingian overlords. The dukes of Saxony became kings (Henry I, the Fowler, 919) and later the first emperors (Henry's son, Otto I, the Great) of Germany during the tenth century, but they lost this position in 1024. The duchy was divided in 1180 when Duke Henry the Lion refused to follow his cousin, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, into war in Lombardy.\nDuring the High Middle Ages, under the Salian emperors and, later, under the Teutonic Knights, German settlers moved east of the Saale into the area of a western Slavic tribe, the Sorbs. The Sorbs were gradually Germanised. This region subsequently acquired the name Saxony through political circumstances, though it was initially called the March of Meissen. The rulers of Meissen acquired control of the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg (only a remnant of the previous Duchy) in 1423; they eventually applied the name \"Saxony\" to the whole of their kingdom. Since then, this part of eastern Germany has been referred to as Saxony (), a source of some misunderstanding about the original homeland of the Saxons, with a central part in the present-day German state of Lower Saxony ().\nLanguage.\nOld English, associated with the Saxons in England, was closer to later recorded dialects of Old Frisian than the Old Saxon language. Old Frisian apparently once stretched along the North Sea coast from the northern Netherlands to southern Denmark, while Old Saxon originally didn't extend to the coast. Linguists have noted that Old Frisian and Old Saxon, although neighbouring and related, did not form part of the same dialect continuum. In contrast, the Saxon dialects became part of the much larger Continental West Germanic continuum. \nAccording to the historical linguist Elmar Seebold, this development can only be explained if continental Saxon society prior to the migration to Britain was effectively composed of two related, but different forms of West Germanic. In his view, the group of people who, in the 3rd century, first migrated southwards to what is now the northwestern portion of Lower Saxony spoke North Sea Germanic dialects closely related to Old Frisian and Old English. There, these migrants encountered an already present population whose language was significantly different from their own, i.e. belonging to the Weser\u2013Rhine Germanic grouping, over whom they then formed an elite, lending their name to the subsequent tribal federation and region as a whole. Later, during the 5th century, as the Angles started migrating to Britain, the descendants of this elite joined them, while the descendants of the native inhabitants did not, or at least not significantly. As the languages of the Angles and this particular Saxon group were closely related, a continuum between Anglian and Saxon could form in Britain, which later became English. In the land of the Saxons itself, the departure of a large part of this former elite caused the sociopolitical landscape to change, and the original population, after the departure of the majority of the elite's descendants, became so predominant that their dialects (presumably the language of the Chauci, the language of the Thuringians, and possibly other ancient tribes) prevailed and ultimately formed the basis for the Low Saxon dialects known today, while their speakers retained the tribal name.\nCulture.\nSocial structure.\nBede, a Northumbrian writing around the year 730, remarks that \"the old (that is, the continental) Saxons have no king, but they are governed by several satraps who, during war, cast lots for leadership but who, in time of peace, are equal in power.\" The was divided into three provinces\u00a0\u2013 Westphalia, Eastphalia and Angria\u00a0\u2013 which comprised about one hundred \"pagi\" or \"Gaue\". Each \"Gau\" had its own satrap with enough military power to level whole villages that opposed him.\nIn the mid-9th century, Nithard first described the social structure of the Saxons beneath their leaders. The caste structure was rigid; in the Saxon language the three castes, excluding slaves, were called the (related to the term \"aetheling\"), and . These terms were subsequently Latinised as or ; , or ; and , or . According to very early traditions that are presumed to contain a good deal of historical truth, the were the descendants of the Saxons who led the tribe out of Holstein and during the migrations of the sixth century. They were a conquering warrior elite. The ' represented the descendants of the , and of that caste. The represented the descendants of the original inhabitants of the conquered territories, who were forced to make oaths of submission and pay tribute to the '.\nThe \"Lex Saxonum\" regulated the Saxons' different society. Intermarriage between the castes was forbidden by the Lex Saxonum, and wergilds were set based upon caste membership. The ' were worth 1,440 solidi, or about 700 head of cattle, the highest wergild on the continent; the price of a bride was also very high. This was six times as much as that of the ' and eight times as much as the \"\". The gulf between noble and ignoble was very large, but the difference between a freeman and an indentured labourer was small.\nAccording to the , an important source for early Saxon history, the Saxons held an annual council at Marklo (Westphalia) where they \"confirmed their laws, gave judgment on outstanding cases, and determined by common counsel whether they would go to war or be in peace that year.\" All three castes participated in the general council; twelve representatives from each caste were sent from each \"Gau\". In 782, Charlemagne abolished the system of \"Gaue\" and replaced it with the , the system of counties typical of Francia. By prohibiting the Marklo councils, Charlemagne pushed the ' and ' out of political power. The old Saxon system of , lordship based on dues and taxes, was replaced by a form of feudalism based on service and labour, personal relationships and oaths.\nReligion.\nGermanic religion.\nSaxon religious practices were closely related to their political practices. The annual councils of the entire tribe began with invocations of the gods. The procedure by which dukes were elected in wartime, by drawing lots, is presumed to have had religious significance, i.e. in giving trust to divine providence\u00a0\u2013 it seems\u00a0\u2013 to guide the random decision-making. There were also sacred rituals and objects, such as the pillars called Irminsul; these were believed to connect heaven and earth, as with other examples of trees or ladders to heaven in numerous religions. Charlemagne had one such pillar chopped down in 772 close to the Eresburg stronghold.\nEarly Saxon religious practices in Britain can be gleaned from place names and the Germanic calendar in use at that time. The Germanic gods Woden, Frigg, Tiw, and Thunor, who are attested to in every Germanic tradition, were worshipped in Wessex, Sussex and Essex. They are the only ones directly attested to, though the names of the third and fourth months (March and April) of the Old English calendar bear the names and , meaning 'month of Hretha' and 'month of \u0112ostre'. It is presumed that these are the names of two goddesses who were worshipped around that season. The Saxons offered cakes to their gods in February (). There was a religious festival associated with the harvest, ('holy month' or 'month of offerings', September). The Saxon calendar began on 25 December, and the months of December and January were called Yule (or ). They contained a or 'night of the mothers', another religious festival of unknown content.\nThe Saxon freemen and servile class remained faithful to their original beliefs long after their nominal conversion to Christianity. Nursing a hatred of the upper class, which, with Frankish assistance, had marginalised them from political power, the lower classes (the or ) were a problem for Christian authorities as late as 836. The remarks on their obstinacy in pagan ('usage and superstition').\nChristianity.\nThe conversion of the Saxons in England from their original Germanic religion to Christianity occurred in the early to late seventh century under the influence of the already converted Jutes of Kent. In the 630s, Birinus became the \"apostle to the West Saxons\" and converted Wessex, whose first Christian king was Cynegils. The West Saxons begin to emerge from obscurity only with their conversion to Christianity and keeping written records. The Gewisse, a West Saxon people, were especially resistant to Christianity; Birinus exercised more efforts against them and ultimately succeeded in conversion. In Wessex, a bishopric was founded at Dorchester. The South Saxons were first evangelised extensively under Anglian influence; Aethelwalh of Sussex was converted by Wulfhere, King of Mercia and allowed Wilfrid, Bishop of York, to evangelise his people beginning in 681. The chief South Saxon bishopric was that of Selsey. The East Saxons were more pagan than the southern or western Saxons; their territory had a superabundance of pagan sites. Their king, Saeberht, was converted early and a diocese was established at London. Its first bishop, Mellitus, was expelled by Saeberht's heirs. The conversion of the East Saxons was completed under Cedd in the 650s and 660s.\nThe continental Saxons were evangelised largely by English missionaries in the late seventh and early eighth centuries. Around 695, two early English missionaries, Hewald the White and Hewald the Black, were martyred by the , that is, villagers. Throughout the century that followed, villagers and other peasants proved to be the greatest opponents of Christianisation, while missionaries often received the support of the \" and other noblemen. Saint Lebuin, an Englishman who between 745 and 770 preached to the Saxons, mainly in the eastern Netherlands, built a church and made many friends among the nobility. Some of them rallied to save him from an angry mob at the annual council at Marklo (near river Weser, Bremen). Social tensions arose between the Christianity-sympathetic noblemen and the pagan lower castes, who were staunchly faithful to their traditional religion.\nUnder Charlemagne, the Saxon Wars had as their chief object the conversion and integration of the Saxons into the Frankish empire. Though much of the highest caste converted readily, forced baptisms and forced tithing made enemies of the lower orders. Even some contemporaries found the methods employed to win over the Saxons wanting, as this excerpt from a letter of Alcuin of York to his friend Meginfrid, written in 796, shows:\nIf the light yoke and sweet burden of Christ were to be preached to the most obstinate people of the Saxons with as much determination as the payment of tithes has been exacted, or as the force of the legal decree has been applied for fault of the most trifling sort imaginable, perhaps they would not be averse to their baptismal vows.\nCharlemagne's successor, Louis the Pious, reportedly treated the Saxons more as Alcuin would have wished, and as a consequence they were faithful subjects. The lower classes, however, revolted against Frankish overlordship in favour of their old paganism as late as the 840s, when the rose up against the Saxon leadership, who were allied with the Frankish emperor Lothair I. After the suppression of the \", in 851 Louis the German brought relics from Rome to Saxony to foster a devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. The Poeta Saxo, in his verse of Charlemagne's reign (written between 888 and 891), laid an emphasis on his conquest of Saxony. He celebrated the Frankish monarch as on par with the Roman emperors and as the bringer of Christian salvation to people. References are made to periodic outbreaks of pagan worship, especially of Freya, among the Saxon peasantry as late as the 12th century.\nChristian literature.\nIn the ninth century, the Saxon nobility became vigorous supporters of monasticism and formed a bulwark of Christianity against the existing Slavic paganism to the east and the Nordic paganism of the Vikings to the north. Much Christian literature was produced in the vernacular Old Saxon, the notable ones being a result of the literary output and wide influence of Saxon monasteries such as Fulda, Corvey and Verden; and the theological controversy between the Augustinian, Gottschalk and Rabanus Maurus.\nFrom an early date, Charlemagne and Louis the Pious supported Christian vernacular works in order to evangelise the Saxons more efficiently. The \"Heliand\", a verse epic of the life of Christ in a Germanic setting, and \"Genesis\", another epic retelling of the events of the first book of the Bible, were commissioned in the early ninth century by Louis to disseminate scriptural knowledge to the masses. A council of Tours in 813 and then a synod of Mainz in 848 both declared that homilies ought to be preached in the vernacular. The earliest preserved text in the Saxon language is a baptismal vow from the late eighth or early ninth century; the vernacular was used extensively in an effort to Christianise the lowest castes of Saxon society.\nSaxon as a demonym.\nCeltic languages.\nIn the hypothetical insular Celtic languages grouping, the words designating English nationality may derive from the Latin word . \n (older spellings: Sassanich or Sassenagh) is a loanword in English from the Scottish Gaelic term , originally used by Gaels for both the English and the Scots language speaking lowlanders of Scotland. In the 20th century, Scots\u2013English tended to use it as a disparaging or jocular term for an English person.\n, the Irish word for an Englishman (with meaning England), has the same derivation, as do the words used in Welsh to describe the English people (, singular ) and the language and things English in general: and .\nCornish terms the English , from the same derivation. In the 16th century Cornish-speakers used the phrase to feign ignorance of the English language. The Cornish words for the English people and England are and ('Land [Pays] of Saxons'). Similarly Breton, spoken in north-western France, has ('English'), ('the English language'), and for 'England'.\nRomance languages.\nThe label \"Saxons\" (in ) also became attached to German settlers who settled during the 12th century in southeastern Transylvania.\nFrom Transylvania, some of these Saxons migrated to neighbouring Moldavia, as the name of the town Sascut, in present-day Romania, shows.\nNon-Indo-European languages.\nThe Finns and Estonians have changed their usage of the root \"Saxon\" over the centuries to apply now to the whole country of Germany ( and respectively) and the Germans ( and , respectively). The Finnish word (scissors) reflects the name of the old Saxon single-edged sword\u2009\u2013\u2009seax\u2009\u2013\u2009from which the name \"Saxon\" supposedly derives. In Estonian, means colloquially, 'a wealthy person'. As a result of the Northern Crusades, Estonia's upper class comprised mostly Baltic Germans, persons of supposedly Saxon origin until well into the 20th century.\nSaxony as a later toponym.\nFollowing the downfall of Henry the Lion (1129\u20131195, Duke of Saxony 1142\u20131180), and the subsequent splitting of the Saxon tribal duchy into several territories, the name of the Saxon duchy was transferred to the lands of the Ascanian family. This led to the differentiation between Lower Saxony (lands settled by the Saxon tribe) and Upper Saxony (the lands belonging to the House of Wettin). Gradually, the latter region became known as Saxony, ultimately usurping the name's original geographical meaning. The area formerly known as Upper Saxony now lies in Central Germany \u2013 in the eastern part of the present-day Federal Republic of Germany: note the names of the federal states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In sufficiently small nanoparticles, magnetization can randomly flip direction under the influence of temperature. The typical time between two flips is called the N\u00e9el relaxation time. In the absence of an external magnetic field, when the time used to measure the magnetization of the nanoparticles is much longer than the N\u00e9el relaxation time, their magnetization appears to be on average zero; they are said to be in the superparamagnetic state. In this state, an external magnetic field is able to magnetize the nanoparticles, similarly to a paramagnet. However, their magnetic susceptibility is much larger than that of paramagnets.\nN\u00e9el relaxation in the absence of magnetic field.\nNormally, any ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material undergoes a transition to a paramagnetic state above its Curie temperature. Superparamagnetism is different from this standard transition since it occurs below the Curie temperature of the material.\nSuperparamagnetism occurs in nanoparticles which are single-domain, i.e. composed of a single magnetic domain. This is possible when their diameter is below 3\u201350\u00a0nm, depending on the materials. In this condition, it is considered that the magnetization of the nanoparticles is a single giant magnetic moment, sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle. Those in the field of superparamagnetism call this \"macro-spin approximation\".\nBecause of the nanoparticle's magnetic anisotropy, the magnetic moment has usually only two stable orientations antiparallel to each other, separated by an energy barrier. The stable orientations define the nanoparticle's so called \"easy axis\". At finite temperature, there is a finite probability for the magnetization to flip and reverse its direction. The mean time between two flips is called the N\u00e9el relaxation time formula_1 and is given by the following N\u00e9el\u2013Arrhenius equation:\n formula_2,\nwhere:\nThis length of time can be anywhere from a few nanoseconds to years or much longer. In particular, it can be seen that the N\u00e9el relaxation time is an exponential function of the grain volume, which explains why the flipping probability becomes rapidly negligible for bulk materials or large nanoparticles.\nBlocking temperature.\nLet us imagine that the magnetization of a single superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured and let us define formula_5 as the measurement time. If formula_6, the nanoparticle magnetization will flip several times during the measurement, then the measured magnetization will average to zero. If formula_7, the magnetization will not flip during the measurement, so the measured magnetization will be what the instantaneous magnetization was at the beginning of the measurement. In the former case, the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will appear to be \u201cblocked\u201d in its initial state.\nThe state of the nanoparticle (superparamagnetic or blocked) depends on the measurement time. A transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state occurs when formula_8. In several experiments, the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied, so the transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state is seen as a function of the temperature. The temperature for which formula_8 is called the \"blocking temperature\":\nformula_10\nFor typical laboratory measurements, the value of the logarithm in the previous equation is in the order of 20\u201325.\nEquivalently, blocking temperature is the temperature below which a material shows slow relaxation of magnetization.\nEffect of a magnetic field.\nWhen an external magnetic field \"H\" is applied to an assembly of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, their magnetic moments tend to align along the applied field, leading to a net magnetization. The magnetization curve of the assembly, i.e. the magnetization as a function of the applied field, is a reversible S-shaped increasing function. This function is quite complicated but for some simple cases:\nIn the above equations:\nThe initial slope of the formula_16 function is the magnetic susceptibility of the sample formula_17:\n formula_18\nThe latter susceptibility is also valid for all temperatures formula_19 if the easy axes of the nanoparticles are randomly oriented.\nIt can be seen from these equations that large nanoparticles have a larger \"\u03bc\" and so a larger susceptibility. This explains why superparamagnetic nanoparticles have a much larger susceptibility than standard paramagnets: they behave exactly as a paramagnet with a huge magnetic moment.\nTime dependence of the magnetization.\nThere is no time-dependence of the magnetization when the nanoparticles are either completely blocked (formula_20) or completely superparamagnetic (formula_21). There is, however, a narrow window around formula_22 where the measurement time and the relaxation time have comparable magnitude. In this case, a frequency-dependence of the susceptibility can be observed. For a randomly oriented sample, the complex susceptibility is:\n formula_23\nwhere\nFrom this frequency-dependent susceptibility, the time-dependence of the magnetization for low-fields can be derived:\nformula_28\nMeasurements.\nA superparamagnetic system can be measured with AC susceptibility measurements, where an applied magnetic field varies in time, and the magnetic response of the system is measured. A superparamagnetic system will show a characteristic frequency dependence: When the frequency is much higher than 1/\u03c4N, there will be a different magnetic response than when the frequency is much lower than 1/\u03c4N, since in the latter case, but not the former, the ferromagnetic clusters will have time to respond to the field by flipping their magnetization. The precise dependence can be calculated from the N\u00e9el\u2013Arrhenius equation, assuming that the neighboring clusters behave independently of one another (if clusters interact, their behavior becomes more complicated). It is also possible to perform magneto-optical AC susceptibility measurements with magneto-optically active superparamagnetic materials such as iron oxide nanoparticles in the visible wavelength range.\nEffect on hard drives.\nSuperparamagnetism sets a limit on the storage density of hard disk drives due to the minimum size of particles that can be used. This limit on areal-density is known as the superparamagnetic limit.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In particular, every continuous function on a separable space whose image is a subset of a Hausdorff space is determined by its values on the countable dense subset.\nContrast separability with the related notion of second countability, which is in general stronger but equivalent on the class of metrizable spaces.\nFirst examples.\nAny topological space that is itself finite or countably infinite is separable, for the whole space is a countable dense subset of itself. An important example of an uncountable separable space is the real line, in which the rational numbers form a countable dense subset. Similarly the set of all length-formula_2 vectors of rational numbers, formula_3, is a countable dense subset of the set of all length-formula_2 vectors of real numbers, formula_5; so for every formula_2, formula_2-dimensional Euclidean space is separable.\nA simple example of a space that is not separable is a discrete space of uncountable cardinality.\nFurther examples are given below.\nSeparability versus second countability.\nAny second-countable space is separable: if formula_8 is a countable base, choosing any formula_9 from the non-empty formula_10 gives a countable dense subset. Conversely, a metrizable space is separable if and only if it is second countable, which is the case if and only if it is Lindel\u00f6f.\nTo further compare these two properties:\nWe can construct an example of a separable topological space that is not second countable. Consider any uncountable set formula_11, pick some formula_12, and define the topology to be the collection of all sets that contain formula_13 (or are empty). Then, the closure of formula_14 is the whole space (formula_11 is the smallest closed set containing formula_13), but every set of the form formula_17 is open. Therefore, the space is separable but there cannot have a countable base.\nCardinality.\nThe property of separability does not in and of itself give any limitations on the cardinality of a topological space: any set endowed with the trivial topology is separable, as well as second countable, quasi-compact, and connected. The \"trouble\" with the trivial topology is its poor separation properties: its Kolmogorov quotient is the one-point space.\nA first-countable, separable Hausdorff space (in particular, a separable metric space) has at most the continuum cardinality formula_18. In such a space, closure is determined by limits of sequences and any convergent sequence has at most one limit, so there is a surjective map from the set of convergent sequences with values in the countable dense subset to the points of formula_11.\nA separable Hausdorff space has cardinality at most formula_20, where formula_18 is the cardinality of the continuum. For this closure is characterized in terms of limits of filter bases: if formula_22 and formula_23, then formula_24 if and only if there exists a filter base formula_25 consisting of subsets of formula_26 that converges to formula_27. The cardinality of the set formula_28 of such filter bases is at most formula_29. Moreover, in a Hausdorff space, there is at most one limit to every filter base. Therefore, there is a surjection formula_30 when formula_31\nThe same arguments establish a more general result: suppose that a Hausdorff topological space formula_11 contains a dense subset of cardinality formula_33.\nThen formula_11 has cardinality at most formula_35 and cardinality at most formula_36 if it is first countable.\nThe product of at most continuum many separable spaces is a separable space . In particular the space formula_37 of all functions from the real line to itself, endowed with the product topology, is a separable Hausdorff space of cardinality formula_20. More generally, if formula_33 is any infinite cardinal, then a product of at most formula_40 spaces with dense subsets of size at most formula_33 has itself a dense subset of size at most formula_33 (Hewitt\u2013Marczewski\u2013Pondiczery theorem).\nConstructive mathematics.\nSeparability is especially important in numerical analysis and constructive mathematics, since many theorems that can be proved for nonseparable spaces have constructive proofs only for separable spaces. Such constructive proofs can be turned into algorithms for use in numerical analysis, and they are the only sorts of proofs acceptable in constructive analysis. A famous example of a theorem of this sort is the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\nProperties.\nEmbedding separable metric spaces.\n\"For nonseparable spaces\":\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat in a closed box may be considered to be simultaneously both alive and dead while it is unobserved, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This experiment, viewed this way, is described as a paradox. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1935 in a discussion with Albert Einstein to illustrate what Schr\u00f6dinger saw as the problems of Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg's philosophical views on quantum mechanics.\nIn Schr\u00f6dinger's original formulation, a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal radiation monitor such as a Geiger counter detects radioactivity (a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. If no decaying atom triggers the monitor, the cat remains alive. Mathematically, the wave function that describes the contents of the box is a combination, or quantum superposition, of these two possibilities. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat \"either\" alive \"or\" dead, not both alive \"and\" dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality resolves into one possibility or the other.\nAlthough originally a critique of Bohr and Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger's seemingly paradoxical thought experiment became part of the foundation of quantum mechanics. It is often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly in situations involving the measurement problem. As a result, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat has had enduring appeal in popular culture. The experiment is not intended to be actually performed on a cat, but rather as an easily understandable illustration of the behavior of atoms. Experiments at the atomic scale have been carried out, showing that very small objects may exist as superpositions, but superposing an object as large as a cat would pose considerable technical difficulties.\nFundamentally, the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment asks how long quantum superpositions last and when (or \"whether\") they collapse. Different interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different explanations for this process.\nOrigin and motivation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nHow does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence, give rise to the reality we perceive? Another way of stating this question regards the measurement problem: What constitutes a \"measurement\" that apparently causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state?\nMore unsolved problems in physics\nSchr\u00f6dinger intended his thought experiment as a discussion of the EPR article\u2014named after its authors Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\u2014in 1935. The EPR article highlighted the counterintuitive nature of quantum superpositions, in which a quantum system for two particles does not separate even when the particles are detected far from their last point of contact. The EPR paper concludes with a claim that this lack of separability meant that quantum mechanics as a theory of reality was incomplete. \nSchr\u00f6dinger and Einstein exchanged letters about Einstein's EPR article, in the course of which Einstein pointed out that the state of an unstable keg of gunpowder will, after a while, contain a superposition of both exploded and unexploded states.\nTo further illustrate, Schr\u00f6dinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schr\u00f6dinger, the position taken by Bohr and Heisenberg would be that \"the cat remains both alive and dead\" until the state has been observed. Schr\u00f6dinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics, thus employing reductio ad absurdum.\nSince Schr\u00f6dinger's time, various interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been advanced by physicists, some of which regard the \"alive and dead\" cat superposition as quite real, while others do not. Intended as a critique of ideas prevalent in 1935, the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment remains a touchstone for modern interpretations of quantum mechanics and can be used to illustrate and compare their strengths and weaknesses.\nThought experiment.\nSchr\u00f6dinger wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne can contrive even completely burlesque [farcical] cases. A cat is put in a steel chamber along with the following infernal device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter, there is a tiny amount of radioactive substance, so tiny that in the course of an hour one of the atoms will perhaps decay, but also, with equal probability, that none of them will; if it does happen, the counter tube will discharge and through a relay release a hammer that will shatter a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would tell oneself that the cat is still alive if no atom has decayed in the meantime. Even a single atomic decay would have poisoned it. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or spread out in equal parts.\nIt is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain turns into a sensually observable [macroscopic] indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. This prevents us from so na\u00efvely accepting a \"blurred model\" as representative of reality. Per se, it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks.\nSchr\u00f6dinger developed his famous thought experiment in correspondence with Einstein. He suggested this 'quite ridiculous case' to illustrate his conclusion that the wave function cannot represent reality.153 \nThe wave function description of the complete cat system implies that the reality of the cat mixes the living and dead cat. Einstein was impressed by the ability of the thought experiment to highlight these issues. In a letter to Schr\u00f6dinger dated 1950, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You are the only contemporary physicist, besides Laue, who sees that one cannot get around the assumption of reality, if only one is honest. Most of them simply do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality\u2014reality as something independent of what is experimentally established. Their interpretation is, however, refuted most elegantly by your system of radioactive atom + amplifier + charge of gun powder + cat in a box, in which the psi-function of the system contains both the cat alive and blown to bits. Nobody really doubts that the presence or absence of the cat is something independent of the act of observation.\nNote that the charge of gunpowder is not mentioned in Schr\u00f6dinger's setup, which uses a Geiger counter as an amplifier and hydrocyanic poison instead of gunpowder. The gunpowder had been mentioned in Einstein's original suggestion to Schr\u00f6dinger 15 years before, and Einstein carried it forward to the present discussion.\nAnalysis.\nIn modern terms Schr\u00f6dinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.1269 \nThe experiment poses the question, \"\"when\" does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?\" (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox. Our intuition says that the cat cannot be in more than one state simultaneously\u2014yet the quantum mechanical description of the thought experiment requires such a condition.\nInterpretations.\nSince Schr\u00f6dinger's time, other interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different answers to the questions posed by Schr\u00f6dinger's cat of how long superpositions last and when (or \"whether\") they collapse.\nCopenhagen interpretation.\nA commonly held interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen interpretation. In the Copenhagen interpretation, a measurement results in only one state of a superposition. This thought experiment makes apparent the fact that this interpretation simply provides no explanation for the state of the cat while the box is closed. The wavefunction description of the system consists of a superposition of the states \"decayed nucleus/dead cat\" and \"undecayed nucleus/living cat\". Only when the box is opened and observed can we make a statement about the cat.\nRole of consciousness.\nIn 1932, John von Neumann described in his book \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\" a pattern where the radioactive source is observed by a device, which itself is observed by another device and so on. It makes no difference in the predictions of quantum theory where along this chain of causal effects the superposition collapses. This potentially infinite chain could be broken if the last device is replaced by a conscious observer. This solved the problem because it was claimed that an individual's consciousness cannot be multiple. Eugene Wigner asserted that an observer is necessary for a collapse to one or the other (e.g., either a live cat or a dead cat) of the terms on the right-hand side of a wave function. Wigner discussed the interpretation in a thought experiment known as Wigner's friend.\nWigner supposed that a friend opened the box and observed the cat without telling anyone. From Wigner's conscious perspective, the friend is now part of the wave function and has seen a live cat and seen a dead cat. To a third person's conscious perspective, Wigner himself becomes part of the wave function once Wigner learns the outcome from the friend. This could be extended indefinitely.\nA resolution of the paradox is that the triggering of the Geiger counter counts as a measurement of the state of the radioactive substance. Because a measurement has already occurred deciding the state of the cat, the subsequent observation by a human records only what has already occurred. Analysis of an actual experiment by Roger Carpenter and A. J. Anderson found that measurement alone (for example by a Geiger counter) is sufficient to collapse a quantum wave function before any human knows of the result. The apparatus indicates one of two colors depending on the outcome. The human observer sees which color is indicated, but they don't consciously know which outcome the color represents. A second human, the one who set up the apparatus, is told of the color and becomes conscious of the outcome, and the box is opened to check if the outcome matches. However, it is disputed whether merely observing the color counts as a conscious observation of the outcome.\nBohr's interpretation.\nAnalysis of the work of Niels Bohr, one of the main scientists associated with the Copenhagen interpretation, suggests he viewed the state of the cat before the box is opened as indeterminate. The superposition itself had no physical meaning to Bohr: Schr\u00f6dinger's cat would be either dead or alive long before the box is opened but the cat and box form an inseparable combination. \nBohr saw no role for a human observer.\nBohr emphasized the classical nature of measurement results.\nAn \"irreversible\" or effectively irreversible process imparts the classical behavior of \"observation\" or \"measurement\".\nMany-worlds interpretation.\nIn 1957, Hugh Everett formulated the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which does not single out observation as a special process. In the many-worlds interpretation, both alive and dead states of the cat persist after the box is opened, but are decoherent from each other. In other words, when the box is opened, the observer and the possibly-dead cat split into an observer looking at a box with a dead cat and an observer looking at a box with a live cat. But since the dead and alive states are decoherent, there is no communication or interaction between them.\nWhen opening the box, the observer becomes entangled with the cat, so \"observer states\" corresponding to the cat's being alive and dead are formed; each observer state is entangled, or linked, with the cat so that the observation of the cat's state and the cat's state correspond with each other. Quantum decoherence ensures that the different outcomes have no interaction with each other. Decoherence is generally considered to prevent simultaneous observation of multiple states.\nA variant of the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment, known as the quantum suicide machine, has been proposed by cosmologist Max Tegmark. It examines the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment from the point of view of the cat, and argues that by using this approach, one may be able to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation and many-worlds.\nEnsemble interpretation.\nIn Ensemble interpretations, superpositions are sub-ensembles of a larger statistical ensemble. The state vector would not apply to individual cat experiments, but only to the statistics of many similarly prepared cat experiments. Proponents of these interpretations argue that this makes the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat paradox a trivial matter, or a non-issue. When the physicist opens the box, they simply discover which subensemble that specific cat belonged to.\nRelational interpretation.\nThe relational interpretation makes no fundamental distinction between the human experimenter, the cat, and the apparatus or between animate and inanimate systems; all are quantum systems governed by the same rules of wavefunction evolution, and all may be considered \"observers\". But the relational interpretation allows that different observers can give different accounts of the same series of events, depending on the information they have about the system. The cat can be considered an observer of the apparatus; meanwhile, the experimenter can be considered another observer of the system in the box (the cat plus the apparatus). Before the box is opened, the cat, by nature of its being alive or dead, has information about the state of the apparatus (the atom has either decayed or not decayed); but the experimenter does not have information about the state of the box contents. In this way, the two observers simultaneously have different accounts of the situation: To the cat, the wavefunction of the apparatus has appeared to \"collapse\"; to the experimenter, the contents of the box appear to be in superposition. Not until the box is opened, and both observers have the same information about what happened, do both system states appear to \"collapse\" into the same definite result, a cat that is either alive or dead.\nTransactional interpretation.\nIn the transactional interpretation the apparatus emits an advanced wave backward in time, which combined with the wave that the source emits forward in time, forms a standing wave. The waves are seen as physically real, and the apparatus is considered an \"observer\". In the transactional interpretation, the collapse of the wavefunction is \"atemporal\" and occurs along the whole transaction between the source and the apparatus. The cat is never in superposition. Rather the cat is only in one state at any particular time, regardless of when the human experimenter looks in the box. The transactional interpretation resolves this quantum paradox.\nObjective collapse theories.\nAccording to objective collapse theories, superpositions are destroyed spontaneously (irrespective of external observation) when some objective physical threshold (of time, mass, temperature, irreversibility, etc.) is reached. Thus, the cat would be expected to have settled into a definite state long before the box is opened. This could loosely be phrased as \"the cat observes itself\" or \"the environment observes the cat\".\nObjective collapse theories require a modification of standard quantum mechanics to allow superpositions to be destroyed by the process of time evolution. These theories could ideally be tested by creating mesoscopic superposition states in the experiment. For instance, energy cat states have been proposed as a precise detector of the quantum gravity related energy decoherence models.\nApplications and tests.\nThe experiment as described is a purely theoretical one, and the machine proposed is not known to have been constructed. However, successful experiments involving similar principles, e.g. superpositions of relatively large (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed. These experiments do not show that a cat-sized object can be superposed, but the known upper limit on \"cat states\" has been pushed upwards by them. In many cases the state is short-lived, even when cooled to near absolute zero.\nIn quantum computing the phrase \"cat state\" sometimes refers to the GHZ state, wherein several qubits are in an equal superposition of all being 0 and all being 1; e.g.,\nformula_1\nAccording to at least one proposal, it may be possible to determine the state of the cat \"before\" observing it.\nIn popular culture.\nAccording to historian of science Robert P. Crease, Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment did not become widely known until the 1970s. In 1972 Ursula K. Le Guin learned about it while reading about quantum mechanics for her novel The Dispossessed; Crease credits her 1974 short story \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat\" with bringing the concept into popular culture. Other science-fiction writers soon picked it up, often using it in a humorous vein. Works of fiction have employed Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment as plot device and as metaphor, in genres from apocalyptic science fiction to young-adult drama, making the cat more prominent in popular culture than in physics itself.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat has been a motive in many science fiction works, and used as a title of a number of them, including Greg Bear's \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Plague\" (\"Analog\", 29 March 1982), George Alec Effinger's \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Kitten\" (\"Omni\", September 1988), F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre's \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat-Sitter\" (\"Analog\", July/August 2001), Rudy Rucker's \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat\" (\"Analog\", 30 March 1981), and Robert Anton Wilson's \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat Trilogy\" (1988), illustrating various interpretations of quantum physics. In addition to novels and short stories, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat has appeared in film, poetry theatre, live-action television, cartoons, music, and webcomics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In solid geometry, a sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance \"r\" from a given point in three-dimensional space. That given point is the \"center\" of the sphere, and the distance \"r\" is the sphere's \"radius\". The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians.\nThe sphere is a fundamental surface in many fields of mathematics. Spheres and nearly-spherical shapes also appear in nature and industry. Bubbles such as soap bubbles take a spherical shape in equilibrium. The Earth is often approximated as a sphere in geography, and the celestial sphere is an important concept in astronomy. Manufactured items including pressure vessels and most curved mirrors and lenses are based on spheres. Spheres roll smoothly in any direction, so most balls used in sports and toys are spherical, as are ball bearings.\nBasic terminology.\nAs mentioned earlier \"r\" is the sphere's radius; any line from the center to a point on the sphere is also called a radius. 'Radius' is used in two senses: as a line segment and also as its length.\nIf a radius is extended through the center to the opposite side of the sphere, it creates a diameter. Like the radius, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter, and denoted \"d\". Diameters are the longest line segments that can be drawn between two points on the sphere: their length is twice the radius, \"d\" = 2\"r\". Two points on the sphere connected by a diameter are antipodal points of each other.\nA unit sphere is a sphere with unit radius (\"r\" = 1). For convenience, spheres are often taken to have their center at the origin of the coordinate system, and spheres in this article have their center at the origin unless a center is mentioned.\nA \"great circle\" on the sphere has the same center and radius as the sphere, and divides it into two equal hemispheres.\nAlthough the figure of Earth is not perfectly spherical, terms borrowed from geography are convenient to apply to the sphere.\nA particular line passing through its center defines an \"axis\" (as in Earth's axis of rotation).\nThe sphere-axis intersection defines two antipodal \"poles\" (\"north pole\" and \"south pole\"). The great circle equidistant to the poles is called the \"equator\". Great circles through the poles are called lines of longitude or \"meridians\". Small circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are circles of latitude (or \"parallels\"). In geometry unrelated to astronomical bodies, geocentric terminology should be used only for illustration and noted as such, unless there is no chance of misunderstanding.\nMathematicians consider a sphere to be a two-dimensional closed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. They draw a distinction between a \"sphere\" and a \"ball\", which is a solid figure, a three-dimensional manifold with boundary that includes the volume contained by the sphere. An \"open ball\" excludes the sphere itself, while a \"closed ball\" includes the sphere: a closed ball is the union of the open ball and the sphere, and a sphere is the boundary of a (closed or open) ball. The distinction between \"ball\" and \"sphere\" has not always been maintained and especially older mathematical references talk about a sphere as a solid. The distinction between \"circle\" and \"disk\" in the plane is similar.\nSmall spheres or balls are sometimes called \"spherules\" (e.g., in Martian spherules).\nEquations.\nIn analytic geometry, a sphere with center (\"x\"0, \"y\"0, \"z\"0) and radius r is the locus of all points (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") such that\nformula_1\nSince it can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial, a sphere is a quadric surface, a type of algebraic surface.\nLet a, b, c, d, e be real numbers with \"a\" \u2260 0 and put\nformula_2\nThen the equation\nformula_3\nhas no real points as solutions if formula_4 and is called the equation of an imaginary sphere. If formula_5, the only solution of formula_6 is the point formula_7 and the equation is said to be the equation of a point sphere. Finally, in the case formula_8, formula_6 is an equation of a sphere whose center is formula_10 and whose radius is formula_11.\nIf a in the above equation is zero then \"f\"(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") = 0 is the equation of a plane. Thus, a plane may be thought of as a sphere of infinite radius whose center is a point at infinity.\nParametric.\nA parametric equation for the sphere with radius formula_12 and center formula_13 can be parameterized using trigonometric functions.\nformula_14\nThe symbols used here are the same as those used in spherical coordinates. r is constant, while \u03b8 varies from 0 to \u03c0 and formula_15 varies from 0 to 2\u03c0.\nProperties.\nEnclosed volume.\nIn three dimensions, the volume inside a sphere (that is, the volume of a ball, but classically referred to as the volume of a sphere) is\nformula_16\nwhere r is the radius and d is the diameter of the sphere. Archimedes first derived this formula (\"On the Sphere and Cylinder\" c. 225 BCE) by showing that the volume inside a sphere is twice the volume between the sphere and the circumscribed cylinder of that sphere (having the height and diameter equal to the diameter of the sphere). This may be proved by inscribing a cone upside down into semi-sphere, noting that the area of a cross section of the cone plus the area of a cross section of the sphere is the same as the area of the cross section of the circumscribing cylinder, and applying Cavalieri's principle. This formula can also be derived using integral calculus (i.e., disk integration) to sum the volumes of an infinite number of circular disks of infinitesimally small thickness stacked side by side and centered along the x-axis from \"x\" = \u2212\"r\" to \"x\" = \"r\", assuming the sphere of radius r is centered at the origin.\nFor most practical purposes, the volume inside a sphere inscribed in a cube can be approximated as 52.4% of the volume of the cube, since \"V\" = \"d\"3, where d is the diameter of the sphere and also the length of a side of the cube and \u00a0\u2248\u00a00.5236. For example, a sphere with diameter 1\u00a0m has 52.4% the volume of a cube with edge length 1m, or about 0.524\u00a0m3.\nSurface area.\nThe surface area of a sphere of radius r is:\nformula_17\nArchimedes first derived this formula from the fact that the projection to the lateral surface of a circumscribed cylinder is area-preserving. Another approach to obtaining the formula comes from the fact that it equals the derivative of the formula for the volume with respect to r because the total volume inside a sphere of radius r can be thought of as the summation of the surface area of an infinite number of spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness concentrically stacked inside one another from radius 0 to radius r. At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius r is simply the product of the surface area at radius r and the infinitesimal thickness.\nThe sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. The sphere therefore appears in nature: for example, bubbles and small water drops are roughly spherical because the surface tension locally minimizes surface area.\nThe surface area relative to the mass of a ball is called the specific surface area and can be expressed from the above stated equations as\nformula_18\nwhere \u03c1 is the density (the ratio of mass to volume).\nOther geometric properties.\nA sphere can be constructed as the surface formed by rotating a circle one half revolution about any of its diameters; this is very similar to the traditional definition of a sphere as given in Euclid's Elements. Since a circle is a special type of ellipse, a sphere is a special type of ellipsoid of revolution. Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its major axis, the shape becomes a prolate spheroid; rotated about the minor axis, an oblate spheroid.\nA sphere is uniquely determined by four points that are not coplanar. More generally, a sphere is uniquely determined by four conditions such as passing through a point, being tangent to a plane, etc. This property is analogous to the property that three non-collinear points determine a unique circle in a plane.\nConsequently, a sphere is uniquely determined by (that is, passes through) a circle and a point not in the plane of that circle.\nBy examining the common solutions of the equations of two spheres, it can be seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the radical plane of the intersecting spheres. Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no real point in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).\nThe angle between two spheres at a real point of intersection is the dihedral angle determined by the tangent planes to the spheres at that point. Two spheres intersect at the same angle at all points of their circle of intersection. They intersect at right angles (are orthogonal) if and only if the square of the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of the squares of their radii.\nPencil of spheres.\nIf \"f\"(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") = 0 and \"g\"(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") = 0 are the equations of two distinct spheres then\nformula_19\nis also the equation of a sphere for arbitrary values of the parameters s and t. The set of all spheres satisfying this equation is called a pencil of spheres determined by the original two spheres. In this definition a sphere is allowed to be a plane (infinite radius, center at infinity) and if both the original spheres are planes then all the spheres of the pencil are planes, otherwise there is only one plane (the radical plane) in the pencil.\nProperties of the sphere.\nIn their book \"Geometry and the Imagination\", David Hilbert and Stephan Cohn-Vossen describe eleven properties of the sphere and discuss whether these properties uniquely determine the sphere. Several properties hold for the plane, which can be thought of as a sphere with infinite radius. These properties are:\nTreatment by area of mathematics.\nSpherical geometry.\nThe basic elements of Euclidean plane geometry are points and lines. On the sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The analogue of the \"line\" is the geodesic, which is a great circle; the defining characteristic of a great circle is that the plane containing all its points also passes through the center of the sphere. Measuring by arc length shows that the shortest path between two points lying on the sphere is the shorter segment of the great circle that includes the points.\nMany theorems from classical geometry hold true for spherical geometry as well, but not all do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's postulates, including the parallel postulate. In spherical trigonometry, angles are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle always exceeds 180\u00a0degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.\nAny pair of points on a sphere that lie on a straight line through the sphere's center (i.e., the diameter) are called \"antipodal points\"\u00a0\u2013 on the sphere, the distance between them is exactly half the length of the circumference. Any other (i.e., not antipodal) pair of distinct points on a sphere\nSpherical geometry is a form of elliptic geometry, which together with hyperbolic geometry makes up non-Euclidean geometry.\nDifferential geometry.\nThe sphere is a smooth surface with constant Gaussian curvature at each point equal to 1/\"r\"2. As per Gauss's Theorema Egregium, this curvature is independent of the sphere's embedding in 3-dimensional space. Also following from Gauss, a sphere cannot be mapped to a plane while maintaining both areas and angles. Therefore, any map projection introduces some form of distortion.\nA sphere of radius r has area element formula_20. This can be found from the volume element in spherical coordinates with r held constant.\nA sphere of any radius centered at zero is an integral surface of the following differential form:\nformula_21\nThis equation reflects that the position vector and tangent plane at a point are always orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, the outward-facing normal vector is equal to the position vector scaled by 1/r.\nIn Riemannian geometry, the filling area conjecture states that the hemisphere is the optimal (least area) isometric filling of the Riemannian circle.\nTopology.\nRemarkably, it is possible to turn an ordinary sphere inside out in a three-dimensional space with possible self-intersections but without creating any creases, in a process called sphere eversion.\nThe antipodal quotient of the sphere is the surface called the real projective plane, which can also be thought of as the Northern Hemisphere with antipodal points of the equator identified.\nCurves on a sphere.\nCircles.\nCircles on the sphere are, like circles in the plane, made up of all points a certain distance from a fixed point on the sphere. The intersection of a sphere and a plane is a circle, a point, or empty. Great circles are the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing through the center of a sphere: others are called small circles.\nMore complicated surfaces may intersect a sphere in circles, too: the intersection of a sphere with a surface of revolution whose axis contains the center of the sphere (are \"coaxial\") consists of circles and/or points if not empty. For example, the diagram to the right shows the intersection of a sphere and a cylinder, which consists of two circles. If the cylinder radius were that of the sphere, the intersection would be a single circle. If the cylinder radius were larger than that of the sphere, the intersection would be empty.\nLoxodrome.\nIn navigation, a \"loxodrome\" or \"rhumb line\" is a path whose bearing, the angle between its tangent and due North, is constant. Loxodromes project to straight lines under the Mercator projection. Two special cases are the meridians which are aligned directly North\u2013South and parallels which are aligned directly East\u2013West. For any other bearing, a loxodrome spirals infinitely around each pole. For the Earth modeled as a sphere, or for a general sphere given a spherical coordinate system, such a loxodrome is a kind of spherical spiral.\nClelia curves.\nAnother kind of spherical spiral is the Clelia curve, for which the longitude (or azimuth) formula_15 and the colatitude (or polar angle) formula_23 are in a linear relationship, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Clelia curves project to straight lines under the equirectangular projection. Viviani's curve (&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;) is a special case. Clelia curves approximate the ground track of satellites in polar orbit.\nSpherical conics.\nThe analog of a conic section on the sphere is a spherical conic, a quartic curve which can be defined in several equivalent ways.\nMany theorems relating to planar conic sections also extend to spherical conics.\nIntersection of a sphere with a more general surface.\nIf a sphere is intersected by another surface, there may be more complicated spherical curves.\nThe intersection of the sphere with equation formula_24 and the cylinder with equation formula_25 is not just one or two circles. It is the solution of the non-linear system of equations\nformula_26\nformula_27\nGeneralizations.\nEllipsoids.\nAn ellipsoid is a sphere that has been stretched or compressed in one or more directions. More exactly, it is the image of a sphere under an affine transformation. An ellipsoid bears the same relationship to the sphere that an ellipse does to a circle.\nDimensionality.\nSpheres can be generalized to spaces of any number of dimensions. For any natural number n, an \"n-sphere,\" often denoted \"S\"\u200d\"n\", is the set of points in (\"n\" + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space that are at a fixed distance r from a central point of that space, where r is, as before, a positive real number. In particular:\nSpheres for \"n\" &gt; 2 are sometimes called hyperspheres.\nThe n-sphere of unit radius centered at the origin is denoted \"S\"\u200d\"n\" and is often referred to as \"the\" n-sphere. The ordinary sphere is a 2-sphere, because it is a 2-dimensional surface which is embedded in 3-dimensional space.\nIn topology, the n-sphere is an example of a compact topological manifold without boundary. A topological sphere need not be smooth; if it is smooth, it need not be diffeomorphic to the Euclidean sphere (an exotic sphere).\nThe sphere is the inverse image of a one-point set under the continuous function , so it is closed; \"Sn\" is also bounded, so it is compact by the Heine\u2013Borel theorem.\nMetric spaces.\nMore generally, in a metric space (\"E\",\"d\"), the sphere of center x and radius \"r\" &gt; 0 is the set of points y such that \"d\"(\"x\",\"y\") = \"r\".\nIf the center is a distinguished point that is considered to be the origin of E, as in a normed space, it is not mentioned in the definition and notation. The same applies for the radius if it is taken to equal one, as in the case of a unit sphere.\nUnlike a ball, even a large sphere may be an empty set. For example, in Z\"n\" with Euclidean metric, a sphere of radius \"r\" is nonempty only if \"r\"2 can be written as sum of \"n\" squares of integers.\nAn octahedron is a sphere in taxicab geometry, and a cube is a sphere in geometry using the Chebyshev distance.\nHistory.\nThe geometry of the sphere was studied by the Greeks. \"Euclid's Elements\" defines the sphere in book XI, discusses various properties of the sphere in book XII, and shows how to inscribe the five regular polyhedra within a sphere in book XIII. Euclid does not include the area and volume of a sphere, only a theorem that the volume of a sphere varies as the third power of its diameter, probably due to Eudoxus of Cnidus. The volume and area formulas were first determined in Archimedes's \"On the Sphere and Cylinder\" by the method of exhaustion. Zenodorus was the first to state that, for a given surface area, the sphere is the solid of maximum volume.\nArchimedes wrote about the problem of dividing a sphere into segments whose volumes are in a given ratio, but did not solve it. A solution by means of the parabola and hyperbola was given by Dionysodorus. A similar problem\u00a0\u2013 to construct a segment equal in volume to a given segment, and in surface to another segment\u00a0\u2013 was solved later by al-Quhi.\nRegions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

S\u00e1pmi includes the northern parts of Fennoscandia, stretching over four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Most of S\u00e1pmi lies north of the Arctic Circle, bounded by the Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, and White Sea. In the south, S\u00e1pmi extends to the counties of Tr\u00f8ndelag in Norway and J\u00e4mtland in Sweden.\nMost of the S\u00e1mi population is concentrated in a few traditional areas in the northernmost part of S\u00e1pmi, such as Kautokeino and Karasjok. Inari is considered one of the centres of S\u00e1mi culture. In the past, the S\u00e1mi settlement reached much farther south, possibly to present-day Oslo in the west and the lakes Ladoga and Onega in the east.\nS\u00e1pmi has never been a sovereign political entity. Since 1970s\u20131990s, the S\u00e1mi have had a limited self-governance in the Nordic states, represented by the S\u00e1mi Parliaments. The interstate cooperation is organized by the umbrella organization S\u00e1mi Council.\nHistorically, the Scandinavian peoples referred to the S\u00e1mi using the exonyms \"Finns\" and \"Lapps\", terms now considered outdated or pejorative. In Scandinavian languages, historical names for the region include , \"Lappmarken\" and , and in English, S\u00e1pmi has traditionally been called Lapland (). Today, variations of these names persist in smaller cultural, geographic and administrative designations within each country, such as Finnmark County in Norway, Lapland Province in Sweden and Lapland Region in Finland, all of which overlap with S\u00e1pmi. The Russian part of the S\u00e1pmi is covered by Murmansk Oblast.\nEtymology.\nS\u00e1pmi (and corresponding terms in other S\u00e1mi languages) refers to both the S\u00e1mi land and the S\u00e1mi people. The word \"S\u00e1mi\" is the accusative-genitive form of the noun \"S\u00e1pmi\"\u2014making the name's (\"S\u00e1mi olbmot\") meaning \"people of S\u00e1pmi\". The origin of the word is speculated to be related to the Baltic word \"*\u017e\u0113m\u0113\", meaning \"land\". Also \"H\u00e4me\", the Finnish name for Tavastia, a historical province of Finland, is thought to have the same origin, and the same word is at least speculated to be the origin of , the Finnish name for Finland.\n\"S\u00e1pmi\" is the name in Northern S\u00e1mi, the most widely spoken of the S\u00e1mi languages. In other languages, the following terms are used:\nIn modern Swedish and Norwegian, S\u00e1pmi is known as either \"Sapmi\" or \"Sameland\". In Finnish it is known as or . In Old Norse, it was historically called \"Finnm\u01ebrk\", a name that later evolved into \"Finnmark\", the name of Norway's northernmost county. In older Swedish, S\u00e1pmi was known as \"Lappmarken\" or \"Lappland\". Some English language sources refer to Northern Norway and Murmansk Oblast as \"Norwegian Lapland\" and \"Russian Lapland\", respectively, especially in the context of tourism marketing.\n\"Lappland\" became the name of Sweden's northernmost province (\"landskap\") which was divided in 1809, leaving one part in Sweden and other under Finland, which became part of the Russian Empire. The name \"Lappland\" remains in use for both the Swedish province of Lapland and the Finnish region of Lapland. Finnish Lapland includes Per\u00e4pohjola, a region traditionally considered part of Ostrobothnia. Consequently. \"Lapland\" and \"S\u00e1pmi\" are not interchangeable in the Finnish context. While Rovaniemi is located in Lapland, it is not part of S\u00e1pmi.\nIn the 17th century, Johannes Schefferus assumed the etymology of the term \"Lapland\" to be related to the Swedish word for \"running\", (cognate with English, \"to leap\"). The terms \"Lapp\" and \"Lappland\" are now regarded as outdated or offensive by many S\u00e1mi people, who prefer the area's name in their language \"\", because over time the term \"Lapp\" has acquired the pejorative connotation of \"silly\", \"uneducated\", \"backwards\", etc. in the major languages of the Scandinavian countries that include S\u00e1pmi.\nGeography.\nLandscape.\nThe largest part of S\u00e1pmi lies north of the Arctic Circle. The western portion is an area of fjords, deep valleys, glaciers and mountains, the highest point being Mount Kebnekaise (). The Swedish part of S\u00e1pmi is characterized by great rivers running from the northwest to the southeast. From the former Norwegian county of Troms and Finnmark and eastward, the terrain is that of a low plateau with many marshes and lakes, the largest of which is Lake Inari in Finnish Lapland. The extreme northeastern section lies within the tundra region, but it does not have permafrost. In the 19th century, scientific expeditions to S\u00e1pmi were undertaken, for instance by J\u00f6ns Svanberg.\nClimate.\nThe climate is subarctic/tundra and vegetation is sparse, except in the densely forested southern portion. The mountainous west coast has significantly milder winters and more precipitation than the large areas east of the mountain chain. North of the Arctic Circle polar nights characterize the winter season and the midnight sun the summer season\u2014both phenomena are longer the further north you go. Traditionally, the Sami divide the year into \"eight\" seasons instead of four.\nIn Inari, the climate is warm-end subarctic, with summer highs of , and winter lows of . The average winter sees 131 days of snowfall, with the first flakes falling to the ground in September. Snow cover lasts about two-thirds of the year and may persist past the last flake and even the last frost.\nEven without permafrost or a true tundra climate, much of S\u00e1pmi is arctic moorland with stunted, scattered trees.\nNatural resources.\nReindeers, wolves, bears, and birds are the main forms of animal life, in addition to a myriad of insects in the short summer. Sea and river fisheries abound in the region. Steamers are operated on some of the lakes, and many ports are ice-free throughout the year. All ports along the Norwegian Sea in the west and the Barents Sea in the northeast to Murmansk are ice-free all year. The northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia usually freezes over in winter. The ocean floor to the north and west of S\u00e1pmi has deposits of petroleum and natural gas. S\u00e1pmi contains valuable mineral deposits, particularly iron ore in Sweden, copper in Norway, and nickel and apatite in Russia.\nCultural subdivisions.\nEast S\u00e1pmi.\n\"East S\u00e1pmi\" consists of the Kola peninsula and the Lake Inari region and is home to the eastern Sami languages. While being the most heavily populated part of S\u00e1pmi, this is also the region where the Indigenous population and their culture are weakest. Corresponds to the regions marked 6 through 9 on the map below.\nCentral S\u00e1pmi.\n\"Central S\u00e1pmi\" consists of the western part of Finland's Sami Domicile Area, the parts of Norway north of the Saltfjellet mountains and areas on the Swedish side corresponding to this. Central S\u00e1pmi is the region where Sami culture is strongest and home to North Sami\u2014the most widely used Sami language, with around 20,000 speakers as of 2024. In the southernmost part of this subregion, however, Sami culture is rather weak\u2014this is where the moribund \"Bithun\" Sami language is used. The areas around the Tysfjorden fjord in Norway and the river Lule in Sweden are home to the \"Julev\" Sami language, one of the more widely used Sami languages. These correspond to the regions marked 3 through 5 on the map below.\nSouth S\u00e1pmi.\n\"South S\u00e1pmi\" consists of the areas south of Saltfjellet and corresponding areas in Sweden and is home to the southern languages. In this area, Sami culture is mostly visible inland and on the coast of the Baltic Sea, and the languages are spoken by few. Corresponds to the regions marked 1 and 2 on the map below to the southeast of region 1 in Sweden.\nS\u00e1mi languages.\nThe Saamic languages are the region's main minority languages and its oldest attested languages. They belong to the Uralic language family and are most closely related to the Finnic languages. Many Sami languages are mutually unintelligible, but the languages originally formed a dialect continuum stretching southwest and northeast, so that a message could hypothetically be passed between Sami speakers from one end to the other and be understood by all. Today, however, many of the languages are moribund and thus there are \"gaps\" in the original continuum.\nOn the map to the right numbers indicate S\u00e1mi languages. Of these languages, Northern S\u00e1mi is by far the most vital; whereas Ume S\u00e1mi and Pite S\u00e1mi are critically endangered. Kemi S\u00e1mi has been extinct for over a century.\nNorth Sami is subdivided into three main dialects: West, East, and Coast. The written standard is based on the Western dialect.\nDemography.\nIt is difficult to give estimates of inhabitants since S\u00e1pmi is not precisely defined. It is also difficult to account for the distribution of ethnic groups as many people have double or multiple ethnic identities\u2014both seeing themselves as members of the majority population and being part of one or more minority groups.\nThe number of S\u00e1mi is generally estimated to be between 80,000 and 100,000. Many live in areas outside S\u00e1pmi such as Oulu, Oslo, Stockholm and Helsinki. Some S\u00e1mi people have migrated to places outside the S\u00e1pmi vernacular region, such as Canada and the United States.\nGroups of S\u00e1mi people have settled in the northern parts of Minnesota.\nThe Sami are a small minority in the Russian part of S\u00e1pmi.\nAs of 2016, 13,226 people inhabited the Sami native region of Finnish Lapland many of whom are Sami.\nPolitics.\nNorway, Finland and Sweden all have S\u00e1mi Parliaments that to varying degrees are involved in governing the region\u2014though mostly they only have authority over the matters of the S\u00e1mi citizens of the states in which they are situated.\nS\u00e1mi Parliaments.\nEvery Norwegian citizen registered as a S\u00e1mi has the right to vote in the elections for the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway. Elections are held every four years by direct vote from seven constituencies covering all of Norway (six of which are in S\u00e1pmi) and run parallel to the general Norwegian parliamentary elections. This is the S\u00e1mi Parliament with the most influence over any part of S\u00e1pmi, as it is involved in the autonomy established by the Finnmark Act. The parliament is in the village of K\u00e1r\u00e1\u0161johka and its current president is Silje Karine Muotka from the Norwegian S\u00e1mi Association.\nThe S\u00e1mi Parliament of Sweden, situated in Kiruna (), is elected by a general vote which all registered S\u00e1mi citizens of Sweden may attend. The current president is Lars-Anders Baer.\nVoting for elections to the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Finland is restricted to inhabitants of the S\u00e1mi Domicile Area. The Parliament is in Inari (), and its current president is Tuomas Aslak Juuso.\nIn Russia, there is no S\u00e1mi Parliament. Two S\u00e1mi organisations are members of the national umbrella organisation of Indigenous peoples, the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), and represent the Russian S\u00e1mi in the S\u00e1mi Council. RAIPON is represented in Russia's Public Chamber by Pavel Sulyandziga. On 14 December 2008, the first Congress of the Russian S\u00e1mi took place. The Conference decided to demand the formation of a Russian S\u00e1mi Parliament, to be elected by the local S\u00e1mi. A suggestion to have the Russian Federation pick representatives for the Parliament was voted down with a clear majority. The Congress also chose a Council of Representatives that was to work for the establishment of a parliament and otherwise represent the Russian S\u00e1mi. It is headed by Valentina Sovkina.\nS\u00e1mi Parliamentary Council.\nOn 2 March 2000, the S\u00e1mi parliaments of Norway and Finland founded the S\u00e1mi Parliamentary Council, and the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Sweden joined two years later. Each parliament sends seven representatives, and observers are sent from the S\u00e1mi organisations of Russia and the S\u00e1mi Council. The S\u00e1mi Parliamentary Council discuss cross-border cooperation, hands out the annual \"Gollegiella\" language development award, and represents the S\u00e1mi people abroad.\nSaami Council.\nIn addition to the parliaments and their common council, there is a Saami Council based on Saami organisations. This council also organises interstate cooperation between the Saami, and also often represents the Saami in international fora such as the Barents Region. This organisation is older than the Parliamentary Council, but not connected to the parliaments except that some of the NGOs double as party lists in Sami parliament elections.\nRussia.\nThe Russian side of S\u00e1pmi is within Murmansk Oblast. \"Oblasts\" are governed by popularly elected parliaments and formally headed by governors. The governors are nominated by the president of Russia and accepted or rejected by the local parliaments. However, should the parliament refuse to accept the president's nominee, the president is entitled to dissolve parliament and call local elections.\nMurmansk Oblast covers the Kola Peninsula and is home to Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic Circle and in the S\u00e1pmi. It is subdivided into several districts, of which the geographically largest is Lovozersky District. This is also part of Russia where the Sami population is most numerous and visible.\nThe Lapland Nature Reserve (, Laplandskiy zapovednik) is a Russian \"zapovednik\" (strict nature reserve) in Murmansk Oblast, above the Arctic Circle. Its administrative centre is the rural locality of Laplandsky Zapovednik. First established between 1930-1951 and reestablished in 1957, the reserve protects an area of to the northwest of Lake Imandra, including 86\u00a0km2 of inland water.\nNorway.\nThe counties of Norway are governed by popularly elected assemblies, headed by county mayors. Formally, the counties are headed by county governors, but in practice, these have limited influence today.\nThe largest of Norway's landscapes, Finnm\u00e1rku (Northern Sami) or Finnmark (Norwegian) county, is in S\u00e1pmi and has a special form of autonomy: 95% (about ) of the area is owned by the Finnmark Estate. The board of the Estate consists of many representatives from the Sami Parliament of Norway and Finnmark's county council. The two institutions appoint leaders of the board alternately. The administrative centre of Finnm\u00e1rku (Finnmark) is \u010c\u00e1hcesuolu or Vads\u00f8, in the far east of the county. The current county governor is Runar Sj\u00e5stad from the Norwegian Labour Party.\nRomsa (or Troms) county is southwest of Finnm\u00e1rku. Its administrative centre is the city after which the county is named, Romsa or Troms\u00f8. Romsa is North Norway's biggest city and S\u00e1pmi's biggest city after Murmansk. The current \"fylkesordf\u00f8rer\" is Terje Olsen from the Conservative Party. A similar solution to the Finnmark Estate, H\u00e5logalandsallmenningen, has been proposed for Romsa County and its southern neighbour Nordl\u00e1nda.\nNordland covers a long strip of coast that includes both North Sami, Julev Sami, Bithun Sami, and South Sami areas. Its administrative centre is B\u00e5d\u00e5ddjo or Bod\u00f8. The current county governor is Mariette Korsrud from the Norwegian Labour Party.\nThe southernmost parts of Norwegian Sapmi lie in Tr\u00f8ndelag county (mostly the northern part of the county). The administrative centre is Steinkjer. The largest city in Tr\u00f8ndelag is Trondheim. Trondheim is outside S\u00e1pmi but is well known for being the site of the first international Sami conference in February 1917. The county governor is Frank Jenssen from the Conservative Party.\nSweden.\nLapland is a large northwestern province of Sweden, wholly within S\u00e1pmi. The traditional provinces of Sweden are cultural and historical entities; for administrative and political purposes they were replaced by the counties of Sweden (l\u00e4n) in 1634.\nFive counties are wholly or partially within S\u00e1pmi. \"L\u00e4n\" is formally governed by the \"landsh\u00f6vding\", who is an envoy of the government and runs the government-appointed \"l\u00e4nsstyrelse\" that coordinates administration with national political goals for the county. Much of county politics is run by the county council or \"landsting\", which is elected by the inhabitants of the county; but the counties' top positions are still determined by those who win the general elections of Sweden.\nNorrbotten County is mostly covered by S\u00e1pmi, although the lower Tornedalen region is often excluded. The administrative centre is Lule\u00e5 in the Julev Sami area (Norrbotten includes North, Julev and Bithun areas). Current landsh\u00f6vding is Per-Ola Eriksson of the Centre Party.\nS\u00e1pmi covers the interior majority of V\u00e4sterbotten County, which are Ubmeje and South Sami regions. The administrative centre is Ume\u00e5, and the current landsh\u00f6vding is Chris Heister from the conservative Moderate Party.\nV\u00e4sternorrland County is an old part of Sapmi and still is. There are a lot of Sami on the coast of the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Bothnia).\nJ\u00e4mtland County is sometimes considered a part of the S\u00e1pmi cultural region and is a South Sami county. The administrative centre is \u00d6stersund. Current landsh\u00f6vding is J\u00f6ran H\u00e4gglund from the centre party Centerpartiet.\nFinland.\nFinland is divided into nineteen regions (\"maakunta\"), each governed by regional councils. These councils serve as cooperative forums for municipalities rather than being elected through a direct popular vote. Lapland (\"Lappi\", \"Lappland\") is the northernmost region, extending further south than S\u00e1pmi and encompassing Southern Lapland (\"Per\u00e4pohjola\", \"Nordbotten\"), historically regarded as the northernmost part of Ostrobothnia. The administrative centre is Rovaniemi. North Sami, Skolt Sami, and Aanaar Sami are Indigenous to the region.\nFour municipalities, An\u00e1r (Inari), Eanodat (Enonteki\u00f6), Ohcejohka (Utsjoki) and Soa\u0111egilli (Sodankyl\u00e4) in the northern part of Finnish Lapland constitute the Sami Domicile Area, \"S\u00e1miid Ruovttoguovlu\", a region that is autonomous on issues regarding Sami culture and language. Ohcejohka is the only municipality in Finland with a Sami majority.\nSports.\nThe region has its own football team, the S\u00e1pmi football team, which is organised by FA S\u00e1pmi. It is a member of ConIFA and the host of the 2014 ConIFA World Football Cup. The S\u00e1pmi football team won the 2006 VIVA World Cup and hosted the 2008 event.\nNotable places.\nThe following towns and villages have a significant Sami population or host Sami institutions. Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or Russian toponyms are in parentheses.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Blue Mountains in the west, and about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) from Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and the Hawkesbury River in the north and north-west, to the Royal National Park and Macarthur in the south and south-west. Greater Sydney consists of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas. Residents of the city are colloquially known as \"Sydneysiders\". The estimated population in June 2024 was 5,557,233, which is about 66% of the state's population. The city's nicknames include the Emerald City and the Harbour City.\nThere is evidence that Aboriginal Australians inhabited the Greater Sydney region at least 30,000 years ago, and their engravings and cultural sites are common. The traditional custodians of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans of the Darug, Dharawal and Eora. During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia. After World War II, Sydney experienced mass migration and by 2021 over 40 per cent of the population was born overseas. Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China, India, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nDespite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, Sydney frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities. It is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world. Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity, Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in education, finance, manufacturing and tourism. The University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales are ranked 18th and 19th in the world respectively.\nSydney has hosted major international sporting events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final, and the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. The city is among the top fifteen most-visited cities worldwide, with millions of tourists coming each year to see the city's landmarks. The city has over of nature reserves and parks, and its notable natural features include Sydney Harbour and Royal National Park. The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the World Heritage-listed Sydney Opera House are major tourist attractions. Central Station is the hub of Sydney's suburban train, metro and light rail networks and longer-distance services. The main passenger airport serving the city is Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the world's oldest continually operating airports.\nToponymy.\nIn 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip, the first governor of New South Wales, named the cove where the first British settlement was established Sydney Cove after Home Secretary Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. The cove was called \"Warrane\" by the Aboriginal inhabitants. Phillip considered naming the settlement Albion, but this name was never officially used. By 1790 Phillip and other officials were regularly calling the township Sydney. Sydney was declared a city in 1842.\nThe Gadigal (Cadigal) clan, whose territory stretches along the southern shore of Port Jackson from South Head to Darling Harbour, are the traditional owners of the land on which the British settlement was initially established, and call their territory \"Gadi\" (\"Cadi\"). Aboriginal clan names within the Sydney region were often formed by adding the suffix \"-gal\" to a word denoting the name for their territory, a specific place in their territory, a food source, or totem. Greater Sydney covers the traditional lands of 28 known Aboriginal clans.\nHistory.\nFirst inhabitants of the region.\nThe first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were Aboriginal Australians who had migrated from southeast Asia via northern Australia. Flaked pebbles found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments might indicate human occupation from 45,000 to 50,000 years ago, while radiocarbon dating has shown evidence of human activity in the region from around 30,000 years ago. Prior to the arrival of the British, there were 4,000 to 8,000 Aboriginal people in the greater Sydney region.\nThe inhabitants subsisted on fishing, hunting, and gathering plants and shellfish. The diet of the coastal clans was more reliant on seafood whereas hinterland clans ate more forest animals and plants. The clans had distinctive equipment and weapons mostly made of stone, wood, plant materials, bone and shell. They also differed in their body decorations, hairstyles, songs and dances. Aboriginal clans had a rich ceremonial life, part of a belief system centring on ancestral, totemic and supernatural beings. People from different clans and language groups came together to participate in initiation and other ceremonies. These occasions fostered trade, marriages and clan alliances.\nThe earliest British settlers recorded the word 'Eora' as an Aboriginal term meaning either 'people' or 'from this place'. The clans of the Sydney area occupied land with traditional boundaries. There is debate, however, about which group or nation these clans belonged to, and the extent of differences in language and rites. The major groups were the coastal Eora people, the Dharug (Darug) occupying the inland area from Parramatta to the Blue Mountains, and the Dharawal people south of Botany Bay. Darginung and Gundungurra languages were spoken on the fringes of the Sydney area.\nThe first meeting between Aboriginals and British explorers occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay (Kamay) and encountered the Gweagal clan. Two Gweagal men opposed the landing party and one was shot and wounded. Cook and his crew stayed at Botany Bay for a week, collecting water, timber, fodder and botanical specimens and exploring the surrounding area. Cook sought to establish relations with the Aboriginal population without success.\nConvict town (1788\u20131840).\nBritain had been sending convicts to its American colonies for most of the eighteenth century, and the loss of these colonies in 1783 was the impetus to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay. Proponents of colonisation also pointed to the strategic importance of a new base in the Asia-Pacific region and its potential to provide much-needed timber and flax for the navy.\nThe First Fleet of 11 ships under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788. It comprised more than a thousand settlers, including 736 convicts. The fleet soon moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. The colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip described as \"the finest Harbour in the World ... Here a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security\".\nThe settlement was planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade and shipbuilding were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated. However, the soil around the settlement proved poor and the first crops failed, leading to several years of hunger and strict rationing. The food crisis was relieved with the arrival of the Second Fleet in mid-1790 and the Third Fleet in 1791. Former convicts received small grants of land, and government and private farms spread to the more fertile lands around Parramatta, Windsor and Camden on the Cumberland Plain. By 1804, the colony was self-sufficient in food.\nA smallpox epidemic in April 1789 killed about half the region's Indigenous population. In November 1790 Bennelong led a group of survivors of the Sydney clans into the settlement, establishing a continuous presence of Aboriginal Australians in settled Sydney.\nPhillip had been given no instructions for urban development, but in July 1788 submitted a plan for the new town at Sydney Cove. It included a wide central avenue, a permanent Government House, law courts, hospital and other public buildings, but no provision for warehouses, shops, or other commercial buildings. Phillip promptly ignored his own plan, and unplanned development became a feature of Sydney's topography.\nAfter Phillip's departure in December 1792, the colony's military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods from visiting ships. Former convicts engaged in trade and opened small businesses. Soldiers and former convicts built houses on Crown land, with or without official permission, in what was now commonly called Sydney town. Governor William Bligh (1806\u201308) imposed restrictions on commerce and ordered the demolition of buildings erected on Crown land, including some owned by past and serving military officers. The resulting conflict culminated in the Rum Rebellion of 1808, in which Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps.\nGovernor Lachlan Macquarie (1810\u20131821) played a leading role in the development of Sydney and New South Wales, establishing a bank, a currency and a hospital. He employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney and commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches, and public buildings. Parramatta Road, linking Sydney and Parramatta, was opened in 1811, and a road across the Blue Mountains was completed in 1815, opening the way for large-scale farming and grazing west of the Great Dividing Range.\nFollowing the departure of Macquarie, official policy encouraged the emigration of free British settlers to New South Wales. Immigration to the colony increased from 900 free settlers in 1826\u201330 to 29,000 in 1836\u201340, many of whom settled in Sydney. By the 1840s Sydney exhibited a geographic divide between poor and working-class residents living west of the Tank Stream in areas such as The Rocks, and the more affluent residents living to its east. Free settlers, free-born residents and former convicts now represented the vast majority of the population of Sydney, leading to increasing public agitation for responsible government and an end to transportation. Transportation to New South Wales ceased in 1840.\nConflict on the Cumberland Plain.\nIn 1804, Irish convicts led around 300 rebels in the Castle Hill Rebellion, an attempt to march on Sydney, commandeer a ship, and sail to freedom. Poorly armed, and with their leader Philip Cunningham captured, the main body of insurgents were routed by about 100 troops and volunteers at Rouse Hill. At least 39 convicts were killed in the uprising and subsequent executions.\nAs the colony spread to the more fertile lands around the Hawkesbury River, north-west of Sydney, conflict between the settlers and the Darug people intensified, reaching a peak from 1794 to 1810. Bands of Darug people, led by Pemulwuy and later by his son Tedbury, burned crops, killed livestock and raided settler stores in a pattern of resistance that was to be repeated as the colonial frontier expanded. A military garrison was established on the Hawkesbury in 1795. The death toll from 1794 to 1800 was 26 settlers and up to 200 Darug.\nConflict again erupted from 1814 to 1816 with the expansion of the colony into Dharawal country in the Nepean region south-west of Sydney. Following the deaths of several settlers, Governor Macquarie dispatched three military detachments into Dharawal lands, culminating in the Appin massacre (April 1816) in which at least 14 Aboriginal people were killed.\nColonial city (1841\u20131900).\nThe New South Wales Legislative Council became a semi-elected body in 1842. Sydney was declared a city the same year, and a governing council established, elected on a restrictive property franchise.The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 initially caused economic disruption as men moved to the goldfields. Melbourne soon overtook Sydney as Australia's largest city, leading to an enduring rivalry between the two. However, increased immigration from overseas and wealth from gold exports increased demand for housing, consumer goods, services and urban amenities. The New South Wales government also stimulated growth by investing heavily in railways, trams, roads, ports, telegraph, schools and urban services. The population of Sydney and its suburbs grew from 95,600 in 1861 to 386,900 in 1891. The city developed many of its characteristic features. The growing population packed into rows of terrace houses in narrow streets. New public buildings of sandstone abounded, including at the University of Sydney (1854\u201361), the Australian Museum (1858\u201366), the Town Hall (1868\u201388), and the General Post Office (1866\u201392). Elaborate coffee palaces and hotels were erected. Daylight bathing at Sydney's beaches was banned, but segregated bathing at designated ocean baths was popular.\nDrought, the winding down of public works and a financial crisis led to economic depression in Sydney throughout most of the 1890s. Meanwhile, the Sydney-based premier of New South Wales, George Reid, became a key figure in the process of federation.\nState capital (1901\u2013present).\nWhen the six colonies federated on 1 January 1901, Sydney became the capital of the State of New South Wales. The spread of bubonic plague in 1900 prompted the state government to modernise the wharves and demolish inner-city slums. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw more Sydney males volunteer for the armed forces than the Commonwealth authorities could process, and helped reduce unemployment. Those returning from the war in 1918 were promised \"homes fit for heroes\" in new suburbs such as Daceyville and Matraville. \"Garden suburbs\" and mixed industrial and residential developments also grew along the rail and tram corridors. The population reached one million in 1926, after Sydney had regained its position as the most populous city in Australia. The government created jobs with massive public projects such as the electrification of the Sydney rail network and building the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n Sydney was more severely affected by the Great Depression of the 1930s than regional New South Wales or Melbourne. New building almost came to a standstill, and by 1933 the unemployment rate for male workers was 28 per cent, but over 40 per cent in working class areas such as Alexandria and Redfern. Many families were evicted from their homes and shanty towns grew along coastal Sydney and Botany Bay, the largest being \"Happy Valley\" at La Perouse. The Depression also exacerbated political divisions. In March 1932, when populist Labor premier Jack Lang attempted to open the Sydney Harbour Bridge he was upstaged by Francis de Groot of the far-right New Guard, who slashed the ribbon with a sabre.\nIn January 1938, Sydney celebrated the Empire Games and the sesquicentenary of European settlement in Australia. One journalist wrote, \"Golden beaches. Sun tanned men and maidens...Red-roofed villas terraced above the blue waters of the harbour...Even Melbourne seems like some grey and stately city of Northern Europe compared with Sydney's sub-tropical splendours.\" A congress of the \"Aborigines of Australia\" declared 26 January \"A Day of Mourning\" for \"the whiteman's seizure of our country.\"\nWith the outbreak of Second World War in 1939, Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development. Unemployment virtually disappeared and women moved into jobs previously typically reserved for males. Sydney was attacked by Japanese submarines in May and June 1942 with 21 killed. Households built air raid shelters and performed drills. Military establishments in response to World War II in Australia included the Garden Island Tunnel System, the only tunnel warfare complex in Sydney, and the heritage-listed military fortification systems Bradleys Head Fortification Complex and Middle Head Fortifications, which were part of a total defence system for Sydney Harbour.\nA post-war immigration and baby boom saw a rapid increase in Sydney's population and the spread of low-density housing in suburbs throughout the Cumberland Plain. Immigrants\u2014mostly from Britain and continental Europe\u2014and their children accounted for over three-quarters of Sydney's population growth between 1947 and 1971. The newly created Cumberland County Council oversaw low-density residential developments, the largest at Green Valley and Mount Druitt. Older residential centres such as Parramatta, Bankstown and Liverpool became suburbs of the metropolis. Manufacturing, protected by high tariffs, employed over a third of the workforce from 1945 to the 1960s. However, as the long post-war economic boom progressed, retail and other service industries became the main source of new jobs.\nAn estimated one million onlookers, most of the city's population, watched Queen Elizabeth II land in 1954 at Farm Cove where Captain Phillip had raised the Union Jack 165 years earlier, commencing her Australian Royal Tour. It was the first time a reigning monarch stepped onto Australian soil.\nIncreasing high-rise development in Sydney and the expansion of suburbs beyond the \"green belt\" envisaged by the planners of the 1950s resulted in community protests. In the early 1970s, trade unions and resident action groups imposed green bans on development projects in historic areas such as The Rocks. Federal, State and local governments introduced heritage and environmental legislation. The Sydney Opera House was also controversial for its cost and disputes between architect J\u00f8rn Utzon and government officials. However, soon after it opened in 1973 it became a major tourist attraction and symbol of the city. The progressive reduction in tariff protection from 1974 began the transformation of Sydney from a manufacturing centre to a \"world city\". From the 1980s, overseas immigration grew rapidly, with Asia, the Middle East and Africa becoming major sources. By 2021, the population of Sydney was over 5.2 million, with 40% of the population born overseas. China and India overtook England as the largest source countries for overseas-born residents.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nSydney is a coastal basin with the Tasman Sea to the east, the Blue Mountains to the west, the Hawkesbury River to the north, and the Woronora Plateau to the south.\nSydney spans two geographic regions. The Cumberland Plain lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed; it was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches became more heavily populated. Seventy surf beaches can be found along its coastline, with Bondi Beach being the most famous.\nThe Nepean River wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching Broken Bay. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The Parramatta River is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson. The southern parts of the city are drained by the Georges River and the Cooks River into Botany Bay.\nThere is no single definition of the boundaries of Sydney. The Australian Statistical Geography Standard definition of Greater Sydney covers and includes the local government areas of Central Coast in the north, Hawkesbury in the north-west, Blue Mountains in the west, Sutherland Shire in the south, and Wollondilly in the south-west. The local government area of the City of Sydney covers about 26 square kilometres from Garden island in the east to Bicentennial Park in the west, and south to the suburbs of Alexandria and Rosebery.\nGeology.\nSydney is made up of mostly Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks (typically found in the Prospect dolerite intrusion, west of Sydney). The Sydney Basin was formed in the early Triassic period. The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was laid down between 360 and 200 million years ago. The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds. The continental shelf of Australia is only away from the coast of Sydney, and that is where the Tasman Abyssal Plain lies.\nThe Sydney Basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. Deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the Triassic period in the Hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region. The rising sea level between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours. Port Jackson, better known as Sydney Harbour, is one such ria. Sydney features two major soil types: sandy soils (which originate from the Hawkesbury sandstone) and clay (which are from shales and volcanic rocks), though some soils may be a mixture of the two.\nDirectly overlying the older Hawkesbury sandstone is the Wianamatta shale, a geological feature found in western Sydney that was deposited in connection with a large river delta during the Middle Triassic. The Wianamatta shale generally comprises fine grained sedimentary rocks such as shales, mudstones, ironstones, siltstones and laminites, with less common sandstone units. The Wianamatta Group is made up of Bringelly Shale, Minchinbury Sandstone and Ashfield Shale.\nEcology.\nThe most prevalent plant communities in the Sydney region are grassy woodlands (i.e. savannas) and some pockets of dry sclerophyll forests, which consist of eucalyptus trees, casuarinas, melaleucas, corymbias and angophoras, with shrubs (typically wattles, callistemons, grevilleas and banksias), and a semi-continuous grass in the understory. The plants in this community tend to have rough, spiky leaves due to low soil fertility. Sydney also features a few areas of wet sclerophyll forests in the wetter, elevated areas in the north and northeast. These forests are defined by straight, tall tree canopies with a moist understory of soft-leaved shrubs, tree ferns and herbs.\nThe predominant vegetation community in Sydney is the Cumberland Plain Woodland in Western Sydney (Cumberland Plain), followed by the Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in the Inner West and Northern Sydney, the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub in the coastline and the Blue Gum High Forest scantily present in the North Shore \u2013 all of which are critically endangered. The city also includes the Sydney Sandstone Ridgetop Woodland found in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park on the Hornsby Plateau to the north.\nSydney is home to dozens of bird species, which commonly include the Australian raven, Australian magpie, crested pigeon, noisy miner and the pied currawong. Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the common myna, common starling, house sparrow and the spotted dove. Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks. Sydney has a few mammal and spider species, such as the grey-headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel-web, respectively, and has a huge diversity of marine species inhabiting its harbour and beaches.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger classification, Sydney has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") with \"warm, sometimes hot\" summers and \"generally mild\", to \"cool\" winters. The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode play an important role in determining Sydney's weather patterns: drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other, associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation in Australia. The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean, and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs because Sydney CBD is more affected by the oceanic climate drivers than the western suburbs.\nAt Sydney's primary weather station at Observatory Hill, extreme temperatures have ranged from on 18 January 2013 to on 22 June 1932. An average of 14.9 days a year have temperatures at or above in the central business district (CBD). In contrast, the metropolitan area averages between 35 and 65 days, depending on the suburb. The hottest day in the metropolitan area occurred in Penrith on 4 January 2020, where a high of was recorded. The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from in September to in February. Sydney has an average of 7.2 hours of sunshine per day and 109.5 clear days annually. Due to the inland location, frost is recorded early in the morning in Western Sydney a few times in winter. Autumn and spring are the transitional seasons, with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn.\nSydney experiences an urban heat island effect. This makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat, including coastal suburbs. In late spring and summer, temperatures over are not uncommon, though hot, dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster, a powerful southerly that brings gale winds and a rapid fall in temperature. Since Sydney is downwind of the Great Dividing Range, it occasionally experiences dry, westerly foehn winds typically in winter and early spring (which are the reason for its warm maximum temperatures). Westerly winds are intense when the Roaring Forties (or the Southern Annular Mode) shift towards southeastern Australia, where they may damage homes and affect flights, in addition to making the temperature seem colder than it actually is.\nRainfall has a moderate to low variability and has historically been fairly uniform throughout the year, although in recent years it has been more summer-dominant and erratic. Precipitation is usually higher in summer through to autumn, and lower in late winter to early spring. In late autumn and winter, east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in the CBD. In the warm season black nor'easters are usually the cause of heavy rain events, though other forms of low-pressure areas, including remnants of ex-cyclones, may also bring heavy deluge and afternoon thunderstorms. 'Snow' was last alleged in 1836, more than likely a fall of graupel, or soft hail; and in July 2008 the Upper North Shore saw a fall of graupel that was mistaken by many for 'snow'. In 2009, dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards the city.\nRegions.\nThe Greater Sydney Commission divides Sydney into three \"cities\" and five \"districts\" based on the 33 LGAs in the metropolitan area. The \"metropolis of three cities\" comprises \"Eastern Harbour City\", \"Central River City\" and \"Western Parkland City\". The Australian Bureau of Statistics also includes City of Central Coast (the former Gosford City and Wyong Shire) as part of Greater Sydney for population counts, adding 330,000 people.\nInner suburbs.\nThe CBD extends about south from Sydney Cove. It is bordered by Farm Cove within the Royal Botanic Garden to the east and Darling Harbour to the west. Suburbs surrounding the CBD include Woolloomooloo and Potts Point to the east, Surry Hills and Darlinghurst to the south, Pyrmont and Ultimo to the west, and Millers Point and The Rocks to the north. Most of these suburbs measure less than in area. The Sydney CBD is characterised by narrow streets and thoroughfares, created in its convict beginnings.\nSeveral localities, distinct from suburbs, exist throughout Sydney's inner reaches. Central and Circular Quay are transport hubs with ferry, rail, and bus interchanges. Chinatown, Darling Harbour, and Kings Cross are important locations for culture, tourism, and recreation. The Strand Arcade, located between Pitt Street Mall and George Street, is a historical Victorian-style shopping arcade. Opened on 1 April 1892, its shop fronts are an exact replica of the original internal shopping facades. Westfield Sydney, located beneath the Sydney Tower, is the largest shopping centre by area in Sydney.\nSince the late 20th century, there has been a trend of gentrification amongst Sydney's inner suburbs. Pyrmont, located on the harbour, was redeveloped from a centre of shipping and international trade to an area of high density housing, tourist accommodation, and gambling. Originally located well outside of the city, Darlinghurst is the location of the historic Darlinghurst Gaol, manufacturing, and mixed housing. For a period it was known as an area of prostitution. The terrace-style housing has largely been retained and Darlinghurst has undergone significant gentrification since the 1980s.\nGreen Square is a former industrial area of Waterloo which is undergoing urban renewal worth $8\u00a0billion. On the city harbour edge, the historic suburb and wharves of Millers Point are being built up as the new area of Barangaroo. The suburb of Paddington is known for its restored terrace houses, Victoria Barracks, and shopping including the weekly Oxford Street markets.\nInner West.\nThe Inner West generally includes the Inner West Council, Municipality of Burwood, Municipality of Strathfield, and City of Canada Bay. These span up to about 11\u00a0km west of the CBD. Historically, especially prior to the building of the Harbour Bridge, the outer suburbs of the Inner West such as Strathfield were the location of \"country\" estates for the colony's elites. By contrast, the inner suburbs in the Inner West, being close to transport and industry, have historically housed working-class industrial workers. These areas have undergone gentrification in the late 20th century, and many parts are now highly valued residential suburbs. As of 2021, an Inner West suburb (Strathfield) remained one of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia by median house price (the others were all in metropolitan Sydney, all in Northern Sydney or the Eastern Suburbs). The University of Sydney is located in this area, as well as the University of Technology, Sydney and a campus of the Australian Catholic University. The Anzac Bridge spans Johnstons Bay and connects Rozelle to Pyrmont and the city, forming part of the Western Distributor.\nThe Inner West is today well known as the location of village commercial centres with cosmopolitan flavours, such as the \"Little Italy\" commercial centres of Leichhardt, Five Dock and Haberfield, \"Little Portugal\" in Petersham, \"Little Korea\" in Strathfield or \"Little Shanghai\" in Ashfield. Large-scale shopping centres in the area include Westfield Burwood, DFO Homebush and Birkenhead Point Outlet Centre. There is a large cosmopolitan community and nightlife hub on King Street, Newtown.\nThe area is serviced by Sydney Trains' T1 and T2, including the Main Suburban Line, which was the first to be constructed in New South Wales. The L1 light rail line also runs through the area. Strathfield railway station is a secondary railway hub within Sydney, and major station on the Suburban and Northern lines. It was constructed in 1876. The future Sydney Metro West will also connect this area with the City and Parramatta. The area is also serviced by the Parramatta River services of Sydney Ferries, numerous bus routes and cycleways.\nEastern Suburbs.\nThe Eastern Suburbs encompass the Municipality of Woollahra, the City of Randwick, the Waverley Municipal Council, and parts of the Bayside Council. They include some of the most affluent and advantaged areas in the country, with some streets being amongst the most expensive in the world. As at 2014, Wolseley Road, Point Piper, had a top price of $20,900 per square metre, making it the ninth-most expensive street in the world. More than 75% of neighbourhoods in the Electoral District of Wentworth fall under the top decile of SEIFA advantage, making it the least disadvantaged area in the country. As of 2021, of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia by median house price, nine were in the Eastern Suburbs.\nMajor landmarks include Bondi Beach, which was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2008; and Bondi Junction, featuring a Westfield shopping centre and an estimated office workforce of 6,400 by 2035, as well as a railway station on the T4 Eastern Suburbs Line. The suburb of Randwick contains Randwick Racecourse, the Royal Hospital for Women, the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney Children's Hospital, and University of New South Wales Kensington Campus.\nConstruction of the CBD and South East Light Rail was completed in April 2020. The project aims to provide reliable and high-capacity tram services to residents in the City and South-East.\nMajor shopping centres in the area include Westfield Bondi Junction and Westfield Eastgardens.\nSouthern Sydney.\nThe Southern district of Sydney includes the suburbs in the local government areas of the Georges River Council (collectively known as St George) and the Sutherland Shire (colloquially known as 'The Shire'), on the southern banks of the Georges River.\nThe Kurnell peninsula, near Botany Bay, is the site of the first landfall on the eastern coastline made by James Cook in 1770. La Perouse, a historic suburb named after the French navigator Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse, is notable for its old military outpost at Bare Island and the Botany Bay National Park.\nThe suburb of Cronulla in southern Sydney is close to Royal National Park, Australia's oldest national park. Hurstville, a large suburb with commercial and high-rise residential buildings dominating the skyline, has become a CBD for the southern suburbs.\nNorthern Sydney.\n'Northern Sydney' includes the suburbs in the Upper North Shore, Lower North Shore and the Northern Beaches.\nThe Northern Suburbs include several landmarks \u2013 Macquarie University, Gladesville Bridge, Ryde Bridge, Macquarie Centre and Curzon Hall in Marsfield. This area includes suburbs in the local government areas of Hornsby Shire, Ku-ring-gai Council, City of Ryde, the Municipality of Hunter's Hill and parts of the City of Parramatta.\nThe North Shore includes the commercial centres of North Sydney and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing and associated trades, with many large corporations holding offices.\nThe Northern Beaches area includes Manly, one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations. The region also features Sydney Heads, a series of headlands which form the entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to Middle Harbour and north to the entrance of Broken Bay. The 2021 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to have, in comparison with the rest of Sydney, a large British diaspora and high concentration of people with European ancestry.\nAs of the end of 2021, half of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia (by median house price) were in Northern Sydney, including four on the Northern Beaches, two on the Lower North Shore, three on the Upper North Shore, and one straddling Hunters Hill and Woolwich.\nHills district.\nThe Hills district generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of The Hills Shire, parts of the City of Parramatta Council and Hornsby Shire. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau. Windsor and Old Windsor Roads are the second and third roads, respectively, laid in Australia.\nOn 26 May 2019, The Sydney Metro Northwest, which went from Chatswood to Tallawong, opened, with a large portion running through the Hills District, which meant the Hills District, for the first time, started having heavy rail.\nBefore this, The Hills was served by Bus Rapid Transit.\nWestern suburbs.\nThe greater western suburbs encompasses the areas of Parramatta, the sixth largest business district in Australia, settled the same year as the harbour-side colony, Bankstown, Liverpool, Penrith, and Fairfield. Covering and having an estimated population as at 2017 of 2,288,554, western Sydney has the most multicultural suburbs in the country \u2013 Cabramatta has earned the nickname \"Little Saigon\" due to its Vietnamese population, Fairfield has been named \"Little Assyria\" for its predominant Assyrian population and Harris Park is known as \"Little India\" with its plurality of Indian and Hindu population. The population is predominantly of a working class background, with major employment in the heavy industries and vocational trade. Toongabbie is noted for being the third mainland settlement (after Sydney and Parramatta) set up after British colonisation began in 1788, although the site of the settlement is actually in the separate suburb of Old Toongabbie.\nThe western suburb of Prospect, in the City of Blacktown, is home to Raging Waters, a water park operated by Parques Reunidos. Auburn Botanic Gardens, a botanical garden in Auburn, attracts thousands of visitors each year, including many from outside Australia. The greater west also includes Sydney Olympic Park, a suburb created to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, and Sydney Motorsport Park, a circuit in Eastern Creek. Prospect Hill, a historically significant ridge in the west and the only area in Sydney with ancient volcanic activity, is also listed on the State Heritage Register.\nTo the northwest, Featherdale Wildlife Park, a zoo in Doonside, near Blacktown, is a major tourist attraction. Sydney Zoo, opened in 2019, is another prominent zoo situated in Bungaribee. Established in 1799, the Old Government House, a historic house museum and tourist spot in Parramatta, was included in the Australian National Heritage List on 1 August 2007 and World Heritage List in 2010 (as part of the 11 penal sites constituting the Australian Convict Sites), making it the only site in greater western Sydney to be featured in such lists. The house is Australia's oldest surviving public building.\nFurther to the southwest is the region of Macarthur and the city of Campbelltown, a significant population centre until the 1990s considered a region separate to Sydney proper. Macarthur Square, a shopping complex in Campbelltown, has become one of the largest shopping complexes in Sydney. The southwest also features Bankstown Reservoir, the oldest elevated reservoir constructed in reinforced concrete that is still in use and is listed on the State Heritage Register. The southwest is home to one of Sydney's oldest trees, the Bland Oak, which was planted in the 1840s by William Bland in Carramar.\nUrban structure.\nArchitecture.\nThe earliest structures in the colony were built to the bare minimum of standards. Governor Macquarie set ambitious targets for the design of new construction projects. The city now has a world heritage listed building, several national heritage listed buildings, and dozens of Commonwealth heritage listed buildings as evidence of the survival of Macquarie's ideals.\nIn 1814, the Governor called on a convict named Francis Greenway to design Macquarie Lighthouse. The lighthouse's Classical design earned Greenway a pardon from Macquarie in 1818 and introduced a culture of refined architecture that remains to this day. Greenway went on to design the Hyde Park Barracks in 1819 and the Georgian style St James's Church in 1824. Gothic-inspired architecture became more popular from the 1830s. John Verge's Elizabeth Bay House and St Philip's Church of 1856 were built in Gothic Revival style along with Edward Blore's Government House of 1845. Kirribilli House, completed in 1858, and St Andrew's Cathedral, Australia's oldest cathedral, are rare examples of Victorian Gothic construction.\nFrom the late 1850s there was a shift towards Classical architecture. Mortimer Lewis designed the Australian Museum in 1857. The General Post Office, completed in 1891 in Victorian Free Classical style, was designed by James Barnet. Barnet also oversaw the 1883 reconstruction of Greenway's Macquarie Lighthouse. Customs House was built in 1844. The neo-Classical and French Second Empire style Town Hall was completed in 1889. Romanesque designs gained favour from the early 1890s. Sydney Technical College was completed in 1893 using both Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne approaches. The Queen Victoria Building was designed in Romanesque Revival fashion by George McRae; completed in 1898, it accommodates 200 shops across its three storeys.\nAs the wealth of the settlement increased and Sydney developed into a metropolis after Federation in 1901, its buildings became taller. Sydney's first tower was Culwulla Chambers which topped out at making 12 floors. The Commercial Traveller's Club, built in 1908, was of similar height at 10 floors. It was built in a brick stone veneer and demolished in 1972. This heralded a change in Sydney's cityscape and with the lifting of height restrictions in the 1960s there came a surge of high-rise construction.\nThe Great Depression had a tangible influence on Sydney's architecture. New structures became more restrained with far less ornamentation. The most notable architectural feat of this period is the Harbour Bridge. Its steel arch was designed by John Bradfield and completed in 1932. A total of 39,000 tonnes of structural steel span the between Milsons Point and Dawes Point.\nModern and International architecture came to Sydney from the 1940s. Since its completion in 1973 the city's Opera House has become a World Heritage Site and one of the world's most renowned pieces of Modern design. J\u00f8rn Utzon was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2003 for his work on the Opera House. Sydney is home to Australia's first building by renowned Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building (2015). An entrance from The Goods Line\u2013a pedestrian pathway and former railway line\u2013is located on the eastern border of the site.\nContemporary buildings in the CBD include Citigroup Centre, Aurora Place, Chifley Tower, the Reserve Bank building, Deutsche Bank Place, MLC Centre, and Capita Centre. The tallest structure is Sydney Tower, designed by Donald Crone and completed in 1981. Due to the proximity of Sydney Airport, a maximum height restriction was imposed, now sitting at 330 metres (1083 feet). Green bans and heritage overlays have been in place since at least 1977 to protect Sydney's heritage after controversial demolitions in the 1970s.\nHousing.\nSydney surpasses both New York City and Paris real estate prices, having some of the most expensive in the world. The city remains Australia's most expensive housing market, with the median house price at $1,595,310 as of December 2023.\nThere were 1.83\u00a0million dwellings in Sydney in 2021 including 900,000 (54%) detached houses, 218,000 (13%) semi-detached terrace houses and 550,000 (33%) units and apartments. Whilst terrace houses are common in the inner city areas, detached houses dominate the landscape in the outer suburbs. Due to environmental and economic pressures, there has been a noted trend towards denser housing, with a 30% increase in the number of apartments between 1996 and 2006. Public housing in Sydney is managed by the Government of New South Wales. Suburbs with large concentrations of public housing include Claymore, Macquarie Fields, Waterloo, and Mount Druitt.\nA range of heritage housing styles can be found throughout Sydney. Terrace houses are found in the inner suburbs such as Paddington, The Rocks, Potts Point and Balmain, many of which have been the subject of gentrification. These terraces, particularly those in suburbs such as The Rocks, were historically home to Sydney's miners and labourers. In the present day, terrace houses now make up some of the most valuable real estate in the city. Surviving large mansions from the Victorian era are mostly found in the oldest suburbs, such as Double Bay, Darling Point, Rose Bay and Strathfield.\nFederation homes, constructed around the time of Federation in 1901, are located in a large number of suburbs that developed thanks to the arrival of railways in the late 19th century, such as Penshurst and Turramurra, and in large-scale planned \"garden suburbs\" such as Haberfield. Workers cottages are found in Surry Hills, Redfern, and Balmain. California bungalows are common in Ashfield, Concord, and Beecroft. Larger modern homes are predominantly found in the outer suburbs, such as Stanhope Gardens, Kellyville Ridge, Bella Vista to the northwest, Bossley Park, Abbotsbury, and Cecil Hills to the west, and Hoxton Park, Harrington Park, and Oran Park to the southwest.\nParks and open spaces.\nThe Anzac War Memorial in Hyde Park is a public memorial dedicated to the Australian Imperial Force of World War I.\nThe Royal Botanic Garden is the most iconic green space in the region, hosting both scientific and leisure activities. There are 15 separate parks under the City administration. Parks within the city centre include Hyde Park, The Domain and Prince Alfred Park.\nThe Centennial Parklands is the largest park in the City of Sydney, comprising .\nThe inner suburbs include Centennial Park and Moore Park in the east (both within the City of Sydney local government area), while the outer suburbs contain Sydney Park and Royal National Park in the south, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in the north, and Western Sydney Parklands in the west, which is one of the largest urban parks in the world. The Royal National Park was proclaimed in 1879 and with is the second oldest national park in the world.\nHyde Park is the oldest parkland in the country. The largest park in the Sydney metropolitan area is Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, established in 1894 with an area of . It is regarded for its well-preserved records of indigenous habitation \u2013 more than 800 rock engravings, cave drawings and middens.\nThe area now known as The Domain was set aside by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1788 as his private reserve. Under the orders of Macquarie the land to the immediate north of The Domain became the Royal Botanic Garden in 1816. This makes them the oldest botanic garden in Australia. The Gardens host scientific research with herbarium collections, a library and laboratories. The two parks have a total area of with 8,900 individual plant species and receive over 3.5\u00a0million annual visits.\nTo the south of The Domain is Hyde Park, the oldest public parkland in Australia which measures . Its location was used for both relaxation and grazing of animals from the earliest days of the colony. Macquarie dedicated it in 1810 for the \"recreation and amusement of the inhabitants of the town\" and named it in honour of Hyde Park in London.\nEconomy.\nResearchers from Loughborough University have ranked Sydney amongst the top ten world cities that are highly integrated into the global economy. The Global Economic Power Index ranks Sydney eleventh in the world. The Global Cities Index recognises it as fourteenth in the world based on global engagement. There is a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations in Sydney and the city is promoted as Australia's financial capital and one of the Asia\u2013Pacific's leading financial hubs.\nThe prevailing economic theory during early colonial days was mercantilism, as it was throughout most of Western Europe. The economy struggled at first due to difficulties in cultivating the land and the lack of a stable monetary system. Governor Macquarie created two coins from every Spanish silver dollar in circulation. The economy was capitalist in nature by the 1840s as the proportion of free settlers increased, the maritime and wool industries flourished, and the powers of the East India Company were curtailed.\nWheat, gold, and other minerals became export industries towards the end of the 1800s. Significant capital began to flow into the city from the 1870s to finance roads, railways, bridges, docks, courthouses, schools and hospitals. Protectionist policies after federation allowed for the creation of a manufacturing industry which became the city's largest employer by the 1920s. These same policies helped to relieve the effects of the Great Depression during which the unemployment rate in New South Wales reached as high as 32%. From the 1960s onwards Parramatta gained recognition as the city's second CBD and finance and tourism became major industries and sources of employment.\nSydney's nominal gross domestic product was AU$400.9\u00a0billion and AU$80,000 per capita in 2015. Its gross domestic product was AU$337\u00a0billion in 2013, the largest in Australia. The financial and insurance services industry accounts for 18.1% of gross product, ahead of professional services with 9% and manufacturing with 7.2%. The creative and technology sectors are also focus industries for the City of Sydney and represented 9% and 11% of its economic output in 2012.\nBusinesses.\nThere were 451,000 businesses based in Sydney in 2011, including 48% of the top 500 companies in Australia and two-thirds of the regional headquarters of multinational corporations. Global companies are attracted to the city in part because its time zone spans the closing of business in North America and the opening of business in Europe. Most foreign companies in Sydney maintain significant sales and service functions but comparably less production, research, and development capabilities. There are 283 multinational companies with regional offices in Sydney.\nDomestic economics.\nSydney has been ranked between the fifteenth and the fifth most expensive city in the world and is the most expensive city in Australia. Of the 15 categories only measured by UBS in 2012, workers receive the seventh highest wage levels of 77 cities in the world. Working residents of Sydney work an average of 1,846 hours per annum with 15 days of leave.\nThe labour force of Greater Sydney Region in 2016 was 2,272,722 with a participation rate of 61.6%. It comprised 61.2% full-time workers, 30.9% part-time workers, and 6.0% unemployed individuals. The largest reported occupations are professionals, clerical and administrative workers, managers, technicians and trades workers, and community and personal service workers. The largest industries by employment across Greater Sydney are Health Care and Social Assistance (11.6%), Professional Services (9.8%), Retail Trade (9.3%), Construction (8.2%), Education and Training (8.0%), Accommodation and Food Services (6.7%), and Financial and Insurance Services (6.6%). The Professional Services and Financial and Insurance Services industries account for 25.4% of employment within the City of Sydney.\nIn 2016, 57.6% of working-age residents had a weekly income of less than $1,000 and 14.4% had a weekly income of $1,750 or more. The median weekly income for the same period was $719 for individuals, $1,988 for families, and $1,750 for households.\nUnemployment in the City of Sydney averaged 4.6% for the decade to 2013, much lower than the current rate of unemployment in Western Sydney of 7.3%. Western Sydney continues to struggle to create jobs to meet its population growth despite the development of commercial centres like Parramatta. Each day about 200,000 commuters travel from Western Sydney to the CBD and suburbs in the east and north of the city.\nHome ownership in Sydney was less common than renting prior to the Second World War but this trend has since reversed. Median house prices have increased by an average of 8.6% per annum since 1970. The median house price in March 2014 was $630,000. The primary cause of rising prices is the increasing cost of land and scarcity. 31.6% of dwellings in Sydney are rented, 30.4% are owned outright and 34.8% are owned with a mortgage. 11.8% of mortgagees in 2011 had monthly loan repayments of less than $1,000 and 82.9% had monthly repayments of $1,000 or more. 44.9% of renters for the same period had weekly rent of less than $350 whilst 51.7% had weekly rent of $350 or more. The median weekly rent in Sydney in 2011 was $450.\nFinancial services.\nMacquarie gave a charter in 1817 to form the first bank in Australia, the Bank of New South Wales. New private banks opened throughout the 1800s but the financial system was unstable. Bank collapses were frequent and a crisis point was reached in 1893 when 12 banks failed.\nThe Bank of New South Wales exists to this day as Westpac. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was formed in Sydney in 1911 and began to issue notes backed by the resources of the nation. It was replaced in this role in 1959 by the Reserve Bank of Australia, also based in Sydney. The Australian Securities Exchange began operating in 1987 and with a market capitalisation of $1.6\u00a0trillion is now one of the ten largest exchanges in the world.\nThe Financial and Insurance Services industry now constitutes 43% of the economic product of the City of Sydney. Sydney makes up half of Australia's finance sector and has been promoted by consecutive Commonwealth Governments as the Asia\u2013Pacific's leading financial centre. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Sydney was ranked as having the eighth most competitive financial centre in the world.\nIn 1985 the Federal Government granted 16 banking licences to foreign banks and now 40 of the 43 foreign banks operating in Australia are based in Sydney, including the People's Bank of China, Bank of America, Citigroup, UBS, Mizuho Bank, Bank of China, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered, State Street, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sumitomo Mitsui, ING Group, BNP Paribas, and Investec.\nManufacturing.\nSydney has been a manufacturing city since the 1920s. By 1961 the industry accounted for 39% of all employment and by 1970 over 30% of all Australian manufacturing jobs were in Sydney. Its status has declined in recent decades, making up 12.6% of employment in 2001 and 8.5% in 2011. Between 1970 and 1985 there was a loss of 180,000 manufacturing jobs. Despite this, Sydney still overtook Melbourne as the largest manufacturing centre in Australia in the 2010s, with a manufacturing output of $21.7\u00a0billion in 2013. Observers have credited Sydney's focus on the domestic market and high-tech manufacturing for its resilience against the high Australian dollar of the early 2010s. The \"Smithfield-Wetherill Park Industrial Estate\" in Western Sydney is the largest industrial estate in the Southern Hemisphere and is the centre of manufacturing and distribution in the region.\nTourism and international education.\nSydney is a gateway to Australia for many international visitors and ranks among the top sixty most visited cities in the world. It has hosted over 2.8\u00a0million international visitors in 2013, or nearly half of all international visits to Australia. These visitors spent 59\u00a0million nights in the city and a total of $5.9\u00a0billion. The countries of origin in descending order were China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Germany, Hong Kong, and India.\nThe city also received 8.3\u00a0million domestic overnight visitors in 2013 who spent a total of $6\u00a0billion. 26,700 workers in the City of Sydney were directly employed by tourism in 2011. There were 480,000 visitors and 27,500 people staying overnight each day in 2012. On average, the tourism industry contributes $36\u00a0million to the city's economy per day.\nPopular destinations include the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Watsons Bay, The Rocks, Sydney Tower, Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Garden, the Australian Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Queen Victoria Building, Sea Life Sydney Aquarium, Taronga Zoo, Bondi Beach, Luna Park and Sydney Olympic Park.\nMajor developmental projects designed to increase Sydney's tourism sector include a casino and hotel at Barangaroo and the redevelopment of East Darling Harbour, which involves a new exhibition and convention centre, now Australia's largest.\nSydney is the highest-ranking city in the world for international students. More than 50,000 international students study at the city's universities and a further 50,000 study at its vocational and English language schools. International education contributes $1.6\u00a0billion to the local economy and creates demand for 4,000 local jobs each year.\nHousing affordability.\nIn 2023, Sydney was ranked the least affordable city to buy a house in Australia and the second least affordable city in the world, after Hong Kong, with the average Sydney house price in late 2023 costing A$1.59 million, and the average unit price costing A$795,000. As of early 2024, Sydney is often described in the media as having a housing shortage, or suffering a housing crisis.\nDemographics.\nThe population of Sydney in 1788 was less than 1,000. With convict transportation it almost tripled in ten years to 2,953. For each decade since 1961 the population has increased by more than 250,000. The 2021 census recorded the population of Greater Sydney as 5,231,150. The Australian Treasury expects the population will grow to 6.5 million in 2033\u201334. The four most densely populated suburbs in Australia are located in Sydney with each having more than 13,000 residents per square kilometre (33,700 residents per square mile). Between 1971 and 2018, Sydney experienced a net loss of 716,832 people to the rest of Australia, but its population grew due to overseas arrivals and a healthy birth rate.\nThe median age of Sydney residents is 37 and 14.8% of people are 65 or older. 48.6% of Sydney's population is married whilst 36.7% have never been married. 49.0% of families are couples with children, 34.4% are couples without children, and 14.8% are single-parent families.\nAncestry and immigration.\nAt the 2021 census, the most common ancestries were: \nAt the 2021 census, 40.5% of Sydney's population was born overseas. Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China, India, England, Vietnam, Philippines and New Zealand.\nAt the 2021 census, 1.7% of Sydney's population identified as being Indigenous \u2014 Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.\nLanguage.\n42% of households in Sydney use a language other than English, with the most common being Mandarin (5%), Arabic (4.2%), Cantonese (2.8%), Vietnamese (2.2%) and Hindi (1.5%).\nReligion.\nIn 2021, Christianity was the largest religious affiliation at 46%, the largest denominations of which were Catholicism at 23.1% and Anglicanism at 9.2%. 30.3% of Sydney residents identified as having no religion. The most common non-Christian religious affiliations were Islam (6.3%), Hinduism (4.8%), Buddhism (3.8%), Sikhism (0.7%), and Judaism (0.7%). About 500 people identified with traditional Aboriginal religions.\nThe Church of England was the only recognised church before Governor Macquarie appointed official Catholic chaplains in 1820. Macquarie also ordered the construction of churches such as St Matthew's, St Luke's, St James's, and St Andrew's. Religious groups, alongside secular institutions, have played a significant role in education, health and charitable services throughout Sydney's history.\nCrime.\nCrime in Sydney is low, with \"The Independent\" ranking Sydney as the fifth safest city in the world in 2019. However, drug use is a significant problem. Methamphetamine is heavily consumed compared to other countries, while heroin is less common. One of the biggest crime-related issues in recent times was the introduction of lockout laws in February 2014, in an attempt to curb alcohol-fuelled violence. Patrons could not enter clubs or bars in the inner-city after 1:30am, and last drinks were called at 3am. The lockout laws were removed in January 2020.\nCulture.\nScience, art, and history.\nKu-ring-gai Chase National Park is rich in Indigenous Australian heritage, containing around 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal rock art \u2013 the largest cluster of Indigenous sites in Australia. The park's indigenous sites include petroglyphs, art sites, burial sites, caves, marriage areas, birthing areas, midden sites, and tool manufacturing locations, which are dated to be around 5,000 years old. The inhabitants of the area were the Garigal people. Other rock art sites exist in the Sydney region, such as in Terrey Hills and Bondi, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their quality, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by Indigenous Australians.\nThe Australian Museum opened in Sydney in 1827 with the purpose of collecting and displaying the natural wealth of the colony. It remains Australia's oldest natural history museum. In 1995 the Museum of Sydney opened on the site of the first Government House. It recounts the story of the city's development. Other museums include the Powerhouse Museum and the Australian National Maritime Museum.\nThe State Library of New South Wales holds the oldest library collections in Australia, being established as the Australian Subscription Library in 1826. The Royal Society of New South Wales, formed in 1866, encourages \"studies and investigations in science, art, literature, and philosophy\". It is based in a terrace house in Darlington owned by the University of Sydney. The Sydney Observatory building was constructed in 1859 and used for astronomy and meteorology research until 1982 before being converted into a museum.\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art was opened in 1991 and occupies an Art Deco building in Circular Quay. Its collection was founded in the 1940s by artist and art collector John Power and has been maintained by the University of Sydney. Sydney's other significant art institution is the Art Gallery of New South Wales which coordinates the Archibald Prize for portraiture. Sydney is also home to contemporary art gallery Artspace, housed in the historic Gunnery Building in Woolloomooloo, fronting Sydney Harbour.\nEntertainment.\nSydney's first commercial theatre opened in 1832 and nine more had commenced performances by the late 1920s. The live medium lost much of its popularity to the cinema during the Great Depression before experiencing a revival after World War II. Prominent theatres in the city today include State Theatre, Theatre Royal, Sydney Theatre, The Wharf Theatre, and Capitol Theatre. Sydney Theatre Company maintains a roster of local, classical, and international plays. It occasionally features Australian theatre icons such as David Williamson, Hugo Weaving, and Geoffrey Rush. The city's other prominent theatre companies are New Theatre, Belvoir, and Griffin Theatre Company. Sydney is also home to Event Cinemas' first theatre, which opened on George St in 1913, under its former Greater Union brand; the theatre currently operates, and is regarded as one of Australia's busiest cinema locations.\nThe Sydney Opera House is the home of Opera Australia and Sydney Symphony. It has staged over 100,000 performances and received 100\u00a0million visitors since opening in 1973. Two other important performance venues in Sydney are Town Hall and the City Recital Hall. The Sydney Conservatorium of Music is located adjacent to the Royal Botanic Garden and serves the Australian music community through education and its biannual Australian Music Examinations Board exams.\nMany writers have originated in and set their work in Sydney. Others have visited the city and commented on it. Some of them are commemorated in the Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay. The city was the headquarters for Australia's first published newspaper, the \"Sydney Gazette\". Watkin Tench's \"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay\" (1789) and \"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales\" (1793) have remained the best-known accounts of life in early Sydney. Since the infancy of the establishment, much of the literature set in Sydney were concerned with life in the city's slums and working-class communities, notably William Lane's \"The Working Man's Paradise\" (1892), Christina Stead's \"Seven Poor Men of Sydney\" (1934) and Ruth Park's \"The Harp in the South\" (1948). The first Australian-born female novelist, Louisa Atkinson, set several novels in Sydney. Contemporary writers, such as Elizabeth Harrower, were born in the city and set most of their work there\u2013Harrower's debut novel \"Down in the City\" (1957) was mostly set in a King's Cross apartment. Well known contemporary novels set in the city include Melina Marchetta's \"Looking for Alibrandi\" (1992), Peter Carey's \"30 Days in Sydney: A Wildly Distorted Account\" (1999), J. M. Coetzee's \"Diary of a Bad Year\" (2007) and Kate Grenville's \"The Secret River\" (2010). The Sydney Writers' Festival is held annually between April and May.\nFilmmaking in Sydney was prolific until the 1920s when spoken films were introduced and American productions gained dominance. The Australian New Wave saw a resurgence in film production, with many notable features shot in the city between the 1970s and 80s, helmed by directors such as Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and Gillian Armstrong. Fox Studios Australia commenced production in Sydney in 1998. Successful films shot in Sydney since then include \"The Matrix\", \"Lantana\", ', \"Moulin Rouge!\", ', \"Australia\", \"Superman Returns\", \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"Anyone but You\". The National Institute of Dramatic Art is based in Sydney and has several famous alumni such as Mel Gibson, Judy Davis, Baz Luhrmann, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Jacqueline Mckenzie.\nSydney hosts several festivals throughout the year. The city's New Year's Eve celebrations are the largest in Australia. The Royal Easter Show is held every year at Sydney Olympic Park. Sydney Festival is Australia's largest arts festival. The travelling rock music festival Big Day Out originated in Sydney. The city's two largest film festivals are Sydney Film Festival and Tropfest. Vivid Sydney is an annual outdoor exhibition of art installations, light projections, and music. In 2015, Sydney was ranked the 13th top fashion capital in the world. It hosts the Australian Fashion Week in autumn. Sydney Mardi Gras has commenced each February since 1979.\nSydney's Chinatown has had numerous locations since the 1850s. It moved from George Street to Campbell Street to its current setting in Dixon Street in 1980. Little Italy is located in Stanley Street.\nRestaurants, bars and nightclubs can be found in the entertainment hubs in the Sydney CBD (Darling Harbour, Barangaroo, The Rocks and George Street), Oxford Street, Surry Hills, Newtown and Parramatta. Kings Cross was previously considered the red-light district. The Star is the city's casino and is situated next to Darling Harbour while the new Crown Sydney resort is in nearby Barangaroo.\nMedia.\nThe \"Sydney Morning Herald\" is Australia's oldest newspaper still in print; it has been published continuously since 1831. Its competitor is \"The Daily Telegraph\", in print since 1879. Both papers have Sunday tabloid editions called \"The Sun-Herald\" and \"The Sunday Telegraph\" respectively. \"The Bulletin\" was founded in Sydney in 1880 and became Australia's longest running magazine. It closed after 128 years of continuous publication. Sydney heralded Australia's first newspaper, the \"Sydney Gazette\", published until 1842.\nEach of Australia's three commercial television networks and two public broadcasters is headquartered in Sydney. Nine's offices and news studios are in North Sydney, Ten is based in Pyrmont, and Seven is based in South Eveleigh in Redfern. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is located in Ultimo, and the Special Broadcasting Service is based in Artarmon. Multiple digital channels have been provided by all five networks since 2000. Foxtel is based in North Ryde and sells subscription cable television to most of the urban area. Sydney's first radio stations commenced broadcasting in the 1920s. Radio has managed to survive despite the introduction of television and the Internet. 2UE was founded in 1925 and under the ownership of Nine Entertainment is the oldest station still broadcasting. Competing stations include the more popular 2GB, ABC Radio Sydney, KIIS 106.5, Triple M, Nova 96.9 and 2Day FM.\nSport and outdoor activities.\nSydney's earliest migrants brought with them a passion for sport but were restricted by the lack of facilities and equipment. The first organised sports were boxing, wrestling, and horse racing from 1810 in Hyde Park. Horse racing remains popular and events such as the Golden Slipper Stakes attract widespread attention. The first cricket club was formed in 1826 and matches were played within Hyde Park throughout the 1830s and 1840s. Cricket is a favoured sport in summer and big matches have been held at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1878. The New South Wales Blues compete in the Sheffield Shield league and the Sydney Sixers and Sydney Thunder contest the national Big Bash Twenty20 competition.\nFirst played in Sydney in 1865, rugby grew to be the city's most popular football code by the 1880s. One-tenth of the state's population attended a New South Wales versus New Zealand rugby match in 1907. Rugby league separated from rugby union in 1908. The New South Wales Waratahs contest the Super Rugby competition, while the Sydney Rays represent the city in the National Rugby Championship. The national Wallabies rugby union team competes in Sydney in international matches such as the Bledisloe Cup, Rugby Championship, and World Cup. Sydney is home to nine of the seventeen teams in the National Rugby League competition: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Penrith Panthers, Parramatta Eels, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St George Illawarra Dragons, Sydney Roosters, and Wests Tigers.

The NSW Pride are a member of the Hockey One League. The Sydney Bears and Sydney Ice Dogs play in the Australian Ice Hockey League. The Swifts are competitors in the national women's netball league.\nMajor sporting venues.\nWomen were first allowed to participate in recreational swimming when separate baths were opened at Woolloomooloo Bay in the 1830s. From being illegal at the beginning of the century, sea bathing gained immense popularity during the early 1900s and the first surf lifesaving club was established at Bondi Beach. Disputes about appropriate clothing for surf bathing surfaced occasionally and concerned men as well as women. The City2Surf is an annual running race from the CBD to Bondi Beach and has been held since 1971. In 2010, 80,000 runners participated which made it the largest run of its kind in the world.\nSailing races have been held on Sydney Harbour since 1827. Yachting has been popular amongst wealthier residents since the 1840s and the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron was founded in 1862. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is a event that starts from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day. Since its inception in 1945 it has been recognised as one of the most difficult yacht races in the world. Six sailors died and 71 vessels of 115 failed to finish in the 1998 edition.\nThe Royal Sydney Golf Club is based in Rose Bay and since its opening in 1893 has hosted the Australian Open on 13 occasions. Royal Randwick Racecourse opened in 1833 and holds several major cups throughout the year.\nSydney benefitted from the construction of significant sporting infrastructure in preparation for its hosting of the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Sydney Olympic Park accommodates athletics, aquatics, tennis, hockey, archery, baseball, cycling, equestrian, and rowing facilities. It also includes the high capacity Stadium Australia used for rugby, soccer, and Australian rules football. The Sydney Football Stadium was completed in 1988 and was used for rugby and soccer matches. Sydney Cricket Ground was opened in 1878 and is used for both cricket and Australian rules football fixtures.\nSydney was one of the host cities during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Sydney Football Stadium and Stadium Australia were selected as venues, with the later hosting the final.\nThe Sydney International tennis tournament is held here at the beginning of each year as the warm-up for the Grand Slam in Melbourne. Two of the most successful tennis players in history (Ken Rosewall and Todd Woodbridge) were born in and live in the city.\nSydney co-hosted the FIBA Oceania Championship in 1979, 1985, 1989, 1995, 2007, 2009 and 2011.\nGovernment.\nHistorical governance.\nThe first five governors had near autocratic power in the colony of New South Wales, subject only to the laws of England and the supervision of the Colonial Office in London. Sydney was the seat of government for the colony which encompassed over half the Australian continent. The first Legislative Council met in 1826, and in 1842, the imperial parliament expanded and reformed the council, making it partly elected. In the same year, the town of Sydney officially became a city and an elected municipal council was established. The council had limited powers, mostly relating to services such as street lighting and drainage. Its boundaries were restricted to an area of 11.6 square kilometres, taking in the city centre and the modern suburbs of Woolloomooloo, Surry Hills, Chippendale, and Pyrmont. As Sydney grew, other municipal councils were formed to provide local administration.\nIn 1856, New South Wales achieved responsible government with the introduction of a bicameral parliament, based in Sydney, comprising a directly elected Legislative Assembly and a nominated Legislative Council. With the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Sydney became the capital of the state of New South Wales and its administration was divided between the Commonwealth, State and constituent local governments.\nGovernment in the present.\nIn common with other Australian capital cities, Sydney has no single local government covering its whole area. Local government areas have responsibilities such as local roads, libraries, child care, community services and waste collection, whereas the state government retains responsibility for main roads, traffic control, public transport, policing, education, and major infrastructure project. There are 33 local government areas which are wholly or mostly within Greater Sydney as defined by the Australian Statistical Geography Standard. Greater Sydney's boundaries encompass 49 state electoral districts and 24 federal electoral districts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSydney is the location of the secondary official residences of the Governor-General and Prime Minister \u2013 Admiralty House and Kirribilli House respectively. The Parliament of New South Wales sits in Parliament House on Macquarie Street. This building was completed in 1816 and first served as a hospital. The Legislative Council moved into its northern wing in 1829 and by 1852 had entirely supplanted the surgeons from their quarters. Several additions have been made as the Parliament has expanded, but it retains its original Georgian fa\u00e7ade. Government House was completed in 1845 and has served as the home of 25 Governors and 5 Governors-General. The Cabinet of Australia also meets in Sydney when needed.\nThe highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of New South Wales, located in Queen's Square. The city is also the home of numerous branches of the intermediate District Court of New South Wales and the lower Local Court of New South Wales.\nIn the past, the state has tended to resist amalgamating Sydney's more populated local government areas as merged councils could pose a threat to its governmental power. Established in 1842, the City of Sydney is one such local government area and includes the CBD and some adjoining inner suburbs. It is responsible for fostering development in the local area, providing local services (waste collection and recycling, libraries, parks, sporting facilities), promoting the interests of residents, supporting organisations that target the local community, and attracting and providing infrastructure for commerce, tourism, and industry. The City of Sydney is led by an elected Council and Lord Mayor.\nIn federal politics, Sydney was initially considered as a possibility for Australia's capital city; the newly created city of Canberra ultimately filled this role. Seven Australian Prime Ministers have been born in Sydney, more than any other city, including first Prime Minister Edmund Barton and current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nEssential public emergency services are provided and managed by the State Government. Greater Sydney is served by:\nInfrastructure.\nEducation.\nEducation became a focus for the colony from the 1870s when public schools began to form and schooling became compulsory. By 2011, 90% of working age residents had completed some schooling and 57% had completed the highest level of school. 1,390,703 people were enrolled in an educational institution in 2011 with 45.1% of these attending school and 16.5% studying at a university. Undergraduate or postgraduate qualifications are held by 22.5% of working age Sydney residents and 40.2% of working age residents of the City of Sydney. The most common fields of tertiary qualification are commerce (22.8%), engineering (13.4%), society and culture (10.8%), health (7.8%), and education (6.6%).\nThere are six public universities based in Sydney: The University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Technology Sydney, Macquarie University, Western Sydney University, and Australian Catholic University. Five public universities maintain secondary campuses in the city: the University of Notre Dame Australia, Central Queensland University, Victoria University, University of Wollongong, and University of Newcastle. Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University operate secondary campuses only designated for international students. In addition, four public universities offer programs in Sydney through third-party providers: University of the Sunshine Coast, La Trobe University, Federation University Australia and Charles Darwin University. 5.2% of residents of Sydney are attending a university. The University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney are ranked equal 19th in the world, the University of Technology Sydney is ranked in the top 100, while Macquarie University is ranked 237, and Western Sydney University is ranked 474.\nSydney has public, denominational, and independent schools. 7.8% of Sydney residents are attending primary school and 6.4% are enrolled in secondary school. There are 935 public preschool, primary, and secondary schools in Sydney that are administered by the New South Wales Department of Education. 14 of the 17 selective secondary schools in New South Wales are based in Sydney.\nPublic vocational education and training in Sydney are run by TAFE New South Wales and began with the opening of the Sydney Technical College in 1878. The college became the Sydney Institute in 1992 and now operates alongside its sister TAFE facilities across the Sydney metropolitan area, namely the Northern Sydney Institute, the Western Sydney Institute, and the South Western Sydney Institute. At the 2011 census, 2.4% of Sydney residents are enrolled in a TAFE course.\nHealth.\nThe first hospital in the new colony was a collection of tents at The Rocks. Many of the convicts that survived the trip suffered from dysentery, smallpox, scurvy, and typhoid. Healthcare facilities remained inadequate despite the arrival of a prefabricated hospital with the Second Fleet and the construction of new hospitals at Parramatta, Windsor, and Liverpool in the 1790s.\nGovernor Macquarie arranged for the construction of Sydney Hospital, completed in 1816. Parts of the facility have been repurposed for use as Parliament House but the hospital itself still operates. The city's first emergency department was established at Sydney Hospital in 1870. Demand for emergency medical care increased from 1895 with the introduction of an ambulance service. The Sydney Hospital also housed Australia's first teaching facility for nurses, the Nightingale Wing, established with the input of Florence Nightingale in 1868.\nHealthcare was recognised as a right in the early 1900s and Sydney's public hospitals came under the oversight of the Government of New South Wales. The administration of healthcare across Sydney is handled by eight local health districts: Central Coast, Illawarra Shoalhaven, Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains, Northern Sydney, South Eastern Sydney, South Western Sydney, and Western Sydney. The Prince of Wales Hospital was established in 1852 and became the first of several major hospitals to be opened. St Vincent's Hospital was founded in 1857, followed by Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in 1880, the Prince Henry Hospital in 1881, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 1882, the Royal North Shore Hospital in 1885, the St George Hospital in 1894, and the Nepean Hospital in 1895. Westmead Hospital in 1978 was the last major facility to open.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe motor vehicle, more than any other factor, has determined the pattern of Sydney's urban development since World War II. The growth of low-density housing in the city's outer suburbs has made car ownership necessary for hundreds of thousands of households. The percentage of trips taken by car has increased from 13% in 1947 to 50% in 1960 and 70% in 1971. The most important roads in Sydney were the nine Metroads, including the Sydney Orbital Network. Sydney's reliance on motor vehicles and its sprawling road network has been criticised by proponents of mass public transport and high-density housing. The Light Horse Interchange in western Sydney is the largest in the southern hemisphere.\nThere can be up to 350,000 cars using Sydney's roads simultaneously during peak hour, leading to significant traffic congestion. 84.9% of Sydney households own a motor vehicle and 46.5% own two or more. With a rate of 26.3% in 2014, Sydney has the highest utilisation of public transport for travel to work of any Australian capital. In contrast, in 2014 only 25.2% of working residents in the City of Sydney use a car, whilst 15.8% take a train, 13.3% use a bus, and 25.3% walk. Several significant infrastructure projects have been completed since. The CBD features a series of alleyways and lanes that provide off-street vehicular access to city buildings and as well as pedestrian routes through city buildings.\nSuburban trains.\nSydney has the largest public transport network in Australia, with 67% of residents having access to adequate public transport services. Sydney's rail network began with the construction of a rail line to present-day Granville in 1855. Afterwards, the network grew with European settlement in the 19th century. The first electric trains were introduced in 1926, by which point electric trams were also running. By 1991, all lines within Sydney were electrified. The rail network, as well as all public transport within Sydney, is ticketed through Opal cards, reusable and contactless cards that are used to automatically calculate and collect transport fares.\nEstablished in 1906, Central station is the largest and busiest railway station in the state and is the main hub of the city's rail network. Sydney Trains is the suburban rail service. Its tracks form part of the New South Wales railway network. It serves 168 stations across the city and had an annual ridership of 302\u00a0million passenger journeys in 2023\u201324. Sydney's railway was first constructed in 1854 with progressive extension to the network to serve both freight and passengers. The main station is the Central railway station in the southern part of the CBD. In the 1850s and 1860s, the railway reached areas that are now outer suburbs of Sydney.\nMetro.\nThe Sydney Metro is a driverless rapid transit network separate from the suburban rail network, with connections at major interchange stations. Currently, the network consists of a single line extending from Tallawong in the north-west to the city and Sydenham. This line, designated as the M1, will be extended to Bankstown in 2025 with suburbs previously on the Bankstown railway line currently closed for conversion to the metro. A new line through the inner west to Parramatta is planned to be built by 2030. It currently serves 21 stations. A line to serve the greater west is planned for 2026 and will include a station for the second international airport. Sydney metro operates with much higher frequency than the suburban rail network, with service intervals of 3-4 minutes compared to Sydney Trains' 10-15 minutes. The scheme is intended to increase Sydney's public transport capacity by 60%.\nLight rail.\nSydney once had one of the largest tram networks in the British Empire after London. It served routes covering . The internal combustion engine made buses more flexible than trams and consequently more popular, leading to the progressive closure of the network with the final tram operating in 1961. From 1930 there were 612 buses across Sydney carrying 90\u00a0million passengers per annum.\nIn 1997, the Inner West Light Rail opened between Central station and Wentworth Park. It ran on a freight line extending from the city to Darling Harbour and the Fish Markets, part of the Metropolitan Goods Lines. The line was extended to Lilyfield in 2000 and then Dulwich Hill in 2014. It links the Inner West and Darling Harbour with Central station and facilitated 9.1\u00a0million journeys in the 2016\u201317 financial year. A second, the CBD and South East Light Rail line serving the CBD and Eastern Suburbs opened in 2019\u20132020. A light rail line serving the western hub of Parramatta opened in 2024. The project is divided into two stages, with the first (the L4) replacing the Carlingford railway line that closed in 2020. The second stage of the project, the L5, servicing the Olympic park, is currently under construction.\nBuses.\nBus services are conducted by private operators under contract to Transport for NSW. Integrated tickets called Opal cards operate on bus routes. In total, nearly 225\u00a0million boardings were recorded across the bus network. NightRide is a nightly bus service that operate between midnight and 5am.\nFerries.\nAt the time the Sydney Harbour Bridge opened in 1932, the city's ferry service was the largest in the world. Patronage declined from 37\u00a0million passengers in 1945 to 11\u00a0million in 1963 but has recovered somewhat in recent years. From its hub at Circular Quay, the ferry network extends from Manly to Parramatta. Ferries in sydney are operated by Transdev Sydney Ferries and operate on 10 routes across the harbour and Parramatta River.\nAirports.\nSydney Kingsford Smith Airport is located in Mascot. It services 46 international and 23 domestic destinations. As the busiest airport in Australia, it handled 37.9\u00a0million passengers in 2013 and 530,000 tonnes of freight in 2011.\nA second airport, Western Sydney International Airport, is under construction at Badgerys Creek and will open in late 2026, at a cost of $2.5 billion. Notably, it will not feature a curfew, unlike Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport, which imposes a suspension of all aircraft operations between 11pm and 6am. Bankstown Airport is Sydney's second busiest airport, and serves general aviation, charter and some scheduled cargo flights. Bankstown is also the fourth busiest airport in Australia by number of aircraft movements. Other airports include Camden Airport, The Oaks Airfield, and Menangle Airfield, which are mostly used for general aviation, flight training and by private operators. Seaplane terminals are located at Rose Bay and Palm Beach, and military airports at Holsworthy and Richmond. Port Botany has surpassed Port Jackson as the city's major shipping port. Cruise ship terminals are located at Sydney Cove and White Bay.\nUtilities.\nObtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times. A catchment called the Tank Stream sourced water from what is now the CBD but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the 1700s. The Botany Swamps Scheme was one of several ventures during the mid-1800s that saw the construction of wells, tunnels, steam pumping stations, and small dams to service Sydney's growing population.\nThe Upper Nepean Scheme came into operation in 1886. It transports water from the Nepean, Cataract, and Cordeaux rivers and continues to service about 15% of Sydney's water needs. Dams were built on these three rivers between 1907 and 1935. In 1977 the Shoalhaven Scheme brought several more dams into service.\nThe state-owned corporation WaterNSW now manages eleven major dams: Warragamba, one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world, Woronora, Cataract, Cordeaux, Nepean, Avon, Wingecarribee Reservoir, Fitzroy Falls Reservoir, Tallowa, the Blue Mountains Dams, and Prospect Reservoir. Water is collected from five catchment areas covering and total storage amounts to . The Sydney Desalination Plant came into operation in 2010. WaterNSW supplies bulk water to Sydney Water, a state-owned corporation that operates water distribution, sewerage and storm water management services.\nSydney's electricity infrastructure is maintained by Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy. Their combined networks include over 815,000 poles and of cables. Submarine communications cable systems in Sydney include the Australia\u2013Japan Cable, Telstra Endeavour and the Southern Cross Cable, which link Australia and countries in the Pacific.\nEnvironmental issues and pollution reduction.\nAir quality.\nAs climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for Australia, Sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution and emissions and maintaining water quality. The release of the Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme (MAQS) led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in Sydney, allowing the government to form appropriate responses.\nThe 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season significantly impacted outer Sydney and dramatically reduced air quality, leading to a smoky haze that lingered for days. The air quality was 11 times the hazardous level in some days, worse than New Delhi's; it was compared to \"smoking 32 cigarettes\" by Brian Oliver, a respiratory diseases scientist at the University of Technology Sydney. Since Sydney is surrounded by bushland and forest, bushfires can ring the region in a natural phenomena that is labelled \"ring of fire\".\nThe City of Sydney became the first council in Australia to achieve formal certification as carbon-neutral in 2008. The city has reduced its 2007 carbon emissions by 6% and since 2006 has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to 20%. The \"Sustainable Sydney 2030\" program presented a guide to reducing energy in homes and offices by 30%. Reductions in energy consumption have slashed energy bills by $30\u00a0million a year. Solar panels have been established on many CBD buildings to minimise carbon pollution by around 3,000 tonnes a year.\nThe city also has an \"urban forest growth strategy\", in which it aims to regularly increase the tree coverage in the city by frequently planting trees with strong leaf density and vegetation to provide cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather, thus lowering city temperatures. Sydney has also become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy-efficient. The One Central Park development, completed in 2013, is an example of this implementation.\nCar-dependency.\nAustralian cities are some of the most car-dependent cities in the world, especially by world city standards, although Sydney's is the lowest of Australia's major cities at 66%. Sydney also has the highest usage of public transport in an Australian city, at 27%\u2013comparable with New York City, Shanghai and Berlin. Despite its high ranking for an Australian city, Sydney has a low level of public transport services, with a historically low-density layout and significant urban sprawl, thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency.\nStrategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging public transport, initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of 10 new electric cars, the largest order of the pollution-free vehicle in Australia. Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, which contribute to climate change. Cycling trips increased by 113% across Sydney's inner-city from 2010 to 2015, at which point about 2,000 bikes were passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday. Transport developments in the north-west and east of the city have been designed to encourage use of the expanding public transportation system.\nSister cities.\nSister cities of Sydney include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27863", "revid": "24013162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27863", "title": "Sword", "text": "Long bladed weapon\nA sword is an edged, bladed weapon intended for manual cutting or thrusting. Its blade, longer than a knife or dagger, is attached to a hilt and can be straight or curved. A thrusting sword tends to have a straighter blade with a pointed tip. A slashing sword is more likely to be curved and to have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing. The precise definition of a sword varies by historical epoch and geographic region.\nHistorically, the sword developed in the Bronze Age, evolving from the dagger; the earliest specimens date to about 1600 BC. The later Iron Age sword remained fairly short and without a crossguard. The spatha, as it developed in the Late Roman army, became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages, at first adopted as the Migration Period sword, and only in the High Middle Ages, developed into the classical arming sword with crossguard. The word \"sword\" continues the Old English, \"sweord\".\nThe use of a sword is known as swordsmanship or, in a modern context, as fencing. In the early modern period, western sword design diverged into two forms, the thrusting swords and the sabres.\nThrusting swords such as the rapier and eventually the smallsword were designed to impale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds. Their long and straight yet light and well balanced design made them highly maneuverable and deadly in a duel but fairly ineffective when used in a slashing or chopping motion. A well aimed lunge and thrust could end a fight in seconds with just the sword's point, leading to the development of a fighting style which closely resembles modern fencing.\nSlashing swords such as the sabre and similar blades such as the cutlass were built more heavily and were more typically used in warfare. Built for slashing and chopping at multiple enemies, often from horseback, the sabre's long curved blade and slightly forward weight balance gave it a deadly character all its own on the battlefield. Most sabres also had sharp points and double-edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier after soldier in a cavalry charge. Sabres continued to see battlefield use until the early 20th century. The US Navy M1917 Cutlass used in World War I was kept in their armory well into World War II and many Marines were issued a variant called the M1941 Cutlass as a makeshift jungle machete during the Pacific War.\nNon-European weapons classified as swords include single-edged weapons such as the Middle Eastern scimitar, the Chinese \"dao\" and the related Japanese \"katana\". The Chinese \"ji\u00e0n\" is an example of a non-European double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-edged Iron Age sword.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nBronze Age.\nThe first weapons that can be described as \"swords\" date to around 3300 BC. They have been found in Arslantepe, Turkey, are made from arsenical bronze, and are about long. Some of them are inlaid with silver.\nThe sword developed from the knife or dagger. The sword became differentiated from the dagger during the Bronze Age (\"c.\" 3000 BC), when copper and bronze weapons were produced with long leaf-shaped blades and with hilts consisting of an extension of the blade in handle form. A knife is unlike a dagger in that a knife has only one cutting surface, while a dagger has two cutting surfaces. Construction of longer blades became possible during the 3rd millennium BC in the Middle East, first in arsenic copper, then in tin-bronze.\nBlades longer than were rare and not practical until the late Bronze Age because the Young's modulus (stiffness) of bronze is relatively low, and consequently longer blades would bend easily. The development of the sword out of the dagger was gradual; the first weapons that can be classified as swords without any ambiguity are those found in Minoan Crete, dated to about 1700 BC, reaching a total length of more than . These are the \"type A\" swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.\nOne of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of swords of the European Bronze Age was the \"Naue II\" type (named for Julius Naue who first described them), also known as \"Griffzungenschwert\" (lit.\u2009'grip-tongue sword'). This type first appears in c. the 13th century BC in Northern Italy (or a general Urnfield background), and survives well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries. During its lifetime, metallurgy changed from bronze to iron, but not its basic design.\nNaue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as Ugarit, beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the Bronze Age collapse. Naue II swords could be as long as 85\u00a0cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70\u00a0cm range. Robert Drews linked the Naue Type II Swords, which spread from Southern Europe into the Mediterranean, with the Bronze Age collapse. Naue II swords, along with Nordic full-hilted swords, were made with functionality and aesthetics in mind. The hilts of these swords were beautifully crafted and often contained false rivets in order to make the sword more visually appealing. Swords coming from northern Denmark and northern Germany usually contained three or more fake rivets in the hilt.\nSword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age Shang dynasty. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the Warring States period and Qin dynasty. Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high tin edges over softer, lower tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see sword of Goujian). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high tin bronze (17\u201321% tin) which is very hard and breaks if stressed too far, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends if stressed too far. Although iron swords were made alongside bronze, it was not until the early Han period that iron completely replaced bronze.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, earliest available Bronze age swords of copper were discovered in the Indus Valley civilization sites in the northwestern regions of South Asia. Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the Ganges-Jamuna Doab region of Indian subcontinent, consisting of bronze but more commonly copper. Diverse specimens have been discovered in Fatehgarh, where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to times between 1700 and 1400 BC. Other swords from this period in India have been discovered from Kallur, Raichur.\nIron Age.\nIron became increasingly common from the 13th century BC. Before that the use of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipping of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.\nAncient swords are often found at burial sites. The sword was often placed on the right side of the corpse. Many times the sword was kept over the corpse. In many late Iron Age graves, the sword and the scabbard were bent at 180 degrees. It was known as killing the sword. Thus they might have considered swords as the most potent and powerful object.\nIndian antiquity.\nHigh-carbon steel for swords, which would later appear as Damascus steel, was likely introduced in India around the mid-1st millennium BC. The \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" mentions swords of Indian iron and steel being exported from ancient India to ancient Greece. Blades from the Indian subcontinent made of Damascus steel also found their way into Persia.\nGreco-Roman antiquity.\nBy the time of Classical Antiquity and the Parthian and Sassanid Empires in Iran, iron swords were common. The Greek \"xiphos\" and the Roman \"gladius\" are typical examples of the type, measuring some . The late Roman Empire introduced the longer \"spatha\" (the term for its wielder, \"spatharius\", became a court rank in Constantinople), and from this time, the term \"longsword\" is applied to swords comparatively long for their respective periods.\nSwords from the Parthian and Sassanian Empires were quite long, the blades on some late Sassanian swords being just under a metre long.\nSwords were also used to administer various physical punishments, such as non-surgical amputation or capital punishment by decapitation. The use of a sword, an honourable weapon, was regarded in Europe since Roman times as a privilege reserved for the nobility and the upper classes.\nPersian antiquity.\nIn the first millennium BC, the Persian armies used a sword that was originally of Scythian design called the \"akinaka\" (acinaces). However, the great conquests of the Persians made the sword more famous as a Persian weapon, to the extent that the true nature of the weapon has been lost somewhat as the name \"akinaka\" has been used to refer to whichever form of sword the Persian army favoured at the time.\nIt is widely believed that the original \"akinaka\" was a 35 to 45\u00a0cm (14 to 18 inch) double-edged sword. The design was not uniform and in fact identification is made more on the nature of the scabbard than the weapon itself; the scabbard usually has a large, decorative mount allowing it to be suspended from a belt on the wearer's right side. Because of this, it is assumed that the sword was intended to be drawn with the blade pointing downwards ready for surprise stabbing attacks.\nIn the 12th century, the Seljuq dynasty had introduced the curved \"shamshir\" to Persia, and this was in extensive use by the early 16th century.\nChinese antiquity.\nChinese iron swords made their first appearance in the later part of the Western Zhou dynasty, but iron and steel swords were not widely used until the 3rd century BC Han dynasty. The Chinese \"dao\" (\u5200 pinyin d\u0101o) is single-edged, sometimes translated as sabre or broadsword, and the \"jian\" (\u528d or \u5251 pinyin ji\u00e0n) is double-edged. The \"zhanmadao\" (literally \"horse chopping sword\") is an extremely long, anti-cavalry sword from the Song dynasty era.\nMiddle Ages.\nEurope.\nEarly and High Middle Ages.\nDuring the Middle Ages, sword technology improved, and the sword became a very advanced weapon. The spatha type remained popular throughout the Migration period and well into the Middle Ages. Vendel Age spathas were decorated with Germanic artwork (not unlike the Germanic bracteates fashioned after Roman coins). The Viking Age saw again a more standardized production, but the basic design remained indebted to the spatha.\nAround the 10th century, the use of properly quenched hardened and tempered steel started to become much more common than in previous periods. The Frankish 'Ulfberht' blades (the name of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high quality. Charles the Bald tried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by Vikings in raids against the Franks.\nWootz steel (which is also known as Damascus steel) was a unique and highly prized steel developed on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a globular cementite in a matrix of pearlite. The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nIt was only from the 11th century that Norman swords began to develop the crossguard (quillons). During the Crusades of the 12th to 13th century, this cruciform type of arming sword remained essentially stable, with variations mainly concerning the shape of the pommel. These swords were designed as cutting weapons, although effective points were becoming common to counter improvements in armour, especially the 14th-century change from mail to plate armour.\nIt was during the 14th century, with the growing use of more advanced armour, that the hand and a half sword, also known as a \"bastard sword\", came into being. It had an extended grip that meant it could be used with either one or two hands. Though these swords did not provide a full two-hand grip they allowed their wielders to hold a shield or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to use it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow.\nIn the Middle Ages, the sword was often used as a symbol of the word of God. The names given to many swords in mythology, literature, and history reflected the high prestige of the weapon and the wealth of the owner.\nLate Middle Ages.\nFrom around 1300 to 1500, in concert with improved armour, innovative sword designs evolved more and more rapidly. The main transition was the lengthening of the grip, allowing two-handed use, and a longer blade. By 1400, this type of sword, at the time called \"langes Schwert\" (longsword) or \"spadone\", was common, and a number of 15th- and 16th-century \"Fechtb\u00fccher\" offering instructions on their use survive. Another variant was the specialized armour-piercing swords of the estoc type. The longsword became popular due to its extreme reach and its cutting and thrusting abilities.\nThe estoc became popular because of its ability to thrust into the gaps between plates of armour. The grip was sometimes wrapped in wire or coarse animal hide to provide a better grip and to make it harder to knock a sword out of the user's hand.\nA number of manuscripts covering longsword combat and techniques dating from the 13th\u201316th centuries exist in German, Italian, and English, providing extensive information on longsword combatives as used throughout this period. Many of these are now readily available online.\nIn the 16th century, the large zweih\u00e4nder was used by the elite German and Swiss mercenaries known as doppels\u00f6ldners. \"Zweih\u00e4nder\", literally translated, means two-hander. The \"zweih\u00e4nder\" possesses a long blade, as well as a huge guard for protection. It is estimated that some \"zweih\u00e4nder\" swords were over long, with the one ascribed to Frisian warrior Pier Gerlofs Donia being long. The gigantic blade length was perfectly designed for manipulating and pushing away enemy polearms, which were major weapons around this time, in both Germany and Eastern Europe. \"Doppels\u00f6ldners\" also used \"katzbalgers\", which means 'cat-gutter'. The \"katzbalger's\" S-shaped guard and blade made it perfect for bringing in when the fighting became too close to use a \"zweih\u00e4nder\".\nCivilian use of swords became increasingly common during the late Renaissance, with duels being a preferred way to honourably settle disputes.\nThe side-sword was a type of war sword used by infantry during the Renaissance of Europe. This sword was a direct descendant of the knightly sword. Quite popular between the 16th and 17th centuries, they were ideal for handling the mix of armoured and unarmoured opponents of that time. A new technique of placing one's finger on the \"ricasso\" to improve the grip (a practice that would continue in the rapier) led to the production of hilts with a guard for the finger. This sword design eventually led to the development of the civilian rapier, but it was not replaced by it, and the side-sword continued to be used during the rapier's lifetime. As it could be used for both cutting and thrusting, the term \"cut and thrust sword\" is sometimes used interchangeably with side-sword. As rapiers became more popular, attempts were made to hybridize the blade, sacrificing the effectiveness found in each unique weapon design. These are still considered side-swords and are sometimes labeled \"sword rapier\" or \"cutting rapier\" by modern collectors.\nSide-swords used in conjunction with bucklers became so popular that it caused the term swashbuckler to be coined. This word stems from the new fighting style of the side-sword and buckler which was filled with much \"swashing and making a noise on the buckler\".\nWithin the Ottoman Empire, the use of a curved sabre called the \"yatagan\" started in the mid-16th century. It would become the weapon of choice for many in Turkey and the Balkans.\nThe sword in this time period was the most personal weapon, the most prestigious, and the most versatile for close combat, but it came to decline in military use as technology, such as the crossbow and firearms changed warfare. However, it maintained a key role in civilian self-defence.\nMiddle East.\nThe earliest evidence of curved swords, or scimitars (and other regional variants as the Arabian \"saif\", the Persian \"shamshir\" and the Turkic \"kilij\") is from the 9th century, when it was used among soldiers in the Khurasan region of Persia.\nAfrica.\nThe \"takoba\" is a type of broadsword originating in the western Sahel, descended from various Byzantine and Islamic swords. It has a straight double-edged blade measuring about one meter in length, usually imported from Europe.\nAbyssinian swords related to the Persian \"shamshir\" are known as \"shotel\". The Asante people adopted swords under the name of \"akrafena\". They are still used today in ceremonies, such as the Odwira festival.\nEast Asia.\nAs steel technology improved, single-edged weapons became popular throughout Asia. Derived from the Chinese \"jian\" or \"dao\", the Korean \"hwandudaedo\" are known from the early medieval Three Kingdoms. Production of the Japanese \"tachi\", a precursor to the \"katana\", is recorded from c. AD 900 (see Japanese sword).\nJapan was famous for the swords it forged in the early 13th century for the class of warrior-nobility known as the Samurai. Western historians have said that Japanese \"katana\" were among the finest cutting weapons in world military history. The types of swords used by the Samurai included the \"\u014ddachi\" (extra long field sword), \"tachi\" (long cavalry sword), \"katana\" (long sword), and \"wakizashi\" (shorter companion sword for \"katana\"). Japanese swords that pre-date the rise of the samurai caste include the \"tsurugi\" (straight double-edged blade) and \"chokut\u014d\" (straight one-edged blade). Japanese swordmaking reached the height of its development in the 15th and 16th centuries, when samurai increasingly found a need for a sword to use in closer quarters, leading to the creation of the modern \"katana\". High quality Japanese swords have been exported to neighboring Asian countries since before the 11th century. From the 15th century to the 16th century, more than 200,000 swords were exported, reaching a quantitative peak, but these were simple swords made exclusively for mass production, specialized for export and lending to conscripted farmers (\"ashigaru\").\nSouth Asia.\nThe \"khanda\" is a double-edge straight sword. It is often featured in religious iconography, theatre and art depicting the ancient history of India. Some communities venerate the weapon as a symbol of Shiva. It is a common weapon in the martial arts in the Indian subcontinent. The \"khanda\" often appears in Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh scriptures and art. In Sri Lanka, a unique wind furnace was used to produce the high-quality steel. This gave the blade a very hard cutting edge and beautiful patterns. For these reasons it became a very popular trading material.\nThe \"firangi\" (, derived from the Arabic term for a Western European, a \"Frank\") was a sword type which used blades manufactured in Western Europe and imported by the Portuguese, or made locally in imitation of European blades. Because of its length the \"firangi\" is usually regarded as primarily a cavalry weapon. The sword has been especially associated with the Marathas, who were famed for their cavalry. However, the \"firangi\" was also widely used by Sikhs and Rajputs.\nThe \"talwar\" () is a type of curved sword from India and other countries of the Indian subcontinent, it was adopted by communities such as Rajputs, Sikhs and Marathas, who favored the sword as their main weapon. It became more widespread in the medieval era.\nThe \"urumi\" ( , lit. curling blade; ; Hindi: ) is a \"sword\" with a flexible whip-like blade.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn Indonesia, the images of Indian style swords can be found in Hindu gods statues from ancient Java circa 8th to 10th century. However the native types of blade known as \"kris\", \"parang\", \"klewang\" and \"golok\" were more popular as weapons. These daggers are shorter than a sword but longer than a common dagger.\nIn the Philippines, traditional large swords known as \"kampilans\" and \"panabas\" were used in combat by the natives. A notable wielder of the \"kampilan\" was Lapu-Lapu, the king of Mactan and his warriors who defeated the Spaniards and killed Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan at the Battle of Mactan on 27 April 1521. Traditional swords in the Philippines were immediately banned, but the training in swordsmanship was later hidden from the occupying Spaniards by practices in dances. But because of the banning, Filipinos were forced to use swords that were disguised as farm tools. \"Bolos\" and baliswords were used during the revolutions against the colonialists not only because ammunition for guns was scarce, but also for concealability while walking in crowded streets and homes. \"Bolos\" were also used by young boys who joined their parents in the revolution and by young girls and their mothers in defending the town while the men were on the battlefields. During the Philippine\u2013American War in events such as the Battle of Balangiga, most of an American company was hacked to death or seriously injured by \"bolo\"-wielding guerillas in Balangiga, Samar. When the Japanese took control of the country, several American special operations groups stationed in the Philippines were introduced to Filipino martial arts and swordsmanship, leading to this style reaching America despite the fact that natives were reluctant to allow outsiders in on their fighting secrets.\nPre-Columbian Americas.\nThe \"macuahuitl\" is a wooden broadsword and club that was utilized by various Mesoamerican civilizations, such as those of the Aztecs, Maya, Olmecs, Toltecs, and Mixtecs.\nPacific Islands.\nIn the Gilbert Islands, the native Kiribati people have developed a type of broadsword made from shark teeth, which serves a similar function to the \"leiomano\" used by the Native Hawaiians.\nEarly modern history.\nMilitary sword.\nA single-edged type of sidearm used by the Hussites was popularized in 16th-century Germany under its Czech name \"dusack\", also known as \"S\u00e4bel auf Teutsch gefasst\" (\"sabre fitted in the German manner\"). A closely related weapon is the \"schnepf\" or Swiss sabre used in Early Modern Switzerland.\nThe cut-and-thrust mortuary sword was used after 1625 by cavalry during the English Civil War. This (usually) two-edged sword sported a half-basket hilt with a straight blade some 90\u2013105\u00a0cm long. Later in the 17th century, the swords used by cavalry became predominantly single-edged. The so-called walloon sword (\"\u00e9p\u00e9e wallone\") was common in the Thirty Years' War and Baroque era. Its hilt was ambidextrous with shell-guards and knuckle-bow that inspired 18th-century continental hunting hangers. Following their campaign in the Netherlands in 1672, the French began producing this weapon as their first regulation sword. Weapons of this design were also issued to the Swedish army from the time of Gustavus Adolphus until as late as the 1850s.\nDuelling sword.\nThe rapier is believed to have evolved either from the Spanish \"espada ropera\" or from the swords of the Italian nobility somewhere in the later part of the 16th century. The rapier differed from most earlier swords in that it was not a military weapon but a primarily civilian sword. Both the rapier and the Italian schiavona developed the crossguard into a basket-shaped guard for hand protection.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the shorter small sword became an essential fashion accessory in European countries and the New World, though in some places such as the Scottish Highlands large swords as the basket-hilted broadsword were preferred, and most wealthy men and military officers carried one slung from a belt. Both the small sword and the rapier remained popular dueling swords well into the 18th century.\nAs the wearing of swords fell out of fashion, canes took their place in a gentleman's wardrobe. This developed to the gentlemen in the Victorian era to use the umbrella. Some examples of canes\u2014those known as sword canes or swordsticks\u2014incorporate a concealed blade. The French martial art \"la canne\" developed to fight with canes and swordsticks and has now evolved into a sport. The English martial art singlestick is very similar.\nWith the rise of the pistol duel, the duelling sword fell out of fashion long before the practice of duelling itself. By about 1770, English duelists enthusiastically adopted the pistol, and sword duels dwindled. However, the custom of duelling with ep\u00e9es persisted well into the 20th century in France. Such modern duels were not fought to the death; the duellists' aim was instead merely to draw blood from the opponent's sword arm.\nLate modern history.\nMilitary sidearm.\nTowards the end of its useful life, the sword served more as a weapon of self-defence than for use on the battlefield, and the military importance of swords steadily decreased during the Modern Age. Even as a personal sidearm, the sword began to lose its preeminence in the early 19th century, reflecting the development of reliable handguns.\nHowever, swords were still normally carried in combat by cavalrymen and by officers of other branches throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, both in colonial and European warfare. For example, during the Aceh War the Acehnese \"klewangs\", a sword similar to the machete, proved very effective in close quarters combat with Dutch troops, leading the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army to adopt a heavy cutlass, also called \"klewang\" (very similar in appearance to the US Navy Model 1917 Cutlass) to counter it. Mobile troops armed with carbines and klewangs succeeded in suppressing Aceh resistance where traditional infantry with rifle and bayonet had failed. From that time on until the 1950s the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, Royal Dutch Army, Royal Dutch Navy and Dutch police used these cutlasses called Klewang.\nSwords continued in general peacetime use by cavalry of most armies during the years prior to World War I. The British Army formally adopted a completely new design of cavalry sword in 1908, almost the last change in British Army weapons before the outbreak of the war. At the outbreak of World War I infantry officers in all combatant armies then involved (French, German, British, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Belgian and Serbian) still carried swords as part of their field equipment. On mobilization in August 1914 all serving British Army officers were required to have their swords sharpened as the only peacetime use of the weapon had been for saluting on parade. The high visibility and limited practical use of the sword however led to it being abandoned within weeks, although most cavalry continued to carry sabres throughout the war. While retained as a symbol of rank and status by at least senior officers of infantry, artillery and other branches, the sword was usually left with non-essential baggage when units reached the front line. It was not until the late 1920s and early 1930s that this historic weapon was finally discarded for all but ceremonial purposes by most remaining horse mounted regiments of Europe and the Americas.\nIn China troops used the long anti-cavalry \"miao dao\" well into the Second Sino-Japanese War. The last units of British heavy cavalry switched to using armoured vehicles as late as 1938. Swords and other dedicated melee weapons were used occasionally by many countries during World War II, but typically as a secondary weapon as they were outclassed by coexisting firearms. A notable exception was the Imperial Japanese Army where, for cultural reasons, all officers and warrant officers carried the shin-gunto (\"new military sword\") into battle from 1934 until 1945.\nCeremonial use.\nSwords are commonly worn as a ceremonial item by officers in many military and naval services throughout the world. Occasions to wear swords include any event in dress uniforms where the rank-and-file carry arms: parades, reviews, courts-martial, tattoos, and changes of command. They are also commonly worn for officers' weddings, and when wearing dress uniforms to church\u2014although they are rarely actually worn in the church itself.\nIn the British forces, swords are also worn for any appearance at Court. In the United States, some Navy and Marine officers are required to own a sword, which can be prescribed for any formal outdoor ceremonial occasion. They are also worn by Non-Commissioned Officers in some circumstances.\nReligious.\nIn the occult practices of Wicca, a sword or knife often referred to as an athame is used as a magical tool.\nSword replicas.\nThe production of replicas of historical swords originates with 19th-century historicism. Contemporary replicas can range from cheap factory produced look-alikes to exact recreations of individual artifacts, including an approximation of the historical production methods.\nSome kinds of swords are still commonly used today as weapons, often as a side arm for military infantry. The Japanese \"katana\", \"wakizashi\" and \"tant\u014d\" are carried by some infantry and officers in Japan and other parts of Asia and the \"kukri\" is the official melee weapon for Nepal. Other swords in use today are the sabre, the scimitar, the shortsword and the machete.\nMorphology.\nThe sword consists of the blade and the hilt. The term \"scabbard\" applies to the cover for the sword blade when not in use.\nBlade.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nParts of a sword \nThere is considerable variation in the detailed design of sword blades. The diagram opposite shows a typical Medieval European sword.\nEarly iron blades have rounded points due to the limited metallurgy of the time. These were still effective for thrusting against lightly armoured opponents. As armour advanced, blades were made narrower, stiffer and sharply pointed to defeat the armour by thrusting.\nDedicated cutting blades are wide and thin, and often have grooves known as fullers which lighten the blade at the cost of some of the blade's stiffness. The edges of a cutting sword are almost parallel. Blades oriented for the thrust have thicker blades, sometimes with a distinct midrib for increased stiffness, with a strong taper and an acute point. The geometry of a cutting sword blade allows for acute edge angles. An edge with an acuter angle is more inclined to degrade quickly in combat situations than an edge with a more obtuse angle. Also, an acute edge angle is not the primary factor of a blade's sharpness.\nThe part of the blade between the center of percussion (CoP) and the point is called the \"foible\" (weak) of the blade, and that between the center of balance (CoB) and the hilt is the \"forte\" (strong). The section in between the CoP and the CoB is the \"middle\".\nThe \"ricasso\" or \"shoulder\" identifies a short section of blade immediately below the guard that is left completely unsharpened. Many swords have no ricasso. On some large weapons, such as the German \"Zweih\u00e4nder\", a metal cover surrounded the ricasso, and a swordsman might grip it in one hand to wield the weapon more easily in close-quarter combat.\nThe ricasso normally bears the maker's mark.\nThe tang is the extension of the blade to which the hilt is fitted.\nOn Japanese blades, the maker's mark appears on the tang under the grip.\nHilt.\nThe hilt is the collective term for the parts allowing for the handling and control of the blade; these consist of the grip, the pommel, and a simple or elaborate guard, which in post-Viking Age swords could consist of only a crossguard (called a cruciform hilt or quillons). The pommel was originally designed as a stop to prevent the sword slipping from the hand. From around the 11th century onward it became a counterbalance to the blade, allowing a more fluid style of fighting. It can also be used as a blunt instrument at close range, and its weight affects the centre of percussion. In later times a \"sword knot\" or \"tassel\" was sometimes added. By the 17th century, with the growing use of firearms and the accompanying decline in the use of armour, many rapiers and dueling swords had developed elaborate basket hilts, which protect the palm of the wielder and rendered the gauntlet obsolete. By contrast, Japanese swords of the early modern period customarily used a small disc guard, or .\nIn late medieval and Renaissance era European swords, a flap of leather called the \"chappe\" or \"rain guard\" was attached to a sword's crossguard at the base of the hilt to protect the mouth of the scabbard and prevent water from entering.\nSword scabbards and suspension.\nCommon accessories to the sword include the scabbard and baldric, known as a 'sword belt'.\nTypology.\nSword typology is based on morphological criteria on the one hand (blade shape (cross-section, taper, and length), shape and size of the hilt and pommel), and age and place of origin on the other (Bronze Age, Iron Age, European (medieval, early modern, modern), Asian).\nThe relatively comprehensive Oakeshott typology was created by historian and illustrator Ewart Oakeshott as a way to define and catalogue European swords of the medieval period based on physical form, including blade shape and hilt configuration. The typology also focuses on the smaller, and in some cases contemporary, single-handed swords such as the arming sword.\nSingle vs. double-edged.\nAs noted above, the terms longsword, broad sword, great sword, and Gaelic claymore are used relative to the era under consideration, and each term designates a particular type of sword.\n\"Jian\".\nIn most Asian countries, a sword (\"jian\" \u528d, geom (\uac80), \"ken/tsurugi\" (\u5263) is a double-edged straight-bladed weapon, while a knife or sabre (\"d\u0101o\" \u5200, \"do\" (\ub3c4), \"to/katana\" (\u5200) refers to a single-edged object.\n\"Kirpan\".\nAmong the Sikhs, the sword is held in very high esteem. A single-edged sword is called a \"kirpan\", and its double-edged counterpart a \"khanda\" or \"tegha\".\n\"Churika\".\nThe South Indian \"churika\" is a handheld double-edged sword traditionally used in the Malabar region of Kerala. It is also worshipped as the weapon of Vettakkorumakan, the hunter god in Hinduism.\nBacksword and falchion.\nEuropean terminology does give generic names for single-edged and double-edged blades but refers to specific types with the term 'sword' covering them all. For example, the backsword may be so called because it is single-edged but the falchion which is also single-edged is given its own specific name.\nSingle vs. two-handed use.\nTwo-handed.\nA two-handed sword is any sword that usually requires two hands to wield, or more specifically the very large swords of the 16th century.\nThroughout history two-handed swords have generally been less common than their one-handed counterparts, one exception being their common use in Japan. Two-handed grips have two advantages: obviously they allow the strength of two hands to be used, not just one, but by spacing the hands apart they also allow a torque to be applied, rotating the sword in a slashing manner.\nA two-handed grip may be needed for one of two reasons: either to wield a particularly large sword or else with the single-sided Japanese tachi for a slashing cut. Slashing swords may have distinctively long hilt grips to facilitate this.\nHand and a half sword.\nA hand and a half sword, colloquially known as a \"bastard sword\", was a sword with an extended grip and sometimes pommel so that it could be used with either one or two hands. Although these swords may not provide a full two-hand grip, they allowed its wielders to hold a shield or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to use it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow. These should not be confused with a longsword, two-handed sword, or Zweih\u00e4nder, which were always intended to be used with two hands.\nLaws on carrying a sword.\nThe Visigothic Code of Ervig (680-687) made ownership of a sword mandatory for men joining the Visigothic army, regardless of whether the men were Goth or Roman. A number of Charlemagne capitularies made ownership of a sword mandatory, for example, those who owned a warhorse needed to also own a sword.\nIn fiction.\nIn fantasy, magic swords often appear, based on their use in myth and legend. The science fiction counterpart to these is known as an energy sword (sometimes also referred to as a \"beam sword\" or \"laser sword\"), a sword whose blade consists of, or is augmented by, concentrated energy. A well known example of this type of sword is the lightsaber, shown in the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some surfaces arise as the boundaries of three-dimensional solid figures; for example, the sphere is the boundary of the solid ball. Other surfaces arise as graphs of functions of two variables; see the figure at right. However, surfaces can also be defined abstractly, without reference to any ambient space. For example, the Klein bottle is a surface that cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space.\nTopological surfaces are sometimes equipped with additional information, such as a Riemannian metric or a complex structure, that connects them to other disciplines within mathematics, such as differential geometry and complex analysis. The various mathematical notions of surface can be used to model surfaces in the physical world.\nIn general.\nIn mathematics, a surface is a geometrical shape that resembles a deformed plane. The most familiar examples arise as boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, such as spheres. The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context. Typically, in algebraic geometry, a surface may cross itself (and may have other singularities), while, in topology and differential geometry, it may not.\nA surface is a two-dimensional space; this means that a moving point on a surface may move in two directions (it has two degrees of freedom). In other words, around almost every point, there is a \"coordinate patch\" on which a two-dimensional coordinate system is defined. For example, the surface of the Earth resembles (ideally) a two-dimensional sphere, and latitude and longitude provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the 180th meridian).\nThe concept of surface is widely used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other disciplines, primarily in representing the surfaces of physical objects. For example, in analyzing the aerodynamic properties of an airplane, the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface.\nDefinitions and first examples.\nA \"(topological) surface\" is a topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of the Euclidean plane E2. Such a neighborhood, together with the corresponding homeomorphism, is known as a \"(coordinate) chart\". It is through this chart that the neighborhood inherits the standard coordinates on the Euclidean plane. These coordinates are known as \"local coordinates\" and these homeomorphisms lead us to describe surfaces as being \"locally Euclidean\".\nIn most writings on the subject, it is often assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that as a topological space a surface is also nonempty, second-countable, and Hausdorff. It is also often assumed that the surfaces under consideration are connected.\nThe rest of this article will assume, unless specified otherwise, that a surface is nonempty, Hausdorff, second-countable, and connected.\nMore generally, a \"(topological) surface with boundary\" is a Hausdorff topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of the closure of the upper half-plane H2 in C. These homeomorphisms are also known as \"(coordinate) charts\". The boundary of the upper half-plane is the \"x\"-axis. A point on the surface mapped via a chart to the \"x\"-axis is termed a \"boundary point\". The collection of such points is known as the \"boundary\" of the surface which is necessarily a one-manifold, that is, the union of closed curves. On the other hand, a point mapped to above the \"x\"-axis is an \"interior point\". The collection of interior points is the \"interior\" of the surface which is always non-empty. The closed disk is a simple example of a surface with boundary. The boundary of the disc is a circle.\nThe term \"surface\" used without qualification refers to surfaces without boundary. In particular, a surface with empty boundary is a surface in the usual sense. A surface with empty boundary which is compact is known as a 'closed' surface. The two-dimensional sphere, the two-dimensional torus, and the real projective plane are examples of closed surfaces.\nThe M\u00f6bius strip is a surface on which the distinction between clockwise and counterclockwise can be defined locally, but not globally. In general, a surface is said to be \"orientable\" if it does not contain a homeomorphic copy of the M\u00f6bius strip; intuitively, it has two distinct \"sides\". For example, the sphere and torus are orientable, while the real projective plane is not (because the real projective plane with one point removed is homeomorphic to the open M\u00f6bius strip).\nIn differential and algebraic geometry, extra structure is added upon the topology of the surface. This added structure can be a smoothness structure (making it possible to define differentiable maps to and from the surface), a Riemannian metric (making it possible to define length and angles on the surface), a complex structure (making it possible to define holomorphic maps to and from the surface\u2014in which case the surface is called a Riemann surface), or an algebraic structure (making it possible to detect singularities, such as self-intersections and cusps, that cannot be described solely in terms of the underlying topology).\nExtrinsically defined surfaces and embeddings.\nHistorically, surfaces were initially defined as subspaces of Euclidean spaces. Often, these surfaces were the locus of zeros of certain functions, usually polynomial functions. Such a definition considered the surface as part of a larger (Euclidean) space, and as such was termed \"extrinsic\".\nIn the previous section, a surface is defined as a topological space with certain properties, namely Hausdorff and locally Euclidean. This topological space is not considered a subspace of another space. In this sense, the definition given above, which is the definition that mathematicians use at present, is \"intrinsic\".\nA surface defined as intrinsic is not required to satisfy the added constraint of being a subspace of Euclidean space. It may seem possible for some surfaces defined intrinsically to not be surfaces in the extrinsic sense. However, the Whitney embedding theorem asserts every surface can in fact be embedded homeomorphically into Euclidean space, in fact into E4: The extrinsic and intrinsic approaches turn out to be equivalent.\nIn fact, any compact surface that is either orientable or has a boundary can be embedded in E3; on the other hand, the real projective plane, which is compact, non-orientable and without boundary, cannot be embedded into E3 (see Gramain). Steiner surfaces, including Boy's surface, the Roman surface and the cross-cap, are models of the real projective plane in E3, but only the Boy surface is an immersed surface. All these models are singular at points where they intersect themselves.\nThe Alexander horned sphere is a well-known pathological embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere.\nThe chosen embedding (if any) of a surface into another space is regarded as extrinsic information; it is not essential to the surface itself. For example, a torus can be embedded into E3 in the \"standard\" manner (which looks like a bagel) or in a knotted manner (see figure). The two embedded tori are homeomorphic, but not isotopic: They are topologically equivalent, but their embeddings are not.\nThe image of a continuous, injective function from R2 to higher-dimensional Rn is said to be a parametric surface. Such an image is so-called because the \"x\"- and \"y\"- directions of the domain R2 are 2 variables that parametrize the image. A parametric surface need not be a topological surface. A surface of revolution can be viewed as a special kind of parametric surface.\nIf \"f\" is a smooth function from R3 to R whose gradient is nowhere zero, then the locus of zeros of \"f\" does define a surface, known as an \"implicit surface\". If the condition of non-vanishing gradient is dropped, then the zero locus may develop singularities.\nConstruction from polygons.\nEach closed surface can be constructed from an oriented polygon with an even number of sides, called a fundamental polygon of the surface, by pairwise identification of its edges. For example, in each polygon below, attaching the sides with matching labels (\"A\" with \"A\", \"B\" with \"B\"), so that the arrows point in the same direction, yields the indicated surface.\nAny fundamental polygon can be written symbolically as follows. Begin at any vertex, and proceed around the perimeter of the polygon in either direction until returning to the starting vertex. During this traversal, record the label on each edge in order, with an exponent of -1 if the edge points opposite to the direction of traversal. The four models above, when traversed clockwise starting at the upper left, yield\nNote that the sphere and the projective plane can both be realized as quotients of the 2-gon, while the torus and Klein bottle require a 4-gon (square).\nThe expression thus derived from a fundamental polygon of a surface turns out to be the sole relation in a presentation of the fundamental group of the surface with the polygon edge labels as generators. This is a consequence of the Seifert\u2013van Kampen theorem.\nGluing edges of polygons is a special kind of quotient space process. The quotient concept can be applied in greater generality to produce new or alternative constructions of surfaces. For example, the real projective plane can be obtained as the quotient of the sphere by identifying all pairs of opposite points on the sphere. Another example of a quotient is the connected sum.\nConnected sums.\nThe connected sum of two surfaces \"M\" and \"N\", denoted \"M\" # \"N\", is obtained by removing a disk from each of them and gluing them along the boundary components that result. The boundary of a disk is a circle, so these boundary components are circles. The Euler characteristic formula_5 of \"M\" # \"N\" is the sum of the Euler characteristics of the summands, minus two:\nformula_6\nThe sphere S is an identity element for the connected sum, meaning that S # \"M\" = \"M\". This is because deleting a disk from the sphere leaves a disk, which simply replaces the disk deleted from \"M\" upon gluing.\nConnected summation with the torus T is also described as attaching a \"handle\" to the other summand \"M\". If \"M\" is orientable, then so is T # \"M\". The connected sum is associative, so the connected sum of a finite collection of surfaces is well-defined.\nThe connected sum of two real projective planes, P # P, is the Klein bottle K. The connected sum of the real projective plane and the Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus; in a formula, P # K = P # T. Thus, the connected sum of three real projective planes is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus. Any connected sum involving a real projective plane is nonorientable.\nClosed surfaces.\nA closed surface is a surface that is compact and without boundary. Examples of closed surfaces include the sphere, the torus and the Klein bottle. Examples of non-closed surfaces include an open disk (which is a sphere with a puncture), an open cylinder (which is a sphere with two punctures), and the M\u00f6bius strip.\nA surface embedded in three-dimensional space is closed if and only if it is the boundary of a solid. As with any closed manifold, a surface embedded in Euclidean space that is closed with respect to the inherited Euclidean topology is \"not\" necessarily a closed surface; for example, a disk embedded in formula_7 that contains its boundary is a surface that is topologically closed but not a closed surface.\nClassification of closed surfaces.\nThe \"classification theorem of closed surfaces\" states that any connected closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families:\nThe surfaces in the first two families are orientable. It is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori. The number \"g\" of tori involved is called the \"genus\" of the surface. The sphere and the torus have Euler characteristics 2 and 0, respectively, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of \"g\" tori is 2 \u2212 2\"g\".\nThe surfaces in the third family are nonorientable. The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of \"k\" of them is 2 \u2212 \"k\".\nIt follows that a closed surface is determined, up to homeomorphism, by two pieces of information: its Euler characteristic, and whether it is orientable or not. In other words, Euler characteristic and orientability completely classify closed surfaces up to homeomorphism.\nClosed surfaces with multiple connected components are classified by the class of each of their connected components, and thus one generally assumes that the surface is connected.\nMonoid structure.\nRelating this classification to connected sums, the closed surfaces up to homeomorphism form a commutative monoid under the operation of connected sum, as indeed do manifolds of any fixed dimension. The identity is the sphere, while the real projective plane and the torus generate this monoid, with a single relation P # P # P = P # T, which may also be written P # K = P # T, since K = P # P. This relation is sometimes known as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Dyck's theorem after Walther von Dyck, who proved it in , and the triple cross surface P # P # P is accordingly called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Dyck's surface.\nGeometrically, connect-sum with a torus (# T) adds a handle with both ends attached to the same side of the surface, while connect-sum with a Klein bottle (# K) adds a handle with the two ends attached to opposite sides of an orientable surface; in the presence of a projective plane (# P), the surface is not orientable (there is no notion of side), so there is no difference between attaching a torus and attaching a Klein bottle, which explains the relation.\nProof.\nThe classification of closed surfaces has been known since the 1860s, and today a number of proofs exist.\nTopological and combinatorial proofs in general rely on the difficult result that every compact 2-manifold is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex, which is of interest in its own right. The most common proof of the classification is , which brings every triangulated surface to a standard form. A simplified proof, which avoids a standard form, was discovered by John H. Conway circa 1992, which he called the \"Zero Irrelevancy Proof\" or \"ZIP proof\" and is presented in .\nA geometric proof, which yields a stronger geometric result, is the uniformization theorem. This was originally proven only for Riemann surfaces in the 1880s and 1900s by Felix Klein, Paul Koebe, and Henri Poincar\u00e9.\nSurfaces with boundary.\nCompact surfaces, possibly with boundary, are simply closed surfaces with a finite number of holes (open discs that have been removed). Thus, a connected compact surface is classified by the number of boundary components and the genus of the corresponding closed surface \u2013 equivalently, by the number of boundary components, the orientability, and Euler characteristic. The genus of a compact surface is defined as the genus of the corresponding closed surface.\nThis classification follows almost immediately from the classification of closed surfaces: removing an open disc from a closed surface yields a compact surface with a circle for boundary component, and removing \"k\" open discs yields a compact surface with \"k\" disjoint circles for boundary components. The precise locations of the holes are irrelevant, because the homeomorphism group acts \"k\"-transitively on any connected manifold of dimension at least 2.\nConversely, the boundary of a compact surface is a closed 1-manifold, and is therefore the disjoint union of a finite number of circles; filling these circles with disks (formally, taking the cone) yields a closed surface.\nThe unique compact orientable surface of genus \"g\" and with \"k\" boundary components is often denoted formula_8 for example in the study of the mapping class group.\nNon-compact surfaces.\nNon-compact surfaces are more difficult to classify. As a simple example, a non-compact surface can be obtained by puncturing (removing a finite set of points from) a closed manifold. On the other hand, any open subset of a compact surface is itself a non-compact surface; consider, for example, the complement of a Cantor set in the sphere, otherwise known as the Cantor tree surface. However, not every non-compact surface is a subset of a compact surface; two canonical counterexamples are the Jacob's ladder and the Loch Ness monster, which are non-compact surfaces with infinite genus.\nA non-compact surface \"M\" has a non-empty space of ends \"E\"(\"M\"), which informally speaking describes the ways that the surface \"goes off to infinity\". The space \"E\"(\"M\") is always topologically equivalent to a closed subspace of the Cantor set. \"M\" may have a finite or countably infinite number Nh of handles, as well as a finite or countably infinite number \"N\"\"p\" of projective planes. If both \"N\"\"h\" and \"N\"\"p\" are finite, then these two numbers, and the topological type of space of ends, classify the surface \"M\" up to topological equivalence. If either or both of \"N\"\"h\" and \"N\"\"p\" is infinite, then the topological type of M depends not only on these two numbers but also on how the infinite one(s) approach the space of ends. In general the topological type of M is determined by the four subspaces of \"E\"(\"M\") that are limit points of infinitely many handles and infinitely many projective planes, limit points of only handles, limit points of only projective planes, and limit points of neither.\nAssumption of second-countability.\nIf one removes the assumption of second-countability from the definition of a surface, there exist (necessarily non-compact) topological surfaces having no countable base for their topology. Perhaps the simplest example is the Cartesian product of the long line with the space of real numbers.\nAnother surface having no countable base for its topology, but \"not\" requiring the Axiom of Choice to prove its existence, is the Pr\u00fcfer manifold, which can be described by simple equations that show it to be a real-analytic surface. The Pr\u00fcfer manifold may be thought of as the upper half plane together with one additional \"tongue\" \"T\"\"x\" hanging down from it directly below the point (\"x\",0), for each real\u00a0\"x\".\nIn 1925, Tibor Rad\u00f3 proved that all Riemann surfaces (i.e., one-dimensional complex manifolds) are necessarily second-countable (Rad\u00f3's theorem). By contrast, if one replaces the real numbers in the construction of the Pr\u00fcfer surface by the complex numbers, one obtains a two-dimensional complex manifold (which is necessarily a 4-dimensional real manifold) with no countable base.\nSurfaces in geometry.\nPolyhedra, such as the boundary of a cube, are among the first surfaces encountered in geometry. It is also possible to define \"smooth surfaces\", in which each point has a neighborhood diffeomorphic to some open set in E2. This elaboration allows calculus to be applied to surfaces to prove many results.\nTwo smooth surfaces are diffeomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic. (The analogous result does not hold for higher-dimensional manifolds.) Thus closed surfaces are classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.\nSmooth surfaces equipped with Riemannian metrics are of foundational importance in differential geometry. A Riemannian metric endows a surface with notions of geodesic, distance, angle, and area. It also gives rise to Gaussian curvature, which describes how curved or bent the surface is at each point. Curvature is a rigid, geometric property, in that it is not preserved by general diffeomorphisms of the surface. However, the famous Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem for closed surfaces states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature \"K\" over the entire surface \"S\" is determined by the Euler characteristic:\nformula_9\nThis result exemplifies the deep relationship between the geometry and topology of surfaces (and, to a lesser extent, higher-dimensional manifolds).\nAnother way in which surfaces arise in geometry is by passing into the complex domain. A complex one-manifold is a smooth oriented surface, also called a Riemann surface. Any complex nonsingular algebraic curve viewed as a complex manifold is a Riemann surface. In fact, every compact orientable surface is realizable as a Riemann surface. Thus compact Riemann surfaces are characterized topologically by their genus: 0, 1, 2, ... On the other hand, the genus does not characterize the complex structure. For example, there are uncountably many non-isomorphic compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1 (the elliptic curves).\nComplex structures on a closed oriented surface correspond to conformal equivalence classes of Riemannian metrics on the surface. One version of the uniformization theorem (due to Poincar\u00e9) states that any Riemannian metric on an oriented, closed surface is conformally equivalent to an essentially unique metric of constant curvature. This provides a starting point for one of the approaches to Teichm\u00fcller theory, which provides a finer classification of Riemann surfaces than the topological one by Euler characteristic alone.\nA \"complex surface\" is a complex two-manifold and thus a real four-manifold; it is not a surface in the sense of this article. Neither are algebraic curves defined over fields other than the complex numbers,\nnor are algebraic surfaces defined over fields other than the real numbers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27873", "revid": "1310555166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27873", "title": "Surjective function", "text": "Mathematical function such that every output has at least one input\nIn mathematics, a surjective function (also known as surjection, or onto function ) is a function \"f\" such that, for every element \"y\" of the function's codomain, there exists at least one element \"x\" in the function's domain such that \"f\"(\"x\") \n \"y\". In other words, for a function \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\", the codomain \"Y\" is the image of the function's domain \"X\". It is not required that \"x\" be unique; the function \"f\" may map one or more elements of \"X\" to the same element of \"Y\".\nThe term \"surjective\" and the related terms \"injective\" and \"bijective\" were introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki, a group of mainly French 20th-century mathematicians who, under this pseudonym, wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. The French word \"sur\" means \"over\" or \"above\", and relates to the fact that the image of the domain of a surjective function completely covers the function's codomain.\nAny function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to the image of its domain. Every surjective function has a right inverse assuming the axiom of choice, and every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The composition of surjective functions is always surjective. Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection.\nDefinition.\nA surjective function is a function whose image is equal to its codomain. Equivalently, a function formula_1 with domain formula_2 and codomain formula_3 is surjective if for every formula_4 in formula_3 there exists at least one formula_6 in formula_2 with formula_8. Surjections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow (), as in formula_9.\nSymbolically,\nIf formula_10, then formula_1 is said to be surjective if\nformula_12.\nProperties.\nA function is bijective if and only if it is both surjective and injective.\nIf (as is often done) a function is identified with its graph, then surjectivity is not a property of the function itself, but rather a property of the mapping. This is, the function together with its codomain. Unlike injectivity, surjectivity cannot be read off of the graph of the function alone.\nSurjections as right invertible functions.\nThe function \"g\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"X\" is said to be a right inverse of the function \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" if \"f\"(\"g\"(\"y\")) = \"y\" for every \"y\" in \"Y\" (\"g\" can be undone by \"f\"). In other words, \"g\" is a right inverse of \"f\" if the composition \"f\" \"g\" of \"g\" and \"f\" in that order is the identity function on the domain \"Y\" of \"g\". The function \"g\" need not be a complete inverse of \"f\" because the composition in the other order, \"g\" \"f\", may not be the identity function on the domain \"X\" of \"f\". In other words, \"f\" can undo or \"reverse\" \"g\", but cannot necessarily be reversed by it.\nFor example, formula_13 has right inverse formula_14 the composition in the other order gives &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, which equals &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; only if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nEvery function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The proposition that every surjective function has a right inverse is equivalent to the axiom of choice.\nIf \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" is surjective and \"B\" is a subset of \"Y\", then \"f\"(\"f\" \u22121(\"B\")) = \"B\". Thus, \"B\" can be recovered from its preimage \"f\" \u22121(\"B\").\nFor example, in the first illustration in the gallery, there is some function \"g\" such that \"g\"(\"C\") = 4. There is also some function \"f\" such that \"f\"(4) = \"C\". It doesn't matter that \"g\" is not unique (it would also work if \"g\"(\"C\") equals 3); it only matters that \"f\" \"reverses\" \"g\".\nSurjections as epimorphisms.\nA function \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" is surjective if and only if it is right-cancellative: given any functions \"g\",\"h\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"Z\", whenever \"g\" \"f\" = \"h\" \"f\", then \"g\" = \"h\". This property is formulated in terms of functions and their composition and can be generalized to the more general notion of the morphisms of a category and their composition. Right-cancellative morphisms are called epimorphisms. Specifically, surjective functions are precisely the epimorphisms in the category of sets. The prefix \"epi\" is derived from the Greek preposition \"\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\" meaning \"over\", \"above\", \"on\".\nAny morphism with a right inverse is an epimorphism, but the converse is not true in general. A right inverse \"g\" of a morphism \"f\" is called a section of \"f\". A morphism with a right inverse is called a split epimorphism.\nSurjections as binary relations.\nAny function with domain \"X\" and codomain \"Y\" can be seen as a left-total and right-unique binary relation between \"X\" and \"Y\" by identifying it with its function graph. A surjective function with domain \"X\" and codomain \"Y\" is then a binary relation between \"X\" and \"Y\" that is right-unique and both left-total and right-total.\nCardinality of the domain of a surjection.\nThe cardinality of the domain of a surjective function is greater than or equal to the cardinality of its codomain: If \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" is a surjective function, then \"X\" has at least as many elements as \"Y\", in the sense of cardinal numbers. (The proof appeals to the axiom of choice to show that a function\n\"g\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"X\" satisfying \"f\"(\"g\"(\"y\")) = \"y\" for all \"y\" in \"Y\" exists. \"g\" is easily seen to be injective, thus the formal definition of |\"Y\"| \u2264 |\"X\"| is satisfied.)\nSpecifically, if both \"X\" and \"Y\" are finite with the same number of elements, then \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" is surjective if and only if \"f\" is injective.\nComposition and decomposition.\nThe composition of surjective functions is always surjective: If \"f\" and \"g\" are both surjective, and the codomain of \"g\" is equal to the domain of \"f\", then \"f\" \"g\" is surjective. Conversely, if \"f\" \"g\" is surjective, then \"f\" is surjective (but \"g\", the function applied first, need not be). These properties generalize from surjections in the category of sets to any epimorphisms in any category.\nAny function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection: For any function \"h\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Z\" there exist a surjection \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" and an injection \"g\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"Z\" such that \"h\" = \"g\" \"f\". To see this, define \"Y\" to be the set of preimages \"h\"\u22121(\"z\") where \"z\" is in \"h\"(\"X\"). These preimages are disjoint and partition \"X\". Then \"f\" carries each \"x\" to the element of \"Y\" which contains it, and \"g\" carries each element of \"Y\" to the point in \"Z\" to which \"h\" sends its points. Then \"f\" is surjective since it is a projection map, and \"g\" is injective by definition.\nInduced surjection and induced bijection.\nAny function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to its range. Any surjective function induces a bijection defined on a quotient of its domain by collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image. More precisely, every surjection \"f\" : \"A\" \u2192 \"B\" can be factored as a projection followed by a bijection as follows. Let \"A\"/~ be the equivalence classes of \"A\" under the following equivalence relation: \"x\" ~ \"y\" if and only if \"f\"(\"x\") = \"f\"(\"y\"). Equivalently, \"A\"/~ is the set of all preimages under \"f\". Let \"P\"(~) : \"A\" \u2192 \"A\"/~ be the projection map which sends each \"x\" in \"A\" to its equivalence class [\"x\"]~, and let \"f\"\"P\" : \"A\"/~ \u2192 \"B\" be the well-defined function given by \"f\"\"P\"([\"x\"]~) = \"f\"(\"x\"). Then \"f\" = \"f\"\"P\" o \"P\"(~).\nThe set of surjections.\nGiven fixed finite sets A and B, one can form the set of surjections \"A\" \u21a0 \"B\". The cardinality of this set is one of the twelve aspects of Rota's Twelvefold way, and is given by formula_15, where formula_16 denotes a Stirling number of the second kind.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27875", "revid": "15014261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27875", "title": "Stephen Jay Gould", "text": "American biologist and historian of science (1941\u20132002)\nStephen Jay Gould ( ; September 10, 1941 \u2013 May 20, 2002) was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science. He was one of the most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation. Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1996, Gould was hired as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University, after which he divided his time teaching between there and Harvard. \nGould's most significant contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching speciation. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.\nMost of Gould's empirical research was based on the land snail genera \"Poecilozonites\" and \"Cerion\". He also made important contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, receiving broad professional recognition for his book \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\". In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields (or \"non-overlapping magisteria\") whose authorities do not overlap.\nGould was known by the general public mainly for his 300 popular essays in \"Natural History\" magazine, and his numerous books written for both the specialist and non-specialist.\nIn April 2000, the US Library of Congress named him a \"Living Legend\".\nBiography.\nStephen Jay Gould was born in Queens, New York, on September 10, 1941. His father Leonard was a court stenographer and a World War II veteran of the United States Navy. His mother Eleanor was an artist, whose parents were Jewish immigrants living and working in the city's Garment District. Gould and his younger brother Peter were raised in Bayside, a middle-class neighborhood in the northeastern section of Queens. He attended elementary school and graduated from Jamaica High School.\nWhen Gould was five years old his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History, where he first encountered \"Tyrannosaurus rex\". \"I had no idea there were such things\u2014I was awestruck,\" Gould once recalled. It was in that moment that he decided to become a paleontologist.\nRaised in a secular Jewish home, Gould did not formally practice religion and preferred to be called an agnostic. When asked directly if he was an agnostic in \"Skeptic\" magazine, he responded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If you absolutely forced me to bet on the existence of a conventional anthropomorphic deity, of course I'd bet no. But, basically, Huxley was right when he said that agnosticism is the only honorable position because we really cannot know. And that's right. I'd be real surprised if there turned out to be a conventional God.\nThough he \"had been brought up by a Marxist father\" he stated that his father's politics were \"very different\" from his own. In describing his own political views, he has said they \"tend to the left of center\". According to Gould the most influential political books he read were C. Wright Mills' \"The Power Elite\" and the political writings of Noam Chomsky.\nWhile attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the early 1960s, Gould was active in the civil rights movement and often campaigned for social justice. When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked. Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially what he saw as the pseudoscience used in the service of racism and sexism.\nInterspersed throughout his scientific essays for \"Natural History\" magazine, Gould frequently referred to his non-scientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained an avid New York Yankees fan throughout his life. As an adult he was fond of science fiction movies but often lamented their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and delighted in city walks. He often traveled to Europe and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.\nLater career.\nIn 1998, Gould co-founded the Art Science Research Laboratory (ASRL) with artist and sculptor Rhonda Roland Shearer, whom he had married in 1995. Based in New York City, the non-profit organization supports interdisciplinary work in art, science, and media studies. Its stated goal is to apply critical methods across different fields, including academic research and journalism.\nGould developed an interest in Marcel Duchamp, particularly the French-American artist's use of optics and perception in his readymades. With artist and journalist Rhonda Roland Shearer, Gould examined the idea that Duchamp\u2019s artistic experiments were relevant to scientific approaches to vision and representation. Contemporary accounts of Gould\u2019s career described him as a scientist whose work often extended into broader cultural and intellectual domains.\nFirst bout of cancer.\nIn July 1982 Gould was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, a deadly form of cancer affecting the abdominal lining (the peritoneum). This cancer is frequently found in people who have ingested or inhaled asbestos fibers, a mineral which was used in the construction of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for \"Discover\" magazine in 1985 titled \"The Median Isn't the Message\", which discusses his reaction to reading that \"mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery.\" In his essay, he describes the actual significance behind this fact, and his relief upon recognizing that statistical averages are useful abstractions, and by themselves do not encompass \"our actual world of variation, shadings, and continua\".\nGould was also an advocate of medical cannabis. When undergoing his cancer treatments he smoked marijuana to help alleviate the long periods of intense and uncontrollable nausea. According to Gould, the drug had a \"most important effect\" on his eventual recovery. He later complained that he could not understand how \"any humane person would withhold such a beneficial substance from people in such great need simply because others use it for different purposes\". On August 5, 1998, Gould's testimony assisted in the successful lawsuit of HIV activist Jim Wakeford, who sued the Government of Canada for the right to cultivate, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes.\nFinal illness and death.\nIn February 2002, a lesion was found on Gould's chest radiograph, and oncologists diagnosed him with stage IV cancer. Gould died 10 weeks later on May 20, 2002, from a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, an aggressive form of cancer which had already spread to his brain, liver, and spleen. This cancer was unrelated to his previous bout of abdominal cancer in 1982, though it is also associated with asbestos exposure. He died in his home \"in a bed set up in the library of his SoHo loft, surrounded by his wife Rhonda, his mother Eleanor, and the many books he loved\".\nScientific career.\nGould began his higher education at Antioch College, graduating with a double major in geology and philosophy in 1963. During this time, he also studied at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. After completing graduate work at Columbia University in 1967 under the guidance of Norman Newell, he was immediately hired by Harvard University, where he worked until the end of his life (1967\u20132002). In 1973, Harvard promoted him to professor of geology and curator of invertebrate paleontology at the institution's Museum of Comparative Zoology.\nIn 1982, Harvard awarded him the title of Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology. That same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1983, he was awarded a fellowship at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where he later served as president (1999\u20132001). The AAAS news release cited his \"numerous contributions to both scientific progress and the public understanding of science\". He also served as president of the Paleontological Society (1985\u20131986) and of the Society for the Study of Evolution (1990\u20131991).\nIn 1989, Gould was elected into the body of the National Academy of Sciences. Through 1996\u20132002 Gould was Vincent Astor Visiting research professor of biology at New York University. In 2001, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the Year for his lifetime of work. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal, along with 12 other recipients. (Until 2008, this medal had been awarded every 50 years by the Linnean Society of London.)\nPunctuated equilibrium.\nEarly in his career, Gould and his colleague Niles Eldredge developed the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which describes the rate of speciation in the fossil record as occurring relatively rapidly, which then alternates to a longer period of evolutionary stability. It was Gould who coined the term \"punctuated equilibria\" though the theory was originally presented by Eldredge in his doctoral dissertation on Devonian trilobites and his article published the previous year on allopatric speciation.\nAccording to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar \"in the central logic of Darwinian theory\". Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was \"of great interest to biology generally,\" it merely modified neo-Darwinism in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before.\nOther biologists emphasize the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been \"unexpected by most evolutionary biologists\" and \"had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology\".\nComparisons were made to George Gaylord Simpson's work in \"Tempo and Mode in Evolution\" (1941), in which he also illustrated relatively sudden changes along evolutionary lines. Simpson describes the paleontological record as being characterized by predominantly gradual change (which he termed horotely), although he also documented examples of slow (bradytely), and rapid (tachytely) rates of evolution. Punctuated equilibrium and phyletic gradualism are not mutually exclusive (as Simpson's work demonstrates), and examples of each have been documented in different lineages. The debate between these two models is often misunderstood by non-scientists, and according to Richard Dawkins has been oversold by the media.\nSome critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as \"evolution by jerks\",\nwhich prompted Gould to describe phyletic gradualism as \"evolution by creeps\".\nEvolutionary developmental biology.\nGould made significant contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, especially in his work \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\". In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.\nSelectionism and sociobiology.\nGould was a champion of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, as well as other non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.\nAgainst \"Sociobiology\".\nIn 1975, Gould's Harvard colleague E. O. Wilson introduced his analysis of animal behavior (including human behavior) based on a sociobiological framework that suggested that many social behaviors have a strong evolutionary basis. In response, Gould, Richard Lewontin, and others from the Boston area wrote the subsequently well-referenced letter to \"The New York Review of Books\" entitled, \"Against 'Sociobiology'\". This open letter criticized Wilson's notion of a \"deterministic view of human society and human action\".\nBut Gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects of animal behavior, and later wrote: \"Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism\u2014previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior... Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.\"\nSpandrels and the Panglossian paradigm.\nWith Richard Lewontin, Gould wrote an influential 1979 paper entitled, \"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm\",\nwhich introduced the architectural term \"spandrel\" into evolutionary biology. In architecture, a spandrel is a triangular space which exists over the haunches of an arch. Spandrels\u2014more often called pendentives in this context\u2014are found particularly in classical architecture, especially Byzantine and Renaissance churches.\nWhen visiting Venice in 1978, Gould noted that the spandrels of the San Marco cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not spaces planned by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as \"necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches.\" Gould and Lewontin thus defined \"spandrels\" in the evolutionary biology context to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Proposed examples include the \"masculinized genitalia in female hyenas, exaptive use of an umbilicus as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant Irish deer, and several key features of human mentality\".\nIn Voltaire's \"Candide\", Dr. Pangloss is portrayed as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, insists that \"all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds\". Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is Panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental constraints. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology.\nAn illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in Elisabeth Lloyd's case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways. Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay \"Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples,\" prompted by Lloyd's earlier work.\nGould was criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett for using the term spandrel instead of pendentive, a spandrel that curves across a right angle to support a dome. Robert Mark, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton, offered his expertise in the pages of \"American Scientist\", noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in architectural theory. Mark concluded, \"Gould and Lewontin's misapplication of the term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy. But Dennett's critique of the architectural basis of the analogy goes even further astray because he slights the technical rationale of the architectural elements in question.\"\nEvolutionary progress.\nGould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term \"progress\". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a ladder of progress, leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards complexity, but towards diversification. Because life is constrained to begin with a simple starting point (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with parasites.\nIn a review of \", Richard Dawkins approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a \"tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, indispensably progressive.\"\nCultural evolution.\nGould's arguments against progress in evolutionary biology did not extend towards a notion of progress in general or notions of cultural evolution. In \"\", Gould compares two notions of progress against one another. While the first concept of progress, evolutionary progress, is argued to be invalid for a number of biological considerations, Gould permits that evolution may operate in human cultural evolution through a Lamarckian mechanism. Gould goes on to argue that the disappearance of the 0.400 batting average in baseball is paradoxically due to the inclusion of better players in the league, rather than players becoming worse over time. In his view such a process is likely reflective in a number of cultural phenomena including sports, the visual arts, and music where, unlike in biological systems, the realm of aesthetic possibilities is constrained by a \"right wall\" of human limits and aesthetic preferences. Gould later goes on to state that his arguments for biological evolution should not be applied to cultural change lest they be employed by, \"so-called 'political correctness' as a doctrine that celebrates all indigenous practice, and therefore permits no distinctions, judgements, or analyses.\"\nCladistics.\nGould never embraced cladistics as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.\nTechnical work on land snails.\nMost of Gould's empirical research pertained to land snails. He focused his early work on the Bermudian genus \"Poecilozonites\", while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus \"Cerion\". According to Gould \"\"Cerion\" is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form.\"\nGiven \"Cerion\"'s extensive geographic diversity, Gould later lamented that if Christopher Columbus had only catalogued a single \"Cerion\" it would have ended the scholarly debate about which island Columbus had first set foot on in America.\nInfluence.\nGould is one of the most frequently cited scientists in the field of evolutionary theory. His 1979 \"spandrels\" paper has been cited more than 5,000 times. In \"Paleobiology\"\u2014the flagship journal of his own speciality\u2014only Charles Darwin and George Gaylord Simpson have been cited more often. Gould was also a considerably respected historian of science. Historian Ronald Numbers has been quoted as saying: \"I can't say much about Gould's strengths as a scientist, but for a long time I've regarded him as the second most influential historian of science (next to Thomas Kuhn).\" Gould's undergraduate course, Science B-16: History of the Earth and Life, was taught in a Harvard Science Center lecture hall with a 250-seat capacity. Science B-16 was so oversubscribed that an annual lottery was held to see which students would be allowed to enroll in the course. If a student was denied course enrollment three times, then their fourth entry into the lottery provided them with a guaranteed seat in the class.\n\"The Structure of Evolutionary Theory\".\nShortly before his death, Gould published \"The Structure of Evolutionary Theory\" (2002), a long treatise recapitulating his version of modern evolutionary theory. In an interview for the Dutch TV series \"Of Beauty and Consolation\" Gould remarked, \"In a couple of years I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals\u2014very different from my popular science writings\u2014but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life.\"\nAs a public figure.\nGould became widely known through his popular essays on evolution in the \"Natural History\" magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled \"This View of Life\" (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of Species\") from January 1974 to January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as \"Ever Since Darwin\" and \"The Panda's Thumb\", \"Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes\", and \"The Flamingo's Smile\".\nA passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book \"Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville\" (2003).\nAlthough a self-described Darwinist, Gould's emphasis was less gradualist and reductionist than most neo-Darwinists. He fiercely opposed many aspects of sociobiology and its intellectual descendant evolutionary psychology. He devoted considerable time to fighting against creationism, creation science, and intelligent design. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in \"McLean v. Arkansas\". Gould later developed the term \"non-overlapping magisteria\" (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion should not comment on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books \"Rocks of Ages\" (1999) and \"The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox\" (2003). In a 1982 essay for \"Natural History\" Gould wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise from the data of science. The factual state of the world does not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner.\nGould also spoke out against creationist misuse of his work and theory, especially with respect to how his theory of punctuated equilibrium relates to the presence of transitional fossils or forms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAn anti-evolution petition drafted by the Discovery Institute inspired the National Center for Science Education to create a pro-evolution counterpart called \"Project Steve,\" which is named in Gould's honor. In 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) selected Gould for inclusion in CSI's \"Pantheon of Skeptics\" created to remember the legacy of deceased CSI fellows and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.\nGould also became a noted public face of science, often appearing on television. In 1984 Gould received his own \"NOVA\" special on PBS. Other appearances included interviews on CNN's \"Crossfire\" and \"Talkback Live\", NBC's \"The Today Show\", and regular appearances on PBS's \"Charlie Rose\" show. Gould was also a guest in all seven episodes of the Dutch talk series \"A Glorious Accident\", in which he appeared with his close friend Oliver Sacks. In 1999, Gould became the first recipient of the GSA Public Service Award.\nGould was featured prominently as a guest in Ken Burns's PBS documentary \"Baseball\", as well as PBS's \"Evolution\" series. Gould was also on the Board of Advisers to the influential Children's Television Workshop television show \"3-2-1 Contact\", where he made frequent guest appearances.\nSince 2013, Gould has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\nIn 1997, he voiced a cartoon version of himself on the television series \"The Simpsons\". In the episode \"Lisa the Skeptic\", Lisa finds a skeleton that many people believe is an apocalyptic angel. Lisa contacts Gould and asks him to test the skeleton's DNA. The fossil is discovered to be a marketing gimmick for a new mall. During production, the only phrase Gould objected to was a line in the script that introduced him as the \"world's most brilliant paleontologist\". In 2002, the show paid tribute to Gould after his death, dedicating the season 13 finale to his memory. Gould had died two days before the episode aired.\nThe \"Darwin Wars\".\nGould received many accolades for his scholarly work and popular expositions of natural history, but a number of biologists felt his public presentations were out of step with mainstream evolutionary thinking. The public debates between Gould's supporters and detractors have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed \"The Darwin Wars\" by several commentators.\nJohn Maynard Smith, the eminent British evolutionary biologist, was among Gould's strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital role of adaptation in biology, and was critical of Gould's acceptance of species selection as a major component of biological evolution. In a review of Daniel Dennett's 1995 book \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Maynard Smith wrote that Gould \"is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory\". But Maynard Smith was not consistently negative, writing in a review of \"The Panda's Thumb\" that \"Stephen Gould is the best writer of popular science now active... Often he infuriates me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these.\" Maynard Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould's reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology.\nOne reason for criticism was that Gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, and argued for the importance of mechanisms other than natural selection, mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists. As a result, many non-specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould never tried to imply). Along with many other researchers in the field, Gould's works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by creationists as \"proof\" that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved. Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.\nThe conflicts between Richard Dawkins and Gould were popularized by philosopher Kim Sterelny in his 2001 book \"Dawkins vs. Gould\". Sterelny documents their disagreements over theoretical issues, including the prominence of gene selection in evolution. Dawkins argues that natural selection is best understood as competition among genes (or replicators), while Gould advocated multi-level selection, which includes selection amongst genes, nucleic acid sequences, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, and clades.\nDawkins accused Gould of deliberately underplaying the differences between rapid gradualism and macromutation in his published accounts of punctuated equilibrium. He also devoted entire chapters to critiquing Gould's account of evolution in his books \"The Blind Watchmaker\" and \"Unweaving the Rainbow\", as did Daniel Dennett in his 1995 book \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\". Other biologists contemporary to Gould went further, as in the case of Robert Trivers who classified it as \"intellectual fraud\".\nCambrian fauna.\nIn his book \"Wonderful Life\" (1989), Gould famously described the Cambrian fauna of the Burgess Shale, emphasizing their bizarre anatomical designs, their sudden appearance, and the role chance played in determining which members survived. He used the Cambrian fauna as an example of the role contingency has in shaping the broader pattern of evolution.\nHis view of contingency was criticized by Simon Conway Morris in his 1998 book \"The Crucible of Creation\". Conway Morris stressed members of the Cambrian fauna that resemble modern taxa. He also argued that convergent evolution has a tendency to produce \"similarities of organization\" and that the forms of life are restricted and channelled. In his book \"Life's Solution\" (2003), Conway Morris argued that the appearance of human-like animals is also likely. Paleontologist Richard Fortey noted that prior to the release of \"Wonderful Life\", Conway Morris shared a similar thesis to Gould's, but after \"Wonderful Life\" Conway Morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more deterministic position on the history of life.\nPaleontologists Derek Briggs and Richard Fortey have also argued that much of the Cambrian fauna may be regarded as stem groups of living taxa, though this is still a subject of intense research and debate, and the relationship of many Cambrian taxa to modern phyla has not been established in the eyes of many palaeontologists.\nRichard Dawkins disagrees with the view that new phyla suddenly appeared in the Cambrian, arguing that for a new phylum \"to spring into existence, what actually has to happen on the ground is that a child is born which suddenly, out of the blue, is as different from its parents as a snail is from an earthworm. No zoologist who thinks through the implications, not even the most ardent saltationist, has ever supported any such notion.\" In the \"Structure of Evolutionary Theory\" Gould stresses the difference between phyletic splitting and large anatomical transitions, noting that the two events may be separated by millions of years. Gould argues that no paleontologist regards the Cambrian explosion \"as a genealogical event\u2014that is as the actual time of initial splitting\", but rather it \"marks an anatomical transition in the overt phenotypes of bilaterian organisms\".\nOpposition to sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.\nGould also had a long-running public feud with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists concerning the disciplines of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, both of which Gould and Lewontin opposed, but which Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Steven Pinker advocated. These debates reached their climax in the 1970s, and included strong opposition from groups such as the Sociobiology Study Group and Science for the People. Pinker accuses Gould, Lewontin, and other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being \"radical scientists\", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science. Gould stated that he made \"no attribution of motive in Wilson's or anyone else's case\" but cautioned that all human beings are influenced, especially unconsciously, by our personal expectations and biases. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I grew up in a family with a tradition of participation in campaigns for social justice, and I was active, as a student, in the civil rights movement at a time of great excitement and success in the early 1960s. Scholars are often wary of citing such commitments. \u2026 [but] it is dangerous for a scholar even to imagine that he might attain complete neutrality, for then one stops being vigilant about personal preferences and their influences\u2014and then one truly falls victim to the dictates of prejudice. Objectivity must be operationally defined as fair treatment of data, not absence of preference.\nGould's primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through culture as well, and either hypothesis is equally plausible. Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, but reframed the debate as \"biological potentiality vs. biological determinism\". Gould stated that the human brain allows for a wide range of behaviors. Its flexibility \"permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, spiteful or generous\u2026 Violence, sexism, and general nastiness \"are\" biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, equality, and kindness are just as biological\u2014and we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish.\"\n\"The Mismeasure of Man\" (1981).\nGould was the author of \"The Mismeasure of Man\" (1981), a history and inquiry of psychometrics and intelligence testing, generating perhaps the greatest controversy of all his books and receiving both widespread praise and extensive criticism. Gould investigated the methods of nineteenth century craniometry, as well as the history of psychological testing. Gould wrote that both theories developed from an unfounded belief in biological determinism, the view that \"social and economic differences between human groups\u2014primarily races, classes, and sexes\u2014arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology.\" The book was reprinted in 1996 with the addition of a new foreword and a critical review of \"The Bell Curve\".\nIn 2011, a study conducted by six anthropologists criticized Gould's claim that Samuel Morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements, arguing that his analysis of Morton was influenced by his opposition to racism. The group's paper was reviewed in an editorial in the journal \"Nature\", which pointed out that the paper's authors might have been influenced by their own motivations, recommending a degree of caution, stating \"the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed,\" and noted that \"because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately.\" The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that \"Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University of Pennsylvania, to whom Morton donated his collection of skulls, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias and did not accept Gould's theory \"that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias\".\nIn 2014, the group's paper was critically reviewed in the journal \"Evolution &amp; Development\" by University of Pennsylvania philosopher professor Michael Weisberg, who tended to support Gould's original accusations, concluding that \"there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton's measurements\". Weisberg concludes that although Gould did make several errors and overstated his case in a number of places, Morton's work \"remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences\". In 2015, biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Banta published an article arguing that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from Morton's data. They agreed with Gould, and disagreed with the 2011 study, insofar as Morton's study was seriously flawed, but they agreed with the 2011 study insofar as Gould's analysis was in many ways not better than Morton's. University of Pennsylvania anthropology doctoral student Paul Wolff Mitchell published an analysis of Morton's original, unpublished data, which neither Gould nor subsequent commentators had directly addressed. Mitchell concluded that Gould's specific argument about Morton's unconscious bias in measurement is not supported, but that it was true, as Gould had claimed, that Morton's racial biases influenced how he reported and interpreted his measurements, arguing that Morton's interpretation of his data was arbitrary and tendentious: Morton investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap. A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected almost identical skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton's on the basis of this overlap, arguing strongly against any conception of a racial hierarchy.\nNon-overlapping magisteria.\nIn his book \"Rocks of Ages\" (1999), Gould put forward what he described as \"a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed conflict between science and religion\". He defines the term \"magisterium\" as \"a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution\". The non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover \"the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry.\" He suggests that \"NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism\" and that NOMA is \"a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria\".\nThis view has not been without criticism, however. In his book \"The God Delusion\", Richard Dawkins argues that the division between religion and science is not so simple as Gould claims, as few religions exist without claiming the existence of miracles, which \"by definition violate the principles of science\". Dawkins also opposes the idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and values, and therefore has no authority to claim a magisterium of its own. He goes on to say that he believes Gould is \"bending over backwards to be nice to an unworthy but powerful opponent\". Similarly, humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz argues that Gould was wrong to posit that science has nothing to say about questions of ethics. In fact, Kurtz claims that science is a much better method than religion for determining moral principles.\nPersonal life.\nGould married artist Deborah Lee on October 3, 1965. Gould met Lee while they were students together at Antioch College. They had two sons, Jesse and Ethan, and were married for 30 years. His second marriage in 1995 was to artist and sculptor Rhonda Roland Shearer, to whom he was married until his death.\nPublications.\nArticles.\nGould's publications were numerous. One review of his publications between 1965 and 2000 noted 479 peer-reviewed papers, 22 books, 300 essays, and 101 \"major\" book reviews.\nBooks.\nThe following is a list of books either written or edited by Stephen Jay Gould, including those published after his death in 2002. While some books have been republished at later dates, by multiple publishers, the list below comprises the original publisher and publishing date.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the \"Prose Edda\" and \"Heimskringla\", both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. All sources note that the ship is the finest of ships, and the \"Poetic Edda\" and \"Prose Edda\" attest that it is owned by the god Freyr, while the euhemerized account in \"Heimskringla\" attributes it to the magic of Odin. Both \"Heimskringla\" and the \"Prose Edda\" attribute to it the ability to be folded up\u2014as cloth may be\u2014into one's pocket when not needed.\nAttestations.\nReferences to the ship occur in the \"Poetic Edda\", the \"Prose Edda\", and in \"Heimskringla\". The ship is mentioned twice in the \"Poetic Edda\" and both incidents therein occur in the poem \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\". In \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", Odin (disguised as \"Gr\u00edmnir\"), tortured, starved, and thirsty, imparts in the young Agnar cosmological knowledge, including information about the origin of the ship Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\" is mentioned several times in the \"Prose Edda\", where it appears in the books \"Gylfaginning\" and \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\". The first mention of \"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\" in the \"Poetic Edda\" occurs in chapter 43, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) that the god Odin is an important deity. High quotes the second of the above-mentioned \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\" stanzas in support.\nThe boat is first directly addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if \"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\" is the best of ships, what there is to know about it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while \"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\" is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact \"Naglfar\", which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be as it could sail on both the wind and the water. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that \"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\" sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.\nThe next mention of the ship occurs in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" where, in chapter 6, poetic ways of referring to Freyr are provided. Among other names, Freyr is referred to as \"possessor of \"Skidbladnir\" and of the boar known as Gullinbursti\". The first of the two \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\" stanzas mentioned above is then provided as reference.\nIn chapter 35, a myth explaining \"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\"'s creation is provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once cut off the goddess's Sif's hair in an act of mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svart\u00e1lfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mj\u00f6llnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and \"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\", the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will go wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.\n\"Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir\" receives a final mention in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" where, in chapter 75, it appears on a list of ships.\nThe ship gets a single mention in the \"Heimskringla\" book \"Ynglinga saga\". In chapter 7, a euhemerized Odin is said to have had various magical abilities, including that \"he was also able with mere words to extinguish fires, to calm the sea, and to turn the winds any way he pleased. He had a ship called \"Sk\u00edthblathnir\" with which he sailed over great seas. It could be folded together like a cloth.\"\nIn popular culture.\nThe animated television series \"Code Lyoko\" features a digital submarine named \"Skidbladnir\", named this way due to the Nordic ship's efficiency and usefulness.\nIn the 2018 game \"God of War\", Ski\u00f0bla\u00f0nir is mentioned by name, but it is not seen. In its 2022 sequel \"God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\", Ski\u00f0bla\u00f0nir is a magical boat that was owned by the Vanir God Freyr, who then gave it to Kratos to use whenever he wants. As it was made by the Vanir Gods, Ski\u00f0bla\u00f0nir was given the ability to fly and to fold itself when not in use.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27881", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27881", "title": "Sleipnir", "text": "Odin's eight-legged horse\nIn Norse mythology, Sleipnir (Old Norse: \"slippy\" or \"the slipper\") is an eight-legged horse ridden by Odin. Sleipnir is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Sleipnir is Odin's steed, is the child of Loki and Sva\u00f0ilfari, is described as the best of all horses, and is sometimes ridden to the location of Hel. The \"Prose Edda\" contains extended information regarding the circumstances of Sleipnir's birth, and details that he is grey in color.\nSleipnir is also mentioned in a riddle found in the 13th-century legendary saga \"Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks\", in the 13th-century legendary saga \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\" as the ancestor of the horse Grani, and book I of \"Gesta Danorum\", written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, contains an episode considered by many scholars to involve Sleipnir. Sleipnir is generally accepted as depicted on two 8th-century Gotlandic image stones: the Tj\u00e4ngvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone.\nScholarly theories have been proposed regarding Sleipnir's potential connection to shamanic practices among the Norse pagans. In modern times, Sleipnir appears in Icelandic folklore as the creator of \u00c1sbyrgi, in works of art, literature, software, and in the names of ships.\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", Sleipnir appears or is mentioned in the poems \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\", \"Baldrs draumar\", and \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\". In \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", Grimnir (Odin in disguise and not yet having revealed his identity) tells the boy Agnar in verse that Sleipnir is the best of horses (\"Odin is the best of the \u00c6sir, Sleipnir of horses\"). In \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\", the valkyrie Sigrdr\u00edfa tells the hero Sigur\u00f0r that runes should be cut \"on Sleipnir's teeth and on the sledge's strap-bands.\" In \"Baldrs draumar\", after the \u00c6sir convene about the god Baldr's bad dreams, Odin places a saddle on Sleipnir and the two proceed to the location of Hel. The \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma\" section of \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\" says that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with Angrbo\u00f0a, produced Sleipnir with Sva\u00f0ilfari, and thirdly \"one monster that was thought the most baleful, who was descended from B\u00fdleistr's brother.\"\n\"Prose Edda\".\nIn the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", Sleipnir is first mentioned in chapter 15 where the enthroned figure of High says that every day the \u00c6sir ride across the bridge Bifr\u00f6st, and provides a list of the \u00c6sir's horses. The list begins with Sleipnir: \"best is Sleipnir, he is Odin's, he has eight legs.\" In chapter 41, High quotes the \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\" stanza that mentions Sleipnir.\nIn chapter 42, Sleipnir's origins are described. Gangleri (described earlier in the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and what there is to tell about it. High expresses surprise at Gangleri's lack of knowledge about Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall\" about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.\nThe gods declare that Loki would deserve a horrible death if he could not find a scheme that would cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threatened to attack him. Loki, afraid, swore oaths that he would devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it would cost himself. That night, the builder drove out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood ran a mare. The mare neighed at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari became frantic, neighed, tore apart his tackle, and ran towards the mare. The mare ran to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari followed, and the builder chased after. The two horses ran around all night, causing the building work to be held up for the night, and the previous momentum of building work that the builder had been able to maintain was not continued.\nWhen the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a hrimthurs, they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki had \"such dealings\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"somewhat later\" Loki gave birth to a grey foal with eight legs; the horse Sleipnir, \"the best horse among gods and men.\"\nIn chapter 49, High describes the death of the god Baldr. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r agrees to ride to Hel to offer a ransom for Baldr's return, and so \"then Odin's horse Sleipnir was fetched and led forward.\" Herm\u00f3\u00f0r mounts Sleipnir and rides away. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r rides for nine nights in deep, dark valleys where Herm\u00f3\u00f0r can see nothing. The two arrive at the river Gj\u00f6ll and then continue to Gj\u00f6ll bridge, encountering a maiden guarding the bridge named M\u00f3\u00f0gu\u00f0r. Some dialogue occurs between Herm\u00f3\u00f0r and M\u00f3\u00f0gu\u00f0r, including that M\u00f3\u00f0gu\u00f0r notes that recently there had ridden five battalions of dead men across the bridge that made less sound than he. Sleipnir and Herm\u00f3\u00f0r continue \"downwards and northwards\" on the road to Hel, until the two arrive at Hel's gates. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r dismounts from Sleipnir, tightens Sleipnir's girth, mounts him, and spurs Sleipnir on. Sleipnir \"jumped so hard and over the gate that it came nowhere near.\" Herm\u00f3\u00f0r rides up to the hall, and dismounts from Sleipnir. After Herm\u00f3\u00f0r's pleas to Hel to return Baldr are accepted under a condition, Herm\u00f3\u00f0r and Baldr retrace their path backward and return to Asgard.\nIn chapter 16 of the book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", a kenning given for Loki is \"relative of Sleipnir.\" In chapter 17, a story is provided in which Odin rides Sleipnir into the land of J\u00f6tunheimr and arrives at the residence of the j\u00f6tunn Hrungnir. Hrungnir asks \"what sort of person this was\" wearing a golden helmet, \"riding sky and sea,\" and says that the stranger \"has a marvellously good horse.\" Odin wagers his head that no horse as good could be found in all of J\u00f6tunheimr. Hrungnir admitted that it was a fine horse, yet states that he owns a much longer-paced horse; Gullfaxi. Incensed, Hrungnir leaps atop Gullfaxi, intending to attack Odin for Odin's boasting. Odin gallops hard ahead of Hrungnir, and, in his, fury, Hrungnir finds himself having rushed into the gates of Asgard. In chapter 58, Sleipnir is mentioned among a list of horses in \"\u00deorgr\u00edms\u00feula\": \"Hrafn and Sleipnir, splendid horses [...]\". In addition, Sleipnir occurs twice in kennings for \"ship\" (once appearing in chapter 25 in a work by the skald Refr, and \"sea-Sleipnir\" appearing in chapter 49 in \"H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa\", a work by the 10th century skald \u00dalfr Uggason).\n\"Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks\".\nIn \"Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks\", the poem \"Hei\u00f0reks g\u00e1tur\" contains a riddle that mentions Sleipnir and Odin:\n36. Gestumblindi said:\n\"Who are the twain\nthat on ten feet run?\nthree eyes they have,\nbut only one tail.\nAlright guess now\nthis riddle, Heithrek!\"\nHeithrek said:\n\"Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,\nand guessed it is:\nthat is Odin riding on Sleipnir.\"\n\"V\u00f6lsunga saga\".\nIn chapter 13 of \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\", the hero Sigur\u00f0r is on his way to a wood and he meets a long-bearded old man he had never seen before. Sigurd tells the old man that he is going to choose a horse, and asks the old man to come with him to help him decide. The old man says that they should drive the horses down to the river Busiltj\u00f6rn. The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltj\u00f6rn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and handsome grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from \"Sleipnir's kin\" and that \"he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse.\" The old man vanishes. Sigurd names the horse Grani, and the narrative adds that the old man was none other than (the god) Odin.\n\"Gesta Danorum\".\nSleipnir is generally considered as appearing in a sequence of events described in book I of \"Gesta Danorum\".\nIn book I, the young Hadingus encounters \"a certain man of great age who had lost an eye\" who allies him with Liserus. Hadingus and Liserus set out to wage war on Lokerus, ruler of Kurland. Meeting defeat, the old man takes Hadingus with him onto his horse as they flee to the old man's house, and the two drink an invigorating draught. The old man sings a prophecy, and takes Hadingus back to where he found him on his horse. During the ride back, Hadingus trembles beneath the old man's mantle, and peers out of its holes. Hadingus realizes that Sleipnir is running over the sea: \"and he saw that before the steps of the horse lay the sea; but was told not to steal a glimpse of the forbidden thing, and therefore turned his amazed eyes from the dread spectacle of the roads that he journeyed.\"\nIn book II, Biarco mentions Odin and Sleipnir: \"If I may look on the awful husband of Frigg, howsoever he be covered in his white shield, and guide his tall steed, he shall in no way go safe out of Leire; it is lawful to lay low in war the war-waging god.\"\nArchaeological record.\nTwo of the 8th century picture stones from the island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most scholars to depict Sleipnir: the Tj\u00e4ngvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature a rider sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars view as Odin. Above the rider on the Tj\u00e4ngvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, and a female figure greets the rider with a cup. The scene has been interpreted as a rider arriving at the world of the dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name \"haras\" (Old Norse 'army god') may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir. The English Runic Inscription 2 (11th century) is also believed by some scholars to depict Sleipnir.\nTheories.\nJohn Lindow theorizes that Sleipnir's \"connection to the world of the dead grants a special poignancy to one of the kennings in which Sleipnir turns up as a horse word,\" referring to the skald \u00dalfr Uggason's usage of \"sea-Sleipnir\" in his \"H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa\", which describes the funeral of Baldr. Lindow continues that \"his use of Sleipnir in the kenning may show that Sleipnir's role in the failed recovery of Baldr was known at that time and place in Iceland; it certainly indicates that Sleipnir was an active participant in the mythology of the last decades of paganism.\" Lindow adds that the eight legs of Sleipnir \"have been interpreted as an indication of great speed or as being connected in some unclear way with cult activity.\"\nHilda Ellis Davidson says that \"the eight-legged horse of Odin is the typical steed of the shaman\" and that in the shaman's journeys to the heavens or the underworld, a shaman \"is usually represented as riding on some bird or animal.\" Davidson says that while the creature may vary, the horse is fairly common \"in the lands where horses are in general use, and Sleipnir's ability to bear the god through the air is typical of the shaman's steed\" and cites an example from a study of shamanism by Mircea Eliade of an eight-legged foal from a story of a Buryat shaman. Davidson says that while attempts have been made to connect Sleipnir with hobby horses and steeds with more than four feet that appear in carnivals and processions, but that \"a more fruitful resemblance seems to be on the bier on which a dead man is carried in the funeral procession by four bearers; borne along thus, he may be described as riding on a steed with eight legs.\" As an example, Davidson cites a funeral dirge from the Gondi people in India as recorded by Verrier Elwin, stating that \"it contains references to Bagri Maro, the horse with eight legs, and it is clear from the song that it is the dead man's bier.\" Davidson says that the song is sung when a distinguished Muria dies, and provides a verse:\nWhat horse is this?\nIt is the horse of Bagri Maro.\nWhat should we say of its legs?\nThis horse has eight legs.\nWhat should we say of its heads?\nThis horse has four heads. . . .\nCatch the bridle and mount the horse.\nDavidson adds that the representation of Odin's steed as eight-legged could arise naturally out of such an image, and that \"this is in accordance with the picture of Sleipnir as a horse that could bear its rider to the land of the dead.\"\nUlla Loumand cites Sleipnir and the flying horse H\u00f3fvarpnir as \"prime examples\" of horses in Norse mythology as being able to \"mediate between earth and sky, between \u00c1sgar\u00f0r, Mi\u00f0gar\u00f0r and \u00datgar\u00f0r and between the world of mortal men and the underworld.\"\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture\" theorizes that Sleipnir's eight legs may be the remnants of horse-associated divine twins found in Indo-European cultures and ultimately stemming from Proto-Indo-European religion. The encyclopedia states that \"[...] Sleipnir is born with an extra set of legs, thus representing an original pair of horses. Like Freyr and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, Sleipnir is responsible for carrying the dead to the otherworld.\" The encyclopedia cites parallels between the birth of Sleipnir and myths originally pointing to a Celtic goddess who gave birth to the Divine horse twins. These elements include a demand for a goddess by an unwanted suitor (the hrimthurs demanding the goddess Freyja) and the seduction of builders.\nModern influence.\nAccording to Icelandic folklore, the horseshoe-shaped canyon \u00c1sbyrgi located in J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rglj\u00fafur National Park, northern Iceland was formed by Sleipnir's hoof. Sleipnir is depicted with Odin on Dagfin Werenskiold's wooden relief \"Odin p\u00e5 Sleipnir\" (1945\u20131950) on the exterior of the Oslo City Hall in Oslo, Norway. Sleipnir has been and remains a popular name for ships in northern Europe, and Rudyard Kipling's short story entitled \"Sleipner, late Thurinda\" (1888) features a horse named Sleipner. A statue of Sleipnir (1998) stands in Wednesbury, England, a town which takes its name from the Anglo-Saxon version of Odin, W\u014dden.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27884", "revid": "50254362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27884", "title": "Walter Scott", "text": "Scottish novelist (1771\u20131832)\nSir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet (15 August 1771 \u2013 21 September 1832), was a Scottish novelist, poet and historian. Many of his works remain classics of European and Scottish literature, notably the novels \"Ivanhoe\" (1819), \"Rob Roy\" (1817), \"Waverley\" (1814), \"Old Mortality\" (1816), \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian\" (1818), and \"The Bride of Lammermoor\" (1819), along with the narrative poems \"Marmion\" (1808) and \"The Lady of the Lake\" (1810). He greatly influenced European and American literature.\nAs an advocate and legal administrator by profession, he combined writing and editing with his daily work as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire. He was prominent in Edinburgh's Tory establishment, active in the Highland Society, long time a president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820\u20131832), and a vice president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1827\u20131829). His knowledge of history and literary facility equipped him to establish the historical novel genre as an exemplar of European Romanticism. He became a baronet of Abbotsford in the County of Roxburgh on 22 April 1820; the title became extinct upon his son's death in 1847.\nEarly life.\nWalter Scott was born on 15 August 1771 in a third-floor apartment on College Wynd in the Old Town, Edinburgh, a narrow alleyway leading from the Cowgate to the gates of the old University of Edinburgh. He was the ninth child (six having died in infancy) of Walter Scott (1729\u20131799), a member of a cadet branch of the Clan Scott and a Writer to the Signet, and his wife Anne Rutherford, a sister of Daniel Rutherford and a descendant both of the Clan Swinton and of the Haliburton family (descent from which granted Walter's family the hereditary right of burial in Dryburgh Abbey).\nWalter was, through the Haliburtons, a cousin of the London property-developer James Burton and his son, the architect Decimus Burton. Walter became a member of the Clarence Club, of which the Burtons were members.\nA childhood bout of polio in 1773 left Scott lame, a condition that would greatly affect his life and writing.\nTo improve his lameness he was sent in 1773 to live in the rural Scottish Borders, at his paternal grandparents' farm at Sandyknowe, by the ruin of Smailholm Tower, the earlier family home. Here he was taught to read by his aunt Jenny Scott and learned from her the speech patterns and many of the tales and legends that later marked much of his work. In January 1775 he returned to Edinburgh, and that summer with his aunt Jenny took spa treatment at Bath in Somerset, southern England, where they lived at 6 South Parade. In the winter of 1776, he went back to Sandyknowe, with another attempt at a water cure at Prestonpans the following summer.\nIn 1778 Scott returned to Edinburgh for private education to prepare him for school and joined his family in their new house, one of the first to be built in George Square. In October 1779 he began at the Royal High School in Edinburgh (in High School Yards). He was by then well able to walk and explore the city and the surrounding countryside. His reading included chivalric romances, poems, history and travel books. He was given private tuition by James Mitchell in arithmetic and writing, and learned from him the history of the Church of Scotland with emphasis on the Covenanters.\nIn 1783 his parents, believing he had outgrown his strength, sent him to stay for six months with his aunt Jenny at Kelso in the Scottish Borders: there he attended Kelso Grammar School, where he met James Ballantyne and his brother John, who later became his business partners and printers.\nAppearance.\nAs a result of his early polio infection, Scott had a pronounced limp. He was described in 1820 as \"tall, well formed (except for one ankle and foot which made him walk lamely), neither fat nor thin, with forehead very high, nose short, upper lip long and face rather fleshy, complexion fresh and clear, eyes very blue, shrewd and penetrating, with hair now silvery white\". Although a determined walker, he experienced greater freedom of movement on horseback.\nStudent.\nScott began studying classics at the University of Edinburgh in November 1783, at the age of 12, a year or so younger than most fellow students. In March 1786, aged 14, he began an apprenticeship in his father's office to become a Writer to the Signet. At school and university Scott had become a friend of Adam Ferguson, whose father, Professor Adam Ferguson, hosted literary salons. Scott met the blind poet Thomas Blacklock, who lent him books and introduced him to the Ossian cycle of poems by James Macpherson. During the winter of 1786\u20131787, a 15-year-old Scott met the Scots poet Robert Burns at one of these salons, their only meeting. When Burns noticed a print illustrating the poem \"The Justice of the Peace\" and asked who had written it, Scott alone named the author as John Langhorne and was thanked by Burns. Scott describes the event in his memoirs, where he whispers the answer to his friend Adam, who tells Burns; another version of the event appears in \"Literary Beginnings\".\nWhen it was decided that he would become a lawyer, he returned to the university to study law, first taking classes in moral philosophy (under Dugald Stewart) and universal history (under Alexander Fraser Tytler) in 1789\u20131790. During this second university spell Scott became prominent in student intellectual activities: he co-founded the Literary Society in 1789 and was elected to the Speculative Society the following year, becoming librarian and secretary-treasurer a year after.\nAfter completing his law studies, Scott took up law in Edinburgh. He made his first visit as a lawyer's clerk to the Scottish Highlands, directing an eviction. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1792. He had an unsuccessful love suit with Williamina Belsches of Fettercairn, who married Scott's friend Sir William Forbes, 7th Baronet. In February 1797 the threat of a French invasion persuaded Scott and many of his friends to join the Royal Edinburgh Volunteer Light Dragoons, where he served into the early 1800s, and was appointed quartermaster and secretary. The daily drill practices that year, starting at 5 am, indicate the determination with which the role was undertaken.\nLiterary career, marriage and family.\nScott was prompted to take up a literary career by enthusiasm in Edinburgh in the 1790s for modern German literature. Recalling the period in 1827, Scott said that he \"was German-mad.\" In 1796 he produced English versions of two poems by Gottfried August B\u00fcrger, \"Der wilde J\u00e4ger\" and \"Lenore\", published as \"The Chase\", and \"William and Helen\". Scott responded to the German interest at the time in national identity, folk culture and medieval literature, which linked with his own developing passion for traditional balladry. A favourite book since childhood had been Thomas Percy's \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry\". During the 1790s he would search in manuscript collections and on Border \"raids\" for ballads from oral performance. With help from John Leyden, he produced a two-volume \"Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border\" in 1802, containing 48 traditional ballads and two imitations apiece by Leyden and himself. Of the 48 traditionals, 26 were published for the first time. An enlarged edition appeared in three volumes the following year. With many of the ballads, Scott fused different versions into more coherent texts, a practice he later repudiated. The \"Minstrelsy\" was the first and most important of a series of editorial projects over the next two decades, including the medieval romance \"Sir Tristrem\" (which Scott attributed to Thomas the Rhymer) in 1804, the works of John Dryden (18 vols, 1808), and the works of Jonathan Swift (19 vols, 1814).\nOn a trip to the English Lake District with old college friends, he met Charlotte Charpentier (Anglicised to \"Carpenter\"), a daughter of Jean Charpentier of Lyon in France and a ward of Lord Downshire in Cumberland, an Anglican. After three weeks' courtship, Scott proposed and they were married on Christmas Eve 1797 in St Mary's Church, Carlisle (now the nave of Carlisle Cathedral). After renting a house in Edinburgh's George Street, they moved to nearby South Castle Street. Their eldest child, Sophia, was born in 1799, and later married John Gibson Lockhart. Four of their five children survived Scott himself. His eldest son Sir Walter Scott, 2nd Baronet (1801\u20131847), inherited his father's estates and possessions: on 3 February 1825 he married Jane Jobson, only daughter of William Jobson of Lochore (died 1822) by his wife Rachel Stuart (died 1863), heiress of Lochore and a niece of Lady Margaret Ferguson. In 1799 Scott was appointed Sheriff of Selkirk, based at the courthouse in the Royal Burgh of Selkirk. In his early married days Scott earned a decent living from his work as a lawyer, his salary as Sheriff-Depute, his wife's income, some revenue from his writing, and his share of his father's modest estate.\nAfter the younger Walter was born in 1801, the Scotts moved to a spacious three-storey house at 39 North Castle Street, which remained his Edinburgh base until 1826, when it was sold by the trustees appointed after his financial ruin. From 1798, Scott had spent summers in a cottage at Lasswade, where he entertained guests, including literary figures. It was there his career as an author began. There were nominal residency requirements for his position of Sheriff-Depute, and at first he stayed at a local inn during the circuit. In 1804 he ended his use of the Lasswade cottage and leased the substantial house of Ashestiel, from Selkirk, sited on the south bank of the River Tweed and incorporating an ancient tower house.\nAt Scott's insistence the first edition of \"Minstrelsy\" was printed by his friend James Ballantyne at Kelso. In 1798 James had published Scott's version of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" in his newspaper \"The Kelso Mail\", and in 1799 included it and the two B\u00fcrger translations in a privately printed anthology, \"Apology for Tales of Terror\". In 1800 Scott suggested that Ballantyne set up business in Edinburgh and provided a loan for him to make the transition in 1802. In 1805, they became partners in the printing business, and from then until the financial crash of 1826 Scott's works were routinely printed by the firm.\nScott was known for his fondness of dogs, and owned several throughout his life. Upon his death, one newspaper noted \"of all the great men who have loved dogs no one ever loved them better or understood them more thoroughly\". The best known of Scott's dogs were Maida, a large stag hound reported to be his favourite dog, and Spice, a Dandie Dinmont terrier described as having asthma, to which Scott gave particular care. In a diary entry written at the height of his financial woes, Scott described dismay at the prospect of having to sell them: \"The thoughts of parting from these dumb creatures have moved me more than any of the reflections I have put down\".\nThe poet.\nBetween 1805 and 1817 Scott produced five long, six-canto narrative poems, four shorter independently published poems, and many small metrical pieces. Scott was by far the most popular poet of the time until Lord Byron published the first two cantos of \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" in 1812 and followed them up with his exotic oriental verse narratives.\n\"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\" (1805), in medieval romance form, grew out of Scott's plan to include a long original poem of his own in the second edition of the \"Minstrelsy\": it was to be \"a sort of Romance of Border Chivalry &amp; inchantment\". He owed the distinctive irregular accent in four-beat metre to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Christabel\", which he had heard recited by John Stoddart. (It was not to be published until 1816.) Scott was able to draw on his unrivalled familiarity with Border history and legend acquired from oral and written sources beginning in his childhood to present an energetic and highly coloured picture of 16th-century Scotland, which both captivated the general public and with its voluminous notes also addressed itself to the antiquarian student. The poem has a strong moral theme, as human pride is placed in the context of the last judgment with the introduction of a version of the \"Dies irae\" at the end. The work was an immediate success with almost all the reviewers and with readers in general, going through five editions in one year. The most celebrated lines are the ones that open the final stanza: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nBreathes there the man, with soul so dead,\nWho never to himself hath said,\n This is my own, my native land!\nWhose heart hath ne'er within him burned,\nAs home his footsteps he hath turned,\n From wandering on a foreign strand!\u2014\nIf such there breathe, go, mark him well;\nFor him no minstrel raptures swell.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThree years after \"The Lay\" Scott published \"Marmion\" (1808) telling a story of corrupt passions leading up as a disastrous climax to the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The main innovation involves prefacing each of the six cantos with an epistle from the author to a friend: William Stewart Rose, The Rev. John Marriot, William Erskine, James Skene, George Ellis, and Richard Heber: the epistles develop themes of moral positives and special delights imparted by art. In an unprecedented move, the publisher Archibald Constable purchased the copyright of the poem for a thousand guineas at the beginning of 1807, when only the first had been completed. Constable's faith was justified by the sales: the three editions published in 1808 sold 8,000 copies. The verse of \"Marmion\" is less striking than that of \"The Lay\", with the epistles in iambic tetrameters and the narrative in tetrameters with frequent trimeters. The reception by the reviewers was less favourable than that accorded \"The Lay\": style and plot were both found faulty, the epistles did not link up with the narrative, there was too much antiquarian pedantry, and Marmion's character was immoral. The most familiar lines in the poem sum up one of its main themes: \"O what a tangled web we weave,/ When first we practice to deceive\"\nScott's meteoric poetic career peaked with his third long narrative, \"The Lady of the Lake\" (1810), which sold 20,000 copies in the first year. The reviewers were fairly favourable, finding the defects noted in \"Marmion\" largely absent. In some ways it is more conventional than its predecessors: the narrative is entirely in iambic tetrameters and the story of the transparently disguised James V (King of Scots 1513\u201242) predictable: Coleridge wrote to William Wordsworth: 'The movement of the Poem... is between a sleeping Canter and a Marketwoman's trot \u2013 but it is endless \u2013 I seem never to have made any way \u2013 I never remember a narrative poem in which I felt the sense of Progress so languid.\" But the metrical uniformity is relieved by frequent songs and the Perthshire Highland setting is presented as an enchanted landscape, which caused a phenomenal increase in the local tourist trade. Moreover, the poem touches on a theme that was to be central to the Waverley Novels: the clash between neighbouring societies in different stages of development.\nThe remaining two long narrative poems, \"Rokeby\" (1813), set in the Yorkshire estate of that name belonging to Scott's friend John Bacon Sawrey Morritt during the Civil War period, and \"The Lord of the Isles\" (1815), set in early 14th-century Scotland and culminating in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Both works had generally favourable receptions and sold well, but without rivalling the huge success of \"The Lady of the Lake\". Scott also produced four minor narrative or semi-narrative poems between 1811 and 1817: \"The Vision of Don Roderick\" (1811, celebrating Wellington's successes in the Peninsular Campaign, with profits donated to Portuguese war sufferers); \"The Bridal of Triermain\" (published anonymously in 1813); \"The Field of Waterloo\" (1815); and \"Harold the Dauntless\" (published anonymously in 1817).\nThroughout his creative life Scott was an active reviewer. Although himself a Tory he reviewed for \"The Edinburgh Review\" between 1803 and 1806, but that journal's advocacy of peace with Napoleon led him to cancel his subscription in 1808. The following year, at the height of his poetic career, he was instrumental in establishing a Tory rival, \"The Quarterly Review\" to which he contributed reviews for the rest of his life.\nIn 1813 Scott was offered the position of Poet Laureate. He declined, feeling that \"such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice,\" as the Laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders, \"as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions.\" He sought advice from the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, who counselled him to retain his literary independence. The position went to Scott's friend Robert Southey.\nThe novelist.\nGothic novel.\nScott was influenced by Gothic romance, and had collaborated in 1801 with 'Monk' Lewis on \"Tales of Wonder\".\nHistoric romances.\nScott's career as a novelist was attended with uncertainty. The first few chapters of \"Waverley\" were complete by roughly 1805, but the project was abandoned as a result of unfavourable criticism from a friend. Soon after, Scott was asked by the publisher John Murray to posthumously edit and complete the last chapter of an unfinished romance by Joseph Strutt. Published in 1808 and set in 15th-century England, \"Queenhoo Hall\" was not a success due to its archaic language and excessive display of antiquarian information. The success of Scott's Highland narrative poem \"The Lady of the Lake\" in 1810 seems to have put it into his head to resume the narrative and have his hero Edward Waverley journey to Scotland. Although \"Waverley\" was announced for publication at that stage, it was again laid by and not resumed until late 1813, then published in 1814. Only a thousand copies were printed, but the work was an immediate success and 3,000 more were added in two further editions the same year. \"Waverley\" turned out to be the first of 27 novels (eight published in pairs), and by the time the sixth of them, \"Rob Roy\", was published, the print run for the first edition had been increased to 10,000 copies, which became the norm.\nGiven Scott's established status as a poet and the tentative nature of \"Waverley\"'s emergence, it is not surprising that he followed a common practice in the period and published it anonymously. He continued this until his financial ruin in 1826, the novels mostly appearing as \"By the Author of \"Waverley\"\" (or variants thereof) or as \"Tales of My Landlord\". It is not clear why he chose to do this (no fewer than eleven reasons have been suggested), especially as it was a fairly open secret, but as he himself said, with Shylock, \"such was my humour.\"\nScott was an almost exclusively historical novelist. Only one of his 27 novels \u2013 \"Saint Ronan's Well\" \u2013 has a wholly modern setting. The settings of the others range from 1794 in \"The Antiquary\" back to 1096 or 1097, the time of the First Crusade, in \"Count Robert of Paris\". Sixteen take place in Scotland. The first nine, from \"Waverley\" (1814) to \"A Legend of Montrose\" (1819), all have Scottish locations and 17th- or 18th-century settings. Scott was better versed in his material than anyone: he could draw on oral tradition and a wide range of written sources in his ever-expanding library (many of the books rare and some unique copies). In general it is these pre-1820 novels that have drawn the attention of modern critics \u2013 especially: \"Waverley\", with its presentation of the 1745 Jacobites drawn from the Highland clans as obsolete and fanatical idealists; \"Old Mortality\" (1816) with its treatment of the 1679 Covenanters as fanatical and often ridiculous (prompting John Galt to produce a contrasting picture in his novel \"Ringan Gilhaize\" in 1823); \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian\" (1818) with its low-born heroine Jeanie Deans making a perilous journey to Richmond in 1737 to secure a promised royal pardon for her sister, falsely accused of infanticide; and the tragic \"The Bride of Lammermoor\" (1819), with its stern account of a declined aristocratic family, with Edgar Ravenswood and his fianc\u00e9e as victims of the wife of an upstart lawyer in a time of political power-struggle before the Act of Union in 1707.\nIn 1820, in a bold move, Scott shifted period and location for \"Ivanhoe\" (1820) to 12th-century England. This meant he was dependent on a limited range of sources, all of them printed: he had to bring together material from different centuries and invent an artificial form of speech based on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. The result is as much myth as history, but the novel remains his best-known work, the most likely to be found by the general reader. Eight of the subsequent 17 novels also have medieval settings, though most are set towards the end of the era, for which Scott had a better supply of contemporaneous sources. His familiarity with Elizabethan and 17th-century English literature, partly resulting from editorial work on pamphlets and other minor publications, meant that four of his works set in the England of that period \u2013 \"Kenilworth\" (1821), \"The Fortunes of Nigel\" and \"Peveril of the Peak\" (1821), and \"Woodstock\" (1826) \u2013 present rich pictures of their societies. The most generally esteemed of Scott's later fictions, though, are three short stories: a supernatural narrative in Scots, \"Wandering Willie's Tale\" in \"Redgauntlet\" (1824), and \"The Highland Widow\" and \"The Two Drovers\" in \"Chronicles of the Canongate\" (1827).\nCrucial to Scott's historical thinking is the concept that very different societies can move through the same stages as they develop, and that humanity is basically unchanging, or as he puts it in the first chapter of \"Waverley\" that there are \"passions common to men in all stages of society, and which have alike agitated the human heart, whether it throbbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth century, the brocaded coat of the eighteenth, or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present day.\" It was one of Scott's main achievements to give lively, detailed pictures of different stages of Scottish, British, and European society while making it clear that for all the differences in form, they took the same human passions as those of his own age. His readers could therefore appreciate the depiction of an unfamiliar society, while having no difficulty in relating to the characters.\nScott is fascinated by striking moments of transition between stages in societies. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in a discussion of Scott's early novels, found that they derive their \"long-sustained \"interest\"\" from \"the contest between the two great moving Principles of social Humanity \u2013 religious adherence to the Past and the Ancient, the Desire &amp; the admiration of Permanence, on the one hand; and the Passion for increase of Knowledge, for Truth as the offspring of Reason, in short, the mighty Instincts of \"Progression\" and \"Free-agency\", on the other.\" This is clear, for example, in \"Waverley\", as the hero is captivated by the romantic allure of the Jacobite cause embodied in Bonnie Prince Charlie and his followers before accepting that the time for such enthusiasms has passed and accepting the more rational, humdrum reality of Hanoverian Britain. Another example appears in 15th-century Europe in the yielding of the old chivalric world view of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, to the Machiavellian pragmatism of Louis XI. Scott is intrigued by the way different stages of societal development can exist side by side in one country. When Waverley has his first experience of Highland ways after a raid on his Lowland host's cattle, it \"seemed like a dream\u00a0... that these deeds of violence should be familiar to men's minds, and currently talked of, as falling with the common order of things, and happening daily in the immediate neighbourhood, without his having crossed the seas, and while he was yet in the otherwise well-ordered island of Great Britain.\" A more complex version of this comes in Scott's second novel, \"Guy Mannering\" (1815), which \"set in 1781\u20122, offers no simple opposition: the Scotland represented in the novel is at once backward and advanced, traditional and modern \u2013 it is a country in varied stages of progression in which there are many social subsets, each with its own laws and customs.\"\nScott's process of composition can be traced through the manuscripts (mostly preserved), the more fragmentary sets of proofs, his correspondence, and publisher's records. He did not create detailed plans for his stories, and the remarks by the figure of \"the Author\" in the Introductory Epistle to \"The Fortunes of Nigel\" probably reflect his own experience: \"I think there is a d\u00e6mon who seats himself on the feather of my pen when I begin to write, and leads it astray from the purpose. Characters expand under my hand; incidents are multiplied; the story lingers, while the materials increase \u2013 my regular mansion turns out a Gothic anomaly, and the work is complete long before I have attained the point I proposed.\" Yet the manuscripts rarely show major deletions or changes of direction, and Scott could clearly keep control of his narrative. That was important, for as soon as he had made fair progress with a novel he would start sending batches of manuscript to be copied (to preserve his anonymity), and the copies were sent to be set up in type. (As usual at the time, the compositors would supply the punctuation.) He received proofs, also in batches, and made many changes at that stage, but these were almost always local corrections and enhancements.\nAs the number of novels grew, they were republished in small collections: \"Novels and Tales\" (1819: \"Waverley\" to \"A Tale of Montrose\"); \"Historical Romances\" (1822: \"Ivanhoe\" to \"Kenilworth\"); \"Novels and Romances\" (1824 [1823]: \"The Pirate\" to \"Quentin Durward\"); and two series of \"Tales and Romances\" (1827: \"St Ronan's Well\" to \"Woodstock\"; 1833: \"Chronicles of the Canongate\" to \"Castle Dangerous\"). In his last years Scott marked up interleaved copies of these collected editions to produce a final version of what were now officially the \"Waverley Novels\", often called his 'Magnum Opus' or 'Magnum Edition'. Scott provided each novel with an introduction and notes and made mostly piecemeal adjustments to the text. Issued in 48 smart monthly volumes between June 1829 and May 1833 at a modest price of five shillings (60p) these were an innovative and profitable venture aimed at a wide readership: the print run was an astonishing 30,000.\nIn a \"General Preface\" to the \"Magnum Edition\", Scott wrote that one factor prompting him to resume work on the \"Waverley\" manuscript in 1813 had been a desire to do for Scotland what had been done in the fiction of Maria Edgeworth, \"whose Irish characters have gone so far to make the English familiar with the character of their gay and kind-hearted neighbours of Ireland, that she may be truly said to have done more towards completing the Union, than perhaps all the legislative enactments by which it has been followed up [the Act of Union of 1801].\" Most of Scott's readers were English: with \"Quentin Durward\" (1823) and \"Woodstock\" (1826), for example, some 8000 of the 10,000 copies of the first edition went to London. In the Scottish novels the lower-class characters normally speak Scots, but Scott is careful not to make the Scots too dense, so that those unfamiliar with it can follow the gist without understanding every word. Some have also argued that although Scott was formally a supporter of the Union with England (and Ireland) his novels have a strong nationalist subtext for readers attuned to that wavelength.\nScott's new career as a novelist in 1814 did not mean he abandoned poetry. The Waverley Novels contain much original verse, including familiar songs such as \"Proud Maisie\" from \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian\" (Ch. 41) and \"Look not thou on Beauty's charming\" from \"The Bride of Lammermoor\" (Ch. 3). In most of the novels Scott preceded each chapter with an epigram or \"motto\"; most of these are in verse, and many are of his own composition, often imitating other writers such as Beaumont and Fletcher.\nRecovery of the Crown Jewels, baronetcy, and ceremonial pageantry.\nPrompted by Scott, the Prince Regent (the future George IV) gave Scott and other officials permission in a Royal Warrant dated 28 October 1817 to conduct a search for the Crown Jewels (\"Honours of Scotland\"). During the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell these had been hidden away, but had subsequently been used to crown Charles II. They were not used to crown subsequent monarchs, but were regularly taken to sittings of Parliament, to represent the absent monarch, until the Act of Union 1707. So the honours were stored in Edinburgh Castle, but their large locked box was not opened for more than 100 years, and stories circulated that they had been \"lost\" or removed. On 4 February 1818, Scott and a small military team opened the box and \"unearthed\" the honours from the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle. On 19 August 1818 through Scott's effort, his friend Adam Ferguson was appointed Deputy Keeper of the \"Scottish Regalia\". The Scottish patronage system swung into action and after elaborate negotiations the Prince Regent granted Scott the title of baronet: in April 1820 he received the baronetcy in London, becoming Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet.\nAfter George's accession, the city council of Edinburgh invited Scott, at the sovereign's behest, to stage-manage the 1822 visit of George IV to Scotland. In spite of having only three weeks to work with, Scott created a spectacular, comprehensive pageant, designed not only to impress the King, but in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised Scots society. Probably fortified by his vivid depiction of the pageant staged for the reception of Queen Elizabeth in \"Kenilworth\" he and his \"production team\" mounted what in modern days would be a public-relations event, with the King dressed in tartan and greeted by his people, many of them also in similar tartan ceremonial dress. This form of dress, proscribed after the Jacobite rising of 1745, became one of the seminal, potent and ubiquitous symbols of Scottish identity.\nFinancial problems and death.\nIn 1825 a British banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the Ballantyne printing business, of which Scott was the only partner with a financial interest. Its debts of \u00a3130,000 () caused his very public ruin. Rather than declare himself bankrupt or accept any financial support from his many supporters and admirers (including the King himself), he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and set out to write his way out of debt. To add to his burdens, his wife Charlotte died in 1826.\nDespite these events or because of them, Scott kept up his prodigious output. Between 1826 and 1832 he produced six novels, two short stories and two plays, eleven works or volumes of non-fiction, and a journal, along with several unfinished works. The non-fiction included the \"Life of Napoleon Buonaparte\" in 1827, two volumes of the \"History of Scotland\" in 1829 and 1830, and four instalments of the series entitled \"Tales of a Grandfather \u2013 Being Stories Taken From Scottish History\", written one per year over the period 1828\u20131831, among several others. Finally, Scott had recently been inspired by the diaries of Samuel Pepys and Lord Byron, and he began keeping a journal over the period, which was published in 1890 as \"The Journal of Sir Walter Scott\".\nBy then Scott's health was failing, and on 29 October 1831, in a vain search for improvement, he set off on a voyage to Malta and Naples aboard HMS \"Barham\", a frigate put at his disposal by the Admiralty. He was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went. On his journey home he boarded the steamboat \"Prins Frederik\" going from Cologne to Rotterdam. While on board he had a final stroke near Emmerich. After local treatment, a steamboat took him to the steamship \"Batavier\", which left for England on 12 June. By coincidence, the writer Mary Martha Sherwood was also on board. She would later write about this encounter. After he was landed in England, Scott was transported back to die at Abbotsford on 21 September 1832. He was 61.\nScott was buried in Dryburgh Abbey, where his wife had earlier been interred. Lady Scott had been buried as an Episcopalian; at Scott's own funeral, three ministers of the Church of Scotland officiated at Abbotsford and the service at Dryburgh was conducted by an Episcopal clergyman.\nAlthough Scott died owing money, his novels continued to sell, and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death.\nReligion.\nScott was raised as a Presbyterian in the Church of Scotland. He was ordained as an elder in Duddingston Kirk in 1806, and sat in the General Assembly for a time as representative elder of the burgh of Selkirk. In adult life he also adhered to the Scottish Episcopal Church: he seldom attended church but read the \"Book of Common Prayer\" services in family worship.\nScott was one of the last individuals cursed by the Muggletonian movement on account of his reviling Muggletonianism.\nFreemasonry.\nScott's father was a Freemason, being a member of Lodge St David, No. 36 (Edinburgh), and Scott also became a Freemason in his father's Lodge in 1801, albeit only after the death of his father.\nAbbotsford House.\nWhen Scott was a boy, he sometimes travelled with his father from Selkirk to Melrose, where some of his novels are set. At a certain spot, the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the Battle of Melrose (1526).\nDuring the summers from 1804, Scott made his home at the large house of Ashestiel, on the south bank of the River Tweed, north of Selkirk. When his lease on this property expired in 1811, he bought Cartley Hole Farm, downstream on the Tweed nearer Melrose. The farm had the nickname of \"Clarty Hole\", and Scott renamed it \"Abbotsford\" after a neighbouring ford used by the monks of Melrose Abbey. Following a modest enlargement of the original farmhouse in 1811\u201312, massive expansions took place in 1816\u201319 and 1822\u201324. Scott described the resulting building as 'a sort of romance in Architecture' and 'a kind of Conundrum Castle to be sure'. With his architects William Atkinson and Edward Blore Scott was a pioneer of the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, and Abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling. Through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour, trophies of the chase, a library of more than 9,000 volumes, fine furniture, and still finer pictures. Panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the house.\nIt is estimated that the building cost Scott more than \u00a325,000 (). More land was purchased until Scott owned nearly . In 1817 as part of the land purchases Scott bought the nearby mansion-house of Toftfield for his friend Adam Ferguson to live in along with his brothers and sisters and on which, at the ladies' request, he bestowed the name of Huntlyburn. Ferguson commissioned Sir David Wilkie to paint the Scott family resulting in the painting \"The Abbotsford Family\" in which Scott is seated with his family represented as a group of country folk. Ferguson is standing to the right with the feather in his cap and Thomas Scott, Scott's Uncle, is behind. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818.\nAbbotsford later gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded in 1834 in memory of Sir Walter Scott.\nReputation.\nLater assessment.\nAlthough he continued to be extremely popular and widely read, both at home and abroad, Scott's critical reputation declined in the last half of the 19th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism, and Scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children. This trend accelerated in the 20th century. For example, in his classic study \"Aspects of the Novel\" (1927), E. M. Forster harshly criticized Scott's clumsy and slapdash writing style, \"flat\" characters, and thin plots. In contrast, the novels of Scott's contemporary Jane Austen, once appreciated only by a discerning few (including, as it happened, Scott himself) rose steadily in critical esteem, though Austen, as a female writer, was still faulted for her narrow (\"feminine\") choice of subject matter, which, unlike Scott, avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine.\nNevertheless, Scott's importance as an innovator continued to be recognised. He was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel (which others trace to Jane Porter, whose work in the genre predates Scott's) and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in Britain and on the European continent. In the cultural sphere, Scott's Waverley novels played a significant part in the movement (begun with James Macpherson's \"Ossian\" cycle) in rehabilitating the public perception of the Scottish Highlands and its culture, which had been formerly been viewed by the southern mind as a barbaric breeding ground of hill bandits, religious fanaticism, and Jacobite risings.\nScott served as chairman of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and was also a member of the Royal Celtic Society. His own contribution to the reinvention of Scottish culture was enormous, even though his re-creations of the customs of the Highlands were fanciful at times. Through the medium of Scott's novels, the violent religious and political conflicts of the country's recent past could be seen as belonging to history\u2014which Scott defined, as the subtitle of \"Waverley\" (\"'Tis Sixty Years Since\") indicates, as something that happened at least 60 years earlier. His advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong, though unspoken, contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative English speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the French style on British soil. Scott's orchestration of King George IV's visit to Scotland, in 1822, was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasi-medieval blood-letting to be put to rest, while envisioning a more useful, peaceful future.\nAfter Scott's work had been essentially unstudied for many decades, a revival of critical interest began in the middle of the 20th century. While F. R. Leavis had disdained Scott, seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence (\"The Great Tradition\" [1948]), Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs (\"The Historical Novel\" [1937, trans. 1962]) and David Daiches (\"Scott's Achievement as a Novelist\" [1951]) offered a Marxian political reading of Scott's fiction that generated a great deal of interest in his work. These were followed in 1966 by a major thematic analysis covering most of the novels by Francis R. Hart (\"Scott's Novels: The Plotting of Historic Survival\"). Scott has proved particularly responsive to Postmodern approaches, most notably to the concept of the interplay of multiple voices highlighted by Mikhail Bakhtin, as suggested by the title of the volume with selected papers from the Fourth International Scott Conference held in Edinburgh in 1991, \"Scott in Carnival\". Scott is now increasingly recognised not only as the principal inventor of the historical novel and a key figure in the development of Scottish and world literature, but also as a writer of a depth and subtlety who challenges his readers as well as entertaining them.\nMemorials and commemoration.\nDuring his lifetime, Scott's portrait was painted by Sir Edwin Landseer and his fellow-Scots Sir Henry Raeburn and James Eckford Lauder, and in 1824 by the American painter Charles Robert Leslie, later engraved by M I Danforth in 1829. After Watts Souvenir of 1829 was published Close friends and family said \"That it was the best engraving that had yet appeared of the likeness of the author of Waverley\". \nPost Scott's life, 1833, W J Thompson painted a miniature for a gold memorial locket shown in William John Thompson. \nIn Edinburgh, the 61.1-metre-tall Victorian Gothic spire of the Scott Monument was designed by George Meikle Kemp. It was completed in 1844, 12 years after Scott's death, and dominates the south side of Princes Street. Scott is also commemorated on a stone slab in Makars' Court, outside The Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, along with other prominent Scottish writers; quotes from his work are also visible on the Canongate Wall of the Scottish Parliament building in Holyrood. There is a tower dedicated to his memory on Corstorphine Hill in the west of the city and Edinburgh's Waverley railway station, opened in 1854, takes its name from his first novel.\nIn Glasgow, Walter Scott's Monument dominates the centre of George Square, the main public square in the city. Designed by David Rhind in 1838, the monument features a large column topped by a statue of Scott. There is a statue of Scott in Central Park in New York City.\nNumerous Masonic Lodges have been named after Scott and his novels. For example: Lodge Sir Walter Scott, No. 859 (Perth, Australia) and Lodge Waverley, No. 597, (Edinburgh, Scotland).\nThe annual Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction was created in 2010 by the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, whose ancestors were closely linked to Sir Walter Scott. At \u00a325,000, it is one of the largest prizes in British literature. The award has been presented at Scott's historic home, Abbotsford House.\nScott has been credited with rescuing the Scottish banknote. In 1826, there was outrage in Scotland at the attempt of Parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds. Scott wrote a series of letters to the \"Edinburgh Weekly Journal\" under the pseudonym \"Malachi Malagrowther\" for retaining the right of Scottish banks to issue their own banknotes. This provoked such a response that the Government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing pound notes. This campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the Bank of Scotland. The image on the 2007 series of banknotes is based on the portrait by Henry Raeburn.\nIn the United States, during and immediately after the First World War, there was a movement spearheaded by President Woodrow Wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in American schoolchildren, especially immigrants, and to stress the American connection with the literature and institutions of the \"mother country\" of Great Britain, using selected readings in middle school textbooks. Scott's \"Ivanhoe\" continued to be required reading for many American high-school students until the end of the 1950s.\nA bust of Scott is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. Twelve streets in Vancouver, British Columbia are named after Scott's books or characters.\nIn the Inch district of Edinburgh, some 30 streets developed in the early 1950s are named for Scott (Sir Walter Scott Avenue) and for characters and places from his poems and novels. Examples include Saddletree Loan (after Bartoline Saddletree, a character in \"The Heart of Midlothian\"), Hazelwood Grove (after Charles Hazelwood, a character in \"Guy Mannering\") and Redgauntlet Terrace (after the 1824 novel of that name).\nInfluence.\nWalter Scott had an immense impact throughout Europe. \"His historical fiction ... created for the first time a sense of the past as a place where people thought, felt and dressed differently\". His historical romances \"influenced Balzac, Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Dumas, Pushkin, and many others; and his interpretation of history was seized on by Romantic nationalists, particularly in Eastern Europe\". Also highly influential were the early translations into French by Auguste Defauconpret.\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon was a great admirer of Scott and, on his death, she wrote two tributes to him: \"On Walter Scott\" in the Literary Gazette, and \"Sir Walter Scott\" in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833. Towards the end of her life she began a series called \"The Female Picture Gallery\" with a series of character analyses based on the women in Scott's works.\nVictor Hugo, in his 1823 essay, \"Sir Walter Scott: Apropos of Quentin Durward\", writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Surely there is something strange and marvelous in the talent of this man who disposes of his reader as the wind disposes of a leaf; who leads him at his will into all places and into all times; unveils for him with ease the most secret recesses of the heart, as well as the most mysterious phenomena of nature, as well as the obscurest pages of history; whose imagination caresses and dominates all other imaginations, clothes with the same astonishing truth the beggar with his rags and the king with his robes, assumes all manners, adopts all garbs, speaks all languages; leaves to the physiognomy of the ages all that is immutable and eternal in their lineaments, traced there by the wisdom of God, and all that is variable and fleeting, planted there by the follies of men; does not force, like certain ignorant romancers, the personages of the past to colour themselves with our brushes and smear themselves with our varnish; but compels, by his magic power, the contemporary reader to imbue himself, at least for some hours, with the spirit of the old times, today so much scorned, like a wise and adroit adviser inviting ungrateful \nchildren to return to their father.\nAlessandro Manzoni's \"The Betrothed\" (1827) has similarities with Scott's historic novel \"Ivanhoe\", although evidently distinct.\nIn Charles Baudelaire's \"La Fanfarlo\" (1847), poet Samuel Cramer says of Scott:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Oh that tedious author, a dusty exhumer of chronicles! A fastidious mass of descriptions of bric-a-brac\u00a0... and castoff things of every sort, armor, tableware, furniture, gothic inns, and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about, dressed in leotards.\nIn the novella, however, Cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of Scott's novels.\nJane Austen, in a letter to her nephew James Edward Austen on 16 December 1816, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUncle Henry writes very superior Sermons.\u2013 You &amp; I must try to get hold of one or two, &amp; put them into our Novels;\u2013 it would be a fine help to a volume; &amp; we could make our Heroine read it aloud of a Sunday Evening, just as well as Isabella Wardour in \"the Antiquary\", is made to read the History of the Hartz Demon in the ruins of St Ruth\u2013 tho' I believe, upon recollection, Lovell is the Reader.\nIn Austen's \"Persuasion\" (1817) Anne Elliot and Captain James Benwick discuss the \"richness of the present age\" of poetry, and whether \"Marmion\" or \"The Lady of the Lake\" is the more preferred work.\nMary Shelley, while researching for her historical novel \"The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck\" (1830), wrote to Scott on 25 May 1829, asking him for information on any works or manuscripts he knew about Perkin Warbeck. She concludes the letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I hope you will forgive my troubling you. It is almost impertinent to say how foolish it appears to me that I should intrude on your ground, or to compliment one all the world so highly appreciates. But as every traveller when they visit the Alps endeavours, however imperfectly, to express their admiration in the Inn's album, so it is impossible to address the Author of \"Waverley\" without thanking him for the delight and instruction derived from the inexhaustible source of his genius, and trying to express a part of the enthusiastic admiration his works inspire.\nIn Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" (1847) St. John Rivers gives a copy of \"Marmion\" to Jane to provide her \"evening solace\" during her stay in her small lodging.\nEmily Bront\u00eb's \"Wuthering Heights\" was influenced by the novels of Scott. In particular, according to Juliet Barker, \"Rob Roy\" (1817) had a significant influence on Bront\u00eb's novel, which, though \"regarded as the archetypal Yorkshire novel ... owed as much, if not more, to Walter Scott's Border country\". \"Rob Roy\" is set \"in the wilds of Northumberland, among the uncouth and quarrelsome squirearchical Osbaldistones\", while Cathy Earnshaw \"has strong similarities with Diana Vernon, who is equally out of place among her boorish relations\" (Barker p.\u00a0501).\nIn Anne Bront\u00eb's \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\" (1848) the narrator, Gilbert Markham, brings an elegantly bound copy of \"Marmion\" as a present to the independent \"tenant of Wildfell Hall\" (Helen Graham) whom he is courting, and is mortified when she insists on paying for it.\nIn George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" (1871), Mr. Trumbull remarks to Mary Garth: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,\" he observed, when Mary re-entered. \"It is by the author of \"Waverley\": that is Sir Walter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself\u2014a very nice thing, a very superior publication, entitled \"Ivanhoe\". You will not get any writer to beat him in a hurry, I think\u2014he will not, in my opinion, be speedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at the commencement of \"Anne of Jeersteen\" [\"sic\"]. It commences well.\"\nThomas Hardy, in his 1888 essay, \"The Profitable Reading of Fiction\", writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTested by such considerations as these there are obviously many volumes of fiction remarkable, and even great, in their character-drawing, their feeling, their philosophy, which are quite second-rate in their structural quality as narratives. Their fewness is remarkable, and bears out the opinion expressed earlier in this essay, that the art of novel-writing is as yet in its tentative stage only... \"The Bride of Lammermoor\" is an almost perfect specimen of form, which is the more remarkable in that Scott, as a rule, depends more upon episode, dialogue, and description, for exciting interest, than upon the well-knit interdependence of parts.\nThe many other British novelists whom Scott influenced included Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Kingsley, and Robert Louis Stevenson. He also shaped children's writers like Charlotte Yonge and G. A. Henty.\nNathaniel Hawthorne, in a letter to his sister Elizabeth on 31 October 1820, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI have bought the \"Lord of the Isles\" and intend either to send or bring it to you. I like it as well as any of Scott's other poems... I shall read \"The Abbot\", by the author of Waverley, as soon as I can hire it. I have read all of Scott's novels except that, I wish I had not, that I might have the pleasure of reading them again.\nEdgar Allan Poe, an admirer of Scott, was particularly captivated with \"The Bride of Lammermoor\", calling it \"that purest, and most enthralling of fictions\", and \"the master novel of Scott.\"\nIn a speech delivered at Salem, Massachusetts, on 6 January 1860, to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist John Brown and his followers, Ralph Waldo Emerson calls Brown an example of true chivalry, which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that \"Walter Scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career.\"\nHenry James, in his 1864 essay, \"Fiction and Sir Walter Scott\", writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Scott was a born story-teller: we can give him no higher praise. Surveying his works, his character, his method, as a whole, we can liken him to nothing better than to a strong and kindly elder brother, who gathers his juvenile public about him at eventide, and pours out a stream of wondrous improvisation. Who cannot remember an experience like this? On no occasion are the delights of fiction so intense. Fiction? These are the triumphs of fact. In the richness of his invention and memory, in the infinitude of his knowledge, in his improvidence for the future, in the skill with which he answers, or rather parries, sudden questions, in his low-voiced pathos and his resounding merriment, he is identical with the ideal fireside chronicler. And thoroughly to enjoy him, we must again become as credulous as children at twilight.\nIn his 1870 memoir, \"Army Life in a Black Regiment\", New England abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson (later editor of Emily Dickinson), described how he wrote down and preserved Negro spirituals or \"shouts\" while serving as a colonel in the 1st South Carolina Colored Infantry Regiment, the first authorized Union Army regiment recruited from freedmen during the Civil War. He wrote that he was \"a faithful student of the Scottish ballads, and had always envied Sir Walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather, and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones.\"\nAccording to Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor, Scott was \"an author to whom Karl Marx again and again returned, whom he admired and knew as well as he did Balzac and Fielding.\"\nMark Twain, in his 1883 \"Life on the Mississippi\", satirised the impact of Scott's writings, declaring with humorous hyperbole that Scott \"had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the [American Civil] war\" that he is \"in great measure responsible for the war.\" He goes on to coin the term \"Sir Walter Scott disease\", describing a respect for aristocracy, a social acceptance of duels and vendettas, and a taste for fantasy and romanticism, which he blames for the Southern US's lack of advancement. Twain also targeted Scott in \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", where he names a sinking boat the \"Walter Scott\" (1884); and, in \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" (1889), the main character repeatedly utters \"Great Scott!\" as an oath; by the end of the book, however, he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armour, reflecting Twain's ambivalence on the topic.\nIn \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1908) by Lucy Maude Montgomery, as Anne is bringing in the cows from pasture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The cows swung placidly down the lane, and Anne followed them dreamily, repeating aloud the battle canto from \"Marmion\"\u2014which had also been part of their English course the preceding winter and which Miss Stacy had made them learn off by heart\u2014and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash of spears in its imagery. When she came to the lines\n\"The stubborn spearsmen still made good\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Their dark impenetrable wood,\"\nshe stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy herself one of that heroic ring.\nThe idyllic Cape Cod retreat of suffragists Verena Tarrant and Olive Chancellor in Henry James's \"The Bostonians\" (1886) is called Marmion, evoking what James considered the Quixotic idealism of such social reformers.\nIn \"To the Lighthouse\" by Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Ramsey glances at her husband:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was reading something that moved him very much\u00a0... He was tossing the pages over. He was acting it \u2013 perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book. She wondered what book it was. Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter's she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting. For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above) \u2013 had been saying that people don't read Scott any more. Then her husband thought, \"That's what they'll say of me;\" so he went and got one of those books?\u00a0... It fortified him. He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening... and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn't exist at all\u00a0...[Scott's] feeling for straight forward simple things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in Mucklebackit's cottage [in \"The Antiquary\"] made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears. Raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and French novels and English novels and Scott's hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie's drowning and Mucklebackit's sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him. \nWell, let them improve upon that, he thought as he finished the chapter\u00a0... The whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the English novel and the French novel.\nWoolf, in a letter to Hugh Walpole on 12 September 1932, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI don't know him [Scott] accurately and minutely as you do, but only in a warm, scattered, amorous way. Now you have put an edge on my love, and if it weren't that I must read MSS\u2014how they flock! I should plunge\u2014you urge me almost beyond endurance to plunge once more\u2014yes, I say to myself, I shall read \"\" again and then I shall go back to [The Heart of] \"Midlothian\". I cant read the \"Bride\" [of Lammermoor], because I know it almost by heart: also the \"Antiquary\" (I think those two, as a whole, are my favourites). Well\u2014to inspire a harassed hack to this wish to kick up her heels\u2014what greater proof could there be of your powers of persuasion and illumination? My only complaint is that you pay too much attention to the arid gulls who can't open their beaks wide enough to swallow Sir Walter. One of the things I want to write about one day is the Shakespearean talk in Scott: the dialogues: surely that is the last appearance in England of the blank verse of Falstaff and so on! We have lost the art of the poetic speech.\nJohn Cowper Powys described Walter Scott's romances as \"by far the most powerful literary influence of my life\". This can be seen particularly in his two historical novels, \"\", set during the end of Roman rule in Britain, and \"Owen Glendower\".\nIn 1951 the science-fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote \"Breeds There a Man...?\", a short story with a title alluding vividly to Scott's \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\" (1805). In Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1960), the protagonist's brother is made to read Scott's book \"Ivanhoe\" to the ailing Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. In \"Mother Night\" (1961) by Kurt Vonnegut Jr, the memoirist and playwright Howard W. Campbell Jr. prefaces his text with the six lines beginning \"Breathes there the man...\" In \"Knights of the Sea\" (2010) by the Canadian author Paul Marlowe, there are several references to \"Marmion\", as well as an inn named after \"Ivanhoe\", and a fictitious Scott novel entitled \"The Beastmen of Glen Glammoch\".\nScott also features as a character in two of Sara Sheridan's novels \"The Fair Botanists\" (2021) and The Jewel Keepers (2026)\nThe other arts.\nAlthough Scott's own appreciation of music was basic, to say the least, he had a considerable influence on composers. Some 90 operas based to some extent on his poems and novels have been traced, the most celebrated being Rossini's \"La donna del lago\" (1819, based on \"The Lady of the Lake\") and Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" (1835, based on \"The Bride of Lammermoor\"). Others include Donizetti's 1829 opera \"Il castello di Kenilworth\" based on \"Kenilworth\", Georges Bizet's La jolie fille de Perth (1867, based on \"The Fair Maid of Perth\"), and Arthur Sullivan's \"Ivanhoe\" (1891).\nMany of Scott's songs were set to music by composers throughout the 19th century. Seven from \"The Lady of the Lake\" were set in German translations by Franz Schubert, one of them being 'Ellens dritter Gesang' popularly known as 'Schubert's \"Ave Maria\"'. Three lyrics, also in translation, appear from Ludwig van Beethoven in his \"Twenty-Five Scottish Songs\", Op. 108. Other notable musical responses include three overtures: \"Waverley\" (1828) and \"Rob Roy\" (1831) by Hector Berlioz, and \"The Land of the Mountain and the Flood\" (1887, alluding to \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\") by Hamish MacCunn. \"Hail to the Chief\" from \"The Lady of the Lake\" was set to music around 1812 by the songwriter James Sanderson (c.\u20091769 \u2013 c.\u20091841). See the Wikipedia article \"Hail to the Chief.\"\nThe Waverley Novels are full of eminently paintable scenes and many 19th-century artists responded to them. Among the outstanding paintings of Scott subjects are: Richard Parkes Bonington's \"Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leicester\" (\"c.\" 1827) from \"Kenilworth\" in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's \"L'Enl\u00e8vement de Rebecca\" (1846) from \"Ivanhoe\" in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and John Everett Millais's \"The Bride of Lammermoor\" (1878) in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.\nWalter Scott features as a character in Sara Sheridan's novel \"The Fair Botanists\" (2021).\nWorks.\nNovels.\nThe Waverley novels is the title given to the long series of Scott novels released from 1814 to 1832 which takes its name from the first novel, \"Waverley\". The following is a chronological list of the entire series:\nOther novels:\nPoetry.\nMany of the short poems or songs released by Scott (or later anthologised) were originally not separate pieces but parts of longer poems interspersed throughout his novels, tales, and dramas.\nCollections.\nIn 1925 Scott's manuscripts, letters and papers were donated to the National Library of Scotland by the Advocates Library of the Faculty of Advocates.\nUniversity College London holds about 300 books relating to Scott. The collection originated with a donation from Arthur MacNalty.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated on the cultural boundary between Occitania and Piedmont, the area extends from Lake Geneva in the north to the Dauphin\u00e9 in the south and west and to the Aosta Valley in the east.\nSavoy, formerly a part of the Kingdom of Burgundy, emerged as the feudal County of Savoy ruled by the House of Savoy during the 11th to 14th centuries.\nThe original territory, also known as \"ducal Savoy\" or \"Savoy proper\", is largely co-terminous with the modern French Savoie and Haute-Savoie \"d\u00e9partements\" in the region of Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, but the historical expansion of Savoyard territories, as the Duchy of Savoy (1416\u20131860), included parts of what is now western Italy and southwestern Switzerland. The current border between France and Italy is due to the Plombi\u00e8res Agreement of 1858, which in preparation for the unification of Italy ceded western Savoy to France, while the eastern territories in Piedmont and Liguria were retained by the House of Savoy, which was to become the ruling dynasty of Italy.\nGeography.\nIn modern France, Savoy is part of the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. Following its annexation to France in 1860, the territory of Savoy was divided administratively into two separate departments, Savoie and Haute-Savoie.\nThe traditional capital remains Chamb\u00e9ry (in Italian, \"Ciamber\u00ec\", from Latin \"Camberia\") on the rivers Leysse and Albane, hosting the castle of the House of Savoy and the Savoyard senate. The state included six districts:\nThe County and Duchy of Savoy incorporated Turin and other territories in Piedmont, a region in northwestern Italy that borders Savoy, which were also possessions of the House of Savoy. The capital of the Duchy remained at the traditional Savoyard capital of Chamb\u00e9ry until 1563, when it was moved to Turin.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe region was occupied by the Allobroges, a Gallic people that the Roman Republic subdued in 121 BC. The name \"Savoy\" stems from the Late Latin \"Sapaudia\", referring to a fir, or upland, forest. The word is likely ultimately from Gaulish \u2013 sapin itself is a blend of Gaulish \"sappos\" (fir tree) and Latin \"pinus\" (pine tree). It is first recorded in Ammianus Marcellinus (354), to describe the southern part of \"Maxima Sequanorum\". According to the \"Chronica Gallica\" of 452, the Burgundians were settled in the territory of Sapaudia in 443, after the Burgundian defeat by Flavius Aetius.\nEarly and High Middle Ages.\nBy the 8th century, the territory that would later become known as Savoy was part of Francia, and at the division of Francia at the Treaty of Verdun in 843, it became part of the short-lived kingdom of Middle Francia. After only 12 years, at the death of Lothair I in 855, Middle Francia was divided into Lotharingia north of the Alps, Italy south of the Alps, and the parts of Burgundy in the Western Alps, inherited by Charles of Provence. This latter territory comprised what would become known as Savoy and Provence. For a short time, this province fell to the Arabs.\nFrom the 10th to 14th century, parts of what would ultimately become Savoy remained within the Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles. Beginning in the 11th century, the gradual rise to power of the House of Savoy is reflected in the increasing territory of their County of Savoy between 1003 and 1416.\nThe County of Savoy was detached \"de jure\" from the Kingdom of Arles by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1361. It acquired the County of Nice in 1388, and in 1401 added the County of Geneva, the area of Geneva except for the city proper, which was ruled by its prince-bishop, nominally under the duke's rule: the bishops of Geneva, by unspoken agreement, came from the House of Savoy until 1533.\nDuchy of Savoy.\nOn 19 February 1416 Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, made the County of Savoy an independent duchy, with Amadeus VIII as the first duke. Straddling the Alps, Savoy lay within two competing spheres of influence, a French sphere and a North Italian one. At the time of the Renaissance, Savoy showed only modest development. Its towns were few and small. Savoy derived its subsistence from agriculture. The geographic location of Savoy was also of military importance. During the interminable wars between France and Spain over the control of northern Italy, Savoy was important to France because it provided access to Italy. Savoy was important to Spain because it served as a buffer between France and the Spanish held lands in Italy. In 1563 Emmanuel Philibert moved the capital from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin, which was less vulnerable to French interference.\nVaud was annexed by Bern in 1536, and Savoy officially ceded Vaud to Bern in the Treaty of Lausanne of 30 October 1564.\nIn 1714, as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession, Savoy was technically subsumed into the Kingdom of Sicily, then (after that island was traded to Austria for Sardinia) the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1720. While the heads of the House of Savoy were known as the Kings of Sardinia, Turin remained their capital.\nFrench Revolutionary Wars.\nSavoy was occupied by French revolutionary forces between 1792 and 1815. The entire region was first created to form the d\u00e9partement of Mont-Blanc. In 1798, it was then divided between the departments of Mont-Blanc and L\u00e9man (French name of Lake Geneva). In 1801, Savoy officially left the Holy Roman Empire. On 13 September 1793 the combined forces of Savoy, Piedmont and Aosta Valley fought against and lost to the occupying French forces at the Battle of M\u00e9ribel (Sallanches).\nTwo-thirds of Savoy was restored to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the First Restoration of 1814 following Napoleon's abdication; approximately one-third of Savoy, including the two most important cities of Chamb\u00e9ry and Annecy, remained in France. Following Napoleon's brief return to power during the Hundred Days and subsequent defeat at Waterloo, the remaining one-third of Savoy was restored to the Kingdom of Sardinia at the Congress of Vienna to strengthen Sardinia as a buffer state on France's southeastern border.\nModern history.\nAnnexation to France.\nThe French Second Republic first attempted to annex Savoy in 1848. A corps of 1,500 was dispatched from Lyon and invaded Savoy on 3 April, occupying Chamb\u00e9ry (capital city) and proclaiming the annexation to France. On learning about the invasion countrymen rushed to Chamb\u00e9ry. The corps were chased away by the local population. Five Frenchmen were killed and 800 captured.\nOn 21 July 1858 in Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains, Vosges, the prime minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, met in secret with Napoleon III to secure French military support against the Austrian Empire during the conflicts associated with the Italian unification. During the discussion, Cavour promised that Sardinia would cede the County of Nice and Duchy of Savoy to the Second French Empire. Though this was a secret arrangement, it quickly became widely known.\nThe treaty annexing Nice and Savoy to France was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860 (Treaty of Turin). In the northern provinces of the Chablais and Faucigny, there was some support for annexation to neighboring Switzerland, with which the northern provinces had longstanding economic ties. To help reduce the attractiveness of Switzerland, the French government conceded a Free-Trade Zone that maintained the longstanding duty-free relationship of northern Savoyard communes to Geneva. After the treaty was already signed, a plebiscite was held on 22\u201323 April. Employing universal male suffrage, voters in the ceded provinces were offered the option of voting \"Yes\" to approve the treaty and join France or voting \"No\" and rejecting the treaty. Voters were not permitted the options of either joining Switzerland, remaining with Italy, or regaining its independence, were the source of some opposition. With a 99.8% vote in favour of joining France, there were allegations of vote-rigging, notably by the British government, which opposed continental expansion by its traditional French enemy. The correspondent of \"The Times\" in Savoy who was in Bonneville on 22 April called the vote \"the lowest and most immoral farce(s) which was ever played in the history of nations\". He finished his letter with those words: I leave you to draw your own conclusions from this trip, which will show clearly what the vote was in this part of Savoy. The vote was the bitterest irony ever made on popular suffrage. The ballot-box in the hands of those very authorities who issued the proclamations; no control possible; even travellers suspected and dogged lest they should pry into the matter; all opposition put down by intimidation, and all liberty of action completely taken away. One can really scarcely reproach the Opposition with having given up the game; there was too great force used against them. As for the result of the vote, therefore, no one need trouble himself about it; it will be just as brilliant as that in Nice. The only danger is lest the Savoy authorities in their zeal should fare as some of the French did in the vote of 1852, finding to their surprise rather more votes than voters inscribed on the list. In his letter to the ambassador of Vienna Lord Augustus Loftus, the then\u2013Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell, said, \"Voting in Savoy and Nice a farce ... we are neither entertained or edified\".\nThe annexation was promulgated on 14 June 1860. On 23 August 1860 and 7 March 1861, two agreements were signed between the Second French Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia to settle the remaining issues concerning the annexation.\nThis was part of a secret agreement (the Plombi\u00e8res Agreement) brokered between the French emperor Napoleon III and the Count Camillo of Cavour (Prime Minister of Sardinia at that time) that allowed the final steps in the process of unification of Italy. Victor Emmanuel's dynasty, the House of Savoy, retained its Italian lands of Piedmont and Liguria and became the ruling dynasty of Italy.\n20th century.\nIn 1919, contrary to the annexation treaty, France officially ended the military neutrality of the parts of the country of Savoy that had originally been agreed to at the Congress of Vienna, and also eliminated the free trade zone \u2013 both treaty articles having been broken unofficially in World War I. France was condemned in 1932 by the international court for noncompliance with the measures of the Treaty of Turin regarding the provinces of Savoy and Nice.\nIn 1960, the term \"annexation\" having acquired negative connotations in France, particularly after Germany's 1871 annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, the annexation was renamed \"Rattachement de la Savoie \u00e0 la France\" (Incorporation of Savoy to France). It was the latter term which was used by the French authorities during the festivities celebrating the 100th anniversary of the annexation. Daniel Rops of the French Academy justified the new title with these words:\nSavoy has begun to solemnize the feasts in 1960, commemorating the centenary of its incorporation (\"rattachement\") to France. It is on purpose that the word incorporation (\"rattachement\") is highlighted here: the Savoyards attach great value to it, and it is the only one they have resolved to use in the official terminology of the Centenary. In that, they are infinitely right. Yesterday another term that was used: annexation. Looking at it more closely it was wrong! Can we say annexation when we talk about a decision which was approved by 130,889 voters over 135,449? [...]. Savoy was not annexed [...] but actually incorporated freely and by the will of its inhabitants.\nA former French deputy, P. Taponnier, spoke of the annexation:\nIn late March 1860, the betrothal ceremony of Savoy to France took place in Tuileries Palace [...], a ceremony which was a pact of love and fidelity [...] it is with free consent that she [Savoy] gave itself to France by a solemn plebiscite of which our leaders can ignore neither the terms nor the commitments. [...] May the bells of our cities [...] in Savoy vibrate in unison to glorify, in this magnificent Centenary, the indefectible commitment of Savoy to France. The Savoyards did not feel Italian. Besides, they spoke French. This explains why in 1858\u20131859 when rumours ran of the Plombi\u00e8res secret agreement, where Napoleon III and Cavour decided of the fate of Savoy, the Savoyards themselves took the initiative to ask for the incorporation (\"rattachement\"). [...] Incorporation, not annexation [...] The incorporation was an act of free will, in the logical order of geography and history [...].\nPolitics.\nModern regionalist politics.\nSince the mid-20th century, regionalist movements have appeared in Savoy much as in other historic provinces of France. The \"Mouvement R\u00e9gion Savoie\" (Savoy Regional Movement) was founded in December 1971 as a 'movement' (rather than a traditional political party) in favour of regional autonomy. Unlike other historic provinces, including Normandy and Brittany, Savoy does not currently have its own region within France and is part of the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. In the 1996 local elections, the Savoy Regional Movement received 19,434 votes; it received 4,849 in the 1998 regional elections. A new non-party organisation, \"La R\u00e9gion Savoie, j'y crois !\" (\"I believe in the Savoy Region!\"), was founded in 1998. The organisation campaigns for the replacement of the Savoie and Haute-Savoie departments with a regional government, separate from the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, with greater devolved powers.\nA very marginal separatist movement has also appeared in Savoy within the past twenty years, most prominently represented by the \"Ligue Savoisienne\", founded in 1994. In the March 1998 regional elections, 1 seat (out of 23) was won by Patrice Abeille, leader of the Ligue, which won a total of 17,865 votes across the two departments. In 2004, \"Waiting for Freedom in Savoy\" was founded to promote the peaceful separatist cause to young people.\nAccording to surveys conducted in 2000, between 41% and 55% of the population were in favour of the proposal for a separate Savoy region. Towards the end of 2005, Herv\u00e9 Gaymard called for Savoie to be given special status, similar to a French region, under his proposed \"Conseil des Pays de Savoie\".\nModern historiographical debates.\nIn recent years, sparked by the tiny Savoyard separatist movement, much attention has been focused on questioning the validity of the 1860 annexation. The Ligue Savoisienne, for example, rejects the Treaty of Turin and subsequent plebiscite as null and void, arguing that the plebiscite did not meet the standards of a free and fair vote. Today, historians generally acknowledge that the plebiscite of 1860 did feature irregularities, but they also affirm that the annexation instrument was the Treaty of Turin and not the plebiscite, whose main purpose was to demonstrate favorable public opinion in Savoy for the annexation after the signature of the treaty. In an interview for the newspaper \"Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9\", Sylvain Milbach, a historian at the University of Savoy, qualifies the vote as Napoleonic, but also argues that a completely free and fair vote would not have dramatically changed the outcome, as the majority of Savoyards wished to become French. This is today the official stance of the General Council of Savoie.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered by Norfolk to the north, the North Sea to the east, Essex to the south, and Cambridgeshire to the west. Ipswich is the largest settlement.\nThe county has an area of and had an estimated population of 786,231 in 2024. Ipswich is located in the south, and the county's other principal towns include the largest towns are Lowestoft in the north-east, Haverhill in the south-west, and Bury St Edmunds in the west. For local government purposes Suffolk is a non-metropolitan county with five districts.\nThe Suffolk coastline, which includes parts of the Suffolk &amp; Essex Coast &amp; Heaths National Landscape, is a complex habitat, formed by London Clay and crag underlain by chalk and therefore susceptible to erosion. It contains several deep estuaries, including those of the rivers Blyth, Deben, Orwell, Stour, and Alde/Ore; the latter is long and separated from the North Sea by Orford Ness, a large spit. Large parts of the coast are backed by heath and wetland habitats, such as Sandlings. The northeast of the county contains part of the Broads, a network of rivers and lakes which is a national park. Inland, the landscape is flat and gently undulating, and contains part of Thetford Forest on the Norfolk border and Dedham Vale National Landscape on the Essex border. \nIt is also known for its extensive farming and has largely arable land. Newmarket is known for horse racing, and Felixstowe is one of the largest container ports in Europe.\nHistory.\nArtefacts dating to around 700,000 years ago found at Pakefield and Beeches Pit are among the earliest evidence of human activity in northern Europe. In the Neolithic period and Bronze Age burial mounds, hillforts and causewayed enclosures were built reflecting Suffolk's role in prehistoric trade and agriculture. \nSuffolk was divided between the Iceni and Trinobantes tribes at the start of the Roman period. The Iceni unsuccessfully revolted under Boudica in AD 60\u201361. Although Suffolk remained predominantly rural in the Roman period there were villas, small towns and pottery kilns. By the late 4th century, however, archaeological evidence suggests significant depopulation in parts of East Anglia possibly linked to coastal raiding. \nAnglian settlement followed in the 5th and 6th centuries with a distinctive Germanic material culture largely replacing a Romano-British one. Soon the area was firmly within the Kingdom of East Anglia with Suffolk\u2019s most celebrated Anglo-Saxon site of Sutton Hoo being an elaborate royal ship burial - probably that of King R\u00e6dwald, who's son Sigeberht christianised East Anglia.\nIn the medieval period Suffolk was shaped by successive waves of conquest. It became part of the Danelaw following Viking incursions, and was reorganised under Norman feudalism after 1066, with castles at Framlingham, Clare, and Eye. The abbey at Bury St Edmunds became one of the wealthiest and most powerful religious institutions in medieval England. \nLater centuries saw Suffolk prosper from the cloth and wool trade, with towns such as Lavenham and Hadleigh flourishing in the 15th and 16th centuries. The county was also a site of Puritan and parliamentary strength during the English Civil War. \nIn modern times Suffolk\u2019s economy evolved with agriculture, fishing, and maritime trade, while the 19th century saw the development of industry at Ipswich and Lowestoft. Coastal erosion and the decline of traditional industries changed the county\u2019s fortunes, but its historic sites, churches, and coastal landscapes continue to shape its identity.\nArchaeology.\nA survey in 2020 named Suffolk the third best place in the UK for aspiring archaeologists, and showed that the area was especially rich in finds from the Roman period, with over 1500 objects found in the preceding year.\nA formative episode in English archeology was in 1797 when John Frere found flint hand axes, now known to date back 400,000 years in the Hoxne Brick Pit, in a deposit twelve feet deep, and commented that \"the situation in which these weapons were found may tempt us to refer them to a very remote period indeed; even beyond that of the present world\". This is the earliest recognition that hand axes were made by early humans, and was over sixty years before the antiquity of humanity was widely appreciated. One of Frere's hand axes, which was probably a general cutting tool, is held in the British Museum. The site also provides the type deposits of the Hoxnian Stage, an interglacial between around 474,000 and 374,000 years ago, which is named after the site.\nWest Suffolk, like nearby East Cambridgeshire, is renowned for archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Bronze Age artefacts have been found in the area between Mildenhall and West Row, in Eriswell and in Lakenheath.\nIn the east of the county is Sutton Hoo, the site of one of England's most significant Anglo-Saxon archaeological finds, a ship burial containing a collection of treasures including a sword of state, helmet, gold and silver bowls, jewellery and a lyre.\nThe Hoxne Hoard, to date the largest assembly of late Roman silver and gold discovered in Britain, was found near the village of Hoxne in 1992.\nWhile carrying out surveys before installing a pipeline in 2014, archaeologists for Anglian Water discovered nine skeletons and four cremation pits, at Bardwell, Barnham, Pakenham and Rougham, all near Bury St Edmunds. Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman and Medieval items were also unearthed, along with the nine skeletons believed to be of the late or Post-Roman Britain. Experts said the five-month project had recovered enough artefacts to fill half a shipping container, and that the discoveries had shed new light on their understanding of the development of small rural communities.\nIn 2019 an excavation of a 4th-century Roman burial in Great Whelnetham uncovered unusual burial practices. Of 52 skeletons found, a large number had been decapitated, which archaeologists claimed gave new insight into Roman traditions. The burial ground includes the remains of men, women and children who likely lived in a nearby settlement. The fact that up to 40% of the bodies were decapitated represents \"quite a rare find\".\nIn July 2020, metal detectorist Luke Mahoney found 1,061 silver hammered coins, estimated to be worth \u00a3100,000, in Ipswich. The coins dated back to the 15th\u201317th century, according to experts.\nIn 2020, archaeologists discovered a 7th century Anglo-Saxon cemetery with 17 cremations and 191 burials in Oulton, near Lowestoft. The graves contained the remains of men, women and children, as well as artefacts including small iron knives, silver pennies, wrist clasps, strings of amber and glass beads. According to Andrew Peachey, who carried out the excavations, the skeletons had mostly vanished because of the highly acidic soil. They were preserved as brittle shapes and \"sand silhouettes\".\nAdministration.\nSuffolk was divided into four separate Quarter Sessions divisions, which met at Beccles, Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich and Woodbridge. In 1860, the number of divisions was reduced to two, when the Beccles, Ipswich and Woodbridge divisions merged into an East Suffolk division, administered from Ipswich, and the old Bury St Edmunds division became the West Suffolk division. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions were made the separate administrative counties of East Suffolk and West Suffolk;\nOn 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, East Suffolk, West Suffolk and Ipswich were merged to form the unified county of Suffolk. The county was divided into several local government districts: Babergh, Forest Heath, Borough of Ipswich, Mid Suffolk, Borough of St Edmundsbury, Suffolk Coastal, and Waveney. This act also transferred some land near Great Yarmouth to Norfolk. As introduced in Parliament, the Local Government Act would have transferred Newmarket and Haverhill to Cambridgeshire and Colchester from Essex; such changes were not included when the act was passed into law.\nIn 2019, Forest Heath and St Edmundsbury merged to form West Suffolk district, while Waveney and Suffolk Coastal formed East Suffolk district.\nSuffolk Pink.\nVillages and towns in Suffolk are renowned for historic, pink-washed halls and cottages, which has become known far and wide as \"Suffolk Pink\". Decorative paint colours found in the county can range from a pale shell shade, to a deep blush brick colour.\nAccording to research, Suffolk Pink dates back to the 14th century, when these shades were developed by local dyers by adding natural substances to a traditional limewash mix. Additives used in this process include pig or ox blood with buttermilk, elderberries and sloe juice.\nLocals and historians often state that a true Suffolk Pink should be a \"deep dusky terracotta shade\", rather than the more popular pastel hue of modern times. This has caused controversy in the past when home and business-owners alike have been reprimanded for using colours deemed incorrect, with some being forced to repaint to an acceptable shade. In 2013, famous chef Marco Pierre White had his 15th-century hotel, The Angel, in Lavenham, decorated a shade of pink that was not traditional Suffolk Pink. He was required by local authorities to repaint.\nIn another example of Suffolk taking its colours seriously, a homeowner in Lavenham was obligated to paint their Grade I listed cottage Suffolk Pink, to make it match a neighbouring property. The local council said it wanted all of the cottages on that particular part of the road to be the same colour, because they were a single building historically (300 years earlier).\nThe historic Suffolk Pink colour has also inspired the name of a British apple.\nGeography.\nSuffolk is also home to nature reserves, such as the RSPB site at Minsmere, and Trimley Marshes, a wetland under the protection of Suffolk Wildlife Trust. The clay plateau inland, deeply intercut by rivers, is often referred to as 'High Suffolk'.\nThe west of the county lies on more resistant Cretaceous chalk. This chalk is responsible for a sweeping tract of largely downland landscapes that stretches from Dorset in the south west to Dover in the south east and north through East Anglia to the Yorkshire Wolds. The chalk is less easily eroded so forms the only significant hills in the county. The highest point in the county is Great Wood Hill, with an elevation of .\nThe county flower is the oxlip.\nDemography.\nAccording to estimates by the Office for National Statistics, the population of Suffolk in 2014 was 738,512, split almost evenly between males and females. Roughly 22% of the population was aged 65 or older, and 90.84% were White British.\nHistorically, the county's population has mostly been employed as agricultural workers. An 1835 survey showed Suffolk to have 4,526 occupiers of land employing labourers, 1,121 occupiers not employing labourers, 33,040 labourers employed in agriculture, 676 employed in manufacture, 18,167 employed in retail trade or handicraft, 2,228 'capitalists, bankers etc.', 5,336 labourers (non-agricultural), 4,940 other males aged over 20, 2,032 male servants and 11,483 female servants.\nA traditional nickname for people from Suffolk is \"Suffolk Fair-Maids\", referring to the supposed beauty of its female inhabitants in the Middle Ages. Another is \"Silly Suffolk\", often assumed to be derived from the Old English word \"s\u00e6lig\" in the meaning \"blessed\", referring to the long history of Christianity in the county. However, use of the term \"Silly Suffolk\" can actually be dated to no earlier than 1819, and its alleged medieval origins have been shown to be mythical.\nEconomy.\nThe majority of agriculture in Suffolk is either agronomy or mixed farming. Farm sizes vary from anything around 80 acres (32 hectares) to over 8,000. Soil types vary from heavy clays to light sands. Crops grown include winter wheat, barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape, winter and spring beans and linseed, although smaller areas of rye and oats can be found growing in areas with lighter soils along with a variety of vegetables.\nThe continuing importance of agriculture in the county is reflected in the Suffolk Show, which is held annually in May at Ipswich. Although latterly somewhat changed in nature, this remains primarily an agricultural show.\nCompanies based in Suffolk include Greene King Brewery and Branston Pickle in Bury St Edmunds. Birds Eye has its largest UK factory in Lowestoft, where all its meat products and frozen vegetables are processed. Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuit company has a base in Sudbury. The UK horse racing industry is based in Newmarket. There are two United States Air Force bases in the west of the county at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. Sizewell B nuclear power station is at Sizewell on the coast near Leiston. Bernard Matthews Farms have some processing units in the county, specifically Holton. Southwold is the home of Adnams Brewery. The Port of Felixstowe is the largest container port in the United Kingdom. Other ports include Port of Lowestoft and Port of Ipswich, run by Associated British Ports. BT Group plc has its main research and development facility at Martlesham Heath.\nEducation.\nPrimary, secondary and further education.\nSuffolk has a comprehensive education system with fourteen independent schools. Unusually for the UK, some of Suffolk had a 3-tier school system in place with primary schools (ages 4\u20139), middle schools (ages 9\u201313) and upper schools (ages 13\u201316). However, a 2006 Suffolk County Council study concluded that Suffolk should move to the two-tier school system used in the majority of the UK. For the purpose of conversion to two-tier, the three-tier system was divided into four geographical area groupings and corresponding phases. The first phase was the conversion of schools in Lowestoft and Haverhill in 2011, followed by schools in north and west Suffolk in 2012. The remainder of the changeovers to two-tier took place from 2013, for those schools that stayed within local government control, and did not become Academies and/or free schools. The majority of schools thus now (2019) operate the more common primary to high school (11\u201316).\nMany of the county's upper schools have a sixth form and most further education colleges in the county offer A-level courses. In terms of school population, Suffolk's individual schools are large with the Ipswich district with the largest school population and Forest Heath the smallest, with just two schools. In 2013, a letter said that \"...nearly a fifth of the schools inspected were judged inadequate. This is unacceptable and now means that Suffolk has a higher proportion of pupils educated in inadequate schools than both the regional and national averages.\"\nThe Royal Hospital School near Ipswich is the largest independent boarding school in Suffolk. Other boarding schools within Suffolk include Barnardiston Hall Preparatory School, Culford School, Finborough School, Framlingham College, Ipswich High School, Ipswich School, Orwell Park School, Saint Felix School and Woodbridge School.\nThe Castle Partnership Academy Trust in Haverhill is the county's only All-through Academy Chain. Comprising Castle Manor Academy and Place Farm Primary Academy, the Academy Trust supports all-through education and provides opportunities for young people aged 3 to 18.\nSixth form colleges in the county include Lowestoft Sixth Form College and One in Ipswich. Suffolk is home to considerably more education colleges, which include: Lowestoft College, Easton &amp; Otley College, Suffolk New College and Northgate Sixth Form (Ipswich), Abbeygate Sixth Form, Thurston Community College (Beyton Campus) and West Suffolk College (Bury St Edmunds).\nTertiary education.\nThe county has one university, the University of Suffolk, which became an independent institution with degree awarding powers and university status in 2016. The university operates at five sites, with its central hub in Ipswich. Others include Lowestoft, Bury St. Edmunds, and Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. The university is organised in four academic schools and in 2023/24 had 13,915 students. 88% of the student body are aged over 21 and 46% of university students are male.\nCulture.\nArts.\nFounded in 1948 by Benjamin Britten, the annual Aldeburgh Festival is one of the UK's major classical music festivals. Originating in Aldeburgh, it has been held at the nearby Snape Maltings since 1967. Since 2006, Henham Park, has been home to the annual Latitude Festival. This mainly open-air festival, which has grown considerably in size and scope, includes popular music, comedy, poetry and literary events. \nThe FolkEast festival is held at Glemham Hall in August and attracts international acoustic, folk and roots musicians whilst also championing local businesses, heritage and crafts. In 2015 it was also home to the first instrumental festival of musical instruments and makers. More recently, LeeStock Music Festival has been held in Sudbury. A celebration of the county, \"Suffolk Day\", was instigated in 2017.\nDialect.\nThe Suffolk dialect is very distinctive. Epenthesis and yod-dropping is common, along with non-conjugation of verbs.\nSport.\nFootball.\nThe county's sole professional football club is Ipswich Town. Formed in 1878, the club were Football League First Division champions in 1961\u201362, FA Cup winners in 1977\u201378 and UEFA Cup winners in 1980\u201381; as of the 2025\u201326 season, Ipswich Town play in the Championship, the second tier of English football. The club has as part of its crest the Suffolk Punch, a now endangered breed of draught horse native to the county. The next highest ranked teams in Suffolk are AFC Sudbury, Bury Town, Leiston and Needham Market, who all participate in the Southern League Premier Division Central, the seventh tier of English football.\nHorse racing.\nNewmarket is the headquarters of British horseracing \u2013 home to the largest cluster of training yards in the country and many key horse racing organisations including the National Stud, and Newmarket Racecourse. Tattersalls bloodstock auctioneers and the National Horseracing Museum are also in the town. Point to point racing takes place at Higham and Ampton.\nSpeedway.\nMotorcycle speedway racing has been staged in Suffolk since at least the 1950s, following the construction of the Foxhall Stadium, just outside Ipswich, home of the Ipswich Witches. The Witches are currently members of the Premier League, the UK's first division. National League team Mildenhall Fen Tigers are also from Suffolk.\nCricket.\nSuffolk County Cricket Club compete in the Eastern Division of the Minor Counties Championship. The club has won the championship three times outright and has shared the title one other time as well as winning the MCCA Knockout Trophy once. Home games are played in Bury St Edmunds, Copdock, Exning, Framlingham, Ipswich and Mildenhall.\nFlag.\nThe Suffolk flag is a banner of arms of the coat of arms which were attributed to Edmund the Martyr, a medieval king of East Anglia. It consists of two gold arrows passing through a gold crown or with heraldic description as \"Azure two Arrows in saltire, points downwards, enfiled with an ancient Crown Or\".\nSuffolk Day.\nSuffolk Day is an annual celebration of the county that takes place annually on June 21.\nSuffolk in popular culture.\nNovels set in Suffolk include parts of \"David Copperfield\" by Charles Dickens, \"The Fourth Protocol\", by Frederick Forsyth, \"Unnatural Causes\" by P.D. James, Dodie Smith's \"The Hundred and One Dalmatians\", \"The Rings of Saturn\" by W. G. Sebald, and among Arthur Ransome's children's books, \"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea, Coot Club\" and \"Secret Water\" take place in part in the county. Roald Dahl's short story \"The Mildenhall Treasure\" is set in Mildenhall.\nA TV series about a British antiques dealer, \"Lovejoy\", was filmed in various locations in Suffolk. The reality TV series \"Space Cadets\" was filmed in Rendlesham Forest, although the producers fooled participants into believing that they were in Russia. Several towns and villages in the county have been used for location filming of other television programmes and cinema films. These include the BBC Four TV series \"Detectorists\", an episode of \"Kavanagh QC,\" and the films \"Iris and\" \"Drowning by Numbers\". During the period 2017\u20132018, a total of \u00a33.8million was spent by film crews in Suffolk.\nThe Rendlesham Forest Incident is one of the most famous UFO events in England and is sometimes referred to as \"Britain's Roswell\".\nThe song \"Castle on the Hill\" by Ed Sheeran was referred to by him as \"a love letter to Suffolk\", with lyrical references to his hometown of Framlingham and Framlingham Castle.\nKnype Hill is the fictional name for Southwold in George Orwell's 1935 novel \"A Clergyman's Daughter\", while the character of Dorothy Hare is modelled on Brenda Salkeld, the gym mistress at St Felix School in the early 1930s.\nRichard Curtis and Danny Boyle's 2019 romantic comedy \"Yesterday\" was filmed throughout Suffolk, using Halesworth, Dunwich, Shingle Street and Latitude Festival as locations. The television series of Anthony Horowitz's \"Magpie Murders\" was filmed extensively in Suffolk during 2021.\nThe 2021 film \"The Dig\", based on the excavation of Sutton Hoo in the 1930s and starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan was mostly shot on location.\nThe 2022 series \"The Witchfinder\" is a BBC Two sitcom based on the journey of Matthew Hopkins, the Witchfinder general, and a suspected witch through East Anglia and many Suffolk towns including Stowmarket and Framlingham during the witch trials of the English Civil War.\nMedia.\nThe county is covered by the BBC East and ITV Anglia television regions.\nThe BBC local radio station for the county is BBC Radio Suffolk, broadcast from its studios in Ipswich.

{"id": "27888", "revid": "39769597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27888", "title": "Scylla", "text": "Nymph transformed into a sea monster by Circe in Greek mythology\nIn Greek mythology, Scylla ( ; , ) is a legendary, man-eating monster that lives on one side of a narrow channel of water, opposite her counterpart, the sea-swallowing monster Charybdis. The two sides of the strait are within an arrow's range of each other\u2014so close that sailors attempting to avoid the whirlpools of Charybdis would pass dangerously close to Scylla and vice versa.\nScylla is first attested in Homer's \"Odyssey\", where Odysseus and his crew encounter her and Charybdis on their travels. Later myth provides an origin story as a beautiful nymph who is transformed into a monster.\nBook Three of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" associates the strait where Scylla dwells with the Strait of Messina between Calabria, a region of Southern Italy, and Sicily. The coastal town of Scilla in Calabria takes its name from the mythological figure of Scylla and it is said to be the home of the nymph.\nThe Byzantine encyclopedia Suda describes Scylla as having the appearance of a beautiful woman up to the eyes, with six dog heads on each side, and a serpent body below.\nThe idiom \"between Scylla and Charybdis\" has come to mean being forced to choose between two similarly undesirable or risky outcomes, similar to \"between a rock and a hard place\".\nParentage.\nThe parentage of Scylla varies according to author. Homer, Ovid, Apollodorus, Servius, and a scholiast on Plato, all name Crataeis as the mother of Scylla. Neither Homer nor Ovid mentions a father, but Apollodorus says that the father was either Trienus (probably a textual corruption of Triton) or Phorcus (a variant of Phorkys). Similarly, the Plato scholiast, perhaps following Apollodorus, gives the father as Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, while Eustathius on Homer, \"Odyssey\" 12.85, gave the father as Triton, or Poseidon and Crataeis as the parents.\nOther authors have Hecate as Scylla's mother. The Hesiodic \"Megalai Ehoiai\" gives Hecate and Phorbas as the parents of Scylla, while Acusilaus says that Scylla's parents were Hecate and Phorkys (so also scholia on \"Odyssey\" 12.85).\nPerhaps trying to reconcile these conflicting accounts, Apollonius of Rhodes says that Crataeis was another name for Hecate, and that she and Phorcys were the parents of Scylla. Likewise, Semos of Delos says that Crataeis was the daughter of Hecate and Triton, and mother of Scylla by Deimos. Stesichorus (alone) names Lamia as the mother of Scylla, possibly the Lamia who was the daughter of Poseidon, while according to Hyginus, Scylla was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna.\nNarratives.\nAccording to John Tzetzes and Servius' commentary on the \"Aeneid\", Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but the jealous Nereid Amphitrite turned her into a terrible monster by poisoning the water of the spring where Scylla would bathe.\nA similar story is found in Hyginus, according to whom Scylla was loved by Glaucus, but Glaucus himself was also loved by the goddess sorceress Circe. While Scylla was bathing in the sea, the jealous Circe poured a baleful potion into the sea water which caused Scylla to transform into a frightful monster with six dog forms springing from her thighs. In this form, she attacked Odysseus' ship, robbing him of his companions.\nIn a late Greek myth, recorded in Eustathius' commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her. Her father, the sea-god Phorcys, then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life.\nHomer's \"Odyssey\".\nIn Homer's \"Odyssey\" XII, Odysseus is advised by Circe to sail closer to Scylla, for Charybdis could drown his whole ship: \"Hug Scylla's crag\u2014sail on past her\u2014top speed! Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew.\" She also tells Odysseus to ask Scylla's mother, the river nymph Crataeis, to prevent Scylla from pouncing more than once. Odysseus successfully navigates the strait, but when he and his crew are momentarily distracted by Charybdis, Scylla snatches six sailors off the deck and devours them alive.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOvid's \"Metamorphoses\".\nAccording to Ovid, the fisherman-turned-sea god Glaucus falls in love with the beautiful Scylla, but she is repulsed by his piscine form and flees to a promontory where he cannot follow. When Glaucus goes to Circe to request a love potion that will win Scylla's affections, the enchantress herself becomes enamored with him. Meeting with no success, Circe becomes hatefully jealous of her rival and therefore prepares a vial of poison and pours it into the sea pool where Scylla regularly bathed, transforming her into a thing of terror even to herself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe story was later adapted into a five-act tragic opera, \"Scylla et Glaucus\" (1746), by the French composer Jean-Marie Leclair.\nKeats' \"Endymion\".\nIn John Keats' loose retelling of Ovid's version of the myth of Scylla and Glaucus in Book 3 of \"Endymion\" (1818), the evil Circe does not transform Scylla into a monster but merely murders the beautiful nymph. Glaucus then takes her corpse to a crystal palace at the bottom of the ocean where lie the bodies of all lovers who have died at sea. After a thousand years, she is resurrected by Endymion and reunited with Glaucus.\nPaintings.\nAt the Carolingian abbey of Corvey in Westphalia, a unique ninth-century wall painting depicts, among other things, Odysseus' fight with Scylla. This illustration is not noted elsewhere in medieval arts.\nIn the Renaissance and after, it was the story of Glaucus and Scylla that caught the imagination of painters across Europe. In Agostino Carracci's 1597 fresco cycle of \"The Loves of the Gods\" in the Farnese Gallery, the two are shown embracing, a conjunction that is not sanctioned by the myth. More orthodox versions show the maiden scrambling away from the amorous arms of the god, as in the oil on copper painting by Filippo Lauri and the oil on canvas by Salvator Rosa in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Caen.\nOther painters picture them divided by their respective elements of land and water, as in the paintings of the Flemish Bartholom\u00e4us Spranger (1587), now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Some add the detail of Cupid aiming at the sea-god with his bow, as in the painting of Laurent de la Hyre (1640/4) in the J. Paul Getty Museum and that of Jacques Dumont le Romain (1726) at the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Troyes. Two cupids can also be seen fluttering around the fleeing Scylla in the late painting of the scene by J. M. W. Turner (1841), now in the Kimbell Art Museum.\nPeter Paul Rubens shows the moment when the horrified Scylla first begins to change, under the gaze of Glaucus (c.\u20091636), while Eglon van der Neer's 1695 painting in the Rijksmuseum shows Circe poisoning the water as Scylla prepares to bathe. There are also two Pre-Raphaelite treatments of the latter scene by John Melhuish Strudwick (1886) and John William Waterhouse (\"Circe Invidiosa\", 1892).\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Once learnt they are helpful in describing, succinctly and accurately, how the games are played. Patience games are usually for a single player, although a small number have been designed for two and, in rare cases, three or even four players. They are games of skill or chance or a combination of the two. There are three classes of patience grouped by object.\nThe most frequent object is to arrange the cards either in ascending sequence (e.g. from Ace to King) or descending sequence. Occasionally both forms of sequence are aimed at in the same game. The card forming the starting point of the required sequence is known as the foundation card and the sequence or family is said to be 'built up' on such card. In some cases foundation cards are picked out and placed in position beforehand; in others they are only laid down as they come to hand in course of play. In some instances the cards forming the sequence must be of the same suit as the foundation card; in others suit is disregarded. Some games permit the provisional formation of auxiliary sequences (descending or ascending), i.e. groups of cards in succession but not yet ripe to be played to the families or sequences on the foundation cards. A second object of many patiences is merely to 'pair' cards. The cards thus paired are thrown aside and, if the player is able, under the limitations of the particular game, to throw out all the cards in this way, the game is won. A third object is to throw out or dispose of any two cards which together form a particular number, say eleven or thirteen\u2013the player's success, as before, depending on being able to get rid of all the cards in this manner.\nIt will be obvious that the endeavour to arrange, pair, or combine the cards of a whole pack is a difficult task, varying in degree according to the rules of the particular game. The player must therefore be prepared for a good many failures even when close to success. Hence why the name 'patience games' has been give to recreations of this description.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\n Placing red on black cards or black on red cards alternately.\n A card that is available may be picked up and laid down elsewhere.\n Those that are not blocked or covered by other cards, \"i.e.\", not forbidden by the particular rules of each game, to be used.\n A pile of cards that is packed on a depot within the tableau in readiness for being built in the reverse order on the foundations when the time is right.\n See foundation card.\n A number of cards dealt at one time.\n A card is below another if it is nearer to the bottom of the playing board or to the player.

Being pursued by Pan, she fled into the river Ladon, and at her own request was metamorphosed into a reed from which Pan then made his panpipes.\nMythology.\nStory.\nSyrinx was a beautiful wood nymph who had many times attracted the attention of satyrs, and fled their advances in turn. She worshipped Artemis, the goddess of wilderness, and, like her, had vowed to remain a virgin for all of time. Pursued by the amorous god Pan, she ran to a river's edge and asked for assistance from the river nymphs. In answer, she was transformed into hollow water reeds that made a haunting sound when the god's frustrated breath blew across them. Pan cut the reeds to fashion the first set of panpipes, which were thenceforth known as \"syrinx\". The word \"syringe\" is derived from this word.\nAuthors.\nOvid includes the story of Pan and Syrinx in Book One of the \"Metamorphoses\", where it is told by Mercury to Argus in the course of lulling him asleep in order to kill him. The myth is also preserved in the works of some anonymous Greek paradoxographer.\nThe story is also told in Achilles Tatius' novel \"Leucippe and Clitophon\" where the eponymous heroine is subjected to a virginity test by entering a cave where Pan has left syrinx pipes that will sound a melody if she passes. This has similarities with another myth Achilles wrote down, that of Rhodopis, who was transformed into a fountain that served as a virginity testing place for maidens.\nLongus makes reference to Syrinx in his tale of \"Daphnis and Chloe\" in Book 2:34. Whilst the description of the tale here is modified to that of Ovid, it nevertheless incorporates Pan's desire to have her. Longus, however, makes no reference to Syrinx receiving aid from the Nymphs in his version, instead Syrinx hides from Pan in amongst some reeds and disappears into the marsh. Upon realising what had happened to Syrinx, Pan created the first set of panpipes from the reeds she was transformed into, forcing her to be with him for the rest of his days.\nRepresentations.\nIn literature.\nThe story became popular among artists and writers in the 19th century. Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a poem entitled \"A Musical Instrument\" describing Pan's ruinous actions in creating the musical pipes. The Victorian artist and poet Thomas Woolner wrote \"Silenus\", a long narrative poem about the myth, in which Syrinx becomes the lover of Silenus, but drowns when she attempts to escape rape by Pan. As a result of the crime, Pan is transmuted into a demon figure and Silenus becomes a drunkard. Amy Clampitt's poem \"Syrinx\" refers to the myth by relating the whispering of the reeds to the difficulties of language.\nThe story was used as a central theme by Aifric Mac Aodha in her poetry collection \"Gabh\u00e1il Syrinx\".\nSamuel R. Delany features an instrument called a syrynx in his science-fiction novel \"Nova\".\nSyrinx is the name of one of the main characters in the Night's Dawn Trilogy of space opera novels by British author Peter F. Hamilton. In the trilogy, Syrinx is a member of the transhumanist future society known as Edenism, and serves as the captain of the \"Oenone\", a living starship.\nA 1972 poem by James Merrill, titled \"Syrinx\", draws on several aspects on the mythological tale, with the poet himself identifying with the celebrated nymph, desiring to become not just a \"reed\" but a \"thinking reed\" (in contrast to a \"thinking stone\", as critic Helen Vendler has observed, noting the influence of a Wallace Stevens lyric, \"Le Monocle de Mon Oncle\"). The poet aspires to return to his \"scarred case\" with minimal suffering inflicted by \"the great god Pain\", a play of words on the Greek god Pan. \"Syrinx\" is the final poem in Merrill's 1972 collection, \"Braving the Elements\".\nIn philosophy.\nIn \"Dark Places of Wisdom\", Peter Kingsley discusses in some detail the use of the word in Parmenides' poem and in association with the ancient practice of incubation.\nIn art.\nThe British Victorian artist Arthur Hacker depicted Syrinx in his 1892 nude. This painting in oil on canvas is currently on display in Manchester Art Gallery.\nA sculpture of Syrinx created in 1925 by sculptor William McMillan is displayed at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow.\nSculptor Adolph Wolter was commissioned in 1973 to create a replacement for a stolen sculpture of Syrinx in Indianapolis, United States. This work was a replacement for a similar statue by Myra Reynolds Richards that had been stolen. The sculpture sits in University Park located in the city's Indiana World War Memorial Plaza.\nAbraham Jannsens painted Syrinx in 1620 as part of \"Pan and Syrinx\".\nIn music.\nClaude Debussy based his 1913 \"Syrinx\" (Debussy) on Pan's sadness over losing his love. The piece is still popular today; it was used as incidental music in the play \"Psych\u00e9\" by Gabriel Mourey.\nThe story of Pan and Syrinx is the inspiration for the first movement in Benjamin Britten's work for solo oboe, Six Metamorphoses after Ovid first performed in 1951. Britten titled the movement, \"Pan: who played upon the reed pipe which was Syrinx, his beloved.\"\nMaurice Ravel incorporated the character of the Syrinx into his ballet \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\".\nGustav Holst alludes to the story of Pan and Syrinx in the opening of his Choral Symphony, which draws from the text of John Keats' 1818 poem \"Endymion.\"\nFrench Baroque composer Michel Pignolet de Mont\u00e9clair composed \"Pan et Syrinx\", a cantata for voice and ensemble (No. 4 of \"Second livre de cantates\").\nDanish composer Carl Nielsen composed \"Pan and Syrinx\" (\"Pan og Syrinx\"), Op. 49, FS 87.\nThe British folk-rock band Oberon included a flute solo called \"Syrinx\" on its 1970 album, \"A Midsummer's Night Dream.\"\nCanadian electronic progressive rock band Syrinx took their name from the legend.\nCanadian progressive rock band Rush have a movement titled \"The Temples of Syrinx\" in their song \"2112\" on their album \"2112\". The song is about a dystopian futuristic society in which the arts, particularly music, have been suppressed by the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx.\nRelated to the Rush reference, Maryland based rockers Clutch mention the Temples of Syrinx in their song \"10001110101\" from their album \"Robot Hive/Exodus\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27901", "revid": "1308624214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27901", "title": "Savate", "text": "French combat sport\nSavate (), also known as French Boxing (French: \"Boxe Fran\u00e7aise\") or French Foot Fighting, is a French hybrid martial art and full-contact combat sport that combines principles of western boxing with a wide variety of kicking techniques. Unlike kickboxing which allow knee and/or shin strikes in competitive bouts, savate involves kicking exclusively with one's feet, but participants can nonetheless target any part of the body. The sport is also notable for requiring footwear to be worn by the competitors, as would be expected from individuals fighting in the streets. A male practitioner of savate is called a \"tireur\" while a female one is a \"tireuse\".\nSavate de rue (lit.\u2009'street savate'), the term used to differentiate the original martial art meant for self-defense from the subsequent combat sport, is an overarching hand-to-hand combat discipline that incorporates knee and elbow strikes as well as joint locks, sweeps, throws, headbutts and takedowns, in addition to punches and kicks.\nEtymology.\n\"Savate\" takes its name from the French for \"old shoe\" or \"old boot\", referencing heavy footwear (more specifically the boots worn by French sailors at the time the discipline emerged).\nHistory.\nThe modern formalized form is mainly an amalgam of French street fighting techniques from the beginning of the 19th century. Savate was then a type of street fighting common in Paris and northern France.\nAccording to one theory, in the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, his soldiers publicly displayed their \"aptitudes\" by kicking their prisoners' behinds. The punishment was known as \u201cSavate\u201d, which can be translated as \u201cold shoe\u201d.\nOrigin.\nSavate originated in France in the 17th century and was practiced by some sailors in the southern port of Marseille. According to historians, it was developed and learned by sailors on board the ships during their trips to the countries of the Indian Ocean and China Seas.&lt;ref name=\"Chausson/Savate\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in every bar fight in French ports, it was common to see savate kicks. Sailors called this type of combat \"Chausson\", in reference to the slippers normally worn on board. \nContact with African and Brazilian fighting styles also occurred through interaction between French sailors and martial arts practitioners in the country's colonial holdings. French naval ships between 1820 and 1833 travelled from France to ports in Brazil (Capoeira), Martinique (Danmy\u00e9) and Madagascar (Moraingy).\nEarly history.\nIn the south, especially in the port of Marseille, sailors developed a fighting style involving high kicks and open-handed slaps. It is conjectured that this kicking style was developed in this way to allow the fighter to use a hand to hold onto something for balance on a rocking ship's deck, and that the kicks and slaps were used on land to avoid the legal penalties for using a closed fist, which was considered a deadly weapon under the law. It was known as the \"jeu marseillais\" (game from Marseille), and was later renamed \"chausson\" (slipper, after the type of shoes the sailors wore). In contrast, at this time in England (the home of boxing and the Queensberry rules), kicking was seen as unsportsmanlike.\nTraditional savate was a northern French development, especially in Paris' slums, and always used heavy shoes and boots derived from its potential military origins. Street fighting savate, unlike chausson, kept the kicks low, almost never targeted above the groin, and they were delivered with vicious, bone-breaking intent. Parisian savate also featured open hand blows, in thrusting or smashing palm strikes (la baffe) or in stunning slaps targeted to facial nerves. Techniques of savate or chausson were at this time also developed in the ports of northwest Italy and northeastern Spain\u2014hence one savate kick named the \"Italian kick\" (\"chass\u00e9 italien\").\nReform.\nThe two key historical figures in the history of the shift from street fighting to the modern sport of savate are Michel Casseux (also known as \"le Pisseux\") (1794\u20131869) and Charles Lecour (1808\u20131894). Casseux opened the first establishment in 1825 for practicing and promoting a regulated version of chausson and savate (disallowing head butting, eye gouging, grappling, etc.).\nHowever, the sport had not shaken its reputation as a street-fighting technique. \nCharles Lecour created a modern edition of the martial art by 1830. Charles Lecour incorporated boxing techniques with kicking techniques and showed how to use them together. He was the first to see savate as both a sport and self-defense system. Charles Lecour was the first to add English boxing gloves to the martial art which allowed his students to train their punches without injuring their hands.\nCharles Lecour was exposed to the English art of boxing when he witnessed an English boxing match in France between English pugilist Owen Swift and Jack Adams in 1838. Lecour also took part in a friendly sparring match with Swift later in that same year. Lecour felt that he was at a disadvantage, using his hands only to bat his opponent's fists away, rather than to punch. He trained in boxing for a time before combining boxing with chausson and savate to create the sport of savate (or \"boxe fran\u00e7aise\", as we know it today). At some point \"la canne\" and \"le baton\", stick fighting, were added, and some form of stick fencing, such as \"la canne\", is commonly part of savate training. Those who train purely for competition may omit this. Savate was developed professionally by Lecour's student Joseph Charlemont and then his son Charles Charlemont. Charles continued his father's work and in 1899 fought an English boxer named Jerry Driscoll. He won the match with a round-kick (\"fouett\u00e9 median\") in the eighth round although the English said that it was a kick to the groin. According to the well known English referee, Bernard John Angle of the National Sporting Club, in his book \"My Sporting Memories\" (London, 1925), \"Driscoll did not know what he was taking on\" when he agreed \"to meet the Frenchman at his own game\". Angle also said that, \"The contest ended in Jerry being counted out to a blow in the groin from the Frenchman's knee.\" He further alleged that \"the timekeeper saved Charlemont several times\". After the fight Driscoll bore no grudges, considering the blow to have been \"an accident\". The French claimed victory for their man by stoppage, following a round-kick to Driscoll's stomach.\nCodification.\nSavate was later codified under a Committee National de Boxe Fran\u00e7aise under Charles Charlemont's student Count Pierre Baruzy (dit Barozzi). The Count is seen as the father of modern savate and was 11-time Champion of France and its colonies, his first ring combat and title prior to the First World War. \"Savate de D\u00e9fense\", \"D\u00e9fense Savate\" or \"Savate de Rue\" (\"street savate\") is the name given to those methods of fighting excluded from savate competition. The International Savate Federation (FIS) is the official worldwide ruling body of savate.\nPerhaps the ultimate recognition of the respectability of savate came in 1924 when it was included as a demonstration sport in the Olympic Games in Paris. In 2008, savate was recognised by the International University Sports Federation (FISU) \u2013 this recognition allows savate to hold official University World Championships; the first was held in Nantes, France in 2010. The 25th anniversary of the founding of the International Savate Federation, in March 2010, was celebrated with a visit to Lausanne, to meet with International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge. FISav President Gilles Le Duigou was presented with a memento depicting the Olympic Rings. In April 2010, the International Savate Federation was accepted as a member of SportAccord (previously known as AGFIS) \u2013 a big step forward on the road to Olympic recognition.\nModern practice.\nDespite its roots, savate is a relatively safe sport to learn.\nToday, savate is practiced all over the world by amateurs from Australia to the U.S. and from Finland to Britain. Many countries (including the United States) have national federations devoted to promoting savate.\nModern codified savate provides for three levels of competition: \"assaut\", \"pre-combat\" and \"combat\".\nMany martial arts provide ranking systems, such as belt colours. Savate uses glove colours to indicate a fighter's level of proficiency (unlike arts such as many modern styles of \"karate\", which assign new belts at each promotion, moving to a higher colour rank in savate does not necessarily entail a change in the colour of one's actual gloves, and a given fighter may continue using the same pair of gloves through multiple promotions). Novices begin at no colour.\nThe qualifications for competition vary depending on the association or commission. In the French Federation a yellow glove can compete, and in Belgium a green glove can compete. In the United States, the competition levels start at novice (6 months). In Russia there is no requirement for a specific glove colour in order to compete.\nThe ranking of savate: Boxe Fran\u00e7aise is divided into three roads that a savateur can choose to take.\nGAT vs GAT# Patches: Pre and Post 1985 patches distinction: \nSimilarly, the former FFBFSDA Professorship of BF-SAVATE requirements included Canne de Combat. New Savate \"instructorships\" tests do not have these requirements. Both sports have split although still under a same federation. These sports can be used in combinations together.\nIn some clubs there is also a rank of aide-moniteur, while in other associations there is no rank of initiateur. Eight to twelve years of training on average are necessary for a student to reach professeur level; eight years average depending on skills. In France the professional professeur must have a French state certificate of specialized teaching (CQP AS, BEES 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree, 1st de CCB BPJEPS, DEJEPS, DESJEPS). These diplomas are university level education in sports with specialisation in savate (supervised by the French Federation of BF Savate and associated disciplines (Canne, Self Defense, Lutte, baton) (i.e.:FFBFSDA). The international federation (FIS), however, is still allowed to award professeur to non-French nationals without requiring such rigid system of education. French nationals have to submit and succeed to the rigid system of education and prove themselves in competition as well as being respected by peers, in order to have a slight chance to become a DTD (directeur technique d\u00e9partemental). Like any sport federations in France, the French and International Federation of Savate are under the control of France Ministry of Sport and Youth. This makes these two federations extremely powerful federations on the world scene. These two federations have followed a set of national traditions.\nNowadays, savate is just a term meaning Savate-Boxe Fran\u00e7aise. In the 1970s the term \"savate\" was rarely used in France to refer to the formalised sport: people mostly used the term Savate boxe fran\u00e7aise, Boxe-Fran\u00e7aise Savate, B.F, B.F.S., S.B.F. or simply boxe fran\u00e7aise. The term savate remains in use mostly outside France or when speaking a language other than French.\nThe global distribution of schools (salles) today is best explained through their stylistic approaches:\nThese are the different stylistic approaches of the French arts of pugilism in the world today.\nIn the United States.\nIn the United States Jean-Noel Eynard brought Savate Boxe-Francaise &amp; Canne de Combat (FFBFSDA) as a pioneer to the east coast. it is said that Daniel Duby brought Savate (FNBF) to the west coast in Southern California. The first real FFBFSDA/ FIS club of Boxe-Francaise Savate was open in 1983 on the east coast in Philadelphia at St Joseph's University, under Jean-Noel Eynard, FFBFSDA/ FIS Professeur with the assistance of former FFBFSDA/ FIS DTN Bob Alix. Forward thinking, https:// registered a series of written worksheets (1983-1999) titled \"Prof. Eynard's easy guide to savate\" with the U.S. Copyright Office and Library of Congress as copyrighted text, including the word \"Savate\" as a sport rather than something else. In 1988 the US Registry of Savate was created on the east coast which became the American Registry of Savate Instructors and Clubs in 1994 (ARSIC-International). Meanwhile, on the west coast Savate clubs were spurring from the California Association of Savate. A couple years later, under the collaborative assistance of a steering committee made of Gilles le Duigou (FIS), JN Eynard, ARSIC-International (PA), Armando Basulto (NJ) and Norman Taylor, USSF president(NJ) as well as few other individuals from California, the official name of United States Savate Federation was given to this combined association. The teaching efforts of Dr. Jean-Noel Eynard, Salem Assli and Nicolas Saignac contributed to the further development of Boxe Francaise Savate in the US. Bob Alix and L. Gillot's \"pedagogie de la Boxe Francaise\"https:// introduced to the world \"Contact / Without being touched\" mentality (i.e.\u00ab\u00eatre capable de toucher sans \u00eatre touch\u00e9\u00bb). This teaching methodology was used by the first instructors (Initiateurs, moniteurs) and Professors of SAVATE in the US who got certified by FFBFSDA. ARSIC-International has been instrumental at promoting savate in the US.\nDress.\nIn official competitions, competitors wear an \"int\u00e9grale\" or a vest and savate trousers. They wear boxing gloves (with or without padded palms) and savate boots. Savate is the only kickboxing style besides Combat Hopak to use footwear, although some other combat sports such as Shoot Fighting and some forms of MMA sometimes also wear grappling-type shoes/boots. Savate boots can be used to hit with the sole, the top of the foot, the toe, or the heel. Sometimes a Headgear can be worn, e.g. in junior competitions and in the early rounds of Combat (full contact) bouts.\nTechniques.\nIn competitive or competition \"savate\", which includes Assaut, Pre-Combat, and Combat types, there are only four kinds of kicks allowed along with four kinds of punches allowed:\nSavate de rue.\nSavate did not begin as a sport, but as a martial art for self-defence taught in the streets of Paris and Marseille. This type of savate was known as Savate de Rue (street savate). In addition to kicks and punches, savate de rue incorporates knee and elbow strikes as well as joint locks, sweeps, throws, headbutts and takedowns.\nEvents.\nThe International Savate Federation (Federation Internationale de Savate) holds World Championships in three disciplines: Savate Assaut, Savate Combat and Canne de combat. World Savate Combat Championships are being held for Seniors (over 21 years) and Juniors (18 to 21 years).\nNotable practitioners.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCultural references.\nIn \"Dr. Wells is Missing\", a 1974 episode of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" a savate master named Pierre fights with Steve Austin, using the original kicks-only style of the art.\nIn Marvel Comics, the criminal mercenary Batroc the Leaper, an adversary of Captain America and mentor of Gwen Poole, is a master of savate, training the latter. The X-Men character Gambit is trained in savate.\nIn the issue \"Flight 714\" of \"The Adventures of Tintin\", Professor Calculus states that he used to be proficient in savate in his younger years. However, when attempting a kick, he ends up falling terribly, prompting stunned reactions from the onlookers. Dazed, Calculus remarks that he is out of practice. In \"The Black Island\", Tintin himself kicks a villain and calls it a savate move.\nIn the 1967 novel \"Logan's Run\", protagonist Logan 3 often uses savate kicks for self-defense.\nIn DC Comics, the character Nightwing is a martial arts expert whose many skills include savate.\nIn the Japanese manga series \"Medaka Box\" Zenkichi Hitoyoshi is a master of savate, and emphasizes its Open Handed Style Techniques with his \"Altered God Mode: Model Zenkichi\" which makes his hands as sharp as blades.\nIn the manga series \"Kengan Omega\", Nicholas Le Banner uses a martial art he calls 'Sahate', created by incorporating techniques from Fencing, Savate, and Karate.\nIn the manga series One Piece, Sanji uses a martial art consisting exclusively of precise kicks using the toe or heel called the \"Black Leg\" style. While not textually based on savate, individual techniques have names in French, and the character's other interests draw from mainstream French culture (such as cuisine and wine).\nAsh Crimson from \"The King of Fighters\" fights in a basic savate style that uses his own green flames. Ash himself is portrayed by SNK as a character with an unknown origin, because his lineage as descendant of Saiki (Those from the Past's leader), but it says too that he was raised by the Blanctorche clan, a French family.\nRemy from \"\" uses savate in a majority of his kick normals, combined with charge command specials reminiscent of Guile and Charlie Nash. His kick normals have a long reach but are slow and punishable, placing him low among competitive 3rd Strike tier lists.\nJohn Crawley from \"Art of Fighting\" and \"The King of Fighters\" uses savate in his martial arts style.\nIn the \"Tekken\" series, Brazilian character Katarina Alves uses savate as her fighting syle.\nIn the mid to late 1980s, WWF commentator Gorilla Monsoon would often refer to the reverse kicks thrown by the French-Canadian Rougeau Brothers as \"savate kicks.\"\nUlrich Stern, occasionally alongside his good friend Yumi Ishiyama, is a practitioner of the French martial art in the 2003-2007 French animated show \"Code Lyoko\"\nIn early Alone in the Dark series of survival horror games the main protagonist Edward Carnby was using Savate as unarmed combat method.\nIn the 1984 film Karate Kid, Daniel LaRusso is taken down in the final competition by an opponent who knows savat; even though he had been warned, this happened because the kick came from an unexpected direction, not being a normal karate move.\nInfluence on other martial arts.\nBruce Lee also studied Savate and included many techniques to his own Jeet Kune Do style. Mixed martial arts also had influence in a similar matter, in UFC 1 world-champion savateur Gerard Gordeau participated, reaching the finals where he lost to Royce Gracie, and he went to corner and train many future Dutch MMA fighters. Other savateurs have competed in MMA, such as Bellator Light Heavyweight Champion Christian M'Pumbu, Karl Amoussou and Cheick Kongo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He influenced fellow historian Eusebius, later writers of Church history among the Church Fathers, and the Greek school of chroniclers.\nDescriptions.\nThe Suda claims Africanus was a \"Libyan philosopher,\" and Gelzer considers him of Roman and Ethiopian descent. Julius called himself a native of Jerusalem \u2013 which some scholars consider his birthplace \u2013 and lived at the neighbouring Emmaus. His chronicle indicates his familiarity with the topography of historic Judea.\nLittle of Africanus's life is known, and all dates are uncertain. One tradition places him under the Emperor Gordianus III (238\u2013244), others mention him under Severus Alexander (222\u2013235). He appears to have known Abgar VIII (176\u2013213).\nAfricanus may have served under Septimius Severus against the Osroenians in 195. He went on an embassy to the emperor Severus Alexander to ask for the restoration of Emmaus, which had fallen into ruins. His mission succeeded, and Emmaus was henceforward known as Nicopolis.\nAfricanus traveled to Greece and Rome and went to Alexandria to study, attracted by the fame of its catechetical school, possibly about the year 215. He knew Greek (in which language he wrote), Latin, and Hebrew. He was at one time a soldier and had been a pagan; he wrote all his works as a Christian.\nWhether Africanus was a layman or a cleric remains controversial. Louis-S\u00e9bastien Le Nain de Tillemont argued from Africanus's addressing the priest Origen as \"dear brother\" that Julius must have been a priest himself but Gelzer points out that such an argument is inconclusive.\nWritings.\nAfricanus wrote \"Chronographiai\", a history of the world in five volumes. The work covers the period from Creation to the year 221 AD. He calculated the period between Creation and Jesus as 5,500 years, placing the Incarnation on the spring equinox in AM 5501 (25 March, 1 BC). While this \"implies\" a birth in December, Africanus did not specify Jesus's birth date. This method of reckoning led to several Creation eras being used in the Greek Eastern Mediterranean, which all placed Creation within one decade of 5500 BC.\nThe history, which had an apologetic aim, is no longer extant, but copious extracts from it are to be found in the \"Chronicon\" of Eusebius, who used it extensively in compiling the early episcopal lists. There are also fragments in George Syncellus, Cedrenus and the \"Chronicon Paschale.\" Eusebius gives some extracts from his letter to one Aristides, reconciling the apparent discrepancy between Matthew and Luke in the genealogy of Christ by a reference to the Jewish law of Levirate marriage, which compelled a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, if the latter died without issue. His terse and pertinent letter to Origen impugning the authority of the part of the Book of Daniel that tells the story of Susanna, and Origen's lengthy answer, are both extant.\nThe ascription to Africanus of an encyclopaedic work entitled \"Kestoi\" (\u039a\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \"Embroidered\"), treating of agriculture, natural history, military science, and other subjects, has been disputed on account of its secular and often credulous character. August Neander suggested that it had been written by Africanus before he had devoted himself to religious subjects. A fragment of the \"Kestoi\" was found in the Oxyrhynchus papyri. According to the \"New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge\", the Kestoi \"appears to have been intended as a sort of encyclopedia of the material sciences with the cognate mathematical and technical branches, but to have contained a large proportion of merely curious, trifling, or miraculous matters, on which account the authorship of Julius has been questioned. Among the parts published are sections on agriculture, liturgiology, tactics, and medicine (including veterinary practise).\"\nVerification of Moses.\nThe Kestoi survives only in fragments, chiefly those preserved by Eusebius and Georgius Syncellus. In turn Africanus preserves fragments of the work of Polemon of Ilium' Greek History.\n [...] Polemo, for instance, in the first book of his Greek History, says: In the time of Apis, king of Argos, son of Phoroneus, a division of the army of the Egyptians left Egypt, and settled in the Palestine called Syrian, not far from Arabia: these are evidently those who were with Moses.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution:"}

Her bones are beneath the high altar of the church built over her tomb in Rome. Her skull is preserved in the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, Rome.\nBiography.\nAccording to tradition, Agnes was born in 291 into Roman nobility, and raised as a Christian. She suffered martyrdom on 21 January 304, aged 12 or 13, and during the reign of the Roman emperor Diocletian. A beautiful young girl, Agnes had many suitors who were young men of high rank. Slighted by her resolute devotion to religious purity, they submitted her name to the authorities as a follower of Christianity. One of them, a man named Procop, brought Agnes to his father, who was the local governor. He urged Agnes to deny God, but she refused.\nThe Prefect Sempronius condemned Agnes to be dragged naked through the streets to a brothel. In one account, as she prayed, her hair grew and covered her body. It was also said that all of the men who attempted to rape her were immediately struck blind. The son of the prefect was struck dead but revived after she prayed for him, causing her release. At the start of Agnes' trial, Sempronius recused himself, and another figure presided. After Agnes was sentenced to death, she was led out and bound to a stake to be burned, but the bundle of wood would not burn, or the flames parted away from her. The officer in charge of the troops drew his sword and beheaded her\u2014or, in other texts, stabbed her in the throat. It is said that when Agnes' blood poured to the stadium floor, other Christians soaked it up with cloths.\nAgnes was buried beside the Via Nomentana in Rome. A few days after her death, her foster-sister, Emerentiana, was found praying by the tomb. Emerentiana claimed to be the daughter of Agnes' wet nurse. She was stoned to death after refusing to leave the place and reprimanding the people for killing her foster-sister. Emerentiana was also later canonized. The daughter of Constantine I, Constantina, was said to have been cured of leprosy after praying at Agnes' tomb. She and Emerentiana appear in the scenes from the life of Agnes on the 14th-century Royal Gold Cup in the British Museum in London.\nAn early account of Agnes' death, stressing her young age, steadfastness and virginity, but not the legendary features of the tradition, is given by the 4th-century theologian, Ambrose.\nThe broader social circumstances of her martyrdom are believed to be largely authentic, though the legend cannot be proven true, and many details of the 5th-century \"Acts of Saint Agnes\" have been challenged. A church was built over her tomb, and her relics venerated.\nVeneration.\nAgnes was venerated as a saint at least as early as the time of St Ambrose, based on an existing homily. She is commemorated in the \"Depositio Martyrum\" of Filocalus (354) and in the early Roman Sacramentaries.\nSaint Agnes' bones are conserved beneath the high altar in the church of in Rome, built over the catacomb that housed her tomb. Her skull is preserved in a separate chapel in the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone in Rome's Piazza Navona.\nAgnes is remembered in the Anglican Communion with a Lesser Festival on 21 January.\nSt Agnes is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Churches.\nPatronage.\nBecause of the legend around her martyrdom, Saint Agnes is patron saint of those seeking chastity and purity. She is also the patron saint of young girls and girl scouts. Folk custom called for them to practise rituals on Saint Agnes' Eve (20\u201321 January) with a view to discovering their future husbands. This superstition has been immortalised in John Keats's poem \"The Eve of Saint Agnes\".\nIconography.\nSince the Middle Ages, Saint Agnes has traditionally been depicted as a young girl with her long hair down, with a lamb, the symbol of both her virginal innocence and her name, and a sword (together with the palm branch an attribute of her martyrdom). The lamb, which is \"agnus\" in the Latin language, is also the linguistic link to the traditional blessing of lambs. Saint Agnes has been depicted with a lamb since the 4th century.\nBlessing of the lambs.\nOn the feast of Saint Agnes, two lambs are traditionally brought from the Trappist abbey of Tre Fontane in Rome to be blessed by the Pope. In summer, the lambs are shorn, and the wool is used to weave the pallia, which the Pope gives on the feast of Saint Peter and Paul to the newly appointed metropolitan archbishops as a sign of his jurisdiction and their union with the pope. This tradition of the blessing of the lambs has been known since the 16th century.\nLegacy.\nThe Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes is a Catholic religious community for women based in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, US. It was founded in 1858, by Father Caspar Rehrl, an Austrian missionary, who established the sisterhood of pioneer women under the patronage of Agnes, to whom he had a particular devotion. \nThe city of Santa Ynez, California is named after her.\nCultural references.\nHrotsvitha, the 10th-century nun and poet, wrote a heroic poem about Agnes.\nIn the historical novel \"Fabiola or, the Church of the Catacombs\", written by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman in 1854, Agnes is the soft-spoken teenage cousin and confidant of the protagonist, the beautiful noblewoman Fabiola.\n\"The Eve of St. Agnes\" is a Romantic narrative poem written by John Keats in 1819.\n\"St. Agnes\u2019 Eve\" is a poem by Alfred Tennyson first published in 1837.\nThe instrumental song \"Saint Agnes and the Burning Train\" appears on the 1991 album \"The Soul Cages\" by Sting.\nThe song \"Bear's Vision of St. Agnes\" appears on the 2012 album \"Ten Stories\" by rock band mewithoutYou.\nThe St. Agnes Library is a branch of the New York Public Library located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, on Amsterdam Avenue between West 81st and West 82nd Streets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Chongqing was formerly a part of Sichuan until 1997; thus, there is a great deal of cultural overlap between the two administrative divisions. There are many regional, local variations of Sichuanese cuisine within Sichuan and Chongqing.\nThe four major substyles of Sichuanese cuisine include Shanghebang, Xiaohebang, Xiahebang, and Buddhist vegetarian style. Shanghebang is represented by Chengdu and Leshan; Xiaohebang by Zigong (which is also known for a genre of dishes called yanbangcai), Yibin, Luzhou, and Neijiang; and Xiahebang by Chongqing and Dazhou.\nSichuanese cuisine is renowned for fiery and bold tastes, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of garlic and chilis, as well as the unique flavors of Sichuan (Szechuan) pepper. Some examples are Kung Pao chicken and Yuxiang shredded pork. \nUNESCO declared Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, a city of gastronomy in 2011.\nHistory.\nSichuan cuisine is thought to have originated during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, the beginning of Qin and Han dynasties, and the formation of classical Sichuan cuisine in Han and Jin dynasties. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, Sichuan cuisine was developed further, and Sichuan restaurants spread throughout Kaifeng and Lin'an. During the Song dynasty, Sichuan cuisine became an distinct cuisine.\nDuring the Ming and Qing dynasties, Sichuan cuisine developed further until the foundation of the modern Republic of China. Modern Sichuan cuisine eventually formed the characteristics of \"rich variety\", and \"strong taste and spicy\".\nChili peppers were introduced into Sichuan and widely used in Sichuan cuisine during the Kangxi period, which was a watershed between ancient Sichuan cuisine and modern Sichuan cuisine. The book \"Flower Mirror\" written and published by Chen Xiuzi in 1688 states in volume five: \"Pepper, a sea mad vine, commonly known as spicy eggplant\u2026\u2026the most spicy, used by many people, very fine, winter moon to replace pepper.\"\nIn the Middle Ages, Sichuan welcomed Middle Eastern crops, such as broad beans, sesame and walnuts. Since the 16th century, the list of major crops in Sichuan has even been lengthened by New World newcomers. The chili pepper is native to Mexico, and likely arrived in Sichuan province from India or Macau, complementing the traditional Sichuan (Szechuan) peppercorns. Other newcomers from the New World included corn, which largely replaced millet; white potatoes introduced by Catholic missions; and sweet potatoes. The population of Sichuan was cut by about 75% in the wars from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. Settlers from the adjacent Hunan Province brought their cooking styles with them.\nSichuan is colloquially known as the \"heavenly country\" due to its abundance of food and natural resources. One ancient Chinese account declared that the \"people of Sichuan uphold good flavors, and they are fond of hot and spicy taste.\" Most Sichuan dishes are spicy, although a typical meal includes nonspicy dishes to cool the palate. Sichuan cuisine is composed of seven basic tastes: sweet, sour, numbingly spicy, spicy, bitter, fragrant/aromatic, and salty. Sichuan food is divided into five different types: sumptuous banquet, ordinary banquet, popular foods, household-style food and snacks. Milder versions of Sichuan dishes remain a staple of American Chinese cuisine.\nWang Dayu, in the Sichuan cuisine history strategy by the Committee on Literature and History of the CPPCC, considers Sichuan cuisine to be roughly divided into Chengdu Bang, Chongqing Bang, Dahe Bang, and Xiaohe Bang categories. \nCategories of Sichuan cuisine.\nShanghe Gang Sichuan cuisine in Chengdu, and Leshan-centered areas in the west of Sichuan is characterized by being rich in seasoning and having a relatively light taste. It often uses spicy bean paste and sugar for flavoring, and is the most widely known Sichuan cuisine. \nShanghe Bangchuan cuisine is based on traditional classical recipes. It has a mild taste and flavor while concentrating on premium dishes such as royal and official banquet dishes.\nXiaohe Bangchuan cuisine is centered on Zigong in southern Sichuan, and includes Yibin cuisine, Luzhou cuisine, and Neijiang cuisine, which are characterized by their rich tastes. Zigong Yanbang dishes are divided into three branches: salty commercial dishes, salty industrial dishes and hall dishes, with a spicy taste, Mala, and sweet and sour taste.\nFeatures.\nThe complex topography of Sichuan Province, including its mountains, hills, plains, plateaus and the Sichuan Basin, has shaped its food customs with versatile and distinct ingredients.\nAbundant rice and vegetables are produced from the fertile Sichuan Basin, whereas a wide variety of herbs, mushrooms and other fungi prosper in the highland regions. Pork is overwhelmingly the most common type of meat consumed. Beef is somewhat more common in Sichuan cuisine than it is in other Chinese cuisines, perhaps due to the prevalence of oxen in the region. Sichuan cuisine also uses various cow and pork offal as ingredients, including intestine, arteries, head, tongue, skin and liver. Rabbit meat is much more popular in Sichuan than elsewhere in China. It is estimated that the Sichuan Basin and Chongqing area are responsible for about 70 percent of China's total rabbit meat consumption. The salt produced from Sichuan salt springs and wells does not contain iodine, which led to issues with goiter before the 20th century.\nSichuan cuisine often contains food preserved through pickling, salting and drying. Preserved dishes are generally served as spicy dishes with heavy application of chili oil.\nIngredients.\nThe most unique and important spice in Sichuan cuisine is the Sichuan (Szechuan) pepper (), which has an intense, fragrant citruslike taste and produces a notably distinct \"numbingly spicy\" () sensation in the mouth. Other commonly used spices in Sichuan cuisine are garlic, chili peppers, ginger, and star anise.\nBroad bean chili paste () is another important seasoning. It is an essential component to famous dishes such as Mapo tofu and twice-cooked pork.\nSichuan cuisine is the origin of several prominent sauces/flavors widely used in modern Chinese cuisine, including:\nOther examples of flavor combinations including spicy and hot (\"Mala),\" fish flavor (\"Yuxiang\"), hot and sour, the five spices (\"Wuxiang;\" \u4e94\u9999), ginger juice, mashed garlic, sweet and sour, spice salt (\"Jiaoyan\"; \u6912\u9e7d), dried tangerine or orange peel (\"Chenpi\"; \u9673\u76ae), burnt chili, pot-stewed fowl (\"Lu\"; \u6ef7\u5473), odd flavor (\"Guaiwei\"; \u602a\u5473), and other recombinations of these seasonings.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a narrow sense, Shanghai cuisine refers only to what is traditionally called Benbang cuisine (; \"pen\u2075 paon\u00b9 tshe\u2075\"; 'local cuisine') which originated in Shanghai. In a broader sense, it refers to complex styles of cooking developed under the influence of neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.\nThe dishes within the cuisine need to master the three elements of \"color, aroma, and taste\" (). Like other cuisines within China, Shanghai cuisine emphasizes the use of seasonings, the quality of raw ingredients, and preserving the original flavors of ingredients. The adoption of Western influence in Shanghai cuisine resulted in a unique cooking style known as Haipai cuisine ().\nCharacteristic features.\nShanghai cuisine is characterized by its use of soy sauce, which gives dishes a red and shiny appearance. Both dark soy sauce and regular soy sauce are used in Shanghai cooking. Dark soy sauce creates a dark amber color in dishes, while regular soy sauce enhances the flavor. The four classic words used to describe Shanghai food are \"\", which means that Shanghai food uses a considerable amount of oil and soy sauce. Dishes are prepared using various methods, such as baking, stewing, braising, steaming, and deep-frying. Seafood is also a prominent feature of Shanghai cuisine, with fish, crab, and chicken being made \"drunken\" using spirits and brisk cooking techniques. Salted meats and preserved vegetables are commonly used to enhance various dishes. Additionally, sugar plays an important role in Shanghai cuisine when used in combination with soy sauce. Rice is more commonly served than noodles or other wheat products. \nShanghai cuisine aims to emphasize the original flavors of raw ingredients while utilizing condiments to enhance the taste. Compared to other Chinese cuisines, it has a mellower and slightly sweet taste. Sweet and sour is a typical Shanghai taste. Presentation is also a key aspect of Shanghai cuisine, with ingredients being meticulously cut and arranged to create a harmonious color scheme.\nInterestingly, in the early 20th century, Shanghai families did not regularly include fish in their daily meals despite the city being a port town. Meat was considered a luxury, and meals typically consisted of vegetables, beans, and rice. Families would only consume meat or fish four times a month, on the second, eighth, sixteenth, and twenty-third days, which were known as \"dang hun\". Today, with greater awareness of nutrition, there is a higher demand for low-sugar and low-fat foods, and more vegetables are being incorporated into diets to promote healthier eating habits.\nHistory.\nShanghai cuisine is the youngest of the ten major cuisines of China, although it still has more than 400 years of history. Traditionally called Benbang cuisine, it originated in the Ming and Qing dynasties (c. 1368\u20131840). During the reign of Emperor Jiaqing and Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, a food stall was set up in the old city of Shanghai called \"Shovel Bang\" (). After 1930, as Shanghai's industry and commerce rapidly developed, the main customers of Benbang cuisine were an emerging class of workers. As a result, the proportion of inexpensive dishes in Benbang cuisine began to decrease.\nIn the later part of the 19th century, after Shanghai became a major domestic and international trading port, Benbang dishes underwent substantial change. After the opening of Shanghai port in 1843, sixteen different catering schools opened in Shanghai. Anhui cuisine was the first to gain popularity in Shanghai, followed by Suxi cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Huaiyang cuisine, and Beijing cuisine. In the 1930s, Suxi cuisine was prevalent in almost half of Shanghai's restaurants. Guangdong cuisine was highly popular among both residents of Shanghai and foreigners. As a result of adopting influences from other cuisines, the flavors of Shanghai cuisine became more complex.\nWestern influence in Shanghai cuisine resulted in the development of a unique cooking style known as Haipai cuisine (). At the time, eating Western food was considered fashionable, but Chinese people initially struggled to adapt to certain aspects of Western cuisine, such as rare steak. Western food in Shanghai was influenced by many countries but formed its own distinct characteristics. Russian Shanghai Western food, which typically included one main dish and one soup (such as borscht, bread and butter), became particularly popular in Shanghai due to its economic benefits. Before 1937, there were over 200 Western restaurants in Shanghai, particularly on Xiafei Road and Fuzhou Road.\nNowadays, Shanghai's traditional cuisine is usually found only in home-cooked meals and some old Benbang restaurants. Shanghai is now more famous for its numerous exotic restaurants, especially those serving Japanese and French food.\nNotable dishes in Shanghai cuisine.\nBreakfast.\nBreakfast food in Shanghai is varied and contains foods mainly made from wheat, rice, and flour. Many of them are influenced by Cantonese, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang cuisine, and through historical precipitation, these breakfasts have slowly become favorites of people in Shanghai today. The most classic Shanghai breakfast is called \"The Four Warriors\" (; \"sy\u2075 du\u2076 cin\u00b9 kaon\u00b9\"). These are the four most popular breakfast choices for Shanghainese.\nSeafood.\nSeafood is commonly seen in Shanghai cuisine.

{"id": "27910", "revid": "50775003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27910", "title": "Soul food", "text": "Ethnic cuisine of African Americans\n A traditional soul food dinner consisting of fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, breaded fried okra, and cornbread.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Subinfobox bodystyle/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSoul food is the ethnic cuisine of African Americans. Originating in the American South from the cuisines of enslaved Africans transported from Africa through the Atlantic slave trade, soul food is closely associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States. The expression \"soul food\" originated in the mid-1960s when \"soul\" was a common word used to describe African-American culture. Soul food uses cooking techniques and ingredients from West African, Central African, Western European, and Indigenous cuisine of the Americas.\nThe cuisine was initially denigrated as low quality and belittled because of its origin. It was seen as low-class food, and African Americans in the North looked down on their Black Southern compatriots who preferred soul food (see the Great Migration). The concept evolved from describing the food of slaves in the South, to being taken up as a primary source of pride in the African American community even in the North, such as in New York City, Chicago and Detroit.\nSoul food historian Adrian Miller said the difference between soul food and Southern food is that soul food is intensely seasoned and uses a variety of meats to add flavor to food and adds a variety of spicy and savory sauces. These spicy and savory sauces add robust flavor. This method of preparation was influenced by West African cuisine where West Africans create sauces to add flavor and spice to their food. Black Americans also add sugar to make cornbread, while \"white southerners say when you put sugar in corn bread, it becomes cake\". Bob Jeffries, the author of \"Soul Food Cookbook\", said the difference between soul food and Southern food is: \"While all soul food is Southern food, not all Southern food is soul. Soul food cooking is an example of how really good Southern [African-American] cooks cooked with what they had available to them.\"\nImpoverished White and Black people in the South cooked many of the same dishes stemming from Southern cooking traditions, but styles of preparation sometimes varied. Certain techniques popular in soul and other Southern cuisines (i.e., frying meat and using all parts of the animal for consumption) are shared with cultures all over the world.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"soul food\" became popular during the 1960s and 1970s in the midst of the Black Power movement. One of the earliest written uses of the term is found in \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", which was published in 1965. LeRoi Jones (later known as Amiri Baraka) published an article entitled \"Soul Food\" and was one of the key proponents for establishing the food as a part of the Black American identity. Those who had participated in the Great Migration found within soul food a reminder of the home and family they had left behind after moving to unfamiliar northern cities. Soul food restaurants were Black-owned businesses that served as neighborhood meeting places where people socialized and ate together. According to author Laretta Henderson, middle-class African Americans embrace their \"blackness\" by preparing and eating soul food. Henderson wrote:In its culinary incarnation, \"soul food\" was associated with a shared history of oppression and inculcated, by some, with cultural pride. Soul food was eaten by the bondsmen. It was also the food former slaves incorporated into their diet after emancipation. Therefore, during the 1960s, middle-class blacks used their reported consumption of soul food to distance themselves from the values of the white middle class, to define themselves ethnically, and to align themselves with lower-class blacks. Irrespective of political affiliation or social class, the definition of \"blackness\", or \"soul\", became part of everyday discourse in the black community. This style of cooking is celebrated in the month of June, called National Soul Food month.\nHistory.\nTransatlantic slave trade.\nDuring the period of the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved people ate African foods aboard slave ships. These included rice, millet, okra, black-eyed peas, yams, and legumes such as kidney beans and lima beans. These crops were brought to North America and became a staple in Southern cuisine. One enslaved African aboard a slave ship recalled later that all they ate were yams on the voyage from Africa to Charleston, South Carolina. Slave ships were provisioned with African vegetables, fruits, and animals to feed the enslaved people bound in chains below the ships' decks. These items were later planted and used in the New World for food and as cash crops. The introduction of African plants to the Americas that shaped American cuisine was part of what is called the Columbian exchange. Researchers from Mercer University Libraries said: \"The foods selected to bring to America were brought over for specific reasons. 'They all remain palatable long after harvesting and were thus ideal for use on the slow voyage from Africa. Secondly, they are all the edible parts of plants that thrive in the American South, and therefore they flourished once they had been planted hopefully by the slave in the garden space allotted to him on his owner's plantation'\". Another way rice, okra, and millet came to North America was by enslaved African women on slave ships hiding the seeds of rice, okra, and millet in their braided hair as a precaution against an unknown future in the new land where they would be forced to work.\nThe guineafowl is a bird indigenous to Africa imported to the Americas by way of the slave trade; the bird was brought by the Spanish to the Caribbean, and introduced to the South of what is now the United States in the early 16th century. Guinea fowl became a source of meat for enslaved Black Americans and eventually part of the subsistence culture of the whole region. On American plantations, enslaved people consumed the eggs of the guinea fowl, as well as cooking the meat with rice like their West-Central African forebears. Enslaved Africans in the South continued to prepare their traditional dishes of guinea fowl and plant foods native to West and Central Africa. They adapted European and Native American foods and cooking methods to create new recipes that were passed down orally in Black families and later published in African-American cookbooks by the end of the American Civil War.\nSlavery.\nSoul food recipes have pre-slavery influences, as West African and European foodways were adapted to the environment of the region. Soul food originated in the home cooking of the rural Southern United States or the \"Deep South\" during the time of slavery, using locally gathered or raised foods and other inexpensive ingredients. Rabbits, squirrels, and deer were often hunted for meat. Fish, frogs, crawfish, turtles, shellfish, and crab were often collected from fresh waters, salt waters, and marshes. Soul food cookery began when African American/Black American enslaved people learned to make do with what they were given to eat by their enslavers: leftovers and the undesirable parts of animals such as ham hocks, hog jowls and pigs' feet, ears, skin, and intestines, which white plantation owners did not eat. Soul food was created by enslaved African Americans, who created meals out of minimal ingredients. Slaves combined their knowledge of West-Central African cooking methods with techniques borrowed from Native Americans and Europeans, thus creating soul food.\nPork and corn were two staple items in the Southern United States for both slave owners and slaves. Many of the foods integral to the cuisine originated in the limited foodstuffs that poor southern subsistence farmers had at hand. This in turn was reflected in the rations given to enslaved people their enslavers. Enslaved people were typically given a peck of cornmeal and 3\u20134 pounds of pork per week, and those rations formed the basis of African American soul food. Most enslaved people needed to consume a high-calorie diet to replenish the calories spent working long days in the fields or performing other physically arduous tasks. The slave owners would have smoked ham and corn pudding while the enslaved were left with the offal. The leftovers and scraps from meals cooked for the \"big houses\" (plantation houses) were called \"juba\" by the enslaved. They were put in troughs on Sundays for the slaves to eat. The term \"juba\" occurs in numerous African languages, and folk knowledge records that early on it had the meaning of \"little bits\" of food.\nArchaeological and historical research concerning slave cabins in the Southern United States indicates that enslaved African Americans used bowls more often than flatware and plates, suggesting that they primarily made stews and \"gumbo\" for meals, using local ingredients gathered in nature, vegetables grown in their gardens, and leftover animal scraps rejected by their enslavers. This process allowed enslaved people to create new dishes, for which they developed a variety of ways to season and add spice using hot sauces they prepared. The research shows that white plantation families more often used plates and flatware, indicating that they ate meals consisting of individual cuts of meats and vegetables that were not blended into one dish like the stews made by enslaved people. Enslaved people living on plantations located along the Atlantic coast developed a diversity of foodways enabled by their access to seafood.\nDuring slavery times, Gullah people in the Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia practiced a fishing culture that came from West Africa and made canoes similar in appearance to the ones in sub-Saharan Africa. Gullah people passed down their fishing traditions and prepared meals of fish using local ingredients from the region, developing fish dishes that are still a part of Gullah culture. Author Amy Lynne Young's research at the Mary Plantation in Louisiana showed the differences in foodways between enslaved people living inland versus those living along the Atlantic coast. Families in coastal areas had access to a variety of meats from land and sea animals, especially those who lived on the coastlines and barrier Sea Islands. Inland slaves' choices of meats were limited, consisting of game such as rabbit and squirrel, farm chickens, pigs, and leftover animal scraps. Vegetables were locally gathered or grown in their gardens. Young suggests enslaved people living along the coast consequently had a more diverse diet than inland slaves. This demonstrates regional styles of cooking soul food based on local ingredients.\nFrederick Douglass said in his autobiography that because enslaved people living on the Eastern shore of Maryland near the Choptank River received the bare minimum in food from their enslavers, they fished for food to supplement their diet, catching turtles, fish, and eels. Douglass wrote: \"The men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal\". Another way they supplemented their diet was by growing vegetable gardens; they grew corn, potatoes, peas, beans, herbs, and melons. They did not have fat or cooking oil to cook their food. Slaveholders in Dorchester County, Maryland rarely fed their slaves. To supplement their poor diets, enslaved people in Dorchester fished for food in the Choptank River and hunted game on land. The animals they caught for food included rabbit, turtle, duck, goose, turkey, pigeon, woodpecker, possum, raccoon, skunk, deer, and muskrat. They cooked vegetables such as okra, corn, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes that they grew in their gardens. From these various food sources enslaved people created their meals.\nResearchers at St. Mary's County Library located in Maryland documented an African American muskrat recipe. \"Skin and disjoint the animal. Soak it in salted or vinegar water for two hours. Put the pieces in a pan of water, and parboil until slightly tender, but not real done. Dust in a mixture of seasoned flour, salted and peppered to taste, and fry in hot fat until golden brown.\" Black Americans in St. Mary's County created recipes during slavery that were passed down orally in their families. To add heat and flavor to seafood dishes, enslaved and free Africans in Baltimore and the Chesapeake region of Maryland grew fish peppers in their gardens. After national emancipation many African Americans got into the seafood industry. By 1864, almost half of all watermen in Maryland were former slaves. They became skilled in netting shrimp, gathering oysters, and fishing. During the American Civil War, some enslaved people in Maryland ate clabber milk, fish, and cornbread. After the war, Maryland became known for its crabbing industry, and Maryland deep-fried crab cakes became a part of soul food cuisine.\nEnslaved fishermen in Virginia caught fish to feed their families and the slave community. \"The Encyclopedia of Virginia\" said of the history of free and enslaved Black fishermen: \"Enslaved workers also received fish considered undesirable by whites, such as garfish, whose red flesh Niemcewicz explained 'is little esteemed, serving only as food for negroes', and black catfish, which held less appeal for whites than white catfish, which was 'considered excellent'. Enslaved workers also fished in their time off to supplement their rations.\" At George Washington's residential plantation in Virginia, Mount Vernon, enslaved cooks there prepared corn meal pancakes, \"hoe cakes\", individual cuts of meat, and seasoned cooked vegetables for the Washington family, while the enslaved people primarily ate corn meal and salted fish.\nThe diet of slaves in Virginia generally included meat from farm animals, vegetables, blackberries, walnuts, and seafood. Historical research at the Burroughs plantation in Franklin County, Virginia by the National Park Service showed that enslaved people there had a diet of cornbread, pork, chicken, sweet potatoes, and boiled corn for breakfast. Along the coast, enslaved people ate oysters and seafood. Booker T. Washington was born enslaved in Franklin County, Virginia in 1856 and wrote an autobiography titled, \"The Story of My Life and Work and Up from Slavery\", that described the diet he grew up with as an enslaved child. Washington's mother was an enslaved plantation cook who prepared meals for the white families.\nBooker T. Washington's mother cooked over an open fireplace or in skillets and pots. Washington, his mother, and siblings ate out of pots and skillets while white families ate from plates and flatware using forks and spoons. His mother prepared one-pot meals for her family using local meats, vegetables, nuts, and berries, combining all the ingredients in a pot to make a stew. This way of cooking is still done in West Africa and continued in the Southern United States with enslaved families. Enslaved people at the Burroughs plantation had a variety of vegetables with which to make stews; they were: \"Asparagus, beets, beans, black-eyed peas, carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, garden peas, Irish potatoes, kale, lettuce, lima beans, muskmelons, okra, onions, peppers, radishes, tomatoes, turnips, and watermelons would be planted, ripened, and harvested from spring through fall\".\nAccording to Chambers's research, Igbo Africans influenced the foodways of Black Americans in Virginia. During the slave trade, about 30,000 Igbo people were trafficked from Igboland to Virginia. Igbo people in West Africa ate yams, okra, poultry, goats, and fished for their food. Okra, yams, black-eyed peas, and other African foods were brought to Virginia and enslaved Igbo people cooked these foods and prepared stews as one-pot meals. Enslaved people fished for food in the Chesapeake Bay and prepared seafood meals. In Virginia's nearby creeks and rivers, slaves caught catfish, crayfish, perch, herring, and turtles for food. White plantation owners in Virginia rarely provided food to feed their slaves. To supplement their diets, enslaved people relied on Igbo methods such as hunting, fishing, and foraging for food and prepared meals that were influenced by Igbo culture. Chambers wrote: \"Slave owners stinted the slaves, throwing the people back onto their own resourcefulness for sustenance. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, masters provided slaves with only the barest necessities. Weekly or monthly rations consisted of salt fish and/ or pork, corn or cornmeal, and salt and perhaps molasses. The largest plantation holders usually doled out salted herring as well as smoked pork and corn, which the slaves pounded and mixed with beans and boiled into hominy\".\nA few enslaved chefs had some degree of autonomy because of their cooking skills, such as Hercules Posey and James Hemings. Hercules Posey was the enslaved cook for George Washington at Mount Vernon in Virginia. Posey's dishes were so popular among elite White families that he had quasi-freedom to leave the house on his own and earn money selling leftovers. According to historians, the dishes Posey made were influenced by West African, European, and Native American foodways. He created dishes of veal, roast beef, and duck, along with puddings and jellies prepared in a way not unlike that of other chefs, but creating his own sauces and flavors. Posey was never given his freedom, and eventually escaped from slavery. James Hemings (brother of Sally Hemings) was born enslaved in colonial Virginia and was the head chef for Thomas Jefferson. Hemings combined African, French, and Native American food traditions. While enslaved, Hemings traveled to Paris, France with Jefferson, where he trained under French chefs and learned how to make macaroni pie (today called macaroni and cheese). Hemings introduced and popularized macaroni and cheese in the United States; it later became a common side item in soul food dishes in Black communities.\nSesame is an African crop that was brought to South Carolina in 1730 during the slave trade. Thomas Jefferson noted how enslaved people prepared stews, baked breads, boiled their greens with sesame seeds, and made sesame pudding. Slaves ate sesame raw, toasted, and boiled. It was used as an ingredient for baked breads in colonial America and is still used in the present day.\nSome slaves grew herbs in their gardens to add flavor to their food. Other cooking techniques were boiling and simmering food in an earthenware or iron pot known as colonoware. Salt was used to preserve meats for weeks until consumption. To sweeten their food and beverages, slaves used molasses. They also made blackstrap molasses, a very dark molasses with robust flavor, by cooking the juice of sugarcane low and slow. Other sweet sauces created and used by slaves were sorghum syrup, similar to molasses, made by cooking the juice of the sorghum plant. Sorghum seeds came from West Africa by way of the transatlantic slave trade and were grown by enslaved people on plantations in the New World and used to make sweet sauces.\nAccording to research by scholars at Mercer University, white plantation families initially refused to eat African foods prepared by their slaves, although in many plantation kitchens enslaved African women were the primary cooks. These women passed down cultural knowledge of cooking techniques to the children. Older slave women were preferred as cooks by white plantation families because they were seen as nonthreatening, knowledgeable, and skilled in cooking. Time spent in the kitchen was time that enslaved mothers could spend bonding with their children and teaching them about life, culture, and foodways. In African societies and during slavery, women were the primary cooks. The role of enslaved Black women in the kitchen and as mothers led to racist stereotypes portraying them as Mammys.\nSlave narratives revealed continued African methods of cooking, heating, and seasoning food. Enslaved people roasted and heated their foods using ashes from fire pits, a traditional cooking method in Africa. This method was passed down orally in Black families in the Antebellum South, and slave narratives describe how slaves cooked food this way. The word \"ash\" was appended to the name of some of the food thus prepared, as in \"ash cake\" and \"ash roasted potatoes\". Enslaved people placed food directly on hot ashes or coals to roast or bake their foods. Pots and pans were also placed on top of hot ashes and coals to cook food. Some slaves heated or cooked their foods by putting them on leaves placed on top of the hot ashes. A former slave, Betty Curlett from Arkansas, told of roasting her potatoes on hot ashes: \"They cooked a washpot full of peas for a meal or two and roasted potatoes around the pot in the ashes.\"\nSome slaves did not receive enough food from their enslavers as some slaves starved and consequently were malnourished. House slaves and field slaves had different diets. House slaves ate the leftovers they prepared for white plantation families such as individual cuts from meats like chicken, turkey, or fish, along with pies and seasoned vegetables. Slaves working in the field ate leftover animal scraps, offal, and whatever food they could find in their environment. Some field slaves rarely ate regular hearty meals. Historian John Blassingame's book published in 1972, \"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South\", was researched from a collection of slave narratives. According to Blassingame's research, some enslaved people received the bare minimum in food and had to supplement their diets by hunting, fishing, and foraging for food. Louisiana slave records showed enslaved people ran away because of inadequate food and overwork. To survive, slaves stole food from their enslavers, killed cattle from nearby farms, and hunted and fished for food.\nResearch from the National Park Service and professor George Estabrook said that enslaved people supplemented their diets \"By boiling black-eyed peas, turnip greens, and pork fat in a single kettle and serving the mixture with grits made from home-ground corn, slaves cooked up meals that satisfied their dietary requirements, as well as their appetites.\" The black-eyed peas were a source of protein and the greens provided fiber and vitamins C and A. Boiling greens in a kettle produced a vitamin-packed beverage called pot liquor that was consumed by the enslaved during the Antebellum era to maintain their health. White plantation owners ate the greens prepared by their slaves and left the green liquid (broth) for the slaves to drink not realizing the nutrients was in the broth. Pot liquor (also called potlikker) has Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, and iron. The enslaved and their descendants created healing remedies using pot liquors. Slave gardens were important in the slave community, it supplemented slaves nutrient-deprived diet because their slaveholders did not provide enough food to feed them. Slaveholders allowed their slaves to grow food in gardens because it saved their enslavers money, giving them an excuse not to buy food for their slaves. Some slaveholders provided the enslaved seeds to grow their own food. Slaves also made money by selling some of the food they grew to their enslavers.\nChitterlings (also known as chitlins) are cleaned pig intestines; they are cooked in a pot and seasoned. This food has been associated with enslaved Black people in the American South; however, eating animal innards (intestines) is practiced in other cultures such as Asia, Europe, and West Africa. The Hausa people in West Africa eat chicken intestines. Enslaved Africans in the American South continued their traditions of cooking, seasoning, and eating animal innards. Enslaved people added extremely hot peppers for additional flavor and spice to their chitlins. Cooking chitlins was time consuming; field slaves slow cooked their pig intestines while they were working in the field. The parts of the pig that white plantation owners did not eat they gave to the enslaved which they used to season food and prepared one-pot meals, soups, and chitlin dishes. Chitterlings are considered a delicacy in other cultures. Due to the time it takes to clean pig intestines, chitterlings were preserved for special occasions and holidays. Some cooks season chitterlings with onions, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, and butter. Booker T. Washington wrote that enslaved people ate chitlins during the Christmas season. Christmas in Virginia was a time when slaves hired to work on other plantations came home to visit their families at their enslaver's plantations. Enslaved families were supplied with food that consisted of chitlins, sausage, and side meats. After the American Civil War, cornbread, pigs' feet, hogs' ears, peas, and chitlins were prepared for Booker T. Washington's daughter, Portia Washington Pittman, 87th birthday.\nFoodways on the Underground Railroad.\nFreedom seekers (runaway slaves) foraged, fished, and hunted for food on their journey to freedom on the Underground Railroad. With these ingredients, they prepared one-pot meals (stews), a West African cooking method. Enslaved and free Black people left food outside their front doors to provide nourishment to the freedom seekers. The meals created on the Underground Railroad became a part of the foodways of Black Americans called soul food. For example, Thomas Downing was born enslaved in 1791 on Chincoteague Island, on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. He learned how to harvest clams, oysters, and terrapin from the Chincoteague Bay, a lagoon of the Atlantic Ocean between Chincoteague and Assateague islands, and prepared meals from this seafood. Downing left Virginia during the War of 1812 and traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a city that had Black Americans working in the culinary industry. There, he settled in the free Black community and found work catching oysters. Gaining his freedom in 1819, Downing, his wife, and sons moved to New York City, where the Hudson River provided work for New York's African American men working on the water harvesting oysters. By 1825 he had opened an oyster cellar, \"Downing's Oyster House\", on Broadway Street, in the city's business district. There he served raw, fried, and stewed oysters, oyster pie, fish with oyster sauce, and poached turkey stuffed with oysters. In the basement of his restaurant, Downing and his eldest son George hid people who were escaping slavery and seeking freedom. Downing became known as the \"Oyster King of New York\".\nSlave recipes.\nIn the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration paid American writers to gather stories from the last generations of African Americans born into slavery that are called slave narratives. Alongside the narratives are collections of recipes for sauces, desserts, and cooked meat and seafood dishes made by formerly enslaved African Americans. These records have been studied by John Blassingame, Michael Twitty, Jessica B. Harris, and other historians as they reveal the food culture and diets of enslaved people. The narratives show how enslaved people created new dishes that influenced Southern cuisine in the United States. The foods enslaved people prepared in the kitchens for white plantation families influenced the diets and cooking methods of European Americans.\nResearch from slave narratives showed enslaved people cooked sweet potatoes by roasting or frying them in lard. Sweet potatoes were mashed and sweetened with molasses. A traditional soul food dessert in Black families for Thanksgiving and Christmas is sweet potato pie. Enslaved people also consumed pot liquor, the liquid left behind after boiling greens. George Key, who was born enslaved in Arkansas, said: \"We had stew made out of pork and potatoes, and sometimes greens and pot liquor, and we had ash cake mostly, but biscuits about once a month.\" Making pot liquor continued after emancipation. Jackie Torrence, an African American storyteller, remembers her grandmother making pot liquor from mustard greens, collard greens, pinto beans, peas, and white potatoes as gravy. Pot liquor was also used as a healing remedy to treat earache and ingrown toenails.\nA former slave named Wesley Jones from South Carolina gave a recipe to make a vinegar-based barbecue sauce using black and red peppers and vinegar. Wesley said slaves barbecued meats often, smoking and basting their meats with this homemade barbecue sauce; they would stay up all night slow cooking the meat. Other slave narratives described barbecuing as a preferred method of cooking because it added flavor and spice to food. Slaves barbecued their foods for special occasions and on their days off. Henry Bland,a former slave who lived in Georgia, said slaves had July 4 (Independence Day) off from work, allowing them to barbecue food, play ball games, wrestle, and play music.\nA former slave named Callie Elder from Georgia said her grandfather cooked catfish with lard, salt, and pepper, and rolled the catfish in cornmeal before baking. Former slave Clara Davis from Alabama cooked catfish using tomatoes and potatoes or prepared baked catfish with a tomato gravy and sweet potatoes. Slaves in the South fried catfish in lard or other fats and seasoned their food with salt acquired from evaporated sea water. Enslaved people made use of fruits like apples and peaches that had been introduced to North America by European colonists. Some fruits, such as apples, were battered and deep fried in oil, fruit fritters were also fried, and peaches were stewed. Former slaves Mose King from Arkansas and Rose Williams from Texas described eating goat. Mary Minus Biddie was a former slave from Florida and said enslaved people cooked goat in a smokehouse. David Goodman Gullins was a former slave from Georgia and said they prepared barbecued goat. Goat is a traditional meat in West Africa and was commonly cooked and eaten in the American south by slaves.\nEnslaved people also barbecued squirrels. One recipe for barbecued squirrels that might have been similar to the way slaves cooked them was given in an 1879 cookbook: \"Put them in the oven and let them cook until done. Lay them on a dish and set near the fire. Take out the bacon, sprinkle one spoonful of flour in the gravy and let it brown. Then pour in one teacup of water, one tablespoon of butter and some tomato or walnut catsup. Let it cool, and then pour it over the squirrel.\" Barbecuing and preparing barbecue sauce and hot sauce were done to season lower grades of meats. Enslaved people living near rivers and the Atlantic Ocean caught crab and made stews with the crab meat in a pot with okra, sometimes adding a sauce. Cooking seafood with okra is a traditional cooking method from West Africa that slaves continued on Southern plantations. Some of these recipes made by former slaves were published in African-American cookbooks. The earliest such cookbook was self-published in 1866 by Malinda Russell as a pamphlet titled, \"A Domestic Cookbook: Containing a Careful Selection of Useful Receipts for the Kitchen\". A cookbook published in 1900 in the city of Charleston, South Carolina had recipes used by formerly enslaved Gullah people. Benne seeds from \"sesame\", a plant native to West Africa, were eaten raw with sugar or milk. Enslaved people also made cakes, wafers, and brittles from them for white plantation families whom they called \"buckra\" (a Gullah word for white people).\nArcheologist, historian, and former professional chef, Kelley Fanto Deetz, wrote a book, \"Bound to the Fire How Virginia's Enslaved Cooks Helped Invent American Cuisine\", that said recipes prepared by enslaved cooks in Virginia contributed to some of the well-known fried and baked meat and vegetable dishes in American southern cuisine. The foods from West-Central Africa brought to the United States by way of the trans-Atlantic slave trade were used by enslaved cooks and combined with North American ingredients using West African, Native American, and European cooking methods to create meals that in the 17th century were necessary for survival that later influenced the foodways of southern Americans generally.\nBarbecue traditions.\nEnslaved Africans in the American south contributed their own influence to the American barbecue tradition. The first people to barbecue food in North America were Indigenous people/Native Americans. West and Central Africans had their own method of barbecuing food that they brought to the Americas and the West Indies. The Hausa people in West Africa had a term for barbecue, \"babbake\". This term is used \"...to describe a complex of words referring to grilling, toasting, building a large fire, singeing hair or feathers and cooking food over a long period of time over an extravagant fire\". The blending of Native American and African styles of barbecuing meat contributed to the creation of the current barbecuing culture in the US. During slavery times, white plantation owners left the labor-intensive work of preparing and barbecuing food to their slaves. Food historian Adrian Miller said the history of Black people and barbecue during slavery: \"Blackness and barbecue were wedded in the public imagination because old-school barbecue was so labour intensive. Someone had to clear the area where the barbecue was held, chop and burn the wood for cooking, dig the pit, butcher, process, cook and season the animals, serve the food, entertain the guests and clean up afterward. Given the racial dynamics of the antebellum South, enslaved African Americans were forced to do that work. The media, in turn, took note that a barbecue, as a social event, was a black experience from beginning to end.\" On Fourth of July celebrations, the enslaved prepared barbecued food for white politicians and their enslavers.\nEnslaved people brought their own influences on the creation of barbecue sauce. Hot and sweet sauces are used in West and Central African cuisine to add flavor, heat, and moisture to food. In 1748, Peter Kalm, a Swedish-Finnish botanist, noted enslaved Africans in Philadelphia cultivated guinea peppers and the pods were pounded and \"mixed with salt preserved in a bottle\" to make sauces poured over fish and meats. Frederick Douglass Opie, writing in his book \"Hog and Hominy\", describes the origins of soul food in Africa: \"African women cooked most meats over an open pit and ate them with a sauce similar to what we now call a barbecue sauce, made from lime or lemon juice and hot peppers.\" \"Slaves made up a large percentage of the Texas population by 1860. During this time they brought with them the idea of cooking over an open fire and dousing meats with a sauce, that sounds an awful lot like the barbecue sauce we know today.\" After the American Civil War, a Black pitmaster named Arthur Watts, brought his family's barbecue sauce recipe and barbecuing methods to Kewanee, Illinois and became a well-known pitmaster. In African-American communities, barbecuing food became a preferred method of cooking during Emancipation Day celebrations.\nEmancipation.\nOn January 1, 1863, Gullah people in the Sea Islands of South Carolina celebrated their freedom on New Year's Day at Camp Saxton in Beaufort with food and barbecues. Black people in the barrier islands of South Carolina became free early during the American Civil War after the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861, when many of the plantation owners and white residents fled the area after the arrival of the Union Navy and Army. As a result, over 10,000 African Americans became free on that day. However, their freedom was not official in government writing until the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation on New Year's Day in 1863. Thousands of newly freed people celebrated their freedom with food, song, and dance. Charlotte Forten, the first black teacher at the Penn School on St. Helena Island in Beaufort, attended the Emancipation Day celebration at Camp Saxton and recorded in her journal they ate roasted oxen and barbecue. Susie King Taylor, a Geechee woman born enslaved in Liberty County, Georgia, wrote in her memoir that she had also attended the Emancipation Day celebration at Camp Saxton: \"It was a glorious day for us all, and we enjoyed every minute of it, and as a fitting close and crowning event of this occasion we had a grand barbecue\". Other Emancipation Day celebrations were celebrated with a barbecue feast, a tradition that originated in the slave community.\nAfter the American Civil War, 4 million African Americans were freed from slavery. They celebrated their newly won freedom with barbecues and Emancipation Day celebrations and prepared soul food meals. Two months after the Civil War ended in April 1865, slaveholders in Galveston, Texas refused to tell their slaves the Civil War had ended and they were free. On June 19, 1865, United States Brigadier General Gordon Granger and his troops arrived in Galveston and issued General order No. 3. This order enforced the Emancipation Proclamation which declared enslaved people in Texas were now free. To celebrate their freedom, African Americans in Galveston, and other Black communities in the United States, gathered at public parks and prepared red foods that represent the color of freedom. These celebrations are called Juneteenth, which became a national holiday under the Biden Administration in the year 2021.\nAccording to food historian Michael Twitty, the reason African Americans eat red food on Juneteenth is that it reminds them of the blood of their ancestors that was shed during slavery, and the cultural colors of the Yoruba and Bakongo people, who were enslaved in the Southern United States and brought to North America under the slave trade. Among the Yoruba and Bakongo people, the color red represents power, sacrifice, and transformation. The red foods eaten at Juneteenth are, watermelon, red lemonade, and red velvet cake. In addition to red foods, BBQ, fried foods, and other cooked meals are prepared to celebrate the day of freedom.\nAfter emancipation, many Black Americans in the South became sharecroppers and cooked what was available in their region. This created regional styles of cooking with similar dishes passed down orally in Black families. Due to slave laws, it was illegal in many states for slaves to learn to read or write. Soul food recipes and cooking techniques were passed down orally until after emancipation.\nThe first soul food cookbook is attributed to Abby Fisher, entitled \"What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking\" and published in 1881. \"Good Things to Eat\" was published in 1911; the author, Rufus Estes, was a former slave who worked for the Pullman railway car service. Many other cookbooks were written by Black Americans during that time, but as they were not widely distributed, most are now lost.\nGlobal spread of African-American cuisine.\nThe global spread of soul food came during World War I and World War II. Thousands of Black Americans enlisted in the army as soldiers and nurses. Some Black soldiers chose to stay overseas than return to the United States where Jim Crow laws, racism, and lynchings were widespread. African American service men and women opened soul food restaurants in Europe, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan and introduced African-American cuisine to people in foreign countries. In the 1920s through the 1940s, African-American culture was popular in France. French people enjoyed jazz, African-American dance, and cuisine. Food historian Adrian Miller said the global spread of soul food: \"The global spread of soul food really took off after the end of World War II. After the war, recently discharged black military veterans in the European theater stayed overseas to open and operate restaurants. At first, they cooked mainly for African Americans who were active-duty military and serving at nearby bases. In some of the countries where the United States had a military presence, like France, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand, it was easy for these entrepreneurs to find the cheap ingredients they needed for their recipes, because the locals ate similar foods: chicken, fish, greens, okra, pork, sweet potatoes.\"\nMid-20th century to present day.\nThe introduction of soul food to cities such as Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Harlem came during the Great Migration as African Americans moved to the North looking for work. Sylvia Woods was born in Hemingway, South Carolina in 1926. When Woods was a teenager she moved to Harlem and worked in a Brooklyn factory. In 1954, Woods changed jobs and started working at Johnson's Luncheonette located in central Harlem. Seven years later, Woods and her husband purchased the luncheonette and opened it as a soul food restaurant in 1962, calling it Sylvia's Restaurant. Sylvia Woods became known as the \"queen of soul food.\"\nFood historian Adrian Miller studied soul food's development in Maryland and in Northern American states. Soul food in Maryland's Black communities added local flavors from seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. People in Maryland fried chicken in shallow fat in a frying pan, covering it with a lid, thus frying and steaming the chicken, which was served with waffles. Chicken and waffles became a common soul food item to eat in Black communities in Maryland and in Harlem, New York. During the blues and jazz era, musicians and singers performed and practiced late into the night and stopped at black-owned restaurants for food where cooks prepared fried chicken and waffles for their customers. Nightclubs in Black communities in the United States during the Jim Crow era were called the Chitlin' Circuit, named after the dish that was usually associated with Black southerners and soul food. The Chitlin' Circuit was given its name by entertainers because it included black-owned night clubs that served chitlins (chitterlings) and soul food.\nDuring the civil rights movement, soul food restaurants were places where civil rights leaders and activists met to discuss and strategize civil rights protests and ideas for implementing social and political change. Paschal's Restaurant in Atlanta, like Georgia Gilmore's eatery in Montgomery, had an important part in the civil rights movement. Upon returning to Atlanta from Montgomery, Martin Luther King got permission \"to bring his team members and guests to Paschal's to eat, meet, rest, plan, and strategize.\" The Atlanta History Center said: \"Throughout the civil rights movement in Atlanta, soul food restaurants were hubs of change where civil rights leaders could convene, converse, and strategize, and in times of terror and violence, these places were retreats where leaders could plan their next tactical moves, giving many of these spots a legacy beyond good cooking\". Soul food restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia served as the primary meeting places for numerous civil rights leaders and supporters of the movement. Many politicians and civil rights leaders gathered to discuss plans about the movement at Paschal's Restaurant on West Hunter Street. In the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights icons such as Andrew Young, John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr., Julian Bond, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Jesse Jackson frequented the restaurant, staying late into the night talking about civil rights strategies and politics. Several soul food restaurants were located on West Hunter Street because Jim Crow laws restricted where African Americans were allowed to operate their businesses.\nIn 1963, a few days before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in Washington D.C., where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"I Have a Dream Speech\" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King ate at a soul food restaurant called the Florida Avenue Grill. During the years of the civil rights movement, other civil rights leaders and activists met at the restaurant, planning and strategizing for the movement. Before King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, he ate at the Four Way restaurant and had fried catfish and lemon icebox pie. Throughout his civil rights career, King frequented several soul food restaurants where he ate and met with other local and national civil rights leaders. After King's assassination, riots broke out in Washington D.C., and the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Stokely Carmichael, asked the owner of Ben's Chili Bowl restaurant to remain open to provide food for police officers, student activists, and firefighters as they worked together to stop the riot. Authors Hoekstra and Khan said in their book, \"The People's Place: Soul Food Restaurants and Reminiscences from the Civil Rights Era to Today\", that soul food restaurants served as places to bring communities and families together in times of trouble during the Jim Crow era and helped in the fight against segregation laws by allowing white and Black people to eat together.\nIn Montgomery, Alabama, civil rights protestors convened and organized for the movement at soul food restaurants because they provided a safe haven and a place to eat and relax. Martha's Place and Chris' Hotdogs were visited by protestors. During this period of activism, Jereline and Larry James Bethune, the owners of the restaurant Brenda's BBQ, also in Montgomery, taught African Americans how to register to vote and how to read a ballot when Jim Crow laws and literacy tests prevented Black people from voting. Civil rights activists frequented the restaurant for moral and financial support. The owners also helped to print out fliers for the movement and allowed protestors to have secret meetings in the back of the restaurant.\nAtlanta's oldest black-owned restaurant, the Evelyn Jones Cafe, was founded in 1936 by Evelyn Jones and her sister. In the mid-1940s, Evelyn and her husband, Luther Frazier, enlarged the restaurant and renamed it Frazier's Cafe Society. It is located at 880 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (then known as West Hunter Street). The Jones family challenged Jim Crow laws when they allowed whites and blacks to eat together. It was the first interracial restaurant on West Hunter Street. The cafe also served as a location for civil rights leaders to meet. The foods the restaurant served were Virginia baked ham, pork chop dinner, jumbo shrimp, roast beef, and other classic Southern dishes. Club from Nowhere was a black-owned soul food restaurant that opened in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, operated by civil rights activist Georgia Gilmore. Gilmore's fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, stuffed pork chops, stuffed peppers, and coleslaw were popular among her black and white customers. These were dishes she learned how to make from the women in her family. Gilmore's restaurant provided food for civil rights leaders during the Montgomery bus boycott, and her soul food was a favorite among Martin Luther King Jr. Several soul food restaurants served black and white people before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made segregated facilities illegal.\nDuring the Jim Crow era in the 20th century, it was not safe for Black Americans to travel on the road as they faced possible violence from white supremacists. Black people needed to know what places were safe to stop for food, gas, and motels. In 1936, an African American postal worker from Harlem, New York, named Victor Hugo Green created \"The Green Book\" for Black people to travel safely in the Southern United States, where Jim Crow laws were widespread. Several soul food restaurants were listed in the book because they were safe havens for African Americans to eat. One restaurant listed in the Green Book was Swett's, which opened in 1954.\nThe Black Church (African-American churches) played a key role in Black communities as they provided food and a place of worship. Researchers from PBS said: \"Religion played a key role in the proliferation of soul food, as well as the diversification of the cuisine. Black churches, crucial during slavery and in the Civil Rights movement, were also crucial as gathering places, where Black communities could eat and rejoice over plates of chicken and dumplings, black-eyed peas and rice, red drinks, and the classic Black American church dish, fried catfish and spaghetti\". Chris Carter is an African American pastor and professor of history who published a book about the Black Church and soul food in 2021 titled, \"The Spirit of Soul Food: Race, Faith, and Food Justice\". According to Carter, soul food in the African-American community is food that fights injustices centered around the lack of access to food, as some Black Americans live in poverty and Black churches on Sundays and during the week prepare meals to feed their community.\nSince the mid-20th century, many cookbooks highlighting soul food and African-American foodways have been compiled and published. One notable soul food chef is celebrated traditional Southern chef and author Edna Lewis, who released a series of books between 1972 and 2003, including \"A Taste of Country Cooking\" in which she weaves stories of her childhood in Freetown, Virginia into her recipes for \"real Southern food\".\nAnother early and influential soul food cookbook is Vertamae Grosvenor's \"Vibration Cooking, or the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl\", originally published in 1970, focused on South Carolina Lowcountry/Geechee/Gullah cooking. Its focus on spontaneity in the kitchen\u2014cooking by \"vibration\" rather than precisely measuring ingredients, as well as \"making do\" with ingredients on hand\u2014captured the essence of traditional African-American cooking techniques. The simple, healthful, basic ingredients of lowcountry cuisine, like shrimp, oysters, crab, fresh produce, rice, and sweet potatoes, made it a bestseller.\nUsher boards and Women's Day committees of various religious congregations large and small, and even public service and social welfare organizations such as the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) have produced cookbooks to fund their operations and charitable enterprises. The NCNW produced its first cookbook, \"The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro\", in 1958, and revived the practice in 1993, producing a popular series of cookbooks featuring recipes by famous Black Americans, among them: \"The Black Family Reunion Cookbook\" (1991), \"Celebrating Our Mothers' Kitchens: Treasured Memories and Tested Recipes\" (1994), and \"Mother Africa's Table: A Chronicle of Celebration\" (1998). The NCNW also recently reissued \"The Historical Cookbook\".\nThe Special Collections at the University of Alabama has the largest collection of over 450 African-American cookbooks. Kate Matheney, a librarian at the University of Alabama, studied the history of African-American cookbooks and found that several Black cookbooks were authored by white women. As they were the primary cooks in plantation houses, enslaved Africans in Alabama influenced the foodways of whites there. During the Jim Crow era, African American women worked in the homes of white families as domestics and prepared their meals. Some white women authored Black cookbooks using stereotypical images of black women as Mammies on the cover of cookbooks to better market the recipes they learned from black cooks to audiences. African Americans authored their cookbooks using non-stereotypical images and added recipes they learned from their family.\nIn 2011, culinary historian Jessica B. Harris published a book titled, \"High on the Hog\" that describes the origins and development of African-American dishes and their roots in Sub-Saharan Africa. Enslaved and free African Americans incorporated indigenous foods from North America such as plants, fruits, and animals but Africanized the foods by preparing and flavoring their dishes similarly to West and Central Africans. Harris' book later became a docuseries in 2021 on Netflix called \"\".\nIn 2018 African American author and culinary historian Michael Twitty published \"The Cooking Gene: A Journey Through African American Culinary History in the Old South\" about the history, development, and evolution of soul food in Black communities in the Southern United States.\nGullah Geechee chef Emily Meggett was born on Edisto Island, South Carolina in 1922. Meggett learned how to farm and cook from her family and published a book about Gullah cuisine in 2022 titled, \"Gullah Geechee Home Cooking: Recipes from the Matriarch of Edisto Island\".\nIn 2024, Lakisha Harris became the first Black woman in the United States to present a presentation on soul food at the American Culinary Federation (ACF) National Convention titled, \"Culinary Freedom of the Soul\".\nGullah Geechee chef Benjamin Dennis IV, born in Charleston, South Carolina, teaches about Gullah and African-American cuisine's origins in West African cuisine and its influence on American foodways.\nProfessional chef Mashama Bailey cooks a fusion of foods derived from the African diaspora with Old World and New World cuisine (of the Southern United States) at \"The Grey\" restaurant in Savannah, Georgia. Bailey learned how to cook soul food from her mother and attended the Institute of Culinary Education; she then traveled to Burgundy, France, where she trained under French chefs. Bailey blends Gullah Geechee cuisine with other cuisines of the African diaspora and continues to educate the public about African-American food culture.\nAshleigh Shanti is an Affrilachian chef who owns the restaurant \"Good Hot Fish\" in Asheville, North Carolina. She opened a restaurant with a focus on Black Appalachian cuisine and culture. She said \"A big part of why I fell in love with the restaurant industry was watching the women in my family and the power they had serving simple, humble food. I thought it was incredible: how their food could transform someone's mood, making them happy, making them cry.\"\nAfrican American chef Carla Hall, author of the cookbook \"Carla Hall's Soul Food: Everyday and Celebration\", is a television personality and the culinary ambassador to the National Museum of African American History and Culture Sweet Home Cafe in Washington, D.C. Hall has Yoruba ancestors from Nigeria, West Africa, and Bubi ancestors from Equatorial Guinea in Central Africa.\nAfrican influence.\nScholars have found substantial African influence in soul food recipes, especially from the West and Central regions of Africa. This influence can be seen in the heat level of many soul food dishes, as well as many ingredients used to prepare them. Peppers used to add spice to food include malagueta pepper, as well as variants native to the Western Hemisphere such as red (cayenne) peppers. Several foods essential to Southern cuisine and soul food were domesticated or consumed in the African savannah and the tropical regions of West and Central Africa. The foods brought from Africa to North America include gherkin, cantaloupe, eggplant, kola nuts, watermelon, pigeon peas, black-eyed peas, okra, sorghum, and guinea pepper.\nA species of rice, \"Oryza glaberrima\" was domesticated in Africa, and many people brought to the Americas preserved rice cooking techniques. Rice was a cash crop in the South Carolina Lowcountry, and during the slave trade, Europeans selected coastal inhabitants of West Africa who had knowledge of rice cultivation. Rice is a staple side dish in the Lowcountry region and in Louisiana. It is a main ingredient in dishes such as jambalaya and red beans and rice, popular in Southern Louisiana. Recipes for rice and beans developed in West Africa were brought to the South Carolina Lowcountry by enslaved Africans and continue to be prepared by their descendants, the Gullah people. A Gullah dish of rice, black-eyed peas, onions, and bacon is Hoppin' John. Food historian Jessica B. Harris traces this dish to a Senegalese food called \"Chiebou niebe\", made with rice and beef. Enslaved Black Americans in the United States thus created new dishes with origins in West Africa but using North American ingredients. A Gullah New Year tradition is eating Hoppin' John to bring in good luck. Customarily eaten on January 1 throughout the Lowcountry region, it is often paired with cornbread and collard greens, which are also said to bring prosperity.\nCharleston red rice is made with rice and tomato paste. This dish originated from jollof rice in West Africa, which is made with a tomato product giving the rice its red color. In the Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia, enslaved Gullah Geechee people's main source of food was rice paired with meats and shellfish. These rice cooking techniques, influenced by rice dishes made in West Africa, are practiced today in Gullah communities.\nThere are many documented parallels between the foodways of West Africans and soul food recipes. The consumption of sweet potatoes in the United States echoes the consumption of yams in West Africa. The presence of cornbread on African-American tables is analogous to West African use of fufu to soak up sauces and stews.\nHarris starred in the 2021 docuseries \"\" and traveled to Benin, West Africa, where she saw women making a leafy sauce called \"feuille\", prepared similarly to how African Americans cook collard greens.\nWest Africans also cooked meat over open pits and brought their methods of barbecuing and making barbecue sauce to the Americas. The Hausa word for barbecue is \"babbake\". Indigenous peoples in North America also barbecued their meats. African Americans use African and Native American techniques of barbecue.\nIt was not uncommon to see food served out of an empty gourd. Many techniques to change the overall flavor of staple food items such as nuts, seeds, and rice contributed to added dimensions of evolving flavors. These techniques included roasting, frying with palm oil, baking in ashes, and steaming in leaves such as banana leaf.\nNative American influence.\nSoutheastern Native American culture is an important element of Southern cuisine. From their cultures came one of the main staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize), either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make hominy, in a Native American process known as nixtamalization. Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes, from the familiar cornbread and grits to liquors such as moonshine and whiskey (which are still important to the Southern economy). Black Americans in Tuskegee, Alabama combined molasses and leftover cooked grease, a combination they called \"sap\", to pour over their cornbread and \"hoe cakes\". An additional Native American influence in soul food is the use of maple syrup. Indigenous people used maple syrup to sweeten and add flavor to dishes; this influenced the foodways of African Americans as they used maple syrup to sweeten their dishes and poured syrup over pancakes and other breakfast foods.\nThe foods of Black Seminoles in Florida and Oklahoma are influenced by Gullah rice and bean dishes and Seminole foodways. Black Seminoles cooked rice, \"sometimes applying a sauce of okra or spinach leaves\". Historian Ray Von Robertson conducted oral interviews with sixteen Black Seminoles from 2006 and 2007 and found that Seminole cultural influences were incorporated into their daily lives in practices such as foodways and herbal medicine. Black Seminoles cooked and ate fry bread, \"sofkee\", and grape dumplings.\nMany fruits are available in this region: blackberries, muscadines, raspberries, and many other wild berries were part of Southern Native Americans' diets as well.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Native Americans of the southeastern U.S.A live on today is the \"soul food\" eaten by both Black and White Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten: Sofkee lives on as grits; cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks; Indian fritters -- variously known as \"hoe cake\" or \"Johnny cake\"; Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as \"corn meal dumplings\" and \"hush puppies\"; Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Native tribes; and, like the Native Americans, Southerners cured their meats and smoked it over hickory coals...\u2014\u200aAfrican, European, and Native Americans of the American South supplemented their diets with meats derived from the hunting of native game. What meats people ate depended on seasonal availability and geographical region. Common game included opossums, rabbits, and squirrels.\nSauces and seasoning.\nSince the mid-20th century, Black Americans have seasoned cooked meats and vegetables with Lawry's Seasoned Salt. Because Lawry's is economical and offers multiple herbs and spices in one product, Black Americans use it in most of their dishes except sweet dishes. For extra flavor and spice, hot sauce is sprinkled over fried chicken and fish, collard greens, and other cooked foods. West Africans made variations of hot spicy sauces using hot peppers indigenous to the region. After their enslavement and transportation to the southern United States, they continued to make their own versions of hot sauces using spices and peppers from North America. By the mid-20th century, Black Americans were turning to store-bought hot sauces to add flavor and spice to their food. During slavery times, enslaved people had flavored their vegetables with bacon grease or other parts of the pig. This tradition continues today with Black families using pig feet, bacon grease, or turkey necks to flavor collard and turnip greens.\nCulinary historian Michael Twitty, thinks enslaved African Americans likely influenced the creation of Old Bay Seasoning, saying, \"It's not that African Americans necessarily invented it, but without us, the story is impossible.\" In his travels to West Africa, Twitty observed how West Africans always add peppers, salt, and a hot condiment to their seafood dishes. Twitty believes enslaved West Africans were probably the first to put \"kitchen pepper\" on shellfish. In colonial America, kitchen pepper was a common kitchen spice blend that often included nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, ginger, black pepper, and mace. He notes that \"there's always a peppery, salty kind of thing that you eat crustaceans with. It's always with a hot condiment\u2014it's never just plain.\" Twitty believes that hundreds of years of cooking shellfish with kitchen pepper developed into the crab spice blends common in the Chesapeake Bay area when Gustav Brunn came to Baltimore.\nThe founder of the Old Bay Seasoning company, Gustuv Brunn was a German Jewish immigrant who came to the United States in the 1930s with his family to flee Adolf Hitler's ascent to power. After Brunn arrived in Baltimore, he created his own seafood seasoning blend influenced by local seasoning recipes and called it \"Delicious Brand Shrimp and Crab Seasoning\", but it was not popular with the locals. Brunn changed the name to Old Bay and sold a few pounds of Old Bay to a nearby seafood wholesaler. Word spread and over time it became a popular seasoning. Seafood dishes in soul food cuisine today will have Old Bay as the primary seasoning combined with other herbs and sauces to add robust flavor.\nCultural relevance.\nSoul food originated in the southern region of the US and is consumed by African-Americans across the nation. Traditional soul food cooking is seen as one of the ways enslaved Africans passed their traditions to their descendants once they were brought to the US. It is a cultural creation stemming from slavery and Native American and European influences.\nSoul food recipes are popular in the South due to the accessibility and affordability of the ingredients. Scholars have said that while white Americans provided the material supplies for soul food dishes, the cooking techniques found in many of the dishes have been visibly influenced by the enslaved Africans themselves.\nThe bountiful vegetables found in Africa were substituted in dishes down south with new leafy greens consisting of dandelion, turnip, and beet greens. Pork, more specifically hog, was introduced into several dishes in the form of cracklins from the skin, pigs' feet, chitterlings, and lard used to increase the fat intake into vegetable dishes. Spices such as thyme, and bay leaf blended with onion and garlic gave dishes their own characteristics.\nRed drinks are common at African American social functions. Restaurants with a mostly black clientele typically serve at least one red drink. Red drinks are important in soul food culture because they represent social connections between friends and family, and a link with the African diaspora. Newbell Puckett, a southern sociologist who documented African American folk beliefs in his 1926 study, \"Folk Beliefs of the Southern Negro\", said that there was cultural and historical continuity between African American culture and West African societies where red had been an important ritual and royal color for hundreds of years. There were two notable red drinks in West Africa, kola tea and hibiscus tea, by the time the Atlantic slave trade began. Kola tea was made from the nuts of West African trees, especially \"Cola nitida\". Tea made from the dried red flowers of the hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa), a plant related to okra, is used to make a tea called \"bissap\", from the French \"jus de bissap\". It is popular in Senegal and Gambia. \"Bissap\" was called sorrel tea or red sorrel in the Americas.\nFigures such as LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), Elijah Muhammad, and Dick Gregory played notable roles in shaping the conversation around soul food. Muhammad and Gregory opposed soul food because they felt it was unhealthy and was slowly killing African-Americans. They saw soul food as a remnant of oppression and felt it should be left behind. Many African-Americans were offended by the Nation of Islam's rejection of pork as it is a staple ingredient used to flavor many dishes.\nStokely Carmichael also spoke out against soul food, claiming that it was not true African food due to its colonial and European influence. Many voices in the Black Power Movement saw soul food as something African-Americans should take pride in and used it to distinguish African-Americans from white Americans. Proponents of soul food embraced the concept and used it as a counterclaim to the argument that African-Americans had no culture or cuisine.\nSoul food spread throughout the United States when African-Americans from the South moved to major cities across the country such as Chicago and New York City during the Great Migration. They brought with them the foods and traditions of the Southern United States, where they had been enslaved. Later, the magazine \"Ebony Jr!\" was important in transmitting the cultural relevance of soul food dishes to middle-class African-American children who typically ate a more standard American diet. Today Soul food is frequently found at religious rituals and social events such as funerals, fellowship, Thanksgiving, and Christmas in the black community.\nSoul food is culturally similar to Romani cuisine in Europe.\nHealth concerns.\nSoul food prepared traditionally and consumed in large amounts can be detrimental to one's health. Opponents of eating soul food have been vocal about health concerns surrounding the culinary traditions since the name was coined in the mid-20th century.\nSoul food has been criticized for its high starch, fat, sodium, cholesterol, and caloric content, as well as the inexpensive and often low-quality nature of the ingredients such as salted pork and cornmeal. In light of this, soul food has been implicated by some in the disproportionately high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension), type 2 diabetes, clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), stroke, and heart attack suffered by African-Americans. Figures who led discussions surrounding the negative impacts of soul food include Dr. Alvenia Fulton, Dick Gregory, and Elijah Muhammad.\nOn the other hand, critics and traditionalists have argued that attempts to make soul food healthier also make it less tasty, as well as less culturally/ethnically authentic. There is also often a foundational difference in how health is perceived; perceptions of healthiness by consumers of soul food may differ from normal understandings in American culture.\nThe nutritional value of most processed foods, and not just those implicated in a traditional perception of soul food, has degraded as the agricultural system in the United States became industrialized, fueled by federal subsidies. This urges a consideration of how concepts of racial authenticity evolve alongside changes in the structures that make some foods more available and accessible than others.\nAn important aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard. Because many cooks could not afford to buy new shortening to replace what they used, they would pour the liquefied cooking grease into a container. After cooling completely, the grease re-solidified and could be used again the next time the cook required lard. With changing fashions and perceptions of healthy eating, some cooks may use preparation methods that differ from those of cooks who came before them: using liquid oil like vegetable oil or canola oil for frying and cooking, and using smoked turkey instead of pork, for example. Changes in hog farming techniques have also resulted in drastically leaner pork, in the late 20th and 21st centuries. Some cooks have even adapted recipes to include vegetarian alternatives to traditional ingredients, including tofu and soy-based analogues. Several Black chefs have opened vegan soul food restaurants to cook healthier foods rooted in African American culture. Others, such as Jenne Claiborne, author of the \"Sweet Potato Soul Cookbook\", have started a YouTube channel and show people how to prepare healthier soul food.\nSeveral of the ingredients included in soul food recipes have pronounced health benefits. Collard and other greens are rich sources of several vitamins (including vitamin A, B6, folic acid or vitamin B9, vitamin K, and C), minerals (manganese, iron, and calcium), fiber, and small amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. They also contain a number of phytonutrients, which are thought to play a role in the prevention of ovarian and breast cancers.\nThe traditional preparation of soul food vegetables often consists of high temperatures or slow cooking methods, which can lead the water-soluble vitamins (e.g., Vitamin C and the B complex vitamins) to be destroyed or leached out into the water in which the greens are cooked. This water is often consumed and is known as pot liquor. Because it contains micronutrients from the greens cooked in it, pot liquor contributes to the nutritional value of a meal when consumed. Peas and legumes are inexpensive sources of protein, and they also contain important vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sforza rule began with the family's acquisition of the Duchy of Milan following the extinction of the Visconti family in the mid-15th century and ended with the death of the last member of the family's main branch, Francesco II Sforza, in 1535.\nHistory.\nThe first son of Muzio Attendolo Sforza, Francesco I Sforza, married Bianca Maria Visconti (1425\u20131468) in 1441. She was the daughter and only heir of the last Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti. He thus acquired the title of Duke of Milan (1450\u20131466), ruled Milan for 16 years, and made the Sforzas the heirs of the house of Visconti.\nThe family also held the seigniory of Pesaro, starting with Muzio Attendolo's second son, Alessandro (1409\u20131473). The Sforza held Pesaro until 1512, after the death of Costanzo II Sforza.\nMuzio's third son, Bosio (1411\u20131476), founded the branch of Santa Fiora, who held the title of count of Cotignola; the Sforza ruled the small county of Santa Fiora in southern Tuscany until 1624. Members of this family also held important ecclesiastical and political positions in the Papal States, and moved to Rome in 1674, taking the name of Sforza Cesarini.\nThe Sforza became allied with the Borgia family through the arranged marriage (1493\u20131497) between Lucrezia Borgia and Giovanni (the illegitimate son of Costanzo I of Pesaro). This alliance failed, as the Borgia family annulled the marriage once the Sforza family were no longer needed.\nIn 1499, in the course of the Italian Wars, the army of Louis XII of France took Milan from Ludovico Sforza (known as \"Ludovico il Moro\", famous for taking Leonardo da Vinci into his service).\nAfter Imperial German troops drove out the French, Maximilian Sforza, son of Ludovico, became Duke of Milan (1512\u20131515) until the French returned under Francis I of France and imprisoned him.\nIn 1521 Charles V drove out the French and restored the younger son of Ludovico, Francesco II Sforza to the duchy. Francesco remained the ruler of Milan until his death in 1535 and as he was childless the Duchy reverted to the Emperor, who passed it to his son Philip II in 1540, thus beginning the period of Spanish rule in Milan.\nCastellini Baldissera.\nWhile the House of Sforza has died out over the last century, it is closely related to the Castellini Baldissera family, who inherited a number of their palazzos and estates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27915", "revid": "7770027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27915", "title": "Septuagint", "text": "Greek translation of Hebrew scriptures\nThe Septuagint ( ), sometimes referred to as the Greek Old Testament or The Translation of the Seventy (), and abbreviated as LXX, is the earliest extant Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible from the original Biblical Hebrew. The full Greek title derives from the story recorded in the Letter of Aristeas to Philocrates that \"the laws of the Jews\" were translated into the Greek language at the request of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285\u2013247 BC) by seventy-two Hebrew translators\u2014six from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel\u2014though this story is considered to be pseudepigraphical by some scholars.\nBiblical scholars agree that the first five books of the Hebrew Bible were translated from Biblical Hebrew into Koine Greek by Jews living in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, centred on the large community in Alexandria, probably in the early or middle part of the 3rd century BC. The remaining books were presumably translated in the 2nd century BC. Some targums translating or paraphrasing the Bible into Aramaic were also made during the Second Temple period.\nFew people could speak and even fewer could read in the Hebrew language during the Second Temple period; Koine Greek and Aramaic were the lingua francas at that time among the Jewish community. The Septuagint, therefore, satisfied a need in the Jewish community.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Septuagint\" is derived from the Latin phrase (\"The Old Testament from the version of the Seventy Translators\"). This phrase in turn was derived from the . It was not until the time of Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430\u00a0AD) that the Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures was called by the Latin term . The Roman numeral LXX (seventy) is commonly used as an abbreviation, in addition to formula_1 or \"G\".\nComposition.\nJewish legend.\nAccording to tradition, Ptolemy II Philadelphus (the Greek Pharaoh of Egypt) sent seventy-two Hebrew translators\u2014six from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel\u2014from Jerusalem to Alexandria to translate the \"Tanakh\" from Biblical Hebrew into Koine Greek, for inclusion in his library. This narrative is found in the possibly pseudepigraphic Letter of Aristeas to his brother Philocrates, and is repeated by Philo of Alexandria, Josephus (in \"Antiquities of the Jews\"), and by later sources (including Augustine of Hippo). It is also found in the Tractate Megillah of the Babylonian Talmud:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;King Ptolemy once gathered 72 Elders. He placed them in 72 chambers, each of them in a separate one, without revealing to them why they were summoned. He entered each one's room and said: \"Write for me the Torah of Moshe, your teacher\". God put it in the heart of each one to translate identically as all the others did.\nPhilo of Alexandria writes that the number of scholars was chosen by selecting six scholars from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Caution is needed here regarding the accuracy of this statement by Philo of Alexandria, as it implies that the twelve tribes were still in existence during King Ptolemy's reign, and that the Ten Lost Tribes of the twelve tribes had not been forcibly resettled by Assyria almost 500 years previously. Although not all the people of the ten tribes were scattered, many peoples of the ten tribes sought refuge in Jerusalem and survived, preserving a remnant of each tribe and their lineages. Jerusalem swelled to five times its prior population due to the influx of refugees. According to later rabbinic tradition (which considered the Greek translation as a distortion of sacred text and unsuitable for use in the synagogue), the Septuagint was given to Ptolemy two days before the annual Tenth of Tevet fast.\nAccording to Aristobulus of Alexandria's fragment 3, portions of the Law were translated from Hebrew into Greek long before the well-known Septuagint version. He stated that Plato and Pythagoras knew the Jewish Law and borrowed from it.\nIn the preface to his 1844 translation of the Septuagint, Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton acknowledges that the Jews of Alexandria were likely to have been the writers of the Septuagint, but dismisses Aristeas' account as a pious fiction. Instead, he asserts that the real origin of the name \"Septuagint\" pertains to the fact that the earliest version was forwarded by the authors to the Jewish Sanhedrin at Alexandria for editing and approval.\nThe Jews of Alexandria celebrated the translation with an annual festival on the island of Pharos, where the Lighthouse of Alexandria stood\u2014the location where the translation was said to have taken place. During the festival, a large gathering of Jews, along with some non-Jewish visitors, would assemble on the beach for a grand picnic.\nHistory.\nThe dating of the translation of the Pentateuch to the 3rd century BC is supported by a number of factors, including its Greek being representative of early Koine Greek, citations beginning as early as the 2nd century BC, and early manuscripts datable to the 2nd century BC. After the Torah, other books were translated over the next two to three centuries. It is unclear which was translated when, or where; some may have been translated twice (into different versions), and then revised. The quality and style of the translators varied considerably from book to book, from a literal translation to paraphrasing to an interpretative style.\nThe translation process of the Septuagint and from the Septuagint into other versions can be divided into several stages: the Greek text was produced within the social environment of Hellenistic Judaism, and completed by 132\u00a0BC. With the spread of Early Christianity, this Septuagint in turn was rendered into Latin in a variety of versions and the latter, collectively known as the \"\", were also referred to as the Septuagint initially in Alexandria but elsewhere as well. The Septuagint also formed the basis for the Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian, and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.\nLanguage.\nThe Septuagint is written in Koine Greek. Some sections contain Semiticisms, which are idioms and phrases based on Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Aramaic. Other books, such as Daniel and Proverbs, have a stronger Greek influence.\nThe Septuagint may also clarify pronunciation of pre-Masoretic Hebrew; many proper nouns are spelled with Greek vowels in the translation, but contemporary Hebrew texts lacked vowel pointing. However, it is unlikely that all Biblical Hebrew sounds had precise Greek equivalents.\nCanonical differences.\nThe Septuagint does not consist of a single, unified corpus. Rather, it is a collection of ancient translations of the \"Tanakh\", along with other Jewish texts that are now commonly referred to as apocrypha. Importantly, the canon of the Hebrew Bible was evolving over the century or so in which the Septuagint was being written. Also, the texts were translated by many different people, in different locations, at different times, for different purposes, and often from different original Hebrew manuscripts.\nThe Hebrew Bible, also called the \"Tanakh\", has three parts: the \"Torah\" (\"Law\"), the \"Nevi'im\" (\"Prophets\"), and the \"Ketuvim\" (\"Writings\"). The Septuagint has four: law, history, poetry, and prophets. The books of the Apocrypha were inserted at appropriate locations. Extant copies of the Septuagint, which date from the 4th century AD, contain books and additions not present in the Hebrew Bible as established in the Jewish canon and are not uniform in their contents. These copies of the Septuagint include books known as \"anagignoskomena\" in Greek and in English as deuterocanon (derived from the Greek words for \"second canon\"), books not included in the modern Jewish canon. These books are estimated to have been written between 200\u00a0BC and 50\u00a0AD. Among them are the first two books of Maccabees; Tobit; Judith; the Wisdom of Solomon; Sirach; Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremiah), and additions to Esther and Daniel. The Septuagint version of some books, such as Daniel and Esther, are longer than those in the Masoretic Text, which were affirmed as canonical in Rabbinic Judaism. The Septuagint Book of Jeremiah is shorter than the Masoretic Text. The Psalms of Solomon, 1 Esdras, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, the Letter of Jeremiah, the Book of Odes, the Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 are included in some copies of the Septuagint.\nThe Septuagint has been rejected as scriptural by mainstream Rabbinic Judaism for a couple of reasons. First, the Septuagint differs from the Hebrew source texts in many cases (particularly in the Book of Job). For example, according to Heinrich Guggenheimer, intentional mistranslations in Deuteronomy 6 make reference to ancient sources of the Passover Haggadah. Second, the translations appear at times to demonstrate an ignorance of Hebrew idiomatic usage. A particularly noteworthy example of this phenomenon is found in , in which the Hebrew word &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4\u200e (, which translates into English as \"young woman\") is translated into the Koine Greek as (, which translates into English as \"virgin\").\nThe Septuagint became synonymous with the Greek Old Testament, a Christian canon incorporating the books of the Hebrew canon with additional texts. Although the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church include most of the books in the Septuagint in their canons, Protestant churches usually do not. After the Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts (which came to be called the Apocrypha) as noncanonical. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible.\nFinal form.\nAll the books in Western Old Testament biblical canons are found in the Septuagint, although the order does not always coincide with the Western book order. The Septuagint order is evident in the earliest Christian Bibles, which were written during the 4th century.\nSome books which are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. The Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are one four-part book entitled (Basileon, 'Of Reigns') in the Septuagint. The Books of Chronicles, known collectively as \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd (Paraleipom\u00e9non, 'Of Things Left Out') supplement Reigns. The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets in its twelve-part Book of Twelve, as does the Masoretic Text.\nSome ancient scriptures are found in the Septuagint, but not in the Hebrew Bible. The books are Tobit; Judith; the Wisdom of Solomon; Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach; Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah, which became chapter six of Baruch in the Vulgate; the additions to Daniel (The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of the Three Children, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon); the additions to Esther; 1 Maccabees; 2 Maccabees; 3 Maccabees; 4 Maccabees; 1 Esdras; Odes (including the Prayer of Manasseh); the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.\nFragments of deuterocanonical books in Hebrew are among the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran. Sirach, whose text in Hebrew was already known from the Cairo Geniza, has been found in two scrolls (2QSir or 2Q18, 11QPs_a or 11Q5) in Hebrew. Another Hebrew scroll of Sirach has been found in Masada (MasSir). Five fragments from the Book of Tobit have been found in Qumran: four written in Aramaic and one written in Hebrew (papyri 4Q, nos. 196-200). Psalm 151 appears with a number of canonical and non-canonical psalms in the Dead Sea scroll 11QPs(a) (also known as 11Q5), a 1st-century AD scroll discovered in 1956. The scroll contains two short Hebrew psalms, which scholars agree were the basis for Psalm 151. The canonical acceptance of these books varies by Christian tradition.\nUse.\nJewish use.\nIt is unclear to what extent Alexandrian Jews accepted the authority of the Septuagint. Manuscripts of the Septuagint have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, and were thought to have been in use among various Jewish sects at the time.\nSeveral factors led most Jews to abandon the Septuagint around the 2nd century AD. The earliest gentile Christians used the Septuagint out of necessity, since it was the only Greek version of the Bible and most (if not all) of these early non-Jewish Christians could not read Hebrew. The association of the Septuagint with a rival religion may have made it suspect in the eyes of the newer generation of Jews and Jewish scholars. Jews instead used Hebrew or Aramaic Targum manuscripts later compiled by the Masoretes and authoritative Aramaic translations, such as those of Onkelos and Rabbi Yonathan ben Uziel.\nPerhaps most significant for the Septuagint, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the Septuagint began to lose Jewish sanction after differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered. Even Greek-speaking Jews tended to prefer other Jewish versions in Greek (such as the translation by Aquila), which seemed to be more concordant with contemporary Hebrew texts.\nChristian use.\nThe Early Christian church used the Greek texts, since Greek was a \"lingua franca\" of the eastern parts of the Roman Empire at the time and the language of the Greco-Roman Church, while Aramaic was the language of Syriac Christianity. The relationship between the apostolic use of the Septuagint and the Hebrew texts is complicated. Although the Septuagint seems to have been a major source for the Apostles, it is not the only one. St. Jerome offered, for example, and , John 19:37, John 7:38, and 1 Corinthians 2:9 as examples found in Hebrew texts but not in the Septuagint. Matthew 2:23 is not present in current Masoretic tradition either; according to Jerome, however, it was in . The New Testament writers freely used the Greek translation when citing the Jewish scriptures (or quoting Jesus doing so), implying that Jesus, his apostles, and their followers considered it reliable.\nIn the early Christian Church, the presumption that the Septuagint was translated by Jews before the time of Christ and that it lends itself more to a Christological interpretation than 2nd-century Hebrew texts in certain places was taken as evidence that \"Jews\" had changed the Hebrew text in a way that made it less Christological. Irenaeus writes about that the Septuagint clearly identifies a \"virgin\" (Greek \"\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\"; \"bethulah\" in Hebrew) who would conceive. The word \"almah\" in the Hebrew text was, according to Irenaeus, interpreted by Theodotion and Aquila (Jewish converts), as a \"young woman\" who would conceive. Again according to Irenaeus, the Ebionites used this to claim that Joseph was the biological father of Jesus. To him that was heresy facilitated by late anti-Christian alterations of the scripture in Hebrew, as evident by the older, pre-Christian Septuagint.\nJerome broke with church tradition, translating most of the Old Testament of his Vulgate from Hebrew rather than Greek. His choice was sharply criticized by Augustine, his contemporary. Although Jerome argued for the superiority of the Hebrew texts in correcting the Septuagint on philological and theological grounds, because he was accused of heresy he also acknowledged the Septuagint texts. Acceptance of Jerome's version increased, and it displaced the Septuagint's Old Latin translations.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church prefers to use the Septuagint as the basis for translating the Old Testament into other languages, and uses the untranslated Septuagint where Greek is the liturgical language.\nCritical translations of the Old Testament which use the Masoretic Text as their basis consult the Septuagint and other versions to reconstruct the meaning of the Hebrew text when it is unclear, corrupted, or ambiguous. According to the New Jerusalem Bible foreword, \"Only when this (the Masoretic Text) presents insuperable difficulties have emendations or other versions, such as the [...] LXX, been used.\" The translator's preface to the New International Version reads, \"The translators also consulted the more important early versions (including) the Septuagint [...] Readings from these versions were occasionally followed where the MT seemed doubtful\"\nTextual history.\nTextual analysis.\nModern scholarship holds that the Septuagint was written from the 3rd through the 1st centuries BC, but nearly all attempts at dating specific books (except for the Pentateuch, early- to mid-3rd century\u00a0BC) are tentative. Later Jewish revisions and recensions of the Greek against the Hebrew are well-attested. The best-known are Aquila (128\u00a0AD), Symmachus, and Theodotion. These three, to varying degrees, are more-literal renderings of their contemporary Hebrew scriptures compared to the Old Greek (the original Septuagint). Modern scholars consider one (or more) of the three to be new Greek versions of the Hebrew Bible.\nAlthough much of Origen's \"Hexapla\" (a six-version critical edition of the Hebrew Bible) is lost, several compilations of fragments are available. Origen kept a column for the Old Greek (the Septuagint), which included readings from all the Greek versions in a critical apparatus with diacritical marks indicating to which version each line (Gr. \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2) belonged. Perhaps the \"Hexapla\" was never copied in its entirety, but Origen's combined text was copied frequently (eventually without the editing marks) and the older uncombined text of the Septuagint was neglected. The combined text was the first major Christian recension of the Septuagint, often called the \"Hexaplar recension\". Two other major recensions were identified in the century following Origen by Jerome, who attributed these to Lucian (the Lucianic, or Antiochene, recension) and (the Hesychian, or Alexandrian, recension).\nManuscripts.\nThe oldest manuscripts of the Septuagint include 2nd-century BC fragments of Leviticus and Deuteronomy (Rahlfs nos. 801, 819, and 957) and 1st-century BC fragments of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and the Twelve Minor Prophets (Alfred Rahlfs nos. 802, 803, 805, 848, 942, and 943). Relatively-complete manuscripts of the Septuagint postdate the Hexaplar recension, and include the 4th-century AD Codex Vaticanus and the 5th-century Codex Alexandrinus. These are the oldest-surviving nearly-complete manuscripts of the Old Testament in any language; the oldest extant complete Hebrew texts date to about 600 years later, from the first half of the 10th century. The 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus also partially survives, with many Old Testament texts. The Jewish (and, later, Christian) revisions and recensions are largely responsible for the divergence of the codices. The Codex Marchalianus is another notable manuscript.\nDifferences from the Vulgate and the Masoretic Text.\nThe text of the Septuagint is generally close to that of the Masoretes and Vulgate. Genesis 4:1\u20136 is identical in the Septuagint, Vulgate and the Masoretic Text, and Genesis 4:8 to the end of the chapter is the same. There is only one noticeable difference in that chapter, at , reflecting an issue of interpretation also highlighted by the Jewish \"Tanna\" Issi ben Judah:\nThe differences between the Septuagint and the MT fall into four categories:\nDead Sea Scrolls.\nThe Biblical manuscripts found in Qumran, commonly known as the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), have prompted comparisons of the texts associated with the Hebrew Bible (including the Septuagint). Emanuel Tov, editor of the translated scrolls, identifies five broad variants of DSS texts:\nThe textual sources present a variety of readings; Bastiaan Van Elderen compares three variations of Deuteronomy 32:43, the Song of Moses:\nPrint editions.\nThe text of all print editions is derived from the recensions of Origen, Lucian, or Hesychius:\nOnomastics.\nOne of the main challenges, faced by translators during their work, emanated from the need to implement appropriate Greek forms for various onomastic terms, used in the Hebrew Bible. Most onomastic terms (toponyms, anthroponyms) of the Hebrew Bible were rendered by corresponding Greek terms that were similar in form and sounding, with some notable exceptions.\nOne of those exceptions was related to a specific group of onomastic terms for the region of Aram and ancient Arameans. Influenced by Greek onomastic terminology, translators decided to adopt Greek custom of using \"Syrian\" labels as designations for Arameans, their lands and language, thus abandoning endonymic (native) terms, that were used in the Hebrew Bible. In the Greek translation, the region of Aram was commonly labeled as \"Syria\", while Arameans were labeled as \"Syrians\". Such adoption and implementation of terms that were foreign (exonymic) had far-reaching influence on later terminology related to Arameans and their lands, since the same terminology was reflected in later Latin and other translations of the Septuagint, including the English translation.\nReflecting on those problems, American orientalist Robert W. Rogers (d. 1930) noted in 1921: \"it is most unfortunate that Syria and Syrians ever came into the English versions. It should always be Aram and the Aramaeans\".\nEnglish translations.\nThe first English translation (which excluded the apocrypha) was Charles Thomson's in 1808, which was revised and enlarged by C. A. Muses in 1954 and published by the Falcon's Wing Press.\n\"The Septuagint with Apocrypha: Greek and English\" was translated by Lancelot Brenton in 1854. It is the traditional translation, and most of the time since its publication it has been the only one readily available. It has also been continually in print. The translation, based on the Codex Vaticanus, contains the Greek and English texts in parallel columns. It has an average of four footnoted, transliterated words per page, abbreviated \"Alex\" and \"GK\".\n\"The Complete Apostles' Bible\" (translated by Paul W. Esposito) was published in 2007. Using the Masoretic Text in the 23rd Psalm (and possibly elsewhere), it omits the apocrypha.\nA New English Translation of the Septuagint and the Other Greek Translations Traditionally Included Under that Title (NETS), an academic translation based on the New Revised Standard version (in turn based on the Masoretic Text) was published by the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies (IOSCS) in October 2007.\nThe \"Apostolic Bible Polyglot,\" published in 2003, features a Greek-English interlinear Septuagint. It includes the Greek books of the Hebrew canon (without the apocrypha) and the Greek New Testament; the whole Bible is numerically coded to a new version of the Strong numbering system created to add words not present in the original numbering by Strong. The edition is set in monotonic orthography. The version includes a Bible concordance and index.\nThe \"Orthodox Study Bible\", published in early 2008, features a new translation of the Septuagint based on the Alfred Rahlfs' edition of the Greek text. Two additional major sources have been added: the 1851 Brenton translation and the New King James Version text in places where the translation matches the Hebrew Masoretic text. This edition includes the NKJV New Testament and extensive commentary from an Eastern Orthodox perspective.\nNicholas King completed \"The Old Testament\" in four volumes and \"The Bible\".\n\"Brenton's Septuagint, Restored Names Version\" (SRNV) has been published in two volumes. The Hebrew-names restoration, based on the Westminster Leningrad Codex, focuses on the restoration of the Divine Name and has extensive Hebrew and Greek footnotes.\n\"The Holy Orthodox Bible\" by Peter A. Papoutsis and \"The Old Testament According to the Seventy\" by Michael Asser are based on the Greek Septuagint text published by the Apostoliki Diakonia of the Church of Greece.\nIn 2012, Lexham Press published the \"Lexham English Septuagint\" (LES), providing a literal, readable, and transparent English edition of the Septuagint for modern readers. In 2019, Lexham Press published the \"Lexham English Septuagint,\" Second Edition (LES2), making more of an effort than the first to focus on the text as received rather than as produced. Because this approach shifts the point of reference from a diverse group to a single implied reader, the new LES exhibits more consistency than the first edition. \"The Lexham English Septuagint (LES), then, is the only contemporary English translation of the LXX that has been made directly from the Greek.\"\nSociety and journal.\nThe International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies (IOSCS), a non-profit learned society, promotes international research into and study of the Septuagint and related texts. The society declared 8 February 2006 International Septuagint Day, a day to promote the work on campuses and in communities.

It is designated by the siglum [Aleph] or 01 in the Gregory-Aland numbering of New Testament manuscripts, and \u03b4 2 in the von Soden numbering of New Testament manuscripts. It is written in uncial letters on parchment. It is one of the four great uncial codices (these being manuscripts which originally contained the whole of both the Old and New Testaments). Along with Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Vaticanus, it is one of the earliest and most complete manuscripts of the Bible, and contains the oldest complete copy of the New Testament. It is a historical treasure, and using the study of comparative writing styles (palaeography), it has been dated to the mid-fourth century.\nBiblical scholarship considers Codex Sinaiticus to be one of the most important Greek texts of the New Testament, along with Codex Vaticanus. Until German Biblical scholar (and manuscript hunter) Constantin von Tischendorf's discovery of Codex Sinaiticus in 1844, the Greek text of Codex Vaticanus was unrivalled. Since its discovery, study of Codex Sinaiticus has proven to be useful to scholars for critical studies of the biblical text.\nCodex Sinaiticus came to the attention of scholars in the 19th century at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, with further material discovered in the 20th and 21st centuries. Although parts of the codex are scattered across four libraries around the world, most of the manuscript is held today in the British Library in London, where it is on public display.\nDescription.\nThe manuscript is a codex (the forerunner to the modern book) made from vellum parchment, originally in double sheets, which may have measured about 40 by 70\u00a0cm. The whole codex consists of quires of eight leaves (with a few exceptions), a format which came to be popular throughout the Middle Ages (this being eight parchment pages laid on top of each other, and folded in half to make a full block (also known as a folio); several of these were then stitched together to create a book). The folios were made primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. Tischendorf thought the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise. Most of the quires (or signatures) contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns, 48 lines per column, with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges.XVI When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically (writing each new poetic phrase on a new line), in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters. Each rectangular page has the proportions 1.1 to 1, while the block of text has the reciprocal proportions, 0.91 (the same proportions, rotated 90\u00b0). If the gutters between the columns were removed, the text block would mirror the page's proportions. Typographer Robert Bringhurst referred to the codex as a \"subtle piece of craftsmanship\". The cost of the material, copying time required for the scribes, and binding, is estimated to have equalled the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.\nThroughout the New Testament portion, the words are written in \"scriptio continua\" (words without any spaces in between them) in the hand-writing style that came to be called \"biblical uncial\" or \"biblical majuscule\". The parchment was ruled with a sharp point to prepare for writing lines. The letters are written along these lines, with neither breathings nor polytonic accents (markings utilised to indicate changes of pitch or emphasis). A variety of types of punctuation are used: high and middle points; colon; diaeresis on initial iota and upsilon; a few ligatures are used, along with the paragraphos: initial letter into margin (extent of this varies considerably). A plain iota is replaced by the epsilon-iota diphthong almost regularly (commonly though imprecisely known as itacism), e.g. instead of , instead of , instead of , etc.74 ff, 93\u201394\nNomina sacra with overlines are employed throughout. Some words usually abbreviated in other manuscripts (such as and ), are written in both full and abbreviated forms. The following nomina sacra are written in abbreviated forms (nominative forms shown): \u0398\u03a3 ( / \"god\"), \u039a\u03a3 ( / \"lord\"), \u0399\u03a3 ( / \"Jesus\"), \u03a7\u03a3 ( / \"Christ\"), \u03a0\u039d\u0391 ( / \"spirit\"), \u03a0\u039d\u0399\u039a\u039f\u03a3 ( / \"spiritual\"), \u03a5\u03a3 ( / \"son\"), \u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a3 ( / \"man\"), \u039f\u03a5\u039f\u03a3 ( / \"heaven\"), \u0394\u0391\u0394 ( / \"David\"), \u0399\u039b\u0397\u039c ( / \"Jerusalem\"), \u0399\u03a3\u03a1\u039b ( / \"Israel\"), \u039c\u0397\u03a1 ( / \"mother\"), \u03a0\u0397\u03a1 ( / \"father\"), \u03a3\u03a9\u03a1 ( / \"saviour\").\nThe portion of the codex held by the British Library consists of 346\u00bd folios, 694 pages (38.1\u00a0cm x 34.5\u00a0cm), constituting over half of the original work. Of these folios, 199 belong to the Old Testament, including the apocrypha (deuterocanonical), and 147\u00bd belong to the New Testament, along with two other books, the Epistle of Barnabas and part of The Shepherd of Hermas. The apocryphal and deuterocanonical books present in the surviving part of the Septuagint are 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 4 Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach. The books of the New Testament are arranged in this order: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul (Hebrews follows 2 Thess.), the Acts of the Apostles, the General Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. The fact that some parts of the codex are preserved in good condition while others are in very poor condition suggests they were separated and stored in several places.\nWhile large portions of the Old Testament are missing, it is assumed the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments. About half of the Greek Old Testament (or \"Septuagint\") survived, along with a complete New Testament, the entire Deuterocanonical books, the Epistle of Barnabas and portions of The Shepherd of Hermas.\nText.\nContents.\nThe text of the Old Testament contains the following passages in order:\nThe text of the New Testament is arranged in the following order:\nThe codex includes two other books as part of the New Testament:\n* Epistle of Barnabas\n* Shepherd of Hermas\nText-type and relationship to other manuscripts.\nFor most of the New Testament, Codex Sinaiticus is in general agreement with \"Codex Vaticanus (B)\" and \"Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C)\", attesting the Alexandrian text-type.\nA notable example of an agreement between the text in Sinaiticus and Vaticanus is they both omit the word \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 ('without cause', 'without reason', 'in vain') from Matthew 5:22: \"But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement\".\nIn John 1:1\u20138:38, Codex Sinaiticus differs from Vaticanus (B) and all other Alexandrian manuscripts. It is in closer agreement with \"Codex Bezae (D)\" in support of the Western text-type. For example, in John 1:4, Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae are the only Greek manuscripts with textual variant (\"in him is life\") instead of (\"in him was life\"). This variant is supported by Vetus Latina and some Sahidic manuscripts. This portion has a large number of corrections.\nThere are a number of differences between Sinaiticus and Vaticanus; Textual critic Herman C. Hoskier enumerated 3036 differences:\nMatt: 656\nMark: 567\nLuke: 791\nJohn: 1022\nTotal \u2014 3036.\nAccording to textual critic Fenton Hort, \"Sinaiticus\" and \"Vaticanus\" were derived from a much older common source, \"the date of which cannot be later than the early part of the second century, and may well be yet earlier\".\nExample of differences between Sinaiticus and Vaticanus in Matt 1:18\u201319 (one transposition difference; two spelling differences; one word substitution difference):\nBiblical scholar B. H. Streeter remarked there was a great agreement between the codex and the Vulgate of Jerome. According to him, Origen brought the Alexandrian text-type that was used in this codex to Caesarea, and it was subsequently employed by Jerome for his Latin revision.\nBetween the 4th and 12th centuries, seven or more correctors worked on this codex, making it one of the most corrected manuscripts in existence. During his investigation in Petersburg, Tischendorf enumerated 14,800 corrections in the portion which was only held in Petersburg (2/3 of the codex). According to textual critic David C. Parker, the full codex has about 23,000 corrections.3 In addition to these corrections some letters were marked by dots as doubtful (e.g. \u1e6a\u1e22).\nNotable omissions.\nThe New Testament portion lacks the following passages:\n Omitted verses\n* Gospel of Matthew - * B L \u0393 ff1 k sys, c sa32\n Matthew 16 - B \u019213 157 syc sa bo\n Matthew 17 - * B \u0398 0281 33 579 892* e ff1 sys, c sa bopt48\n Matthew 18 - B L* \u0398* \u01921 \u019213 33 892* e ff1 sys sa bopt49\n Matthew 23 - B D L \u0398 \u01921 33 892* a aur e ff1 g1 vgst, ww sys sa bopt65\n* Gospel of Mark - B L \u0394*81\n Mark 9:44 - B C W k sys sa86\n Mark 9:46 - B C W k sys sa87\n Mark 11:25 - B L W \u0394 \u03a8 565 700 892 k l sys sa bopt128\n Mark 15:28 - A B C D \u03a8 k sys sa bopt144\n Mark 16:9\u201320 (Long ending of the Gospel Mark) - B k sys arm\n* Gospel of Luke Luke 10:32 - * (Likely omitted due to haplography resulting from homeoteleuton; the verse was added by a later corrector in lower margin)128\n Luke 17:36 - \ud835\udd1375 A B L W \u0394 \u0398 \u03a8 \u01921 28 33 565\n* Gospel of John - \ud835\udd1366 \ud835\udd1375 B C* D Wsupp Minuscule 33 d l q vg syc sa bomss179\n John 7:53-8:11 (Pericope adulterae) - \ud835\udd1366 \ud835\udd1375 B L N T W X Y \u0394 \u0398 \u03a8 0141 0211 22 33 124 157 209 788 828 1230 1241 1253 2193 (see Image \"John 7:53\u20138:11\");\n* The Book of Acts - \ud835\udd1345 \ud835\udd1374 A B C 33 81 614 vg syp, h sa bo eth315\n Acts 15:34 - \ud835\udd1374 A B E L \u03a8 81 1241 1505 Byz387\n Acts 24:7 - \ud835\udd1374 A B H L P 049 81 1175 1241 p* s vgst co395\n Acts 28:29 - \ud835\udd1374 A B E \u03a8 048 33 81 1175 1739 2464 s vgst syp co408\n* Epistle of Paul to the - \ud835\udd1346 \ud835\udd1361 A B C 81 1739 2464 b vgst co440\n Omitted phrases\n* : (\"bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you\") - B \u01921 205 k syc sa bopt\n* Matthew 6:13: (\"For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.

Ehrman says this was a corrupt reading from a proto-orthodox scribe, although this conclusion has not gained wide support.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nProvenance.\nLittle is known of the manuscript's early history. According to Hort, it was written in the West, probably in Rome, as suggested by the fact that the chapter division in the Acts of the Apostles common to Sinaiticus and Vaticanus occurs in no other Greek manuscript, but is found in several manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate. Robinson countered this argument, suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by Jerome himself, as a result of his studies at Caesarea. According to Kenyon the forms of the letters are Egyptian and they were found in Egyptian papyri of earlier date.128 Gardthausen, Ropes and Jellicoe thought it was written in Egypt. Biblical scholar J. Rendel Harris believed that the manuscript came from the library of Pamphilus at Caesarea Maritima.128 Streeter, Skeat, and Milne also believed that it was produced in Caesarea.\nDate.\nThe codex can be dated with a reasonable degree of confidence between the early fourth century and the early fifth century. It could not have been written before about 325 because it contains the Eusebian Canons, which is a \"terminus post quem\". The \"terminus ante quem\" is less certain. Milne and Skeat relied on small cursive notes to assert that the date of the production of the codex was not likely to be much later than about 360. More recent research suggests that these cursive notes could be as late as the early fifth century.\nTischendorf theorized that Codex Sinaiticus was one of the fifty copies of the Bible commissioned from Eusebius by Roman emperor Constantine after his conversion to Christianity (\"De vita Constantini\", IV, 37). This hypothesis was supported by Pierre Batiffol. Biblical scholars Caspar Ren\u00e9 Gregory and T.C. Skeat believed that it was already in production when Constantine placed his order, but had to be suspended in order to accommodate different page dimensions.\nBiblical scholar Frederic G. Kenyon argued: \"There is not the least sign of either of them ever having been at Constantinople. The fact that Sinaiticus was collated with the manuscript of Pamphilus so late as the sixth century seems to show that it was not originally written at Caesarea\".\nScribes and correctors.\nTischendorf believed four separate scribes copied the work (whom he named A, B, C and D), and five correctors amended portions (whom he designated a, b, c, d and e). He posited one of the correctors was contemporaneous with the original scribes, and the others worked during the sixth and seventh centuries. After Milne and Skeat's reinvestigation, it is now agreed Tischendorf was incorrect, as scribe C never existed.22\u201350 According to Tischendorf, scribe C wrote the poetic books of the Old Testament. These are written in a different format from the rest of the manuscript \u2013 they appear in two columns (the rest of books is in four columns), written stichometrically. Tischendorf probably interpreted the different formatting as indicating the existence of another scribe.22\u201350, 12\u201313 The three remaining scribes are still identified by the letters Tischendorf gave them: A, B, and D. There were in fact more correctors, with at least seven (a, b, c, ca, cb, cc, e).\nModern analysis identifies three scribes:\nScribe B was a poor speller, and scribe A was not much better; the best scribe was D.90 Metzger states: \"scribe A had made some unusually serious mistakes\". Scribes A and B used \"nomina sacra\" in contracted forms most often (\u03a0\u039d\u0395\u03a5\u039c\u0391 contracted in all occurrences, \u039a\u03a5\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a3 contracted except in two occurrences), whereas scribe D mostly used the uncontracted forms. Scribe D distinguished between sacral and nonsacral uses of \u039a\u03a5\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a3. His spelling errors are the substitution of \u0395\u0399 for \u0399, and \u0399 for \u0395\u0399 in medial positions, both equally common. Otherwise substitution of \u0399 for initial \u0395\u0399 is unknown, and final \u0395\u0399 is only replaced in the word \u0399\u03a3\u03a7\u03a5\u0395\u0399. The confusion of \u0395 and \u0391\u0399 is very rare.90 In the Book of Psalms, this scribe has \u0394\u0391\u03a5\u0395\u0399\u0394 instead of \u0394\u0391\u03a5\u0399\u0394 35 times, while scribe A normally uses an abbreviated form \u0394\u0391\u0394.94 Scribe A made the most phonetic errors: confusion of \u0395 and \u0391\u0399 occurs in all contexts.90 Milne and Skeat characterised scribe B as \"careless and illiterate\".\nA paleographical study at the British Museum in 1938 found the text had undergone several corrections. The first corrections were done by several scribes before the manuscript left the scriptorium. Readings which they introduced are designated by the siglum a. Milne and Skeat have observed the superscription to 1 Maccabees was made by scribe D, while the text was written by scribe A.33 Scribe D corrects his own work and that of scribe A, but scribe A limits himself to correcting his own work.44 In the sixth or seventh century, many alterations were made (b) \u2013 according to a colophon at the end of the book of Esdras and Esther, the source of these alterations was \"a very ancient manuscript that had been corrected by the hand of the holy martyr Pamphylus\" (martyred in 309). If this is so, material beginning with 1 Samuel to the end of Esther is Origen's copy of the Hexapla. From this colophon, the corrections are concluded to have been made in Caesarea Maritima in the sixth or seventh centuries. The pervasive iotacism, especially of the diphthong, remains uncorrected.\nDiscovery.\nThe Codex may have been seen in 1761 by the Italian traveller Vitaliano Donati, when he visited the Saint Catherine's Monastery at Sinai in Egypt. His diary was published in 1879, in which was written:\nIn questo monastero ritrovai una quantit\u00e0 grandissima di codici membranacei... ve ne sono alcuni che mi sembravano anteriori al settimo secolo, ed in ispecie una Bibbia in membrane bellissime, assai grandi, sottili, e quadre, scritta in carattere rotondo e bellissimo; conservano poi in chiesa un Evangelistario greco in caractere d'oro rotondo, che dovrebbe pur essere assai antico. \n\"In this monastery I found a great number of parchment codices ... there are some which seemed to be written before the seventh century, and especially a Bible (made) of beautiful vellum, very large, thin and square parchments, written in round and very beautiful letters; moreover there are also in the church a Greek Evangelistarium in gold and round letters, it should be very old.\" \nThe \"Bible on beautiful vellum\" may be Codex Sinaiticus, and the gold evangelistarium is likely Lectionary 300 on the Gregory-Aland list.\nGerman Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf wrote about his visit to the monastery in \"Reise in den Orient\" in 1846 (translated as \"Travels in the East\" in 1847), without mentioning the manuscript. Later, in 1860, in his writings about the Sinaiticus discovery, Tischendorf wrote a narrative about the monastery and the manuscript that spanned from 1844 to 1859. He wrote that in 1844, during his first visit to the Saint Catherine's Monastery, he saw some leaves of parchment in a waste-basket. They were \"rubbish which was to be destroyed by burning it in the ovens of the monastery\",313 although this is firmly denied by the Monastery. After examination he realized that they were part of the Septuagint, written in an early Greek uncial script. He retrieved from the basket 129 leaves in Greek which he identified as coming from a manuscript of the Septuagint. He asked if he might keep them, but at this point the attitude of the monks changed. They realized how valuable these old leaves were, and Tischendorf was permitted to take only one-third of the whole, i.e. 43 leaves. These leaves contained portions of 1 Chronicles, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, and Esther. After his return they were deposited in the Leipzig University Library, where they remain. In 1846 Tischendorf published their contents, naming them the 'Codex Friderico-Augustanus' (in honor of Frederick Augustus and keeping secret the source of the leaves). Other portions of the same codex remained in the monastery, containing all of Isaiah and 1 and 4 Maccabees.\nIn 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804\u20131885), at that time head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and subsequently Bishop of Chigirin, visited the monastery and the codex was shown to him, together with leaves which Tischendorf had not seen. In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.\nIn 1853, Tischendorf revisited the Saint Catherine's Monastery to get the remaining 86 folios, but without success. Returning in 1859, this time under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, he was shown Codex Sinaiticus. He would later claim to have found it discarded in a rubbish bin. (This story may have been a fabrication, or the manuscripts in question may have been unrelated to Codex Sinaiticus: Rev. J. Silvester Davies in 1863 quoted \"a monk of Sinai who... stated that according to the librarian of the monastery the whole of Codex Sinaiticus had been in the library for many years and was marked in the ancient catalogues... Is it not likely... that a manuscript known in the library catalogue would have been jettisoned in the rubbish basket.\" Indeed, it has been noted that the leaves were in \"suspiciously good condition\" for something found in the trash.) Tischendorf had been sent to search for manuscripts by Russia's Tsar Alexander II, who was convinced there were still manuscripts to be found at the Sinai monastery. The text of this part of the codex was published by Tischendorf in 1862:\nThis work has been digitised in full and all four volumes may be consulted online.\nIt was reprinted in four volumes in 1869:\nThe complete publication of the codex was made by Kirsopp Lake in 1911 (New Testament), and in 1922 (Old Testament). It was the full-sized black and white facsimile of the manuscript, \"made from negatives taken from St. Petersburg by my wife and myself in the summer of 1908\".\nThe story of how Tischendorf found the manuscript, which contained most of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament, has all the interest of a romance. Tischendorf reached the monastery on 31 January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On 4 February, he had resolved to return home without having gained his object:\nOn the afternoon of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment with him in his cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: \"And I, too, have read a Septuagint\" \u2013 i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from the corner of the room a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.\nAfter some negotiations, he obtained possession of this precious fragment. James Bentley gives an account of how this came about, prefacing it with the comment, \"Tischendorf therefore now embarked on the remarkable piece of duplicity which was to occupy him for the next decade, which involved the careful suppression of facts and the systematic denigration of the monks of Mount Sinai.\" He conveyed it to Tsar Alexander II, who appreciated its importance and had it published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. In 1869 the Tsar sent the monastery 7,000 rubles and the monastery of Mount Tabor 2,000 rubles by way of compensation.VI The document in Russian formalising this was published in 2007 in Russia and has since been translated.\nThe codex is regarded by the monastery as having been stolen, which is proven by a receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from St. Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request', a copy of which is on display in the publicly-accessible area of the monastery.\nThis view of Tischendorf's role in the transfer to Saint Petersburg has been contested by several scholars in Europe. New Testament scholar Bruce Metzger wrote:\nCertain aspects of the negotiations leading to the transfer of the codex to the Tsar's possession are open to an interpretation that reflects adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For an account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in \"Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe f\u00fcr Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag\" (Berlin, c. 1961), pp.15-24; for an account that includes a hitherto [i.e., before 1964] unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request,' see Ihor \u0160ev\u010denko, \"New Documents on Tischendorf and the Codex Sinaiticus\", published in the journal \"Scriptorium\", xviii (1964), pp. 55\u201380.64\nSimonides.\nOn 13 September 1862 Constantine Simonides (1820\u20131890), skilled in calligraphy and with a controversial background with manuscripts, made the claim in print in \"The Manchester Guardian\" that he had written the codex himself as a 19-year-old boy in 1839 in the Panteleimonos monastery at Athos. Constantin von Tischendorf, who worked with numerous Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mount Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in \"The Manchester Guardian\" in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of Codex Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides, which later have been disproved. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.\nIn answer to Simonides in \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" (December 1862), Tischendorf noted only in the New Testament were there many differences between it and all other manuscripts. Henry Bradshaw, a bibliographer, combatted the claims of Constantine Simonides in a letter to \"The Manchester Guardian\" (26 January 1863). Bradshaw argued that Codex Sinaiticus brought by Tischendorf from the Greek monastery of Mount Sinai was not a modern forgery or written by Simonides. The controversy seems to regard the misplaced use of the word 'fraud' or 'forgery' since it may have been a repaired text, a copy of the Septuagint based upon Origen's Hexapla, a text which has been rejected for centuries because of its lineage from Eusebius who introduced Arian doctrine into the courts of Constantine I and II.\nNot every scholar and Church minister was delighted about the codex find. Burgon, a supporter of the Textus Receptus, suggested that Codex Sinaiticus, as well as codices Vaticanus and Codex Bezae, were the most corrupt documents extant. Each of these three codices \"clearly exhibits a fabricated text \u2013 is the result of arbitrary and reckless recension.\" The two most weighty of these three codices, and B, he likens to the \"two false witnesses\" of Matthew 26:60.48\nHowever, independent discoveries of other fragments of the codex in recent history (see below) prove its authenticity, and disprove all theories of it being a forgery.\nRecent history.\nIn the early 20th century Vladimir Beneshevich (1874\u20131938) discovered parts of three more leaves of the codex in the bindings of other manuscripts in the library of Mount Sinai. Beneshevich went on three occasions to the monastery (1907, 1908, 1911) but does not tell when or from which book these were recovered. These leaves were also acquired for St. Petersburg, where they remain.\nFor many decades, the Codex was preserved in the Russian National Library. In 1933, the Soviet Union sold the codex to the British Museum (after 1973 part of it was separated to become the British Library) for \u00a3100,000 raised by public subscription (worth \u00a3 in 2023). After coming to Britain it was examined by Skeat and Milne using an ultra-violet lamp.\nIn May 1975, during restoration work, the monks of Saint Catherine's Monastery discovered a room beneath the St. George Chapel which contained many parchment fragments. Kurt Aland and his team from the Institute for New Testament Textual Research were the first scholars who were invited to analyse, examine and photograph these new fragments of the New Testament in 1982. Among these fragments were twelve complete leaves from the \"Sinaiticus\", eleven leaves of the Pentateuch and one leaf of the Shepherd of Hermas. Together with these leaves 67 Greek Manuscripts of New Testament have been found (uncials 0278 \u2013 0296 and some minuscules).\nIn June 2005, a team of experts from the United Kingdom, Europe, Egypt, Russia and United States undertook a joint project to produce a new digital edition of the manuscript (involving all four holding libraries), and a series of other studies was announced. This will include the use of hyperspectral imaging to photograph the manuscripts to look for hidden information such as erased or faded text. This was done in cooperation with the British Library.\nMore than one quarter of the manuscript was made publicly available at https:// on 24 July 2008. On 6 July 2009, 800 more pages of the manuscript were made available, showing over half of the entire text, although the entire text was intended to be shown by that date.\nThe complete document is now available online in digital form and available for scholarly study. The online version has a fully transcribed set of digital pages, including amendments to the text, and two images of each page, with both standard lighting and raked lighting to highlight the texture of the parchment.\nPrior to 1 September 2009, the University of the Arts London PhD student, Nikolas Sarris, discovered the previously unseen fragment of the Codex in the library of Saint Catherine's Monastery. It contains the text of Book of Joshua 1:10.\nPresent location.\nThe codex is now split into four unequal portions: 347 leaves in the British Library in London (199 of the Old Testament, 148 of the New Testament), 12 leaves and 14 fragments in the Saint Catherine's Monastery, 43 leaves in the Leipzig University Library, and fragments of 3 leaves in the Russian National Library in Saint Petersburg.\nSaint Catherine's Monastery still maintains the importance of a letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves and that they would be returned from Russia if requested. However, Russian scholars contend that recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 (four years after the removal of the manuscript from the monastery) and signed by Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, amount to a proof that the manuscript was obtained legally. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. This development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality of the gift arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so that even though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866).\nSkeat in his article \"The Last Chapter in the History of the Codex Sinaiticus\" concluded in this way:\nThis is not the place to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the importance of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.315\nImpact on biblical scholarship.\nAlong with Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus is considered one of the most valuable manuscripts available, as it is one of the oldest and likely closer to the original text of the Greek New Testament. It is the only uncial manuscript with the complete text of the New Testament, and the only ancient manuscript of the New Testament written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating Codex Sinaiticus and the lifetime of Jesus, it is considered by some to be more accurate than most New Testament copies in preserving readings where almost all manuscripts are assumed by them to be in error.191\nFor the Gospels, Sinaiticus is considered among some people as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is equal to that of Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is assumed to be the most reliable witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, \ud835\udd1347, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27918", "revid": "69412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27918", "title": "Scouting", "text": "Youth movement\nScouting or the Scout Movement is a youth movement which became popularly established in the first decade of the twentieth century. \nIt follows the Scout method of informal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking and sports. A widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing and encouraging equality, with neckerchief (known as a scarf in some countries) and (originally) a campaign hat or comparable headwear. Distinctive insignia include the fleur-de-lis as well as merit badges or patches. In many countries, girl only organizations, whose members are often called Guides instead of Scouts, use a trefoil insignia instead of the fleur-de-lis.\nThe original program was for youths between the ages of 11 and 17. Other programs for youths who are too young to be in the main program and take the Scout Promise sometimes exist within an organization. Early examples are Wolf Cubs and Brownies. Programs can also exist for those who are older. Early examples are Rovers or Rangers. The actual names or even existence depend on organization and time period. Speciality programs, such as Sea Scouts, exist.\nIn 2019, there were over 55 million Scouts and Guides in at least 155 countries. The Scout Movement is a pluralist movement, not a unitary organization. Numerous local, national and international Scout organizations have been formed. The largest international organizations are the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS); some national organization belong to both. \nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn the late nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, there was popular interest in frontier and military scouts. Boys and girls read fictional and non fictional stories about scouts and emulated these scouts in dress and activities and used self-help manuals. Some teachers and youth leaders instructed boys and girls in scout craft. \"Reconnaissance and Scouting\" (1884) and \"Aids to Scouting\", books on military scout training written by Robert Baden-Powell, were among the sources used for instruction. Sales of \"Aids to Scouting\" were fueled by Baden-Powell's fame as hero of the Second Boer War.\nInspired by the interest in his books on scout training and urged by the Boys' Brigade founder, William A. Smith and leaders, some of whom had adopted Scout training, and by the publishers, C. Arthur Pearson Ltd, Baden-Powell began writing a book for boy readership. Baden-Powell was also motivated by his experience with the Mafeking Cadet Corp and the poor physical standards of recruits and their poor preparation for colonial wars. He studied other youth training schemes. In July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton, a British-born Canadian raised naturalist, artist and writer living in the United States, sent Baden-Powell a copy of his 1902 book \"The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians\" and they met in October 1906 and shared ideas about youth training, providing Baden-Powell with a scheme for delivery of scout training.\nIn August 1907, Baden-Powell led a week-long experimental Scout camp on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset England to test his ideas. Twenty-one boys from various social backgrounds, from boy's schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth and Winton Boys' Brigade units attended the camp. Following Seton's scheme, the boys organized themselves in small groups with an elected leader. The camp was accompanied by advertising and followed by an extensive promotional speaking tour arranged by C. Arthur Pearson Ltd. to promote the forthcoming book.\nIn 1908, Baden-Powell's book, \"Scouting for Boys\", was published in six fortnightly parts, followed in April by \"The Scout\" magazine. These omitted many military aspects of \"Aids to Scouting\" and transferred the techniques (mainly survival skills) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education. and provided descriptions of the Scout method of outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship training and Physical fitness among youth. Later in 1908, \"Scouting for Boys\" was published in book form and a revised edition was published in 1909 and was the basis for the 1910 \"Boy Scout Handbook\" of the Boy Scouts of America by Seton. The various editions of the book are now the fourth-bestselling title of all time. The original edition and magazine described a scheme which could be used by established organizations, particular the various Brigade Movement organizations. However, because of the popular image of scouts and desire for adventurous outdoor activities, boys and even some girls formed their own Scout patrols and troops, independent of any organization.\nIn 1909, a Scout Rally was held at Crystal Palace in London, which 11,000 Boy Scouts and even some Girl Scouts in uniform attended. \nLocal and national Scout organizations were formed. In 1910, Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association. The Boy Scouts Association's first census in 1910 claimed 100,000 registered Scouts.\nSpecial interests and programs developed such as Scout bands, cyclist scouts, Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, mounted Scouts and high adventure.\nGirl Guides.\nMany girls took up being Girl Scouts and were part of the Scout Movement as soon as it began. Common Edwardian values of the time would not accept young boys and girls to \"rough and tumble\" together. Baden-Powell with the help of his sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, formed a separate organization for girls in 1910, the Girl Guides Association, which was followed in other countries forming the Girl Guides. However, by the 1990s, two-thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.\nOriginal Scout Law.\nThe scouts law is for boys, as follows;\nPromise of 1908.\n\"Scouting for boys\", introduced the Scout promise, as follows:\n\"Before he becomes a scout, a boy must take the scout's oath, thus:\n'On my honour I promise that\u2014\n#I will do my duty to God and the King.\n#I will do my best to help others, whatever it costs me.\n#I know the scout law, and will obey it.'\nWhile taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of the little finger and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards:\u2014\nThis is the scout's salute\".\nWorldwide spread.\nThe Boy Scout Movement swiftly established itself throughout the British Empire. By 1908, Scouts were established in Gibraltar, Malta, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Malaya (YMCA Experimental Troop in Penang) and South Africa. In 1909 Chile was possibly the first country outside the British dominions to have a national Scout organization. By 1910, Argentina, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States had Boy Scouts.\nAssociated programs for younger children.\nYounger children, particularly younger siblings, too young to be Scouts and take the Scout Promise attended some Scout meetings and so programs for younger children were developed by some troops and organizations. Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts Association launched its Wolf Cubs in 1916, which Baden-Powell wanted to be distinct from Scouts in name, uniform and identity to ensure they did not give Scouts a juvenile image. In the United States, attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911 but formal recognition by the Boy Scouts of America was not made until 1930. Some Scout organizations have associated programs for even younger children and infants.\nAssociated programs for older adolescents.\nSome Scout organizations developed programs for those who had grown too old to be Scouts but wanted to remain associated with and support Scout Troops. Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts Association formed its Rovers in 1918 for young men and its Guild of Old Scouts.\nLeader training.\nBaden-Powell's Boy Scouts Association held Scoutmaster training camps in London and Yorkshire in 1910 and 1911. Leader training was delayed by World War I. The Boy Scouts Association acquired Gilwell Park near London in 1919 as an adult training site and Scout campsite and held its first Wood Badge training there in 1919. The Wood Badge was copied in many other national scout organizations. Baden-Powell also wrote \"Aids to Scoutmastership\" to help Scout leaders.\nInfluences.\nImportant elements of Scout training have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences in education and military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he wrote \"Scouting for boys\" and his writing inspired thousands of young people from all parts of society to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of the Scout Movement.\nAt Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools, Baden-Powell had an interest in the outdoors. Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and \nIn 1896, Baden-Powell was assigned to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War. In June 1896 he met here and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas originated here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in \"Scouting for Boys\". Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called \"scoutcraft\", the fundamentals of Scout training. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. During this time in the Matobo Hills Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and acquired his kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses.\nThree years later, in South Africa during the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was besieged in the small town of Mafikeng (Mafeking) by a much larger Boer army. The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a group of youths that supported the troops by carrying messages, which freed the men for military duties and kept the boys occupied during the long siege. The Cadet Corps performed well, helping in the defence of the town (1899\u20131900) and were one of the many factors that inspired Baden-Powell to write \"Scouting for boys\". Each member received a badge that illustrated a combined compass point and spearhead. The badge's logo was similar to the fleur-de-lis shaped arrowhead that later adopted by Scout. The siege of Mafeking was the first time since his own childhood that Baden-Powell, a regular serving soldier, had come into the same orbit as \"civilians\"\u2014women and children\u2014and discovered for himself the usefulness of well-trained boys.\nIn the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, followed Baden-Powell's struggle to hold Mafeking, and when the siege was broken he had become a national hero. This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scout training and survival, \"Aids to scouting,\" that owed much to what he had learned from discussions with Burnham.\nOn his return to England, Baden-Powell noticed that boys showed considerable interest in \"Aids to scouting\", which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations. He was urged to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys' Brigade (of which he was vice president at the time), a large youth movement drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought this would not be attractive and suggested that the Boys' Brigade could grow much larger if scouting was included. He studied other schemes, parts of which he used in \"Scouting for boys\".\nA wide variety of cultures have adopted Scout training. Scouts in the United States use images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience and American native peoples for their connection with nature and wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from its wider colonial frontiers including Canada, the Indian subcontinent, Australia and Africa and writings such as Rudyard Kipling's.\nFrontier and military scouts inspired interest in playing and training as Scouts. Baden-Powell wrote his military training book, \"Aids to scouting\" because he saw the need for the improved training of British soldiers and army scouts, particularly in initiative, self-reliance, and observational skills. The book's popularity with young boys surprised him. He adapted the book as \"Scouting for boys\".\n\"Duty to God\" is a principle of the Scout Movement, though it is applied differently in various countries. Scouting America takes a strong position, excluding atheists. The Scout Association in the United Kingdom permits variations to its Promise, in order to accommodate different religious obligations. While for example in the predominantly atheist Czech Republic the Scout oath does not mention God altogether with the organization being strictly irreligious, in 2014, United Kingdom Scouts were given the choice of being able to make a variation of the Promise that replaced \"duty to God\" with \"uphold our Scout values\", Scouts Canada defines Duty to God broadly in terms of \"adherence to spiritual principles\" and leaves it to the individual member or leader whether they can follow a Scout Promise that includes Duty to God. Worldwide, roughly one in three Scouts are Muslim.\nScout Movement characteristics.\nScouts use the Scout method, which incorporates an informal educational system that emphasizes practical activities in the outdoors. Programs exist for Scouts ranging in age from 6 to 25 (though age limits vary slightly by country), and program specifics target Scouts in a manner appropriate to their age.\nScout method.\nThe Scout method is the principal method by which Scout organizations and Scouts, operate their units. One description of the Scout Movement is: \"a voluntary nonpolitical educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of origin, race or creed, in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by the Founder\". It is the goal of Scouting \"to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.\"\nScout principles describe a code of behaviour for all members and characterize the Scout Movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: law and promise, learning by doing, team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support. While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method: service in the community.\nThe Scout Law and Promise embody the values of the Scout movement and bind all Scouts together. The emphasis on \"learning by doing\" provides experiences and hands-on orientation as a practical method of learning and building self-confidence. Small groups build unity, camaraderie, and a close-knit fraternal atmosphere. These experiences, along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor, help to develop responsibility, character, self-reliance, self-confidence, reliability, and readiness; which eventually lead to collaboration and leadership. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout's horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as dexterity. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment.\nSince the origins of the Scout Movement, Scouts have taken a Scout Promise to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribe to the Scout Law. The form of the promise and laws have varied slightly by country and over time, but must fulfil the requirements of the WOSM to qualify a National Scout Association for membership.\nThe Scout Motto, \"Be Prepared\", has been used in various languages by millions of Scouts since 1907. Less well-known is the Scout Slogan, \"Do a good turn daily\".\nActivities.\nCommon ways to implement the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing \"good citizenship\" and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities is a key element. Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.\nCamping is most often arranged at the unit level, such as one Scout troop, but there are periodic camps (known in the US as \"camporees\") and \"jamborees\". Camps occur a few times a year and may involve several groups from a local area or region camping together for a weekend. The events usually have a theme, such as pioneering. World Scout Moots are gatherings, originally for Rover Scouts, but mainly focused on Scout Leaders. Jamborees are large national or international events held every four years, during which thousands of Scouts camp together for one or two weeks. Activities at these events will include games, Scoutcraft competitions, badge, pin or patch trading, aquatics, woodcarving, archery and activities related to the theme of the event.\nIn some countries a highlight of the year for Scouts is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.\nScouting promotes international harmony and peace. Various initiatives towards achieving this aim include the development of activities that benefit the wider community, challenge prejudice and encourage tolerance of diversity. Such programs include co-operation with non-Scout organisations including various NGOs, the United Nations and religious institutions as set out in \"The Marrakech Charter\".\nUniforms and distinctive insignia.\nThe Scout uniform is a widely recognized characteristic. Baden-Powell said the uniform \"hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality; but, more important still, it covers differences of country and race and creed, and makes all feel that they are members with one another of the one great brotherhood\". The original uniform, still widely recognized, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed campaign hat. Baden-Powell also wore shorts, because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age-imposed distance between adult and youth. Uniform shirts are now frequently blue, orange, red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather.\nWhile designed for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams to make them ideal for use in makeshift stretchers\u2014Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges could be used as emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.\nDistinctive insignia for all are Scout uniforms, recognized and worn the world over, include the Wood Badge and the World Membership Badge. Scouts use a fleur-de-lis emblem while members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) use a trefoil.\nThe fylfot (now more commonly called a swastika) was used by the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom and others in early thanks badges from 1911. Lord Baden-Powell's 1922 design for the Medal of Merit added a swastika to the Scout Arrowhead to symbolize good luck for the recipient. In 1934, Scouters requested a change to the design because of the connection of the swastika with its more recent use by the German National Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party. A new Medal of Merit was issued by the Boy Scouts Association in 1935.\nAge groups and sections.\nIn addition to Scouts, many Scout and Guide organizations have developed other programs for other age groups. These age divisions have varied over time as they adapt to the local culture and environment.\nScouts are youths between the ages of 11 and 17. In most Scout organizations, this age group composes the Boy Scout, Girls Scouts or Guides. Some organizations developed other programs for those who had become too old to remain Scouts or were too young to be Scouts and take the Scout Promise (e.g. Cubs for ages 6 to 10). Many organizations split training of Scouts and Guides into \"junior\" and \"senior\" groups. The age ranges vary by organization.\nThe national programs for younger children include Lions, Tigers, Wolves, Bears, Webelos, Arrow of the Light Scouts, Cubs, Brownies, Daisies, Rainbow Guides, Beavers, Joeys, Keas, and Teddies. Programs for post-adolescents and young adults include Rovers the Rangers and Young Leaders, Rovers, Senior Scouts, Venturer Scouts, Explorer Scouts, and the Scout Network. Many organizations also have a program for those with special needs, often known as Extension Scouting. The Scout Method has been adapted to specific programs such as Air Scouts, Sea Scouts, Mounted Scouts and Scout bands.\nSome Scout organizations use the local Scout Group structure which contain units operating programs for different ages.\nAdults and leadership.\nAdults supporters, including former Scouts and Guides, can often join organizations such as the International Scout and Guide Fellowship. In the United States and the Philippines, university students might join the co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. In the United Kingdom, university students might join the Student Scout and Guide Organisation and, after graduation, the Scout and Guide Graduate Association. In some organizations, it is possible for adults to join support groups such as ScoutLink or a Trefoil Guild without being an adult leader.\nScout units are usually operated by adult volunteers, such as parents and carers, former Scouts, students, and community leaders, including teachers and religious leaders. Scout Leadership positions are often divided into 'uniform' and 'lay' positions. Uniformed leaders have received formal training, such as the Wood Badge, and have received a warrant for a rank within the organization. Lay members commonly hold part-time roles such as meeting helpers, committee members and advisors, though there are a small number of full-time lay professionals.\nA unit has uniformed positions\u2014such as the Scoutmaster and assistants\u2014whose titles vary among countries. In some countries, units are supported by lay members, who range from acting as meeting helpers to being members of the unit's committee. In some Scout associations, the committee members may also wear uniforms and be registered Scout leaders.\nAbove the unit are further uniformed positions, called Commissioners, at levels such as district, county, council or province, depending on the structure of the national organization. Commissioners work with lay teams and professionals. Training teams and related functions are often formed at these levels. In the UK and in other countries, the national Scout organization appoints the Chief Scout, the most senior uniformed member.\nAround the world.\nFollowing its origins in the United Kingdom, the Scout Movement spread around the world. Possibly the first national organization outside the British Empire was founded in Chile on May 21, 1909, after a visit by Baden Powell. In most countries, there is now at least one Scout organization. International Scout organizations were formed. In 1911, the World Scouts were formed. In 1922 the World Organization of the Scout Movement was formed and organizes its World Scout Jamboree every four years. In 1928 the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts for female-only national Scout and Guide organizations and operates four international centres: Our Caba\u00f1a in Mexico, Our Chalet in Switzerland, Pax Lodge in the United Kingdom, and Sangam in India.\nCo-educational.\nThere have been different approaches to co-education in the Scout Movement. Some countries have maintained separate organizations for boys and girls, In other countries, especially within Europe, Scout and Guide organizations have merged and there is a single organization for boys and girls. The United States\u2013based Boy Scouts of America permitted girls to join in early 2018. In others, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In some countries like Greece, Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations for Scouts, that are members of WOSM, and for Guides, that are members of WAGGGS, both admitting boys and girls.\nThe Scout Association in the United Kingdom has been co-educational at all levels since 1991, and this was optional for groups until the year 2000 when new sections were required to accept girls. The Scout Association transitioned all Scout groups and sections across the UK to become co-educational by January 2007, the year of the Scout Movement's centenary. The traditionalist Baden-Powell Scouts' Association has been co-educational since its formation in 1970.\nIn the United States, the Cub Scout and Boy Scout programs of the BSA were for boys only until 2018; it has changed its policies and is now inviting girls to join, as local packs organize all-girl dens (same uniform, same book, same activities). For youths age 14 and older, Venturing has been co-educational since the 1930s. The Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) is an independent organization founded in 1912 for girls and young women only. Adult leadership positions in the BSA and GSUSA are open to both men and women.\nIn 2006, of the 155 WOSM member National Scout Organizations (representing 155 countries), 122 belonged only to WOSM, and 34 belonged to both WOSM and WAGGGS. Of the 122 which belonged only to WOSM, 95 were open to boys and girls in some or all program sections, and 20 were only for boys. All 34 that belonged to both WOSM and WAGGGS were open to boys and girls.\nWAGGGS had 144 Member Organizations in 2007 and 110 of them belonged only to WAGGGS. Of these 110, 17 were coeducational and 93 admitted only girls.\nMembership.\nAs of 2019, there are over 46 million registered Scouts and as of 2020 9 million registered Guides around the world, from 216 countries and territories.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNonaligned and Scout-like organizations.\nThe Scout Movement is a pluralist movement, not a unitary or hierarchical organization. Before the establishment of national Scout organizations, the Scout training and the Scout Movement were the purview of the world's youth and before the formation of international Scout organizations, several national Scout organizations had already formed in many countries.\nAlternative organization have formed since the origins of the Scout Movement. Many early organizations were formed on religious, gender, ethnic or language lines or differed on the influence of militarism or pacifism. More recently formed alternate organizations often differ on social, political and/or organizational issues. Some believe that other Scout organizations have moved away from original intents and want to return to earlier, simpler, traditional methods. Others do not want to follow all Scout principles or those of particular international organizations and their national member organizations but still desire to participate in Scout activities.\nIn 2008, there were at least 539 independent Scout organizations around the world, Only 367 of them were members of WOSM or WAGGGS. About half of the remaining 172 Scout organizations are only local or national oriented. About 90 other national or regional Scout organizations have created other international Scout organizations:\nSome Scout-like organizations are also served by international organizations, many with religious elements, for example:\nInfluence on society.\nAfter the origins of the Scout in the early 1900s, some nations' programs have taken part in social movements such as the nationalist resistance movements in India. Although Scouts was sometimes introduced in Africa by imperial officials as a way to strengthen their rule, the Scout principles helped to challenge the legitimacy of imperialism. Likewise, African Scouts used the Scout Law's principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to collectively claim full citizenship.\nControversies.\nIn the United Kingdom, The Scout Association had been criticised for its insistence on the use of a religious promise, leading the organization to introduce an alternative in January 2014 for those not wanting to mention a god in their promise. This change made the organisation entirely non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, and religion (or lack thereof).\nThe Boy Scouts of America was the focus of criticism in the United States for not allowing the open participation of homosexuals until removing the prohibition in 2013.\nCommunist states such as the Soviet Union in 1920 and fascist regimes like Nazi Germany in 1934 often either absorbed the Scout movement into government-controlled organizations or banned Scouting entirely.\nIn film and the arts.\nThe Scout Movement has been a facet of culture during most of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in many countries; numerous films and artwork focus on the subject. Movie critic Roger Ebert mentioned the scene in which the young Boy Scout, Indiana Jones, discovers the Cross of Coronado in the movie \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", as \"when he discovers his life mission\".\nThe works of painters Ernest Stafford Carlos, Norman Rockwell, Pierre Joubert and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film \"Follow Me, Boys!\" are prime examples of this ethos. Scout are often portrayed in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film \"Troop Beverly Hills\", the 2005 film \"Down and Derby\", and the film \"Scout Camp\". In 1980, Scottish singer and songwriter Gerry Rafferty recorded \"I was a Boy Scout\" as part of his \"Snakes and Ladders\" album.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It draws from disciplines including psychology, ethology, anthropology, evolution, zoology, archaeology, and population genetics. Within the study of human societies, sociobiology is closely allied to evolutionary anthropology, human behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology, and sociology.\nSociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of social insects. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.\nWhile the term \"sociobiology\" originated at least as early as the 1940s; the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of E. O. Wilson's book \"\" in 1975. The field quickly became the subject of scientific controversy. Critics, led by Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between nature and nurture. Among sociobiologists, the controversy between laying weight to different levels of selection was settled between D.S. Wilson and E.O. Wilson in 2007.\nDefinition.\nE. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as \"the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization\".\nSociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by natural selection. \nThe discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be inherited from generation to generation.\nFor example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This behavior is adaptive because killing the cubs eliminates competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.\nHistory.\nThe philosopher of biology Daniel Dennett suggested that the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes was the first proto-sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book \"Leviathan\" Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.\nThe geneticist of animal behavior John Paul Scott coined the word \"sociobiology\" at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behavior, which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a \"Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology\" of the Ecological Society of America was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, E. O. Wilson came in contact with this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a \"sociobiologist\" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.\nWilson's sociobiology is different from John Paul Scott's or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximization of the genetic fitness by W. D. Hamilton, Robert Trivers, John Maynard Smith, and George R. Price. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when \"biology in the field\" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by \"modern\" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).\nOnce a specialist term, \"sociobiology\" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book \"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis\", sparking intense controversy. Since then \"sociobiology\" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as altruism, aggression, and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other Hymenoptera, but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers from the 19th century onwards. Peter Kropotkin's \"\", written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book, \"On Human Nature\", that addressed human behavior specifically.\nEdward H. Hagen writes in \"The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology\" that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy on its application to humans, \"one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century.\" He adds that \"Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists.\" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as \"Nature\" and \"Science\". The more general term behavioral ecology is commonly substituted to avoid the public controversy.\nTheory.\nNatural selection.\nSociobiologists maintain that human and other animal behavior can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolution, principally by natural selection. Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:\nSociobiology uses Nikolaas Tinbergen's four questions to search for explanations of animal behavior. Two of these categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called \"ultimate explanations\") are\nThe individual-level categories (often called \"proximate explanations\") are\nIn humans.\nStudies of human behavior genetics have found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and IQ have high heritability. Researchers are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on these traits.\nVarious theorists have argued that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive. The evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory, by sociologist/criminologist Lee Ellis, posits that female sexual selection has led to increased competitive behavior among men, sometimes resulting in criminality. In another theory, Mark van Vugt argues that a history of intergroup conflict for resources between men have led to differences in violence and aggression between men and women. The novelist Elias Canetti also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.\nGenetics.\nGenetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behavior. For example, the transcription factor FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the serotonergic system in the brain, is required for normal aggressive and anxiety-like behavior. Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behavior. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behavior in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.\nA genetic basis for instinctive behavioral traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviors in human societies has remained extremely controversial.\nReception.\nSteven Pinker argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of biological determinism, accusing among others Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin of being \"radical scientists\", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science, while Lewontin, Steven Rose and Leon Kamin, who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity, argue that sociobiology fails on scientific grounds. Gould grouped sociobiology with eugenics, criticizing both in his book \"The Mismeasure of Man\". When Napoleon Chagnon scheduled sessions on sociobiology at the 1976 American Anthropological Association convention, other scholars attempted to cancel them with what Chagnon later described as \"Impassioned accusations of racism, fascism and Nazism\"; Margaret Mead's support caused the sessions to occur as scheduled.\nNoam Chomsky has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the Sociobiology Study Group, as reported by Ullica Segerstr\u00e5le, Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature. Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the \"blank slate\" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 \"Reflections on Language\". Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of Peter Kropotkin's \"\", which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.\nWilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what \"ought\" to be, only what \"is\" the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from \"is\" to \"ought\", an instance of the naturalistic fallacy. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as ethnic nepotism, is based on moral assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not falsifiable by scientific advances.

More formally, #P is the class of function problems of the form \"compute \"f\"(\"x\")\", where \"f\" is the number of accepting paths of a nondeterministic Turing machine running in polynomial time. Unlike most well-known complexity classes, it is not a class of decision problems but a class of function problems. The most difficult, representative problems of this class are #P-complete.\nRelation to decision problems.\nAn NP decision problem is often of the form \"Are there any solutions that satisfy certain constraints?\" For example:\nThe corresponding #P function problems ask \"how many\" rather than \"are there any\". For example:\nRelated complexity classes.\nClearly, a #P problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem. If it's easy to count answers, then it must be easy to tell whether there are any answers\u2014just count them and see whether the count is greater than zero. Some of these problems, such as root finding, are easy enough to be in FP, while others are #P-complete.\nOne consequence of Toda's theorem is that a polynomial-time machine with a #P oracle (P#P) can solve all problems in PH, the entire polynomial hierarchy. In fact, the polynomial-time machine only needs to make one #P query to solve any problem in PH. This is an indication of the extreme difficulty of solving #P-complete problems exactly.\nSurprisingly, some #P problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) P problems. For more information on this, see #P-complete.\nThe closest decision problem class to #P is PP, which asks whether a majority (more than half) of the computation paths accept. This finds the most significant bit in the #P problem answer. The decision problem class \u2295P (pronounced \"Parity-P\") instead asks for the least significant bit of the #P answer.\n #P is the set of all functions formula_1 such that there is a polynomial time nondeterministic Turing machine formula_2 such that for all formula_3, formula_4 equals the number of accepting branches in formula_2's computation graph on formula_6. \n #P is the set of functions formula_7 such that there exists a polynomial formula_8 and a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine formula_9, called the verifier, such that for every formula_3, formula_11.

The runtime of the algorithm is polynomial in formula_14 and formula_20. The algorithm is based on the leftover hash lemma.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The problems in this complexity class are defined by having the following two properties:\nExamples.\nExamples of #P-complete problems include:\nThese are all necessarily members of the class #P as well. As a non-example, consider the case of counting solutions to a 1-satisfiability problem: a series of variables that are each individually constrained, but have no relationships with each other. The solutions can be efficiently counted, by multiplying the number of options for each variable in isolation. Thus, this problem is in #P, but cannot be #P-complete unless #P=FP. This would be surprising, as it would imply that P=NP=PH.\nEasy problems with hard counting versions.\nSome #P-complete problems correspond to easy (polynomial time) problems. Determining the satisfiability of a Boolean formula in disjunctive normal form is easy: such a formula is satisfiable if and only if it contains a satisfiable conjunction (one that does not contain a variable and its negation), whereas counting the number of satisfying assignments is #P-complete. Furthermore, deciding 2-satisfiability is easy compared to counting the number of satisfying assignments. Topologically sorting is easy in contrast to counting the number of topological sortings. A single perfect matching can be found in polynomial time, but counting all perfect matchings is #P-complete. The perfect matching counting problem was the first counting problem corresponding to an easy P problem shown to be #P-complete, in a 1979 paper by Leslie Valiant which also defined the class #P and the #P-complete problems for the first time.\nApproximation.\nThere are probabilistic algorithms that return good approximations to some #P-complete problems with high probability. This is one of the demonstrations of the power of probabilistic algorithms.\nMany #P-complete problems have a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme, or \"FPRAS,\" which, informally, will produce with high probability an approximation to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, in time that is polynomial with respect to both the size of the problem and the degree of accuracy required. Jerrum, Valiant, and Vazirani showed that every #P-complete problem either has an FPRAS, or is essentially impossible to approximate; if there is any polynomial-time algorithm which consistently produces an approximation of a #P-complete problem which is within a polynomial ratio in the size of the input of the exact answer, then that algorithm can be used to construct an FPRAS."}

He is the patron saint of tin-miners, and is also generally regarded as the patron saint of Cornwall, although Michael and Petroc also have some claim to this title.\nThe consensus of scholarship has identified the \"Life\" of Piran as a copy of that of the Irish saint Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir with the names changed. While Piran's origins are not certain, it is generally accepted that he was Irish, that he spent time in Wales and later was expelled from Ireland because of his powerful preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Having been thrown into the sea tied to a mill stone, he miraculously arrived on the shores of Cornwall where he built his tiny oratory and continued his work of evangelism, founding communities.\nSaint Piran's Flag, a white cross on a black background, is the county flag of Cornwall. Saint Piran's Day falls on 5 March.\nLife.\nPiran is the most famous of all the saints said to have come to Cornwall from Ireland. G. H. Doble thought that Piran was a Welshman from Glamorgan, citing the lost chapel once dedicated to him in Cardiff.\nFrom medieval times, since Brittonic languages and Goidelic languages regularly alternate p and k sounds, he had become erroneously identified with the Irish saint Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir who founded the monastery at Seir-Kieran in County Offaly. Joseph Loth has argued, on detailed philological grounds, that the names Piran and Ciar\u00e1n could not possibly refer to the same person.\nThe fourteenth-century \"Life of Saint Piran\", probably written at Exeter Cathedral, is a complete copy of an earlier Middle Irish life of Ciar\u00e1n of Saighir, with different parentage and a different ending that takes into account Piran's works in Cornwall, and especially details of his death and the movements of his Cornish shrine; thus \"excising the passages which speak of his burial at Saighir\" (Doble).\nProfessor Nicholas Orme writes in his \"Churches of Medieval Exeter\", that \"it may well be that Piran was the inspiration for the Kerrian dedication (in Exeter), albeit believed (as Piran usually was) to be identical with Ciar\u00e1n.\" Also, the saint of the church in Exeter was \"Keranus\" or \"Kyeranus\" [Queranus] in Latin documents, with \"Kerrian\" being the local vernacular pronunciation.\nThe St Piran Trust has undertaken research which suggests that Piran was either Ciar\u00e1n of Saighir or a disciple, as indicated by James Brennan of Kilkenny and T. F. G. Dexter, whose thesis is held in the Royal Cornwall Museum. \nThe Celtic scholar Charles Plummer suggested that Piran might, instead, be identified with Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise, who founded the monastery of Clonmacnoise also in County Offaly, but this is doubtful since this saint is believed to have died of yellow fever at the age of thirty-two and was buried at Clonmacnoise. His father is, however, sometimes said to have been a Cornishman. David Nash Ford accepts the Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise identification, whilst further suggesting that Piran's father in the Exeter life, Domuel, be identified with Dywel fab Erbin, a fifth-century prince of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall).\n5 March is the traditional feast day of both Saint Ciar\u00e1n of Saighir and Saint Piran. However the Calendar of Launceston Church records an alternative date of 18 November for the latter. In Perranzabuloe parish Perran Feast is traditionally celebrated on the last Monday in October. On the previous Sunday there are services at the site of St Piran's Oratory and in the parish church of St Piran.\nDeath and veneration.\nPiran was reportedly executed by Theodoric or Tador, King of Cornwall in 480, about the time of Vortigern (Usher's Prim. 869). It is also said that at his death, the remains of the Blessed Martin the Abbot which he had brought from Ireland were buried with him at Perranzabuloe.\nHis own remains were subsequently exhumed and redistributed to be venerated in various reliquaries. Exeter Cathedral was reputed to be the possessor of one of his arms, while according to an inventory, St Piran's Old Church, Perranzabuloe, had a reliquary containing his head and also a hearse in which his body was placed for processionals. In 1443, Cornish nobleman, Sir John Arundell bequeathed money in his will for the preservation of the head of St Piran in the chapel at Perranzabuloe.\nThe churches at Perranuthnoe and Perranarworthal were dedicated to Piran and holy wells at Perranwell and Probus, Cornwall are named after him. In Brittany St. Peran, Loperan and Saint-Perran are also named after him. The former Methodist chapel at Laity Moor has served as the Orthodox Church of Archangel Michael and Holy Piran since 1996.\nThe earliest documented link to the design of the St Piran's Flag with Piran is on the coat of arms of the \"de Saint-P\u00e9ran\" or \"Saint-Pezran\" (pronounced \"P\u00e9ran\") family from Cornouaille in Brittany. The earliest evidence known comes from the 15th century, with the arms being \"De sable \u00e0 la croix patt\u00e9e d'argent.\" (a black shield with a white cross patt\u00e9e).\nMount St. Piran is a mountain in Banff National Park near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, named after the saint. St Piran's crab, \"Clibanarius erythropus\", was also named in his honour, in 2016.\nSt Piran's Day.\nSt Piran's Day on 5 March is popular in Cornwall and the term 'Perrantide' has been coined to describe the week prior to this day. Many Cornish-themed events occur in the county and also in areas in which there is a large community descended from Cornish emigrants. The village of Perranporth ('Porthpyran' in Cornish) hosts the annual inter-Celtic festival of https://, which is also named in honour of him.\nOne St Piran's Day event is the march across the dunes to St Piran's cross which hundreds of people attend, generally dressed in black, white and gold, and carrying the Cornish Flag. A play of the Life of St Piran, in Cornish, has been enacted since 2000 at the event. Daffodils are also carried and placed at the cross. Daffodils also feature in celebrations in Truro, most likely due to their 'gold' colour. Black, white and gold are colours associated with Cornwall due to St Piran's Flag (black and white), and the Duchy Shield (gold coins on black).\nIn 2006 Cornish MP Dan Rogerson asked the government to make 5 March a public holiday in Cornwall to recognise celebrations for St Piran's Day.\nIn 2010, a short movie about St. Piran was made and premiered at the Heartland Film Festival.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mattel owns the rights to manufacture \"Scrabble\" outside the U.S. and Canada. As of 2008, the game is sold in 121 countries and is available in more than 30 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide, and roughly one-third of American homes and half of British homes have a \"Scrabble\" set. There are approximately 4,000 \"Scrabble\" clubs around the world.\nEquipment.\n\"Scrabble\" is played on a 15x15 board, containing 225 squares. Certain squares are premium squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple word\" squares, 17 pale red \"double word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol, 12 dark blue \"triple letter\" squares, and 24 pale blue \"double letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL, but the original premium square color scheme is still preferred for \"Scrabble\" boards used in tournaments.\nAn English-language set contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value between 1 and 10. Each tile's point value is based on its frequency in English, with vowels and common letters such as L, N, R, S, and T worth 1 point, and rare letters such as Q and Z worth 10 points. The remaining two tiles are blank and carry no value. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are square and thick, slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Each player uses a rack that conceals their tiles from other players.\nHistory.\nIn 1931 in Poughkeepsie, New York, the American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented, called \"Lexiko\". The two games had the same set of letter tiles, whose distributions and point values Butts worked out by performing a frequency analysis of letters from various sources, including \"The New York Times\". The new game, which he called \"Criss-Crosswords\", added the 15\u00d715 gameboard and the crossword-style gameplay. He manufactured a few sets himself but was not successful in selling the game to any major game manufacturers of the day.\nIn 1948, James Brunot, a resident of Newtown, Connecticut, and one of the few owners of the original \"Criss-Crosswords\" game, bought the rights to manufacture the game in exchange for granting Butts a royalty on every unit sold. Although he left most of the game (including the distribution of letters) unchanged, Brunot slightly rearranged the \"premium\" squares of the board and simplified the rules; he also renamed the game \"Scrabble\", a real word that means \"scratch frantically\". In 1949, Brunot and his family made sets in a converted former schoolhouse in Dodgingtown, Connecticut, a section of Newtown. They made 2,400 sets that year but lost money.\nIn 1952, unable to meet demand himself, Brunot licensed the manufacturing rights to Long Island-based Selchow and Righter, one of the manufacturers that, like Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley Company, had previously rejected the game. \"It's a nice little game. It will sell well in bookstores,\" Selchow and Righter president Harriet T. Righter remembered saying about Scrabble when she first saw it. In its second year as a Selchow and Righter product, 1954, nearly four million sets were sold. Selchow and Righter then bought the trademark to the game in 1972.\nSelchow and Righter imported Scrabble tiles for the North American market from a factory in Germany until 1979, when they, and subsequent owners of the Scrabble brand, reshored North American tile production to the United States for roughly two decades. From 1979 to 1998 Scrabble tiles for the North American market were produced in Fairfax, Vermont, and packaged for distribution and sale in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. At its busiest the 55,000 square foot Fairfax factory produced over one million Scrabble tiles a day and employed upwards of 150 people.\nMeanwhile, JW Spear acquired the rights to sell the game in Australia and the UK on January 19, 1955. In 1986, Selchow and Righter was sold to Coleco, which soon afterward went bankrupt. Hasbro then purchased Coleco's assets in 1989, including \"Scrabble\" and \"Parcheesi\". Mattel then acquired JW Spear in 1994. Since then, Hasbro has owned the rights to manufacture \"Scrabble\" in the U.S. and Canada, and Mattel has held the rights to manufacture the game in other parts of the world.\nIn 1984, \"Scrabble\" was turned into a daytime game show on NBC. The \"Scrabble\" game show ran from July 1984 to March 1990, with a second run from January to June 1993. The show was hosted by Chuck Woolery. Its tagline in promotional broadcasts was, \"Every man dies; not every man truly Scrabbles.\" In 2011, a new TV variation of \"Scrabble\", called \"Scrabble Showdown\", aired on The Hub cable channel, which is a joint venture of Discovery Communications, Inc. and Hasbro.\n\"Scrabble\" was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2004.\nEvolution of the rules.\nThe \"box rules\" included in each copy of the North American edition have been edited four times: in 1953, 1976, 1989, and 1999.\nThe major changes in 1953 were as follows.\nThe major changes in 1976 were as follows.\nThe editorial changes made in 1989 did not affect gameplay.\nThe major changes in 1999 were as follows.\nRules.\nBefore the game, a word list or dictionary is selected in order to adjudicate any challenges during the game. In tournament play, the word list is specified in advance, typically the NASPA Word List, the \"Official Scrabble Players Dictionary\", or Collins Scrabble Words. All 100 tiles are placed into an opaque bag. One player is selected to go first; a commonly used method is for each player to draw one tile from the bag, and whoever draws a letter alphabetically closest to A goes first (blanks supersede A). Each player then draws seven tiles and places them on their rack, hidden from other players.\nGameplay.\nOn every turn, the player at turn can perform one of the following options:\nThe first play of the game must consist of at least two tiles and cover the center square (H8). Any play thereafter must use at least one of the player's tiles to form a \"main word\" (containing all of the player's played tiles in a straight line) reading left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Diagonal plays are not allowed. At least one tile must be adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a tile already on the board. If the play includes a blank tile, the player must designate the letter the blank represents; that letter remains unchanged for the rest of the game unless the play is challenged off. The player announces the score for that play, and then draws tiles from the bag equal to the number of tiles played, so that there are seven tiles on their rack. If there are not enough tiles, the player draws any remaining tiles instead. If the game is played using a clock, the player starts the opponent's clock after announcing the score and before drawing tiles. Players may keep track of tiles played during the game.\nIf a player has made a play and not yet drawn a tile, any other player may choose to challenge any or all words formed by the play. The challenged word(s) are then searched in the agreed-upon word list or dictionary. If at least one challenged word is unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, and the player scores zero for that turn. If all challenged words are acceptable, the challenger loses their turn. In tournament play, players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid or the definitions of any challenged words. Penalties for unsuccessfully challenging an acceptable play vary in club and tournament play and are described in greater detail below.\nEnd of game.\nThe game ends when either:\nAt the end of the game, each player's score is reduced by the sum of the values of their unplayed tiles; if a player plays out, the sum of all other players' unplayed tiles is added to that player's score. This rule differs slightly in most tournaments; a player who plays out adds twice this sum, and the opponent's score is unchanged.\nScoring.\nThe score for a play is determined as follows:\nScoreless turns can occur when a player passes, exchanges tiles, loses a challenge, or otherwise makes an illegal move. A scoreless turn can also occur if a play consists of only blank tiles, but this is extremely unlikely in actual play.\nScoring example.\nSee the example board at right. \nSuppose Player 1 plays QUITE 8D, with the Q on a DLS and the E on the center star. Because the center star is a DWS, the score for this play is formula_1 points.\nPlayer 2 extends the play to form the word MES(QUITE) 8A with the M on the TWS at 8A. The score for this play is formula_2 points. The Q is not doubled, as the Q was not played on this turn.\nPlayer 1 plays INFaNCY 9D with a blank A, forming five 2-letter words, QI, UN, IF, TA, and EN. Because several additional words were formed, each new word is scored separately. The score for this play, without the 50-point bonus, is\nformula_3 points. Because all 7 tiles were played on this turn, a 50-point bonus is added, and the score for this play is formula_4 points.\nPlayer 2 plays RECO(UN)TS E4 through the word UN. Because this word covers two DWS squares, the score for this word is quadrupled, and the score for the play is formula_5 points. Player 1 is ahead 136\u201397.\nAcceptable words.\nAll words of length 2 to 15 letters that appear in the agreed-upon dictionary or lexicon are acceptable words in \"Scrabble\", as are all their inflected forms and plurals. Words that contain apostrophes, are hyphenated or capitalized (such as proper nouns) are generally not allowed unless they also appear as acceptable entries; for example, words such as HERES, JACK and TEXAS, while typically containing an apostrophe or considered a proper noun, have unrelated meanings and are therefore acceptable in major Scrabble lexicons. Acronyms and abbreviations are generally not allowed unless they have separate entries (such as AWOL, RADAR, SCUBA, and WYSIWYG). Variant spellings, slang or offensive terms, archaic or obsolete terms, and specialized jargon words are acceptable if they meet all other criteria for acceptability, but archaic spellings (e.g., NEEDE or MAKETH) are generally not acceptable words. Foreign words are generally not allowed in English-language \"Scrabble\" unless they have been incorporated into the English language, such as the words QI, KILIM, and PATISSERIE.\nVulgar and offensive words are generally excluded from the \"Official Scrabble Players Dictionary\" but allowed in club and tournament play. The North American Scrabble Players Association removed slurs from its lexicon in 2020, after conducting a poll of its members. Mattel removed 400 derogatory terms from its official word list in 2021, in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, with the company's head of games saying: \"Can you imagine any other game where you can score points and win by using a racial epithet? It\u2019s long overdue.\" This does not exclude players from playing these words, as it is within the rules of the game to play unacceptable words (at the risk of losing a challenge).\nThere are two popular competition word lists for English-language Scrabble:\nThe first predominates in the U.S., Canada, and Thailand, and the second in English Scrabble in the rest of the world. There is also a large community of competitive Collins players in North America, with its own NASPA rating system.\nNWL and OSPD.\nToday's NASPA Word List (NWL), published by NASPA Games, descends from the \"Official Tournament and Club Word List\" (a non-bowdlerized version of the \"Official Scrabble Players Dictionary\") and its companion \"Long Words List\" for longer words. The current version of NWL is NWL2023, effective February 2024, and the \"Official Scrabble Players Dictionary\", published by Merriam-Webster, is currently in its seventh edition of 2022. NWL includes all current OSPD words, plus several hundred offensive words and genericized trademarks such as KLEENEX; as of 2020, it no longer includes words judged to be personally applicable offensive slurs.\nThe NWL and OSPD are compiled using a number of major college-level dictionaries, principally those published by Merriam-Webster. If a word appears, at least historically, in any one of the dictionaries, it is included in the NWL and the OSPD. If the word has only an offensive meaning, it is included only in the NWL. The key difference between the OSPD and the NWL is that the OSPD is marketed for \"home and school\" use, without words which their source dictionaries judged offensive, rendering the \"Official Scrabble Players Dictionary\" less fit for official \"Scrabble\" play. The OSPD is available in bookstores, while the NWL is available only through NASPA.\n\"Collins Scrabble Words\".\nIn all other English-speaking countries, the competition word list is \"Collins Scrabble Words\" 2021 edition, known as CSW21 (Versions of this lexicon before 2007 were known as SOWPODS). Historically, this list has contained all OTCWL words plus words sourced from the Chambers and Collins English dictionaries, but recent editorial decisions have caused greater discrepancies between CSW and NWL. CSW is commonly used to adjudicate major tournaments outside North America.\nTournaments are also played using CSW in North America, particularly since Hasbro ceased to control tournament play in 2009. NASPA, the https://, and https:// (CoCo) all sanction CSW tournaments, using separate Elo rating systems.\nChallenges.\nThe penalty for a successfully challenged play is nearly universal: the offending player removes the tiles played and forfeits their turn. (In some online games, an option known as \"void\" may be used, wherein unacceptable words are automatically rejected by the program. The player is then required to make another play, with no penalty applied.)\nThe penalty for an unsuccessful challenge (where all words challenged in the play are deemed valid) varies considerably, including:\nUnder tournament rules, a player may request to \"hold\" the opponent's play to consider challenging, provided that the opponent has not yet drawn replacement tiles. The holding player's clock still runs, and the opponent cannot draw replacement tiles for 15 seconds or until the hold is released but may draw tiles afterward (which must be kept separate). If a player successfully challenges, the opponent must reveal any replacement tiles before returning them to the bag.\nCompetitive play.\nClub and tournament play.\nTens of thousands play club and tournament \"Scrabble\" worldwide. The rules and equipment in tournament Scrabble differ somewhat from those typically found in casual play. For example, all tournament (and most club) games are played with a game clock and a set time control, and are only between two players (or occasionally, two teams of players). A player who goes overtime does not immediately lose the game (as in chess), but is instead assessed a 10-point penalty per minute. Also, the original wooden tiles are not allowed in tournaments as it is possible for players to \"feel\" the tiles in the bag (especially blank tiles); thus, molded plastic tiles are often used. Players are allowed tracking sheets containing the tile distribution, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played.\nRegularly held major tournaments include:\nOther important tournaments include:\n\"Scrabble\" clubs typically meet weekly and may typically hold one or more open, sanctioned tournaments per year.\nRecords.\nThe following records were achieved during international competitive club or tournament play, according to authoritative sources, including the book \"Everything Scrabble\" by Joe Edley and John D. Williams Jr. (revised edition, Pocket Books, 2001) and the Scrabble FAQ. When available, separate records are listed based upon different official word lists:\nTo date, new editions or revisions of these lists have not been considered substantial enough to warrant separate record-keeping.\nTwo other records are believed to have been achieved under a British format known as the \"high score rule\", in which a player's tournament result is determined only by the player's own scores, and not by the differentials between that player's scores and the opponents'. Play in this system \"encourages elaborate setups often independently mined by the two players\", and is significantly different from the standard game in which defensive considerations play a major role. While the \"high score\" rule has led to impressively high records, it is currently out of favor.\nMuch higher-scoring plays are possible (e.g., plays covering three TWS squares), but extremely unlikely to occur without elaborate setups by both players. The highest reported score for a single play is 1786 points using the word oxyphenbutazone creating seven additional words simultaneously. When only adding the word SESQUIOXIDIZING to these official lists, one could theoretically score 2015 (OSPD) and 2044 (SOWPODS) points in a single move. The highest reported combined score for a theoretical game based on SOWPODS is 4054 points, constructed by Nathan Hedt of Australia.\nOther records are available for viewing at http://, an unofficial record book that includes the above as sources and expands on other topics.\nIn August 1984, Peter Finan and Neil Smith played \"Scrabble\" for 153 hours at St. Anselm's College, Birkenhead, Merseyside, setting a new duration record. A longer record was never recorded by \"Guinness Book of Records\", as the publishers decided that duration records of this nature were becoming too dangerous and stopped accepting them.\nSoftware.\nComputer players.\nMaven is a computer opponent for the game created by Brian Sheppard. The official \"Scrabble\" computer game in North America uses a version of Maven as its artificial intelligence and is published by Atari. Outside North America, the official \"Scrabble\" computer game is published by Ubisoft. Quackle is an open-source alternative to Maven of comparable strength, created by a five-person team led by Jason Katz-Brown. A Qt cross-platform version of Quackle is available on GitHub.\nVideo game versions.\nVideo game versions of \"Scrabble\" have been released for various platforms, including IBM PC compatibles, Mac, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Portable, iPod, iOS, Game.com, Palm OS, Amstrad CPC, Xbox 360, Kindle, Wii, and mobile phones.\nThe Nintendo DS version of \"Scrabble 2007 Edition\" made news when parents became angry over the game's AI using potentially offensive language during gameplay.\nWeb versions.\nSeveral websites offer the possibility to play \"Scrabble\" online against other users, such as the Internet Scrabble Club, Pogo.com from Electronic Arts (North America only), and http://.\nFacebook initially offered a variation of \"Scrabble\" called Scrabulous as a third-party application add-on. On July 24, 2008, Hasbro filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against its developers. Four days later, Scrabulous was disabled for users in North America, eventually reappearing as \"Lexulous\" in September 2008, with changes made to distinguish it from Scrabble. By December 20, Hasbro had withdrawn its lawsuit.\nMattel launched its official version of online \"Scrabble\", \"Scrabble by Mattel\", on Facebook in late March 2008. The application was developed by Gamehouse, a division of RealNetworks that was licensed by Mattel. Since Hasbro controls the copyright for North America with the copyright for the rest of the world belonging to Mattel, the Gamehouse Facebook application was available only to players outside the United States and Canada. The version developed by Electronic Arts for Hasbro was available throughout the world.\nWhen Gamehouse ceased support for its application, Mattel replaced it with the Electronic Arts version in May 2013. This decision was met with criticism from its userbase. The Hasbro version continues to be available worldwide but now uses IP lookup to display Hasbro branding to North American players and Mattel branding to the rest of the world. Electronic Arts have also released mobile apps for Android and iOS, allowing players to continue the same game on more than one platform.\nAs well as facilities to play occasional games online, there are many options to play in leagues.\nIn 2020, the license for Scrabble passed from Electronic Arts to Scopely, which launched the app Scrabble GO on March 5, 2020, with the Electronic Arts version discontinued on June 5, 2020. The new app was very different, leading to protests, and Scopely soon began to offer a 'Classic' version, without some of the extras initially offered: \"this updated mode is reimagined to reflect the ask for a streamlined experience. Features such as boosts, rewards and all other game modes are disabled\", the company announced.\nVariations.\n\"Super Scrabble\".\nA new licensed product, \"Super Scrabble\", was launched in North America by Winning Moves Games in 2004 under license from Hasbro, with the deluxe version (with turntable and lock-in grid) released in February 2007. A Mattel-licensed product for the rest of the world was released by Tinderbox Games in 2006. This set comprises 200 tiles in slightly modified distribution to the standard set and a 21\u00d721 playing board.\nNational versions.\nVersions of the game have been released in several other languages.\nThe game was called Alfapet when it was introduced in Sweden in 1954, but since the mid-1990s, the game has also been known as Scrabble in Sweden. Alfapet is now another crossword game, developed by the owners of the name Alfapet. A Russian version is called \"Erudit\". A Hebrew version is called Shabets Na (\u05e9\u05d1\u05e5 \u05e0\u05d0). Versions have been prepared for Dakotah, Haitian Creole, Dakelh (Carrier language), and Tuvan.\nFor languages with digraphs counted as single letters, such as Welsh and Hungarian, the game features separate tiles for those digraphs.\nAn Irish-language version of Scrabble was published by Gl\u00f3r na nGael in 2010. The previous year the same organisation published the Junior version of the game and two years later it republished Junior Scrabble using a two-sided (and two skill level) board.\nTelevision game show version.\nIn 1987, a board game was released by Selchow &amp; Righter, based on the game show hosted by Chuck Woolery that aired on NBC from 1984 to 1990 (and for five months in 1993). Billed as the \"Official Home Version\" of the game show (or officially as the \"TV Scrabble Home Game\"), gameplay bears more resemblance to the game show than it does to a traditional \"Scrabble\" game, although it does utilize a traditional \"Scrabble\" gameboard in play.\nGames based on \"Scrabble\".\nThere are numerous variations of the game. While they are similar to the original \"Scrabble\" game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different board layout, whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of seven. \"Words with Friends\" uses a different board layout and different letter values, as does \"Words of Gold\".\nDuplicate Scrabble is a popular variant in French speaking countries. Every player has the same letters on the same board and the players must submit a paper slip at the end of the allotted time (usually 3 minutes) with the highest scoring word they have found. This is the format used for the French World Scrabble Championships but it is also used in Romanian and Dutch. There is no limit to the number of players that can be involved in one game, and at Vichy in 1998 there were 1,485 players, a record for French \"Scrabble\" tournaments.\n\"Scarabeo\" is a variant that is much more popular in Italy than the original game. It features a 17\u00d717 grid of cells and peculiar rules.\nPopular among tournament \"Scrabble\" players is \"Clabbers\". In \"Clabbers\", any move that consists of anagrams of allowable words is allowed. For example, because ETAERIO is allowable in ordinary Collins Scrabble, EEAIORT would be allowable in \"Clabbers\".\nA junior version, called \"Junior Scrabble\", has been marketed. This has slightly different distributions of frequencies of letter tiles to the standard \"Scrabble\" game.\nWord games similar to or influenced by \"Scrabble\" include \"Bananagrams\", \"Boggle\", \"Dabble\", \"Nab-It!\", \"Perquackey\", \"Puzzlage\", \"Quiddler\", \"Scribbage\", \"Tapple\", \"Upwords\", and \"WordSpot\".\nThere are also number-based variations, such as \"Equate\".\nGameboard formats.\nThe game has been released in numerous gameboard formats appealing to various user groups. The original boards included wood tiles and many \"deluxe\" sets still do.\nTile Lock editions.\n\"Tile Lock\" editions of \"Scrabble\" and \"Super Scrabble\" are made by Winning Moves and feature smaller, plastic tiles that are held in place on the board with little plastic posts. The standard version features exactly the same 100 tiles as regular \"Scrabble\". The Tile Lock Super Scrabble features the same 200 tiles that are in Super Scrabble.\nTravel editions.\nEditions are available for travelers who may wish to play in a conveyance such as a train or plane or to pause a game in progress and resume later. Many versions thus include methods to keep letters from moving, such as pegboards, recessed tile holders and magnetic tiles. Players' trays are also designed with stay-fast holders. Such boards are also typically designed to be reoriented by each player to put the board upright during the game, as well as folded and stowed with the game in progress.\nDeluxe editions.\nAt the opposite end, some \"deluxe\" or \"prestige\" editions offer superior materials and features. These include editions on a rotating turntable, so players can always face the board, with the letters upright and a raised grid that holds the tiles in place. Also available are alternative \"Scrabble\" boards, often made of glass or hardwood, that have superior rotating mechanisms and personalized graphics.\nLarge print and braille editions.\nAn edition has been released (in association with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)) with a larger board and letters for players with impaired vision. The colours on the board are more contrasting, and the font size has been increased from 16 to 24 point. The tiles are in bold 48 point, and have braille labels. A separate braille edition is also available.\nWorld's Smallest edition.\nReleased by Super Impulse, \"World's Smallest Scrabble\" measures 3 \u00d7 1.75 \u00d7 0.5 inches. It has the full gameplay of the standard version, with a board, a case, and 99 magnetic tiles. It is available worldwide, with Hasbro branding in the U.S. and Canada and Mattel branding elsewhere.\nWorks related to \"Scrabble\".\nBooks.\nNumerous books about \"Scrabble\" have been published, including nonfiction titles helping players improve their game, and fiction titles using the game as a plot device. These include:\nDocumentaries.\nNumerous documentaries have been made about the game, including:\nGame shows.\n\"Scrabble\" has been adapted into multiple television game shows.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sedevacantism owes its origins to the rejection of the theological and disciplinary changes implemented following the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965).\nThe term \"sedevacantism\" is derived from the Latin phrase , which means \"the chair [of the Bishop of Rome] being vacant\". The phrase is commonly used to refer specifically to a vacancy of the Holy See which takes place from the pope's death or renunciation to the election of his successor.\nThe number of sedevacantists is unknown and difficult to measure; estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Various factions of conclavists among sedevacantists have proceeded to end the perceived vacancy in the Holy See by electing their own pope.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"sedevacantism\" derives from the Latin term \"sede vacante\", which means \"with the chair being vacant\". In the Catholic Church, when an episcopal see becomes vacant due to the death or removal of a Bishop from office for whatever reason, in the interim the diocese is automatically in a state of \"sede vacante\", until a new designate is appointed and duly elevated to his see. With Sedevacantism, this is specifically in reference to the See of Saint Peter, i.e., the Catholic Papacy.\nThe Sedevacantist thesis that the post-Second Vatican Council claimants to the Papacy operating out of the Vatican City are non-Catholic Antipopes, originated from a 1973 work, \"Sede Vacante: Paul VI is Not a Legitimate Pope\", by the Mexican Jesuit priest Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1enz Arriaga. However, there were some instances of proto-sedevacatism, \"avant la lettre\", reaching back into the 1960s.\nHistory.\nEarly sedevacantism: origins in the 1960s.\nSedevacantism, \"avant la lettre\", is evidenced from the mid-1960s, as part of a response to the Second Vatican Council in the Roman Catholic Church. The earliest example is from a group of traditionalist Catholics in Mexico associated with the radical right secret society \"Los TECOS\" based in Guadalajara, in particular their spiritual director, Fr. Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1enz y Arriaga, a Jesuit priest. In 1965, at a private meeting in the house of Anacleto Gonz\u00e1lez Guerrero (son of the \"Cristero\" martyr Anacleto Gonz\u00e1lez Flores), \"Los TECOS\" leaders proposed the motion that Paul VI (Giovanni Montini) was a crypto-Jew and an illegitimate Pope, and that this line should be officially adopted as the position of Mexican traditionalists.\nA connected secret society, based in Puebla under Ram\u00f3n Plata Moreno, known as \"El Yunque\", although ultra-conservative as well and unhappy about the liberalising changes in the Catholic world, rejected the proposal of \"Los TECOS\", stating that Pope Paul VI was indeed the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. This led to a deadly split in the Mexican traditionalist scene.\nEarlier, during the Second Vatican Council, \"Los TECOS\" had distributed a document entitled \"Complotto contro la Chiesa\" (\"The Plot Against the Church\") under the pseudonym of Maurice Pinay, warning Council fathers of a supposed \"Judeo-Masonic-Communist\" plot to infiltrate and destroy Christianity and the Catholic Church.\nAnother early expositor from Latin America was in Argentina, a personal associate of Juan Per\u00f3n, belonging to the Catholic wing of orthodox Peronism, who raised the question in 1969 with his book \"Pontificado y Pont\u00edfice: una breve quaestio teol\u00f3gica\".\n\"The New Montinian Church\" (1970s).\nAs changes in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council filtered down to the local diocesan and parish level by the early 1970s, especially with the introduction of a New Order of Mass as the primary form of public worship, the sedevacantist issue began to be voiced more stridently and publicly by its advocates. One landmark was the 1971 work by Fr. S\u00e1enz y Arriaga, called \"The New Montinian Church\", which explicitly brought into the public sphere views that had previously circulated in private among these nascent groups. \"The New Montinian Church\" claimed: \"My suspicions appear confirmed, Giovanni Battista Montini was invalidly elected to the Papacy and, thus, is not a true Pope. Because of this ritualistic symbol of Judaism and Masonry, I suspect that Paul VI was not only the most efficient instrument of the 'Jewish Mafia,' but an integral part of this Mafia.\" A public controversy ensued and the Vatican, acting through the local ordinary, Cardinal Miguel Dar\u00edo Miranda y G\u00f3mez declared the \"suspension a divinis\" of the S\u00e1enz y Arriaga.\nS\u00e1enz y Arriaga founded the publication \"Trento\" (in reference to the Council of Trent) in 1972 to promote sedevacantism, along with Mexican priests, Fr. Mois\u00e9s Carmona and Fr. Adolfo Zamora. This was followed up by the 1973 work \"Sede Vacante: Paul VI is Not a Legitimate Pope\", from which the theory was framed more comprehensively and from which the sedevacantist movement would derive its name.\nThe earliest American traditionalist organisation to take up the line of Fr. S\u00e1enz y Arriaga was the Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement, which was founded in 1973 under Fr. Francis Fenton (a member of the National Council of the John Birch Society). The group also included Fr. Robert McKenna who would go on to become a significant figure in sedevacantism and later a Th\u1ee5c-line Bishop. However, the most numerically significant American group would be founded by a Catholic layman, Francis Schuckardt, eventually called the Traditional Latin Rite Catholic Church (TLRCC).\nPositions.\nPrincipal claims.\nSedevacantism is based on rejection of theological and disciplinary changes implemented following the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965). Sedevacantists reject this council, on the basis of their interpretations of its documents on ecumenism and religious liberty, among others, which they see as contradicting the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church and as denying the unique mission of Catholicism as the one true religion, outside of which there is no salvation. They also say that new disciplinary norms, such as the Mass of Paul VI promulgated on 3 April 1969, undermine or conflict with the historical Catholic faith and are deemed blasphemous, while post-Vatican II teachings, particularly those related to ecumenism, are labelled heresies. They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and of postconciliar church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false. Even amongst traditionalist Catholics, this is a quite divisive question.\nTraditionalist Catholics who are not sedevacantists recognize the line of popes leading to and including Pope Leo XIV as legitimate. Sedevacantists, however, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope John XXIII and his successors have left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority. A notorious heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.\nMost sedevacantists believe that this \"Great Apostasy\" started with the Second Vatican Council, although there are disagreements about whether the last legitimate Pope was John XXIII or Pius XII, with the latter position being held by those who believe the 1958 conclave results were illegitimate; this particular belief is usually associated with the Giuseppe Siri conspiracy theory. However, there are other sedevacantist positions that describe the Great Apostasy as having started with Benedict XV in 1914, meaning that Pope Pius XII and Pope Pius XI were also heretics and making the last legitimate Pope Saint Pius X.\nWhile sedevacantist arguments often hinge on interpretations of modernism as being a heresy, this is also debated.\nAuthority to declare an Antipope.\nAn issue facing sedevacantists in attempting to justify their position, was how to deal with the question of who from a Catholic perspective has the legitimate authority to judge or declare a man, who the world at large considered the legitimate Pope (Paul VI), to instead be a non-Catholic Antipope and manifest, public and notorious heretic.\nThe \u201cJesuit\u201d faction, represented by Fr. Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1enz y Arriaga and his base within the Mexican sedevacantists and later American factions influenced by them such as the CMRI, looked especially to Doctor of the Church, Robert Bellarmine and Francisco Su\u00e1rez. The CMRI cites Bellarmine, writing in his \"De Romano Pontifice\": \u201cThe pope manifestly a heretic ceases by himself to be pope and head, in the same way as he ceases to be a Christian and a member of the body of the Church; and for this reason, he can be judged and punished by the Church. This is the opinion of all the ancient Fathers, who teach that manifest heretics lose immediately all jurisdiction.\u201d That is to say, by becoming a public and notorious heretic, a reigning Pontiff tacitly resigns office automatically by the very act of consenting to heresy itself, without any formal procedure being required.\nGiven that the sedevacantist movement during the time of Paul VI consisted of a very small number of lower clergymen who had been ordained by the Roman Catholic Church and laymen who had followed them (being without a single Bishop who publicly endorsed the sedevacantist position in public until Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c in the early 1980s), the likelihood that such juridical proceedings by a General Council would be initiated against Paul VI was incredibly marginal. After the death of Paul VI in 1978, the opportunity to do this had passed and Gu\u00e9rard des Lauriers was forced, by the logic of his own arguments, to adopt the position of sedeprivationism in 1979 \u2013 breaking with sedevacantism proper or \u201ctotalism\u201d as it is sometimes called \u2013 claiming instead that the Vatican-based, post-Conciliar claimants to the Papacy were indeed Popes \u201cmaterially but not formally.\u201d\nCircumstances for a future Pope.\nSince the 1990s, a small number of ex-sedevacantists became conclavists and have had themselves \"elected\" claiming to be Pope, using different methods; the most notable of these are David Bawden, Victor von Pentz and Lucian Pulvermacher, but they gained negligible acceptance and credibility within sedevacantism.\nProfessor Tom\u00e1s Tello Corraliza, a Spanish sedevacantist, authored a study in 1994 entitled \u201cThe Election of the Pope,\" exploring possibilities. This was subsequently published in the German journal \"Einsicht\" (No. 1, February 2003), edited by Dr. Eberhard Heller, where he explores the opinions of influential Catholic theologians on this question, including Thomas Cajetan, Robert Bellarmine, Francisco de Vitoria, John of St. Thomas, , Louis Billot and Charles Journet. Another position, favoured by Tello, is that of de Vitoria, founder of the School of Salamanca, who in his work \"De ecclesiastica potestate\" (\u201cOn the Church Power\u201d), suggested in the absence of Cardinals, faithful Catholic Bishops in General Council (to the exclusion of the laity and lower clergy) could elect a new Pope.\nClergy, Mass, and sacraments.\nSome sedevacantists accept the consecrations and ordinations of sedevacantist bishops and priests, and the offering of Masses and the administration of sacraments by the said bishops and priests, to be licit because of \"epikea\", i.e. \"the interpretation of the mind and will of him who made the law\".\n\"Una cum\" liturgical controversy.\nAnthony Cekada considers that a question among sedevacantists is whether it is permissible to go to Masses and whether or not it amounts to a mortal sin. These masses are Traditional Latin Masses naming the man in the Vatican City whom most of the world considers to be the Pope, in the Roman Canon in the prayer, specifically where the priest says (\"together with Your Servant N., our Pope.\"). Cekada argues that it is not, under any circumstances, permissible.\nBelievers and organisations.\nBecause sedevacantists, particularly the laity, are not concentrated into one single organisation, it is difficult to ascertain exact numbers of sedevacantists in the world, however the number has been estimated at around 30,000 people worldwide. These are mostly concentrated in the United States, Mexico, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Australia and the United Kingdom, but the actual size of the movement has never been accurately assessed. It remains extremely difficult to do so for a wide range of reasons, such as the fact that not all sedevacantists identify as such, nor do they necessarily belong to avowedly sedevacantist groups or societies.\nSedevacantist groups.\nSedevacantist groups include:\nEarly proponents.\nEarly proponents of sedevacantism include:\nSedevacantist bishops.\nConsecrated before Vatican II.\nThe only known Catholic bishop consecrated before the Second Vatican Council who publicly became sedevacantist was Vietnamese Archbishop Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c (consecrated in 1938), former Vicar Apostolic of V\u0129nh Long, Vietnam and former Archbishop of Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam.\nBishop Alfredo M\u00e9ndez-Gonzalez (consecrated in 1960), former Bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, though not having publicly identified as a sedevacantist, associated himself with sedevacantist priests and consecrated a bishop for them.\nTh\u1ee5c-line bishops.\nMany sedevacantist bishops derive their claims to holy orders and episcopacy from Archbishop Th\u1ee5c or bishops of his lineage. \nSome bishops in the sedevacantist world derive their lineage from the Palmarian Catholic Church (also known as the Carmelites of the Holy Face); this is due to Th\u1ee5c having consecrated as Bishop Clemente Dom\u00ednguez y G\u00f3mez, later the Pope of the Palmarian Church and consequently the Palmarians making many more consecrations. An example of this from Spain is the case of sedevacantist bishop Pablo de Rojas S\u00e1nchez-Franco of the P\u00eda Uni\u00f3n de San Pablo Ap\u00f3stol, who was consecrated a bishop by Ricardo Subir\u00f3n Ferrandis, a former Palmarian bishop turned sedevacantist. De Rojas was at the centre of a significant controversy in 2024, as an entire monastery of nuns belonging to the Poor Clares from Belorado near Burgos, broke with the Vatican and came over to the sedevacantists under his protection.\nOn 7 May 1981, Th\u1ee5c consecrated the sedeprivationist French priest Michel-Louis Gu\u00e9rard des Lauriers as a bishop. Des Lauriers was a French Dominican theologian and a papal advisor.\nOn 17 October 1981, Th\u1ee5c consecrated the sedevacantist Mexican priests Mois\u00e9s Carmona and Adolfo Zamora as bishops. Carmona and Zamora had been sedevacantist leaders and propagators in Mexico.\nThe Vatican declared Th\u1ee5c \"latae sententiae\" excommunicated for these consecrations and for his declaration of Sedevacantism.\nM\u00e9ndez-line bishops.\nOn 19 October 1993, in Carlsbad, California, United States, Bishop M\u00e9ndez-Gonzalez consecrated the sedevacantist Clarence Kelly of the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV) to the episcopacy. By M\u00e9ndez's wish, the consecration was kept secret until his death in 1995.\nWhose lineages derive from earlier movements.\nA considerable number of sedevacantist bishops are thought to derive their holy orders from Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa, who in 1945 set up his own independent Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church. While Duarte Costa was not a sedevacantist, he instead questioned the papacy as an institution, denying papal infallibility and rejecting the pope's universal jurisdiction. In further contrast to most Catholic traditionalists, Duarte Costa was left-wing.\nRelated concepts.\nSedeprivationism.\nIn contrast to sedevacantists, sedeprivationists affirm the Thesis of Cassiciacum by the Dominican theologian Bishop Michel-Louis Gu\u00e9rard des Lauriers as being a valid position, which states that John XXIII and his successors are popes (\"materially but not formally\"), and that post-Vatican II popes will become legitimate once they recant their heresies.\nSedeprivationism is the position endorsed by the .\nBenevacantism.\nA separate minority position called Benevacantism (a portmanteau of \"Benedict\" and \"sedevacantism\") holds that Pope Benedict XVI continued as pope following his resignation, with Pope Francis ruling as a heretical antipope. Since Benedict's death, some Benevacantists now hold to sedevacantism, while others considered Francis to be the Pope until Francis' death in 2025. The Vatican for its part, rarely acknowledges or addresses the claims of sedevacantists at all, however after increased visibility during the time of Francis, in 2024 he compared sedevacantists to \"mushrooms\" and said \"they carry sadness in their hearts, I have compassion for them\".\nSociety of St. Pius X.\nThe Society of St. Pius X, founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in 1970 as a \"pious union\" with the permission of Fran\u00e7ois Charri\u00e8re, the sitting Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg in Switzerland, was by far the largest traditionalist Catholic organisation internationally, founded to pushback against the introduction of a New Order of Mass and aspects of the Second Vatican Council. The public line taken by Lefebvre during his lifetime and the SSPX since, is to affirm the legitimacy of the claimants to the Papacy in the Vatican City, but to \"resist\" anything they claim is contrary to Catholic tradition; thus, as part of the traditionalist Catholic movement, they are adjacent to sedevacantism and have some overlap, but do not hold to the sedevacantist line and write articles in their journals critiquing it.\nIn the aftermath of the canonical visitation to the International Seminary of Saint Pius X in 1974, which led to the Vatican's withdrawal of the SSPX's \"pious union\" status, individual sedevacantists were tolerated and Archbishop Lefebvre stated to Cardinal Giovanni Benelli in 1976 after his \"suspension a divinis\", \"The post-Concillar Church is a schismatic Church, since it has broken with the Catholic Church that has always been\", without explicitly saying that Paul VI was not the Pope.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally serialized in Kodansha's \"sh\u014djo\" manga magazine \"Nakayoshi\" from 1991 to 1997; the 60 individual chapters (later reorganized into 52) and several side stories were compiled into 18 \"tank\u014dbon\" volumes. Set in Tokyo in the 1990s, the series follows the adventures of a schoolgirl named Usagi Tsukino as she transforms into the eponymous character to search for a magical artifact, the . She leads a group of comrades, the Sailor Soldiers, called Sailor Guardians in later editions, as they battle against villains to prevent the theft of the Silver Crystal and the destruction of the Solar System.\nThe manga was written in conjunction with the airing of an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which was broadcast in Japan from 1992 to 1997. Toei also developed three animated feature films, a television special, and three short films based on the anime. A live-action television adaptation, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\", aired from 2003 to 2004, and a second anime series, \"Sailor Moon Crystal\", began simulcasting in 2014. The manga series was licensed for an English release by Kodansha Comics in North America, and in Australia and New Zealand by Random House Australia. The entire anime series has been licensed by Viz Media for an English-language release in North America and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.\nSince its release, \"Sailor Moon\" has received critical acclaim, with praise for its art, characterization, and humor. The manga has sold over 46 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series, as well as one of the best-selling \"sh\u014djo\" manga series of all time, marking its importance in the history of manga. Additionally, the television series played a major role in popularizing anime in the Western world, particularly in the United States. The \"Sailor Moon\" franchise has generated over $ in worldwide merchandise sales.\nPlot.\nThe series focuses on Usagi Tsukino, a young middle school student in the Azabu-J\u016bban district of Tokyo in the 1990s, who learns from the talking cat Luna that she is actually a reincarnation of a princess from the Moon Kingdom, Sailor Moon. They are joined by Ami Mizuno, a student who awakens as Sailor Mercury; Rei Hino, a local Shinto shrine maiden who awakens as Sailor Mars; Makoto Kino, a tall and strong transfer student who awakens as Sailor Jupiter; and Minako Aino, a young aspiring idol who had awakened as Sailor Venus a few months earlier, accompanied by her talking feline companion Artemis. As they set out on their adventures, others join the Guardians later in the series, including Mamoru Chiba, a high school student who occasionally assists them as Tuxedo Mask; Chibiusa, Usagi and Mamoru's future daughter who awakens as Sailor Chibi Moon; Haruka Tenoh, a car-racer who can transform into Sailor Uranus; Michiru Kaioh, a violinist who can transform into Sailor Neptune; Setsuna Meioh, a physics student who can transform into Sailor Pluto; Hotaru Tomoe, who awakens as Sailor Saturn; and the Three Lights, pop idols who are really the Sailor Starlights. Together, they encounter extraterrestrials, space travelers, and other Guardians as they protect the Earth and the Moon from destruction by malevolent forces.\nProduction.\nConcept and creation.\nNaoko Takeuchi, after working on the 1991 Nami Akimoto manga \"Miracle Girls\", redeveloped \"Sailor Moon\" from her manga one-shot \"\", which was published on August 8, 1991, and featured Sailor Venus as the main protagonist. Takeuchi wanted to create a story with a theme about girls in outer space. While discussing with her editor, Fumio Osano, he suggested the addition of Sailor fuku. When \"Codename: Sailor V\" was proposed for adaptation into an anime by Toei Animation, Takeuchi redeveloped the concept so Sailor Venus became a member of a team. The resulting manga series became a fusion of the popular magical girl genre and the \"Super Sentai\" series, of which Takeuchi was a fan. Recurring motifs include astronomy, astrology, gemology, Greco-Roman mythology, Japanese elemental themes, teenage fashion trends, and schoolgirl antics. \"Codename: Sailor V\" would continue to run parallel to \"Sailor Moon\" as a serial, now recontextualized as an origin story for Sailor Venus.\nTakeuchi said discussions with Kodansha originally envisaged a single story arc; the storyline was developed in meetings a year before serialization began. After completing the arc, Toei and Kodansha asked Takeuchi to continue the series. She wrote four more story arcs, which were often published simultaneously with the five corresponding seasons of the anime adaptation. The anime ran one or two months behind the manga. As a result, the anime follows the storyline of the manga fairly closely, although there are deviations. Takeuchi later said because Toei's production staff was mostly male, she felt the anime had \"a slight male perspective\".\nTakeuchi later said that she planned to kill off the protagonists, but Osano rejected the notion and said, \"[\"Sailor Moon\"] is a \"sh\u014djo\" manga!\" When the anime adaptation was produced, the protagonists were killed in the final battle with the Dark Kingdom, although they were revived. Takeuchi resented that she was unable to do that in her version. Takeuchi also intended for the \"Sailor Moon\" anime adaptation to last for one season, but due to its immense popularity, Toei asked Takeuchi to continue the series. At first, she struggled to develop another storyline to extend the series. While discussing with Osano, he suggested the inclusion of Usagi's daughter from the future, Chibiusa.\nWesternization.\nWhen the \"Sailor Moon\" anime was first released in North America and dubbed in English in 1995, fans and academics alike noted that the dub had westernized the series by altering or removing Japanese names and cultural references. These included, but were not limited to, Sailor Moon's real name, Usagi Tsukino, being changed to Serena., and the name of Mamoru Chiba, Usagi's love interest, is changed to Darien Shields. The original main theme was changed from a romance ballad discussing Serena's (Usagi's) eternal love for Darien (Mamoru) to an anthem focused on Serena's newfound identity as the superheroine Sailor Moon.\nOther examples of westernization referenced by \"Sailor Moon\"'s audience included flipping scenes of traffic to have cars drive on the right side of the road, along with the English dub changing any conversations between characters that contained lesser-known Japanese cultural references, removing violent scenes, reducing visible nudity, and censoring LGBT+ characters, such as depicting the lesbian couple of Haruka and Michiru as cousins (while maintaining the intimacy of their relationship and thereby replacing the homoerotic context with an unintentional incestuous one).\nAccording to Bandai America, the company in charge of Sailor Moon merchandise in the Western Hemisphere, the approach to advertising \"Sailor Moon\" was to make the show and superheroine \"'culturally appropriate' for the American market\".\nMedia.\nManga.\nWritten and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi, \"Sailor Moon\" was serialized by Kodansha in the manga anthology \"Nakayoshi\" from December 28, 1991, to February 3, 1997. The side-stories were serialized simultaneously in \"RunRun\"\u2014another of Kodansha's manga magazines. The 52 individual chapters were published in 18 \"tank\u014dbon\" volumes by Kodansha from July 6, 1992, to April 4, 1997. In 2003, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 12 \"shinz\u014dban\" volumes to coincide with the release of the live-action series. The manga was retitled \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\" and included new cover art, and revised dialogue and illustrations. The ten individual short stories were also released in two volumes. In 2013, the chapters were once again re-released in 10 \"kanzenban\" volumes to commemorate the manga's 20th anniversary, which includes digitally remastered artwork, new covers, and color artwork from its \"Nakayoshi\" run. The books were enlarged from the typical Japanese manga size to A5. The short stories were republished in two volumes, with the order of the stories shuffled. \"Codename: Sailor V\" was also included in the third edition.\nThe \"Sailor Moon\" manga was initially licensed for an English release by Mixx (later Tokyopop) in North America. The manga was first published as a serial in \"MixxZine\" beginning in 1997, but was later removed from the magazine and made into a separate, low print monthly comic to finish the first, second, and third arcs. At the same time, the fourth and fifth arcs were printed in a secondary magazine, \"Smile\". Pages from the Tokyopop version of the manga ran daily in the Japanimation Station, a service accessible to users of America Online. The series was later collected into a three-part graphic novel series spanning eighteen volumes, which were published from December 1, 1998, to September 18, 2001. In May 2005, Tokyopop's license to the \"Sailor Moon\" manga expired, and its edition went out of print.\nIn 2011, Kodansha Comics announced that the company had acquired the license for the \"Sailor Moon\" manga and its lead-in series, \"Codename: Sailor V,\" in English. They published the twelve volumes of \"Sailor Moon\" simultaneously with the two-volume edition of \"Codename: Sailor V\" from September 2011 to July 2013. The first of the two related short story volumes was published on September 10, 2013; the second was published on November 26, 2013. At Anime Expo 2017, Kodansha Comics announced plans to re-release \"Sailor Moon\" in an \"Eternal Edition\", featuring a new English translation, new cover artwork by Takeuchi, and color pages from the manga's original run, printed on extra-large premium paper. The first Eternal Edition volume was published on September 11, 2018; the tenth and final volume was published on October 20, 2020. On July 1, 2019, Kondasha Comics began releasing the Eternal Editions digitally, following an announcement the day before about the series being released digitally in ten different languages. In November 2020, Kodansha Comics announced plans to re-release the \"Sailor Moon\" manga again as part of their \"Naoko Takeuchi Collection\". The company described the new edition as a \"more affordable, portable\" version of the Eternal Edition. The first volume was published on April 5, 2022, and the last on September 17, 2024.\n\"Sailor Moon\" has also been licensed in other English-speaking countries. In the United Kingdom, the volumes are distributed by Turnaround Publisher Services. In Australia, the manga is distributed by Penguin Books Australia.\nThe manga has been licensed in Russia as well as the CIS for distribution by publishing company XL Media. The first volume was released in 2018.\nAnime series &amp; films.\n\"Sailor Moon\".\nToei Animation produced an anime television series based on the 52 manga chapters, also titled \"Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon\". Junichi Sato directed the first season, Kunihiko Ikuhara took over the second through fourth season, and Takuya Igarashi directed the fifth and final season. The series premiered in Japan on TV Asahi on March 7, 1992, and ran for 200 episodes until its conclusion on February 8, 1997. Upon its release, the show quickly rose to be Toei Animation's highest-rated TV series. Most of the international versions, including the English adaptations, are titled \"Sailor Moon\".\n\"Sailor Moon Crystal\".\nOn July 6, 2012, Kodansha and Toei Animation announced that it would commence the production of a new anime adaptation of \"Sailor Moon\", called \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal\", for a simultaneous worldwide release in 2013 as part of the series's 20th anniversary celebrations, and stated that it would be a closer adaptation of the manga than the first anime. \"Crystal\" premiered on July 5, 2014, and new episodes would air on the first and third Saturdays of each month. A new cast was announced, along with Kotono Mitsuishi reprising her role as Sailor Moon. The first two seasons were released together, covering their corresponding arcs of the manga (\"Dark Kingdom\" and \"Black Moon\"). A third season based on the \"Infinity\" arc of the manga premiered on Japanese television on April 4, 2016, known as \"Death Busters\" in this adaptation. Munehisa Sakai directed the first and second seasons, while Chiaki Kon directed the third season.\nFilms and television specials.\nThree animated theatrical feature films based on the original \"Sailor Moon\" series have been released in Japan: ' in 1993, followed by ' in 1994, and \"\" in 1995. The films are side-stories that do not correlate with the timeline of the original series. A one-hour television special was aired on TV Asahi in Japan on April 8, 1995. Kunihiko Ikuhara directed the first film, while the latter two were directed by Hiroki Shibata.\nIn 1997, an article in \"Variety\" stated that The Walt Disney Company was interested in acquiring the rights to \"Sailor Moon\" as a live action film to be directed by Stanley Tong and Geena Davis set to portray as Queen Beryl, along with Winona Ryder and Elisabeth Shue starring as well. After Disney put the project on turnaround, Universal Pictures acquired the film rights.\nIn 2017, it was revealed that \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal\" anime's fourth season would be produced as a two-part theatrical anime film project, adapting the \"Dream\" arc from the manga. On June 30, 2019, it was announced that the title of the film would be \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie\". The first film was to be released on September 11, 2020, but was postponed and released on January 8, 2021, and the second film was released on February 11, 2021. Chiaki Kon returned from \"Crystal\"'s third season to direct the two films.\nIn 2022, it was announced that a sequel to \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie\", covering the \"Stars\" arc of the manga, would also be produced as a two-part theatrical anime film project, titled \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Cosmos The Movie\". The two films were directed by Tomoya Takahashi and were released on June 9 and 30, 2023, respectively.\nCompanion books.\nThere have been numerous companion books to \"Sailor Moon\". Kodansha released some of these books for each of the five story arcs, collectively called the \"Original Picture Collection\". The books contain cover art, promotional material, and other work by Takeuchi. Many of the drawings are accompanied by comments on the way she developed her ideas, created each picture, and commentary on the anime adaption of her story. Another picture collection, \"Volume Infinity\", was released as a self-published, limited-edition art book after the end of the series in 1997. This art book includes drawings by Takeuchi and her friends, her staff, and many of the voice actors who worked on the anime. In 1999, Kodansha published the \"Materials Collection\"; this contained development sketches and notes for nearly every character in the manga, and for some characters that never appeared. Each drawing includes notes by Takeuchi about costume pieces, the mentality of the characters, and her feelings about them. It also includes timelines for the story arcs and for the real-life release of products and materials relating to the anime and manga. A short story, \"Parallel Sailor Moon,\" is also featured, celebrating the year of the rabbit.\nNovels.\n\"Sailor Moon\" was also adapted for publication as novels and released in 1998. The first book was written by Stuart J. Levy. The following novels were written by Lianne Sentar.\nStage musicals.\nIn mid-1993, the first musical theater production based on \"Sailor Moon\" premiered and starred Anza Ohyama as Sailor Moon. Thirty such musicals in all have been produced, with one in pre-production. The show\u2019s stories include anime-inspired plotlines and original material. Music from the series has been released on about 20 memorial albums. The popularity of the musicals has been cited as a reason behind the production of the live-action television series, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\".\nDuring the original, run musicals ran in the winter and summer of each year, with summer musicals staged at the Sunshine Theater in the Ikebukuro area of Tokyo. In the winter, musicals toured to other large cities in Japan, including Osaka, Fukuoka, Nagoya, Shizuoka, Kanazawa, Sendai, Saga, Oita, Yamagata, and Fukushima. The final incarnation of the first run, , went on stage in January 2005, following which, Bandai officially put the series on a hiatus. On June 2, 2013, Fumio Osano announced on his Twitter page that the \"Sailor Moon\" musicals would begin again in September 2013. The 20th anniversary show \"La Reconquista\" ran from September 13 to 23 at Shibuya's AiiA Theater Tokyo, with Satomi \u014ckubo as Sailor Moon. Satomi \u014ckubo reprised the role in the 2014 production \"Petite \u00c9trang\u00e8re,\" which ran from August 21 to September 7, 2014, again at AiiA Theater Tokyo.\nLive-action film &amp; series.\nCancelled Disney film adaptation.\nDuring the 1990s, Disney had plans for a \"Sailor Moon\" film adaptation under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, but it was cancelled immediately. Not much was known, except for the fact that they had intended for Geena Davis to portray Queen Beryl and that Stanley Tong was to direct it.\nUnrealized American adaptation.\nIn 1993, Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, Bandai, and Toon Makers, Inc. conceptualized their own version of \"Sailor Moon\", which was half live-action and half Western-style animation. Toon Makers produced a 17-minute proof of concept pilot and a two-minute music video, both of which were directed by Rocky Solotoff, who also worked on the pilot's script. Renaissance-Atlantic presented the concept to Toei, but it was turned down, as their concept would have cost significantly more than simply exporting and dubbing the anime adaptation. The companies' work is believed by Solotoff to have been handed over to Raymond Iacovacci, one of the producers on the project, who stored the pilot script and animation cels in a storage facility. The logo created for the pilot was kept for the English dub, and Bandai released a \"Moon Cycle\" as part of its merchandise for the show, based on vehicles designed for the pilot.\nThe project was rediscovered in 1998 when the music video was screened at the Anime Expo convention in Los Angeles, where it was met with laughter by onlookers. A congoer recorded the music video and the audience response, which would later resurface on video sites such as YouTube. The pilot and the music video would go on to be discussed at conventions such as the 2011 Gen Con and 2012 Anime Expo. It was given the monikers of \"Toon Makers' Sailor Moon\" and \"Saban Moon\", despite having no connection with Saban Entertainment save for Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, which worked with the company on \"Power Rangers\". The proof of concept video was widely considered to be lost media, and director Solotoff reported that he was frequently contacted by people searching for the pilot. However, in 2012, multiple animation cels from the pilot, along with the script, surfaced on the internet after a storage locker, believed to be the one owned by Iacovacci, was sold.\nIn 1998, Frank Ward, along with his company Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, tried to revive the idea of doing a live-action series based on Sailor Moon, this time called \"Team Angel\", without the involvement of Toon Makers. A 2-minute reel was produced and sent to Bandai America, but was also rejected.\nIn August 2022, the proof of concept was showcased for the first time on YouTube in a documentary by Ray Mona. Mona obtained both the pilot and its music video, as well as its related materials, from the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.\n\"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\".\nIn 2003, Toei Company produced a Japanese live action \"Sailor Moon\" television series using the new translated English title of \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\". Its 49 episodes were broadcast on Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting from October 4, 2003, to September 25, 2004. \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\" featured Miyuu Sawai as Usagi Tsukino, Rika Izumi (credited as Chisaki Hama) as Ami Mizuno, Keiko Kitagawa as Rei Hino, Mew Azama as Makoto Kino, Ayaka Komatsu as Minako Aino, Jouji Shibue as Mamoru Chiba, Keiko Han reprising her voice role as Luna from the original anime, and Kappei Yamaguchi voicing Artemis. The series was an alternate retelling of the Dark Kingdom arc, adding a storyline different from that in the manga and first anime series, with original characters, and new plot developments. In addition to the main episodes, two direct-to-video releases appeared after the show ended its television broadcast. \"Special Act\" is set four years after the main storyline ends, and shows the wedding of the two main characters. \"Act Zero\" is a prequel showing the origins of and Tuxedo Mask.\nVideo games.\nThe \"Sailor Moon\" franchise has spawned several video games across various genres and platforms. Most were made by Bandai and its subsidiary Angel; others were produced by Banpresto. The early games were side-scrolling fighters; later ones were unique puzzle games or versus fighting games. \"\" was a turn-based role-playing video game. The only \"Sailor Moon\" game produced outside Japan, 3VR New Media's \"The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon\", went on sale in North America in 1997. They were developed in association with DIC Entertainment, which held the rights to the game and the TV series. A video game called \"Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende\" (\"Sailor Moon: The Moon Shines\") was released on March 16, 2011, for the Nintendo DS.\nTabletop games.\nThe Dyskami Publishing Company released \"Sailor Moon Crystal Dice Challenge\", created by James Ernest of Cheapass Games and based on the \"Button Men\" tabletop game, in 2017, and \"Sailor Moon Crystal Truth or Bluff\" in 2018.\nTheme park attractions.\nA Sailor Moon attraction, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Miracle 4-D\", was announced for Universal Studios Japan. It featured Sailor Moon and the Inner Guardians arriving at the theme park, only to discover and stop the Youma's plan from stealing people's energies. The attraction ran from March 16 through July 24, 2018.\nThe sequel attraction, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Miracle 4-D: Moon Palace arc\", ran from May 31, 2019, to August 25, 2019. It featured all 10 Sailor Guardians and Super Sailor Moon.\nIn January 2022, a new attraction was announced titled \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Miracle 4-D ~Moon Palace arc~ Deluxe\". The attraction features the same storyline as the last and features the Sailor Guardians in their princess forms. It ran from March 4, 2022, to August 28, 2022.\nIce skating show.\nAn ice skating show of \"Sailor Moon\" was announced on June 30, 2019, starring Evgenia Medvedeva as the lead. The name for the ice-skating show was announced as \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Prism on Ice\", as well as the additional casts, with Anza from the first \"Sailor Moon\" musicals to play Queen Serenity, and the main voice actresses of the \"Sailor Moon Crystal\" anime series to voice their individual characters. Takuya Hiramatsu from the musicals was to write the screenplay, Yuka Sato and Benji Schwimmer were to be in charge of choreography, and Akiko Kosaka &amp; Gesshoku Kaigi were to write the music for the show. The show was set to debut in early June 2020, but was first postponed to June 2021, and later to June 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally cancelled on February 23, 2023, due to an \"unstable world situation\", following the Russo-Ukrainian war.\nIdol group.\nA Japanese idol pop group named SG5, short for Sailor Guardians 5, was announced in June 2022. Early plans to form the group began in 2020, with the official lineup and overall concept finalized in 2022. As part of the process, the group had to seek the approval of Naoko Takeuchi by performing in front of her and giving a presentation. The group consists of five members: Sayaka, Ruri, Miyuu, Kaede, and Rui. They officially debuted in July 2022 at Anime Expo. On March 1, 2023, SG5 released their debut single \"Firetruck\", alongside a music video with references to the manga. The group re-debuted under the name F5ve with the single \"Lettuce\" in May 2024, ceasing their association with \"Sailor Moon\".\nReception.\n\"Sailor Moon\" is one of the most popular manga series of all time and continues to enjoy high readership worldwide. More than one million copies of its \"tank\u014dbon\" volumes had been sold in Japan by the end of 1995. The series and its characters have been described as iconic. By the series's 20th anniversary in 2012, the manga had sold over 35 million copies in over fifty countries, and the franchise has generated $ in worldwide merchandise sales as of 1996. By 1995, Sailor Moon merchandise was bringing in more than $250 million per year in Japan. The manga won the Kodansha Manga Award in 1993 in the \"sh\u014djo\" genre. The English adaptations of both the manga and the anime series became the first successful \"sh\u014djo\" title in the United States. The character of Sailor Moon is recognized as one of the most popular and influential female superheroes of all time.\n\"Sailor Moon\" has also become popular internationally. The 1992 \"Sailor Moon\" anime was broadcast in Spain and France beginning in December 1993; these became the first countries outside Japan to broadcast the series. It was later aired in Russia, South Korea, the Philippines, China, Italy, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, before North America picked up the franchise for adaptation. In the Philippines, \"Sailor Moon\" was one of its carrier network's main draws, helping it to become the third-biggest network in the country. In 2001, the \"Sailor Moon\" manga was Tokyopop's best-selling property, outselling the next-best-selling titles by at least a factor of 1.5. In Diamond Comic Distributors\u2019 May 1999 \"Graphic Novel and Trade Paperback\" category, \"Sailor Moon\" Volume 3 was the best-selling comic book in the United States.\nAcademic Timothy J. Craig attributes \"Sailor Moon\"'s international success to three characteristics: the show's magical girl transformation of ordinary characters into superheroes, the ability of marketers to establish the international audience's connection to characters, despite their culture being Japanese, and a female superhero protagonist, something which was still rare in global pop culture during the 1990s.\nIn his 2007 book \"\", Jason Thompson gave the manga series three stars out of four. He enjoyed the blending of \"sh\u014dnen\" and \"sh\u014djo\" styles and said the combat scenes seemed heavily influenced by \"Saint Seiya\", but shorter and less bloody. He also said the manga itself appeared similar to \"Super Sentai\" television shows. Thompson found the series fun and entertaining, but said the repetitive plot lines were a detriment to the title, which the increasing quality of art could not make up for; even so, he called the series \"sweet, effective entertainment\". Thompson said that although the audience for \"Sailor Moon\" is both female and male, Takeuchi does not use fan service for males, which would run the risk of alienating her female audience. Thompson said fight scenes are not physical and \"boil down to their purest form of a clash of wills\", which he says \"makes thematic sense\" for the manga. Venita Blackburn of \"The New York Times\" opined that \"Sailor Moon\" is a \"transformative experience\" about friendship and liberation that does not match the world's expectations of femininity, adding that its \"iconic status\" within the queer community was \"no accident\". She stated that the world of \"Sailor Moon\" is \"interested in transformation, in upsetting expectations of presentation and value related to girlhood, masculinity, strength and gender roles\", further adding that in \"Sailor Moon,\" the concept of transformation is \"about light, magic and power hidden in the ordinariness of living\", concluding that \"there is nothing queerer than that\".\nWhile comparing the manga and anime, Sylvain Durand thought that the manga artwork was\"gorgeous\", but that its storytelling was more compressed and erratic, and the anime had more character development. Durand said \"the sense of tragedy is greater\" in the manga's telling of the \"fall of the Silver Millennium,\" giving more detail about the origins of the Four Kings of Heaven and in Usagi's final battle against Queen Beryl and Metaria. Durand said the anime omits information that makes the story easy to understand, but judges the anime as more \"coherent\" with a better balance of comedy and tragedy, whereas the manga is \"more tragic\" and focused on Usagi and Mamoru's romance.\nFor the week of September 11, 2011, to September 17, 2011, the first volume of the re-released \"Sailor Moon\" manga was the best-selling manga on \"The New York Times\" Manga Best Sellers list, with the first volume of \"Codename: Sailor V\" in second place. The first print run of the first volume sold out after four weeks.\nIn English-speaking countries, \"Sailor Moon\" developed a cult following among anime fans and university students. Patrick Drazen says the Internet was a new medium that fans used to communicate and played a role in the popularity of \"Sailor Moon\". Fans could use the Internet to discuss the series, organize campaigns to return \"Sailor Moon\" to U.S. broadcast, share information about episodes that had not yet aired, or write fan fiction. Gemma Cox of \"Neo\" magazine said part of the series's allure was that fans communicated via the Internet about the differences between the dub and the original version.\nCultural impact and legacy.\nWith their dynamic heroines and action-oriented plots, \"Sailor Moon\" is widely credited with reinvigorating the magical girl genre. After its success, many similar magical girl series, including \"Magic Knight Rayearth\", \"Wedding Peach\", \"Saint Tail\", \"Nurse Angel Ririka SOS\", \"Cyber Team in Akihabara\", \"Corrector Yui,\" and \"Pretty Cure\", emerged. \"Sailor Moon\" has been called \"the biggest breakthrough\" in English-dubbed anime until 1995, when it premiered on YTV, and \"the pinnacle of little kid \"sh\u014djo\" anime\". Cultural anthropologist Rachel Thorn said that soon after \"Sailor Moon\", \"sh\u014djo\" manga started appearing in bookshops instead of fandom-dominated comic shops. The series is seen as kickstarting a wider movement of girls taking up \"sh\u014djo\" manga. Canadian librarian Gilles Poitras defines a generation of anime fans as those who were introduced to anime by \"Sailor Moon\" in the 1990s, saying they were both much younger than other fans and were also mostly female.\nHistorian Fred Patten credits Takeuchi with popularizing the concept of a \"Super Sentai\"-like team of magical girls, and Paul Gravett credits the series with revitalizing the magical girl genre itself. A reviewer for \"THEM Anime Reviews\" also credited the anime series with changing the genre\u2014its heroine must use her powers to fight evil, not simply have fun as previous magical girls had done. The series has been compared to \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", and \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\". Sailor Moon also influenced the development of \"\", \"W.I.T.C.H.\", \"Winx Club\", \"LoliRock\", \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\", \"Robot Chicken\", \"Steven Universe\", and \"Totally Spies!\".\n\"Sailor Moon\" is associated with the feminist and girl power movements and with empowering its female viewers, especially regarding the \"credible, charismatic and independent\" characterizations of the Sailor Guardians. \"Sailor Moon\" is regarded as empowering to women and feminism in concept, particularly through the aggressive nature and strong personalities of the Guardians. It represents a specific type of feminist concept where \"traditional feminine ideals [are] incorporated into characters that act in traditionally male capacities\". While the Sailor Guardians are strong, independent fighters who thwart evil\u2014which is generally a masculine stereotype\u2014they are also ideally feminized in their Guardian transformation.\nThe most notable hyper-feminine features of the Sailor Guardians\u2014and most other females in Japanese girls' comics\u2014are the girls' thin bodies, long legs, and, in particular, round, orb-like eyes. Eyes are commonly known as the primal source within characters where emotion is evoked\u2014sensitive characters have larger eyes than more stoic ones. The stereotypical role of women in Japanese culture is to undertake romantic and loving feelings; therefore, the prevalence of hyper-feminine qualities like the openness of the female eye in Japanese girls' comics is clearly exhibited in \"Sailor Moon\". Thus, \"Sailor Moon\" emphasizes a type of feminist model by combining traditionally masculine action with traditionally feminine affection through the Sailor Guardians.\nMerchandise.\nSince the early 2000s, Toei Animation has collaborated with various different brands to create merchandise outside of a children's demographic. On February 20, 2020, ColourPop released a \"Sailor Moon-\"inspired makeup collection. Celebrating the 25th anniversary of \"Sailor Moon\" in the U.S., streetwear brand KITH released clothing such as hoodies and t-shirts with \"Sailor Moon\" graphics on them. In honor of \"Sailor Moon\"'s 30th anniversary, brands like Sanrio, Uniqlo, and Maison de FLEUR launched a \"Sailor Moon\" collaboration in January 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27936", "revid": "48655281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27936", "title": "Spider-Man", "text": "Marvel Comics superhero\nSpider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Considered one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes, he has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.\nSpider-Man is the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker, who was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in Queens, New York City, after the death of his parents. Lee, Ditko, and later writers had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood. Readers identified with his self-doubt and loneliness. Unlike previous teen heroes, Spider-Man was not a sidekick nor did he have a mentor. He would be given many supporting characters, such as his \"Daily Bugle\" boss J. Jonah Jameson; friends like Harry Osborn and Flash Thompson; romantic interests like Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after he was bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes and durability; clinging to surfaces and ceilings; and detecting danger with his precognitive \"spider-sense\". He sews a spider-web patterned spandex costume that fully covers his body and builds wrist-mounted \"web-shooter\" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses for both fighting and \"web swinging\" across the city. Peter initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar that he could have stopped but did not, he learned that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", and began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man.\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012\u20132014 following the \"Dying Wish\" storyline, where Peter appears to die after Doctor Octopus orchestrates a body swap with him and becomes the Superior Spider-Man. Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including \"Spider-Man 2099\", which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", which features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and \"\", which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the \"Secret Wars\" event, where he sometimes works alongside the mainline version of Peter.\nSpider-Man has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" trilogy, Andrew Garfield in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" duology directed by Marc Webb, and Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Peter Parker version of Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film ', with the former reprising his role in the sequel, '.\nPublication history.\nCreation and development.\nIn 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was looking for a new superhero idea. He said the teenage demand for comic books and a character with whom they could identify led to the creation of Spider-Man. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to \"get out of his system\" what he felt was missing in comic books.\nThere are many conflicting stories about the inspiration and precise authorship of the various aspects of Spider-Man's appearance and character. In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence. Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a \"sixth sense\", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's \"spider-sense\". In a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee also says he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall\u2014adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.\nAlthough at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with \"boy\", Lee says he chose \"Spider-Man\" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and felt the name \"Spider-Boy\" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. Comics scholar Ben Saunders points out that this emphasis on adolescence was an important innovation for superhero comics.\nLee required Marvel publisher Martin Goodman's approval for the character. In a 1986 interview, Lee gives his arguments against Goodman's objections. Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series \"Amazing Adult Fantasy\", which was renamed \"Amazing Fantasy\" for issue #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). In particular, Lee states that the decision that \"Amazing Fantasy\" would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to present Spider-Man. While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the continuing appearances of Spider-Man in future issues.\nLee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the \"ordinary teen\" concept and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby \"immediately sat down for a story conference\", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, \"I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly\u2014it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic\". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed an art style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character...\nAlthough the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked. As Lee explained in 2010, \"I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers.\"\nKirby disputed Lee's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon, who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic \"Black Magic\", but the character was left unused. Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that \"Black Magic\" was not a factor and that Simon devised the name \"Spider-Man\" (later changed to \"The Silver Spider\"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's Archie Comics superhero, the Fly. Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics, and that \"Spider-Man\" was an outgrowth of that interest.\nSimon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character, but disliked the results\u2014in Simon's description, \"Captain America with cobwebs\". Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely\u2014Kirby still drew the covers for \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 and the first issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was \"too busy\" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties, since Kirby was, said Evanier, \"always busy\". Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly.\nAuthor and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that \"Stan called Jack about the Fly\", adding that \"[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis.\" It was at this point that the entire concept of the strip went through a major overhaul. \"Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained.\" Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, where Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as \"the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series\". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, \"I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man\". Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one he saw in the five pencilled pages that Kirby had completed. To support this, Ditko used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel Thor, which was based on a name or idea of a character in Norse mythology: \"If Marvel's Thor is a valid created work by Jack, his creation, then why isn't Spider-Man by Stan and me valid created work, our creation?\"\nAt the time of Spider-Man's creation, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was \"almost nil\", he and Ditko had \"worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own\u00a0... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands.\"\nKirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who \"got \"Spider-Man\" to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did\". Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, had acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, \"If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]\". He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus easily identify with the character.\nAs depicted in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 (Aug. 1962), Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and \"acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid\". When \"[h]e blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.\" Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, \"With great power there must also come\u2014great responsibility!\" Ben Saunders points out that this conclusion makes problematic the usual conceptions of heroism in the genre; Ben's death does not fully validate Peter Parker's new mission, and the protagonist is continually portrayed as a conflicted, imperfect person, in uncertain circumstances.\n1960s.\nA few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics. A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 \"Esquire\" poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was \"beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us.\" Ditko introduced Peter Parker's boss, J. Jonah Jameson, newspaper publisher of the \"Daily Bugle\", who despises Spider-Man and slanders him despite his heroism. Parker experiences frequent high-school drama involving his love interest, Betty Brant, and a classroom bully, Flash Thompson.\nIn the first issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (March 1963), despite his superpowers, Peter struggles to help his widowed Aunt May pay the rent, is taunted by Flash, and continues fighting crime and saving the city as Spider-Man. Peter gets hired as a freelance photographer Jameson to take pictures of Spider-Man, with Jameson unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Ben Saunders identifies nineteen different supervillains who appear in the early Spider-Man stories of Lee and Ditko, sixteen of which become recurring figures in the Marvel Universe. These enemies include Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Lizard, Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, and Mysterio. Peter finds juggling his personal and superhero life difficult. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, Jack Kirby.\nFollowing Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita Sr. replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita also drew the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\", a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It lasted for two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' summer \"Annual\"s that began in 1964. Romita's illustrations of the character were substantially more glamorous and influenced by romance comics of the time; Parker's social status markedly improved. Romita introduced a new prominent enemy for Spider-Man, the gangster Wilson Fisk, also known as Kingpin. In this period, Peter graduates from high school, and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University), where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and girlfriend Gwen Stacy. As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father, Norman Osborn, is revealed to be the Green Goblin, Peter attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while. Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective Captain George Stacy, is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (issue #90, November 1970).\nRomita also created a new love interest for Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson. Romita's storylines emphasize a long triangle between Parker, Watson, and Gwen Stacy. This period included one of the first Black supporting characters in superhero comic books, Robbie Robertson, a reporter at the Daily Bugle. By 1968, the series began to address political controversies and student activism.\n1970s.\nAn early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the Comics Code Authority. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling \"The Amazing Spider-Man;\" issues #96\u201398 (May\u2013July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut, and the Code was subsequently revised.\nBy 1972, with Spider-Man as its flagship character, Marvel had begun to outsell its primary competitor, DC. In that year, a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider-Man began: \"Marvel Team-Up\", in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and supervillains. From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. Gerry Conway became the primary writer of the series from 1972 to 1975, and Ross Andru was the penciller from October 1973 to July 1978. In 1973, Gwen Stacy was tragically killed during her rescue from the Green Goblin, a turning point for Spider-Man. In issue #121 (June 1973), the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text). She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt, and Spider-Man swears revenge against his nemesis; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: \"It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her.\" The following issue, Spider-Man vengefully attacks and overpowers the Green Goblin, who kills himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.\nIn 1974, the Punisher, a murderous vigilante who later became particularly popular, first appeared in the series. Len Wein became the new writer in December 1975. He was replaced in June 1978, initially by Bill Mantlo and later by Marv Wolfman. Sal Buscema, Jim Starlin, Keith Pollard, and John Byrne were all featured artists in the late 1970s.\nIn December 1976, a second solo series, \"Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\", began running parallel to the main series.\nWorking through his grief for Gwen Stacy, Peter eventually develops tentative feelings toward Mary Jane, and the two \"become confidants rather than lovers\". A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in issue #182 (July 1978), and being turned down an issue later. Felicia Hardy, also known as the Black Cat, first appeared in the series in 1979; she becomes a new femme fatale love interest for Peter.\n1980s.\nIn the early 1980s, Roger Stern and John Romita Jr. (the son of the primary artist in the late 1960s) became the primary creative team of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\".\nA third series featuring Spider-Man, \"Web of Spider-Man\", launched in 1985 to replace \"Marvel Team-Up\". In the mid-1980s, Spider-Man was also a significant character in the \"Secret Wars\" miniseries, which led to his adoption of a new black costume. At the end of the decade, this costume was revealed to be an enemy symbiote which became a prominent new enemy, Venom. From 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest. The new costume originated in the \"Secret Wars\" miniseries on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth's major superheroes and supervillains. He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #252. The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle, though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge.\nIn 1987, Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were married; the creative team in this period was Jim Shooter as plot writer and Paul Ryan as penciller. Peter proposes to Mary Jane in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding taking place in \"The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #21 (1987)\u2014promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at Shea Stadium, with Stan Lee officiating, on June 5, 1987. David Michelinie, who scripted based on a plot by editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, said in 2007, \"I didn't think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had actually planned another version, one that wasn't used.\"\nOctober 1985 to 1986 in \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" featured a storyline inspired by film noir, \"The Death of Jean DeWolff\". October to November 1987 were devoted to an equally dark story that crossed over among the three Spider-Man titles, \"Kraven's Last Hunt\". Todd McFarlane became the new artist of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" in March 1988; his rendition of Spider-Man distinguished itself by \"'impossible' anatomy, huge eyes, poses that were more spiderlike than human, skewed frames, and brand-new spaghetti webbing.\"\n1990s.\nThe launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the \"adjectiveless\" \"\" (with the storyline \"Torment\"), written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane, debuted with several different covers, all with the same interior content. All four versions combined sold over three million copies, an industry record at the time. Several miniseries, one-shot issues, and loosely related comics were also published in this decade, and Spider-Man made frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic book series. In 1996, \"The Sensational Spider-Man\" was created to replace \"Web of Spider-Man\".\nIn the mid-1990s, there was a very long storyline in which a clone of Spider-Man first created in an earlier storyline of the 1970s returned, and it was unclear which of the two versions of Peter Parker was the original. This lasted for three years. In the controversial 1990s storyline the \"Clone Saga\", a clone of Parker, created in a storyline of the 1970s, re-appears after living incognito as Ben Reilly and allies with Parker. To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone. Complicating matters, Mary Jane announces in \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" #220 (Jan. 1995) that she is pregnant with Peter's baby. Later, however, a resurrected Norman Osborn has Mary Jane poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her and Peter's unborn daughter. It is later revealed that The Green Goblin switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Peter's life by making him believe himself to be the clone. Ben is killed while saving Peter, in \"Peter Parker: Spider-Man\" #75 (Dec. 1996), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Ben was the clone.\nIn 1998, writer-artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series \"\" (Dec. 1998\u2013Oct. 1999), similar to Byrne's adding details and some revisions to Superman's origin in DC Comics' \"The Man of Steel\". During that time, the original \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" ended, and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" started with volume 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).\nIn issue #97 (Nov. 1998) of the second series titled \"Peter Parker: Spider-Man\", Parker learns Norman Osborn kidnapped Aunt May and her apparent death in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #400 (April 1995) had been a hoax. Shortly afterward, Mary Jane appears to be killed in an airplane explosion. She is subsequently revealed to be alive, but she and Peter are then completely separated.\n2000s.\nIn October 2000, an alternative interpretation and updated re-imagining of the character appeared in \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", written by Brian Michael Bendis.\nBeginning in June 2001, J. Michael Straczynski, who had created the science fiction TV show \"Babylon Five\", became the primary writer of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". In this period, Peter, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets the enigmatic Ezekiel Sims, who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Peter, having gained such abilities, might not have been a fluke\u2014that Parker has a connection to a totemic spider spirit. In vol. 2, #37 (#478, Jan. 2002), Aunt May discovers her nephew is Spider-Man.\nBeginning in 2005, Spider-Man joined the Avengers and appeared in the \"New Avengers\" series written by Bendis. After a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate destroys their respective homes, Peter, Mary Jane, and May move into Stark Tower, and Peter begins working as Tony Stark's assistant while freelancing for \"The Daily Bugle\" and continuing his teacher career. In the 12-part 2005 story arc \"The Other\", Peter undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers. In the comic \"Civil War\" #2 (June 2006), part of the company-wide crossover arc of that title, the U.S. government's Superhuman Registration Act leads Spider-Man to reveal his true identity publicly. A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and Mary Jane and joins the anti-registration underground.\nIn 2007, the \"One More Day\" storyline un-did Peter Parker's marriage to Mary Jane Watson; the demon Mephisto magically erased the event from the memory of everyone in the world. In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), Aunt May is critically wounded from Wilson Fisk's sniper, and enters into a coma. Peter, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a pact with the demon-lord Mephisto, who saves May's life in exchange for Peter and Mary Jane agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man's identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Mary Jane returns and is cold toward him. The controversial storyline \"One More Day\" rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, who said, \"Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man\". It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski, who \"told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc\", but was talked out of doing so. At issue with Straczynski's climax to the arc, Quesada said, was&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...that we didn't receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting. What made that very problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on [the sequel arc] \"Brand New Day\" that were expecting and needed \"One More Day\" to end in the way that we had all agreed it would. ... The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series. Also, the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made over 30 years of Spider-Man books worthless, because they never would have had happened. ...[I]t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider-Man titles. We just couldn't go there...\nIn this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the Marvel Universe, Parker begins working for the alternative press paper \"The Front Line\". J. Jonah Jameson becomes the Mayor of New York City in issue #591 (June 2008).\nWhen the main series \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" three times monthly, beginning with #546\u2013548 (all January 2008). The scheduling of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" lasted until November 2010, when the comic book expanded from 22 pages to 30 pages for each issue. Later on, \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was published twice a month, beginning with #648\u2013649 (both November 2010).\n2010s.\nIn \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", a storyline that began in 2011 narrated the death of the alternative version of Peter Parker, who was replaced by a younger character with similar powers, Miles Morales.\nIn 2012, Marvel launched \"Avenging Spider-Man\" as the first spin-off ongoing series in addition to \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", since the previous ones were canceled at the end of 2007. Dan Slott became the primary writer of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" in January 2011. The \"Amazing\" series temporarily ended with issue #700 in December 2012 and was replaced by \"The Superior Spider-Man\", which had Doctor Octopus serve as the new Spider-Man by taking over Peter Parker's body. One of Doctor Octopus' Octobots swaps his and Spider-Man's personality, causing Peter to become trapped in the Doctor's dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter's life for himself. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he manages to establish a weak link with the Doctor's mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories; Otto understands Peter's ideals of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a \"Superior\" Spider-Man. \"Superior\" was an enormous commercial success for Marvel, and ran for 31 issues before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #1 in April 2014.\nLater, realizing that he failed in his role as the \"Superior\" Spider-Man, Otto willingly allows Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn and save a woman Otto loves. In the aftermath of these events, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto's arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto.\nPeter soon learns a second person had been bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon. Spider-Man tracks her down and frees her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms. Cindy goes on to adopt her own heroine identity as Silk. The \"Spider-Verse\" storyline began in November 2014, introducing new variants of Spider-Man, such as Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Gwen. Spider-Man encounters a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires who had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by an alternate version of Otto Octavius. Together, they neutralize the Inheritors.\nFollowing the 2015 \"Secret Wars\" crossover event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were begun or relaunced. Among them, \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was relaunched and primarily focuses on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becomes a successful global businessman.\nFictional character biography.\nBorn in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, Peter Benjamin Parker's parents died in a plane crash when he was a child. He is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. While a student at Midtown High School, student Peter Benjamin Parker is an excellent student and scientific prodigy, but he is not popular with his peers. He is bitten by a radioactive spider at a science exhibit and subsequently develops superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as \"Spider-Man\", becomes a novelty television star. However, he refuses to prevent the escape of a thief, who subsequently murders his beloved Uncle Ben. He tracks down the killer, and, overcome by guilt, devotes himself to applying his powers in the service of justice.\nPeter struggles to help his widowed Aunt May pay the rent, has social problems as a student, and continues fighting crime and saving the city as Spider-Man. His heroic deeds engender the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher of the \"Daily Bugle\", J. Jonah Jameson, who holds a grudge against Spider-Man. Peter gets hired as a freelance photographer by Jameson to take pictures of Spider-Man, with him being unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Spider-Man fights various enemies, including archenemy and nemesis Green Goblin and then Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Lizard, Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, and Mysterio, defeating them one by one. Peter finds juggling his personal and superhero life difficult.\nPeter graduates from high school and enrolls at Empire State University, where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and girlfriend Gwen Stacy, and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson. As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father, Norman Osborn, is revealed to be the Green Goblin, Peter attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while. Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective Captain George Stacy, is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Later, the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of a major bridge. She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt, and Spider-Man swears revenge against his nemesis the Green Goblin, who kills himself accidentally in an ensuing battle with Spider-Man.\nWorking through his grief, Peter eventually develops tentative feelings toward Mary Jane, and the two become close. A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker eventually proposing and being turned down. Peter graduates from college, and becomes involved with the flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy, a.k.a. the Black Cat.\nSpider-Man visits an alien planet, where he participates in a battle between Earth's major superheroes and supervillains. On this planet, he discovers a mysterious black alien suit that initially obeys his mental control. The costume eventually reveals itself as an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle, though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge. Peter again proposes to Mary Jane and this time she accepts.\nA clone of Parker created in his college years by insane scientist Miles Warren, a.k.a. the Jackal, returns to New York City upon hearing of Aunt May's health worsening. The clone had lived incognito as Ben Reilly, but now assumes the superhero guise the Scarlet Spider and allies with Parker. To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone. Complicating matters, Mary Jane announces that she is pregnant with Peter's baby. Later, however, a resurrected Norman Osborn has Mary Jane poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her and Peter's unborn daughter. It is later revealed that The Green Goblin switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Peter's life by making him believe himself to be the clone. Ben is killed while saving Peter, and it is confirmed that Ben was the clone.\nAunt May appears to die, but this is revealed as a hoax. Shortly afterward, Mary Jane also has an apparent death that is later discovered to be a mistaken impression. Mary Jane and Peter become estranged.\nPeter becomes a teacher at his old high school. He meets the enigmatic Ezekiel Sims, and comes to believe that he has a connection to a totemic spider spirit. Parker comes to believe that his late girlfriend Gwen Stacy had had two children with Norman Osborn, although this is later revealed as a hoax.\nHe joins the superhero team the New Avengers. After a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate destroys their respective homes, Peter, Mary Jane, and May move into Stark Tower, and Peter begins working as Tony Stark's assistant while freelancing for \"The Daily Bugle\" and continuing his teaching career. Peter undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers. The U.S. government's Superhuman Registration Act leads Spider-Man to reveal his true identity publicly.

Peter, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a pact with the demon-lord Mephisto, who saves May's life in exchange for Peter and Mary Jane agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man's identity is secret once again. Parker returns to work at the \"Daily Bugle\", which has been renamed \"The DB\" under a new publisher. He soon switches to the alternative press paper \"The Front Line\". J. Jonah Jameson becomes the Mayor of New York City.\nA conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus over Osborn's son ends when it is revealed the child's father is Harry, who leaves town to raise him. One of Doctor Octopus' Octobots swaps his and Spider-Man's personality, causing Peter to become trapped in the Doctor's dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter's life for himself. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he manages to establish a weak link with the Doctor's mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories. Otto understands Peter's ideals of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a \"Superior\" Spider-Man. A portion of Peter survived in his original body in the form of a subconsciousness. Later, realizing that he failed in his role as the \"Superior\" Spider-Man, Otto willingly allows Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn and save Anna Maria Marconi, Otto's love. In the aftermath of these events, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto's arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs.\nPeter soon learns a second person had been bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon. Spider-Man tracks her down and frees her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms. Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own heroine identity as Silk, Spider-Man encounters a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires who had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by an alternate version of Otto Octavius. Together, they neutralize the Inheritors.\nPeter then stops a nefarious plan put forward by the Jackal. Peter's life is plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, Mayor Fisk publicly supports him, condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials are revoked after accusations of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius, resulting in Peter being fired from the \"Daily Bugle\". Subsequently, Peter again became romantically involved with Mary Jane.

Peter eventually manages to reverse the process, and merges his two halves back together before the side-effects worsen and result in their death.\nKindred uses the resurrected Sin-Eater's sins to possess Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman, Anya Corazon, and Julia Carpenter. Doctor Strange, who manages to restrain a possessed Silk, agrees to help Spider-Man. However, Peter dies when fighting Kindred, but Kindred is willing to resurrect Peter.\nPersonality and themes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What Lee and Ditko actually did in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character's life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this month's bad guys... Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience.\"\n Comics historian Peter Sanderson\nSally Kempton for the \"Village Voice\" opined in 1965 that \"Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and a fear of women. He is antisocial, castration-ridden, racked with Oedipal guilt, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic\". Spider-Man's writers often describe him as an everyman who stands in from the average reader; however, he is also characterized it has also been argued that he is one of the first nerd heroes. Comics scholar Phillip Lamarr Cunningham says that \"[Peter] Parker arguably epitomizes the conflation of everyman and nerd better than any popular culture figure.\" Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.\nCultural historian Bradford W. Wright notes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the \"Daily Bugle\", launches an editorial campaign against the \"Spider-Man menace\". The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's \"Daily Bugle\".\nThe mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time; early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the Cold War and communism. Wright writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.\nComics scholar Peter Lee identifies a theme of generational consciousness for Baby Boomers in Spider-Man stories of the 1960s, and an emphasis on a generation gap with their elders. Douglas Wolk emphasizes Parker's complex identity formation through conflict with paternal authority figures; many of his most prominent arch-enemies can be viewed as distorted father figures. Wolk also points out a continual theme of a frustrated \"bildungsroman\", the classic narrative of transition from childhood to adulthood: Parker is often about to achieve the resolution of maturity before this progress is unfairly interrupted.\nMike Flanagan also points out Spider-Man's bond with New York City, and the complex metafictional relationship between the real, factual city and its representation in the fantastical world of superhero comics.\nPowers, skills, and equipment.\nPeter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and subsequently developed the ability to stick to walls and climb smooth surfaces, the proportionate strength, speed, agility, and reflexes of a spider, and a \"spider-sense\" that warns him of danger. Commentators have speculated that a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force, accounts for his sticking ability.\nThe character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, and later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Peter has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics.\nSpider-Man designed his own web-shooters that depend on an organic fluid. He can swing from building to building on these webs, and use them as fighting weapons. He also invented spider-tracers that he is able to track with his spider-sense.\nSupporting cast.\nSpider-Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker, and his uncle and father figure, Ben Parker. After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt May is virtually Peter's only family, and she and Peter are very close.\nJ. Jonah Jameson is the publisher of the \"Daily Bugle\" and Peter Parker's boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he constantly features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper. Jameson can be interpreted as symbolic of demagogic, sensationalistic media. In contrast, Robbie Robertson, Jameson's editor and confidant, is always depicted as a supporter of both Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker.\nEugene \"Flash\" Thompson is commonly depicted as Peter Parker's high school tormentor and bully, who idolizes Spider-Man, but is unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Later, he becomes a friend of Peter and adopts his own superhero identity, Agent Venom, after merging with the Venom symbiote. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn, is Peter's best friend, and experiences problems with drug addiction.\nEnemies.\nWriters and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man, in comics and in other media. As with Spider-Man, the majority of the villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers. Comics scholar Rick Hudson argues that Spider-Man's enemies are in some sense \"'ordinary guys' living in a fantastical world\", in contrast to the operatic, gothic villains who Batman faces. In the early period written by Steve Ditko, Spider-Man's enemies are usually older men whose power comes from scientific inventions.\nThe Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin is most commonly regarded as Spider-Man's arch-enemy. While Norman is usually portrayed as an amoral industrialist and the head of the Oscorp scientific corporation, the Goblin is a psychopathic alternate personality, born after Norman's exposore to some unstable chemicals that also increased his strength and agility. The Goblin is a Halloween-themed villain, dressing up like an actual goblin and utilizing a large arsenal of high tech weapons, including a glider and pumpkin-shaped explosives. Unlike most villains, who only aim to kill Spider-Man, the Goblin also targets his loved ones and shows no remorse in killing them as long as it caused pain to Spider-Man. His most infamous feat is killing Gwen Stacy in \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" While the Goblin was killed in the same story, he returned in the 1990s to plague Spider-Man once again. He also came into conflict with other heroes, such as the Avengers. Norman is sometimes depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man, even when not being the Green Goblin.\nDoctor Octopus (a.k.a. Doc Ock) is a highly intelligent mad scientist who uses four mechanical appendages for both movement and combat. He has been described as Spider-Man's greatest enemy, and the man Peter Parker might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility. Doc Ock is infamous for defeating him the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter's Aunt May. He is also the core leader of the Sinister Six. Later stories depicted his mind in Peter Parker's body, where he acted as the titular character.\nThe Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is often regarded as Spider-Man's deadliest foe, and has been described as an evil mirror version of Spider-Man in many ways. He is also among Spider-Man's most popular villains. Originally a reporter who grew to despise Spider-Man, Eddie later came into contact with the Venom symbiote, which had been rejected by Spider-Man. The symbiote merges with Eddie and gives him the same powers as Spider-Man, in addition to making him immune to the web-slinger's \"spider-sense\". Venom's main goal is to ruin Peter Parker's life and mentally confuse him in any way he can. The character has a sense of honor and justice, and later starred in his own comic book stories, where he is depicted as an antihero and has a desire to protect innocent people from harm. On several occasions, he and Spider-Man even put their differences aside and became allies.\nRomantic interests.\nAs a high-schooler, Peter Parker's romantic interests first included his first crush, fellow high-school student Liz Allan, and his first date, with Betty Brant, who was secretary to the \"Daily Bugle\" newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Peter eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy, daughter of New York City Police Department detective Captain George Stacy. Her father is killed by Doctor Octopus, and Gwen blames Spider-Man for his death, not realizing Peter's secret identity. Gwen Stacy later dies after being held hostage by the Green Goblin. The Green Goblin throws her from a bridge and Spider-Man attempts to save her, but a \"snap\" sound effect suggests that Spider-Man's web broke her neck when it interrupted her fall. The event of her death and ramifications are revisited in many subsequent storylines.\nMary Jane Watson is first introduced in 1965, but does not become fully visible until the following year. Peter's Aunt May constantly suggests her as a blind date, which Peter continually postpones. When he finally meets her, she declares \"Face It Tiger... You Just Hit the Jackpot!\", which becomes a repeated catchphrase. They date off and on through storylines over subsequent decades. She become Peter's best friend; in a storyline of 1987, they marry. However, in a story written two decades later, their marriage is erased from the memory of the world by Mephisto, in exchange for saving Aunt May's life.\nFelicia Hardy, the Black Cat, is a reformed cat burglar who was Spider-Man's only superhuman girlfriend and partner.\nChildren.\nThe main incarnation of Spider-Man has never become a father. However, over the course of the comics, alternate versions of Peter Parker had biological children, usually with Mary Jane Watson. These include Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker) and Benjy Parker from the MC2 universe, and Spiderling (Annie Parker) from Earth-18119.\nAlternate versions of Spider-Man.\nWithin the Marvel Universe, there exists a multiverse with many variations of Spider-Man. An early character included in the 1980s is the fictional anthropomorphic animal parody of Spider-Man as a pig named Spider-Ham (Peter Porker). Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the futuristic version of Spider-Man in Marvel 2099 named Miguel O'Hara. In the Marvel Comics 2 imprint, Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named Mayday Parker, who carries on Spider-Man's legacy, while Marvel Noir has a 1930s version of Peter Parker. Other themed versions exist within the early 2000s, such as a Marvel Mangaverse version and an Indian version from \"\", Pavitr Prabhakar.\n\"Ultimate Spider-Man\" was a popular modern retelling of Spider-Man, Peter Parker. The version of Peter Parker would later be depicted as being killed off and replaced by a Black Hispanic Spider-Man named Miles Morales.\nThe storyline \"Spider-Verse\" brought back many alternate takes on Spider-Man and introduced many new ones, such as an alternate world where Gwen Stacy gets bitten by a radioactive spider instead, along with a British-themed version named Spider-UK, who is Billy Braddock from the Captain Britain Corps.\nReception and legacy.\nIn \"The Creation of Spider-Man\", comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers \"nothing too original\"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a \"nerdy high school student\". Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included \"heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama\". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: \"the flawed superhero with everyday problems\". This idea spawned a comics revolution. The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books, such as \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", \"The Incredible Hulk\", \"The Fantastic Four\", and \"The X-Men\" ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them. Later stories also affected the entire genre of superhero comics. Historians of the genre have argued that the dark, pessimistic conclusion of the 1973 story \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\" is partly responsible from the shift from the idealistic Silver Age of Comic Books to the more violent and troubled Bronze Age of Comic Books.\nSpider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products. After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as May Parker's residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero. He has been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, \"The Wall Street Journal\" announced \"Spider-Man is coming to Wall Street\"; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange. Comics scholars Robert G. Weiner and Robert Moses Peaslee argue that Spider-Man is the clear flagship character of Marvel Comics and one of the best-known superheroes worldwide, only rivaled by Batman and Superman. They draw from research that indicates he is a globally recognizable character. They cite statistics that from 1966 to 2012 The Amazing Spider-Man sold an estimated 145-150 million copies. As of 2014, Spider-Man was the world's most profitable superhero. In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion. Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman, Superman, and the Avengers combined.\nSpider-Man joined the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats, designed by John Romita Sr., one of the character's signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared from 2009 to 2014.\nWhen Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the company chose the November 2001 issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character's secret identity, an event detailed in a full-page story in the \"New York Post\" before the issue containing the story was even released.\nIn 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the United Nations, depicting Spider-Man alongside the UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions. A \"BusinessWeek\" article listed Spider-Man as one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided \"Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC\", a case concerning royalties on a patent for an imitation web shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice Elena Kagan, included several Spider-Man references, concluding with the statement that \"with great power, there must also come\u2014great responsibility\".\nSpider-Man has become a subject of scientific inquiry. In 1987, researchers at Loyola University conducted a study into the utility of Spider-Man comics for informing children and parents about issues relating to child abuse.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of Thor. He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he's more relatable than playboy billionaire Iron Man. And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like Captain America. Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.\n\u2014IGN staff on placing Spider-Man as the number one hero of Marvel.\nIn 2005, Bravo's \"Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains\" TV series declared that Spider-Man was the number 1 superhero. \"Empire\" magazine ranked him the fifth-greatest comic book character of all time. \"Wizard\" magazine placed Spider-Man as the third-greatest comic book character on their website. In 2011, Spider-Man placed third on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, behind DC Comics characters Superman and Batman, and sixth in their 2012 list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\". In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the greatest Marvel Comics character of all time. A 2015 poll at Comic Book Resources named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time. IGN described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noted his uniqueness compared to many superheroes with his depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN wrote that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time, he is \"one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence.\" \"Empire\" praised Spider-Man's always-present sense of humor and wisecracks in the face of the many tragedies he faces. The magazine website appraised the depiction of his \"iconic\" superhero poses, describing it as \"a top artist's dream\".\nIn 2022, Penguin Random House released a Penguin Classics edition of the first issues of Spider-Man as part of a line of Penguin Classics editions of other Marvel characters.\nReal-life comparisons.\nReal-life people who have been compared to Spider-Man for their climbing feats include:\nIn other media.\nSpider-Man has appeared in comics, cartoons, films, video games, coloring books, novels, records, children's books, and theme park rides. On television, he first starred in the ABC animated series \"Spider-Man\" (1967\u20131970), \"Spidey Super Stories\" (1974\u20131977) on PBS, and the CBS live-action series \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (1978\u20131979), starring Nicholas Hammond. Other animated series featuring the superhero include the syndicated \"Spider-Man\" (1981\u20131982), \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" (1981\u20131983), Fox Kids' ' (1994\u20131998), \"Spider-Man Unlimited\" (1999\u20132000), ' (2003), \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" (2008\u20132009), \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" (2012\u20132017), Disney XD's \"Spider-Man\" (2017\u20132020), and \"Spidey and His Amazing Friends\" (2021\u2013present). Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action in \"Spidey Super Stories\", a recurring skit on \"The Electric Company\" from 1974 to 1977.\nA tokusatsu series featuring Spider-Man was produced by Toei and aired in Japan. It is commonly referred to by its Japanese pronunciation \"Supaid\u0101-Man\". Spider-Man also appeared in other print forms besides the comics, including novels, children's books, and the daily newspaper comic strip \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", which debuted in January 1977, with the earliest installments written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita Sr. Spider-Man has been adapted to other media including games, toys, collectibles, and miscellaneous memorabilia, and has appeared as the main character in numerous computer and video games on over 15 gaming platforms.\nSpider-Man was featured in a trilogy of live-action films directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero. The first \"Spider-Man\" film of the trilogy was released on May 3, 2002, followed by \"Spider-Man 2\" (2004) and \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007). A third sequel was originally scheduled to be released in 2011; however, Sony later decided to reboot the franchise with a new director and cast. The reboot, titled \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", was released on July 3, 2012, directed by Marc Webb, and starred Andrew Garfield as the new Spider-Man. It was followed by \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" (2014). In 2015, Sony and Disney made a deal for Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in the MCU film ' (2016), before later starring in his standalone film ' (2017), directed by Jon Watts. Holland reprised his role as Spider-Man in ' (2018), ' (2019), ' (2019), and ' (2021); Maguire and Garfield reprise their roles in the latter film. Jake Johnson voiced an alternate universe version of Spider-Man in the animated film ', and reprised the role in its sequel ' (2023). Chris Pine also voiced another version of Peter Parker in \"Into the Spider-Verse\". In 2021, Hudson Thames was cast as the voice of Spider-Man in animated anthology series \"What If...?\", replacing Tom Holland. He later reprised the role for animated series \"Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\" (2025).\nFollowing a brief contract dispute over financial terms, in 2019, Sony and Disney reached a deal to allow Spider-Man to return to the MCU, with the two studios jointly producing Spider-Man films.\nA Broadway musical, \"\", began previews on November 14, 2010, at the Foxwoods Theatre on Broadway, with the official opening night on June 14, 2011. Reeve Carney originally played the starring role. The music and lyrics were written by Bono and The Edge of the rock group U2, with a book by Julie Taymor, Glen Berger, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. \"Turn Off the Dark\" is currently the most expensive musical in Broadway history, costing an estimated $70 million. In addition, the show's unusually high running costs are reported to have been about $1.2 million per week.\nIn the fine arts, since the Pop Art period of the 1960s, the character of Spider-Man has been \"appropriated\" by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Mel Ramos, Vijay, Dulce Pinzon, Mr. Brainwash, and F. Lennox Campello.\nIn 2025, Chicago's Griffin Museum of Science and Industry opened \"Marvel's Spider-Man: Beyond Amazing \u2013 The Exhibition\". It spans two galleries. The \"Chicago Tribune\" reports, \"The first is dedicated to building the character; the other to its ripening and expansion,\" and the exhibit includes archival material not from Marvel or DC but from eight collectors, as well as film props and a final station with supplies that enable visitors to draw their own interpretation of Spider-Man.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27939", "revid": "40014237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27939", "title": "History of Stockholm", "text": "History of the capital of Sweden\nThe history of Stockholm, capital of Sweden, for many centuries coincided with the development of what is today known as Gamla stan, the Stockholm Old Town.\nOrigins.\nThe name 'Stockholm' easily splits into two distinct parts \u2013 Stock-holm, \"Log-islet\", but as no serious explanation to the name has been produced, various myths and legends have attempted to fill in the gap. According to a 17th-century myth the population at the viking settlement Birka decided to found a new settlement, and to determine its location had a log bound with gold drifting in Lake M\u00e4laren. It landed on present day Riddarholmen where today the Tower of Birger Jarl stands, a building, as a consequence, still often erroneously mentioned as the oldest building in Stockholm. The most established explanation for the name are logs driven into the strait passing north of today's old town which dendrochronological examinations in the late 1970s dated to around 1000. While no solid proofs exists, it is often assumed the Three Crown Castle, which preceded the present Stockholm Palace, originated from these wooden structures, and that the medieval city quickly expanded around it in the mid 13th century. In a wider historical context, Stockholm can be thought of as the capital of the Lake M\u00e4laren Region, and as such can trace its origin back to at least two much older cities: Birka (c. 790\u2013975) and Sigtuna, which still exists but dominated the region c. 1000\u20131240 \u2014 a capital which has simply been relocated at a number of occasions.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe name Stockholm first appears in historical records in letters written by Birger Jarl and King Valdemar dated 1252. However, the two letters give no information about the appearance of the city and events during the following decades remain diffuse. While the absence of a perpendicular city plan in medieval Stockholm seems to indicate a spontaneous growth, it is known German merchants invited by Birger Jarl played an important role in the foundation of the city. Under any circumstance, during the end of the 13th century, Stockholm quickly grew to become not only the largest city in Sweden, but also the \"de facto\" Swedish political centre and royal residence. Thus, from its foundation, Stockholm has been the largest and most important Swedish city, inseparable from and dependent on the Swedish government. However, as late as the 16th century, reigns of Kings Eric XIV and John III, whose Swedish government often travelled with them elsewhere (see below), the city was still not what could be called a national capital in modern terms.\nDuring the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523), controlling Stockholm was crucial to anyone aspiring to control the kingdom, and the city was consequently repeatedly besieged by various Swedish-Danish factions. In 1452, a Danish fleet made a failed attack on the city. In 1471, Sten Sture the Elder defeated Christian I of Denmark at the Battle of Brunkeberg only to lose the city to Hans of Denmark in 1497. Sten Sture managed to seize power again in 1501 which resulted in a Danish blockade lasting 1502\u20131509 and eventually a short peace. Hans' son Christian II of Denmark finally conquered it in 1520 and had many leading nobles and burghers of Stockholm beheaded in the so-called Stockholm Bloodbath. When King Gustav Vasa finally besieged and conquered the city three years later, an event which ended the Kalmar Union and the Swedish Middle Ages, he noted every second building in the city was abandoned.\nBy the end of the 15th century, the population in Stockholm can be estimated to 5,000\u20137,000 people, which made it a relatively small town compared to several other contemporary European cities. On the other hand, it was far larger than any other city in Sweden. Many of its inhabitants were Germans and Finns, with the former forming a political and economic elite in the city.\nDuring the Middle Ages, export was administered mostly by German merchants living by the squares Kornhamnstorg (\"Grain Harbour Square\") and J\u00e4rntorget (\"Iron Square\") on the southern corner of the city. Regional peasantry supplied the city with food and raw materials, while the craftsmen in the city produced handicrafts, most of whom lived by the central square Stortorget or by the oldest two streets in Stockholm, the names of which still reflects their trade: K\u00f6pmangatan (\"Merchant Street\") and Skomakargatan (\"Shoemaker Street\") in the central part of the city. Other groups lived by the eastern or western thoroughfares, V\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan and \u00d6sterl\u00e5nggatan.\nEarly Vasa era.\nAfter Gustav Vasa's siege of Stockholm, he restored the privileges of the city which was beneficiary to the burghers of the city. The king maintained his control over the city by controlling the elections of aldermen and magistrates. By the mid-century, the numbers of officials increased in order to make the management of the city more professional and to ensure the state-controlled trade. Stockholm thus lost much of the independence it had had during the Middle Ages and became politically and financially bound to the state. During the reign of his sons (1561\u20131611), the city council remained escorted by a royal representative and both magistrates and aldermen were appointed by the king.\nGustav Vasa invited the clergyman Olaus Petri (1493\u20131552) to become the city secretary of Stockholm. With the two side by side, the new ideas of the Protestant Reformation could be quickly implemented, and sermons in the church were held in Swedish starting in 1525 and Latin was abolished in 1530. A consequence of this development was a need for separate churches for the numerous German and Finnish-speaking citizens and during the 1530 the still-existent German and Finnish parishes were created. The king was, however, not favourably disposed to older chapels and churches in the city, and he ordered churches and monasteries on the ridges surrounding the city to be demolished, together with the numerous charitable institutions.\nBecause Stockholm had a city wall, it was exempted from the tax paid by other Swedish cities. During the reign of Gustav Vasa the city's fortifications were reinforced and in the Stockholm Archipelago, Vaxholm was created to guard the inlet from the Baltic. While the medieval structure of Stockholm remained mostly unaltered during the 16th century, the city's social and economic importance grew to the extent that no king could permit the city to determine its own faith \u2013 the most important export item being bar iron and the most important destination L\u00fcbeck. During the reign of Vasa's sons, trade led many Swedes to settle in the city, but the trade and the capital needed to control it was largely in the hands of the king and German merchants from L\u00fcbeck and Danzig. Throughout the era, Sweden could hardly claim the level of government and bureaucracy requisite to a capital in the modern sense, but Stockholm was the kingdom's strongest bastion and the king's main residence. As Eric XIV's pretensions were on par with those of Renaissance princes on the continent, he afforded himself the largest court his finances could possibly support, and the royal castle was thus the biggest employer in the city.\nAround 1560\u201380, most of the citizens, some 8.000 people, still lived on Stadsholmen. This central island was at this time densely settled and the city was now expanding on the ridges surrounding the city. Stockholm had no private palaces at this time and the only larger buildings were the castle, the church, and the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen. The surrounding ridges, unable to boast a single timber framed building, were mostly used for activities that either required a lot of space, produced odours, or could cause fire. Even though some burghers had secondary residences outside the city, the population living on the ridges, perhaps a quarter of the city's population, were mostly poor, including the royal personnel occupying the ridges north of the city.\nGreat Power era.\nFollowing the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), Sweden was determined never to repeat the embarrassment experienced following the death of Gustavus II Adolphus (1594\u20131632) when Stockholm, still medieval in character, caused hesitation on whether to invite foreign statesmen for fear the lamentable appearance might undermine the nation's authority. Therefore, Stockholm saw many ambitious city plans during the era, of which those for the ridges surrounding today's old town still stands. In accordance to the mercantilism of the era, trade and industry was concentrated to cities where it was easier to control, and Stockholm was of central importance. In a letter in 1636, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna (1583\u20131654) wrote that evolving the Swedish capital was a prerequisite for the nation's power and strength and that this would bring all the other cities on their feet. Increased state intervention on city level was not unique to Sweden at this time, but it was probably more prominent in the case of Stockholm than anywhere else in Europe. To this end, the government of the city was reformed and the former volunteered magistrates gradually replaced by professionals with a theoretical education.\nPopulation and city plans.\nThe process of reshaping Stockholm was initiated by a major fire in 1625 which destroyed the south-western part of today's old town. As a result, two new boulevard-like streets were created \u2014 Stora Nygatan and Lilla Nygatan \u2014 and along the eastern waterfront the medieval wall was replaced by a row of prestigious palaces \u2014 Skeppsbron.\nFor the ridges surrounding the city \u2013 Norrmalm, \u00d6stermalm, Kungsholmen, and S\u00f6dermalm \u2013 new city plans were worked out to create wide and straight artery streets. The project was implemented so thoroughly, in several parts of the city no traces exist of the previous medieval structures. Many of the streets from this era are still extant, and some of those proposed have been realised with some minor modifications.\nThe population grew from less than 10,000 in the early 17th century to more than 50,000 in the mid-1670s.\nThe city's income rose from 18,595 daler in 1635\u201336 to 81,480 daler in 1644. In 1642, approximately 60 per cent of that sum was spent on construction works.\nLaw enforcement and the poor.\nThe growing city of Stockholm also had a greater demand for law enforcement. In 1624, the first prison in the city, called \"Tukthuset,\" was established. During their time in prison, the inmates were tasked with creating textiles. To reduce the crime rate and maintain order, a mounted nighttime police force was created to prevent crimes and escort people to their homes.\nIn 1633, the \"Great Orphanage\" (the exact name was \"Stora barnhuset\") was established in Norrmalm. The children would work and be taught a profession while having a place to sleep and eat.\nBeggars were prohibited in Stockholm in 1642, including those who were legally allowed to beg. This marked a significant change from medieval times when poverty was often regarded as having religious worth; now, beggars were seen as lazy. The \"right poor\"\u2014for example, those who had been injured and were therefore unable to work\u2014would be housed in care houses called \"fattighus,\" while the \"wrong poor\" would be placed in workhouses. Despite this, a large number of mutilated soldiers and other impoverished individuals moved to the city in hopes of a better future.\nTrade.\nOther Swedish cities were deprived of their export privileges by the so-called \"Bothnian Trade Coercion\" (\"Bottniska handelstv\u00e5nget\"). Most Swedish cities were granted a trade monopoly over a limited surrounding area, but for Stockholm most of the lands surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia formed part of the city's trade territory. However, the state-granted monopoly was not the only thing that favoured Stockholm at that time. It was one of the best natural harbours of the era and throughout the 17th century, countless foreign visitors marvelled at the sight of large ships \"with 60 or 70 cannons\" moored along the eastern quay next to the royal castle.\nIn contrast with other Swedish cities, all of which were self-supporting, Stockholm was completely dependent of the transit passing through the city\u2014it had, for example, about the same number of domestic animals as Uppsala, which only had ten per cent the population of the capital. All goods brought into Stockholm had to pass through one of six customs stations, and approximately three-fourths of them were exported from the city. Half of the remaining items, mostly fishery products, were delivered from the Baltic, and corn came from the Lake M\u00e4laren region. However, during the latter half of the century, the rapidly growing capital could not be supported by the Lake M\u00e4laren region alone and therefore became dependent on corn imported from the provinces.\nSweden had played a passive role in international trade during the 16th century; German merchants and ships managed the export of Swedish primary products such as osmond iron, raw copper, and butter. This export was largely regarded as a means of securing the import of items not available in Sweden, such as salt, wine, and luxury goods demanded at the court. With the introduction of a mercantile doctrine around 1620, trade became a keystone to governmental income and the Swedish economy subsequently focused on export, not of raw materials, but of refined products. Over the entire period (c. 1590\u20131685), Stockholm's share of the national economy remained stable at around two-thirds, but during the first half of the 17th century, export grew fourfold and import fivefold. Most goods were delivered to the Netherlands in the mid-17th century and to the UK in the early 18th century.\nIn the 17th century, the textile industry was developed with the establishments of the textile manufactures \"Paulinska manufakturerna\" (active 1673\u20131776) and the \"Barn\u00e4ngens manufaktur\" (active 1691\u20131826), which became two of the greatest sources of employments in the Swedish capital during the entire 18th-century.\nAge of Liberty (1718\u20131772).\nFollowing the Greater Wrath and the Treaty of Nystad in 1722, Sweden's role as a major European power was over, and the decades that followed brought even more disasters. Black death and the sufferings caused by the Great Northern Wars made Stockholm the capital of a shrinking nation, despair which would deepen even further when Sweden lost Finland in 1809. Notwithstanding Sweden's partial recover of spirit with the union with Norway in 1814, during the period 1750\u20131850, Stockholm was a stagnating city, with a dwindling population and widespread unemployment, marked by ill-health, poverty, alcoholism, and rampant mortality. The M\u00e4laren region lost in influence to the benefit of south-western Sweden, and as population and welfare dwindled in the capital, there was a leveling of social classes. Wars and alcohol abuse resulted in a surplus of women during the period, with widows outnumbering widowers six to one in 1850. Stockholm was marked by an absence of children, caused by the number of unmarried people and high infant mortality. Average length of life was limited to 44, but those who survived infancy were likely to get about as old as people do today, except those born to a life of hard labour.\nA stratification into three social groups can be made for this era :\nWomen were associated with their husband's status. However, as craftsmen saw their status sink with the introduction of industrialism, the proletarian class grew during the period. There also was an economic segregation in the city, with the present old town and the lower parts of Norrmalm being the wealthiest (more than 150% above average); the suburbs (today part of central Stockholm) were poor (50% below average).\nDuring the 18th century, the Mercantile model introduced the previous century was further developed, with domestic production promoted by loans and bounties and import limited to raw materials not available in Sweden by tolls. The era saw the rise of the so-called \"Skeppsbro Nobility\" (\"Skeppsbroadeln\"), the wealthy wholesalers at Skeppsbron who made a fortune by delivering bar iron to the international market and by controlling the chartered companies. The most successful of them was the Swedish East India Company (1731\u20131813) which had its headquarters in Gothenburg, but was of significant importance to Stockholm because of the shipbuilding yards, the trade houses, and the exotic products imported by the company. Furthermore, before these ships left Stockholm some 100\u2013150 men per ship were recruited, most of them in the city, and as a single trip to China would take 1\u20132 years the company had a huge impact on Stockholm during this era.\nDuring the 18th century, several devastating fires destroyed entire neighbourhoods which resulted in building codes being introduced. They improved fire safety by prohibiting wooden buildings and further embellished the city by implementing the 17th-century city plans. In the old town, the new royal palace was gradually completed and the exterior of the Storkyrkan church was adopted to it. The skilled artists and craftsmen working for the royal court formed an elite which considerably raised the artistic standards in the capital.\nGustavian era (1772\u20131809).\nDuring the enlightened absolute monarchy of Gustav III Stockholm managed to maintain its role as the political centre of Sweden and developed culturally.\nThe king had a great interest for the city's development. He created the Gustav Adolf square and had the Royal Opera inaugurated there in 1782 \u2014 in accordance to the original intentions of Tessin the Younger for a monumental square north of the palace. The fa\u00e7ade of Arvfurstens palats on the opposite side is identical to the now replaced fa\u00e7ade of the opera.\nThe neoclassical bridge Norrbro, designed by Erik Palmstedt (1741\u20131807) and was completed in ten years. It was a very ambitious project that caused the centre of the city to gradually move out of the medieval city.\nThe colourful and often burlesque descriptions of Stockholm by troubadour and composer Carl Michael Bellman are still popular.\nThe period ended as King Gustav IV Adolf was deposed in 1809 in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The loss of Finland that same year meant Stockholm ceased to be the geographical centre of the Swedish kingdom. As a result, the fortress \"Karlsborg\" was built between 1819 and 1909 to serve as a backup capital in wartime.\nEarly industrial era (1809\u20131850).\nFor Stockholm, the early 19th century meant the only larger-scale projects to be realised were those initiated by the military which favoured a more stiff classicism, the local Swedish version of the Empire style (in Sweden named \"Karl Johansstil\" after King Charles XIV John). The architects dominating the era, Fredrik Blom and Carl Christoffer Gj\u00f6rwell, both were commissioned by the military. Due to the general stagnation, few other constructions were realised \u2014 in average ten smaller residential buildings per year \u2014 additions which the ambitious city plans of the 17th century could easily handle.\nDuring the later half of the 18th century real income dwindled to reach an all-time low in 1810 when it corresponded to roughly half that of the 1730s; public officials being those worst affected. Norrk\u00f6ping became the greatest manufacturing city of Sweden and Gothenburg developed into the key trading port because of its location on the North Sea.\nMost people still lived within the present Old Town, with a growth along the eastern shore. Population also grew on the surrounding ridges, more so in the wealthy district Norrmalm and less so in the poor district S\u00f6dermalm. However, many of the ridges surrounding the city were slums mostly rural in character without water and sewage and frequently ravaged by cholera.\nLate industrial era (1850\u20131910).\nIn the second half of the century, Stockholm regained its leading economic role. New industries emerged, and Stockholm transformed into an important trade and service centre, as well as a key gateway point within Sweden.\nWhile steam engines were introduced in Stockholm in 1806 with the Eldkvarn mill, it took until the mid-19th century for industrialization to take off. Two factories, Ludvigsberg and Bolinder, constructed in the 1840s were followed by many others, and the economic development that succeeded resulted in some 800 new buildings being constructed 1850\u201370 \u2014 many of which were located in the Klara district and subsequently demolished in the Redevelopment of Norrmalm 1950\u201370.\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, gas works, sewage, and running water was introduced. Many streets were paved, including Skeppsbron and Strandv\u00e4gen, and the railway brought Stockholm closer to continental Europe \u2014 an event which additionally lead to the creation of the first suburb Liljeholmen where railway workshops were located. As the railway was extended further north, Stockholm Central Station was inaugurated in 1871. The first horse-pulled trams were introduced in 1877. Long before the railway, steam engines became common on boats which resulted in many summertime residences being built around Stockholm. But the booming urban development was also notable in central Stockholm where several prominent Neo-Renaissance buildings were built, including the Academy of Music and S\u00f6dra Teatern.\nIn 1866, a commission led by Albert Lindhagen produced a city plan for the ridges (\"malmarna\") designed to offer citizens light, fresh air and access to Swedish nature by mean of parks and plantations. To this goal, he proposed a system of esplanades culminating in Sveav\u00e4gen, a 2\u00a0km long and 70 m wide boulevard inspired by Champs Elys\u00e9es. 1877\u201380 new city plans were finally passed for central Stockholm, which made the city well-prepared for the major expansion that followed. During the 1880s more than 2.000 buildings were added on the ridges and the population grew from 168.000 to 245.000. At the end of the century, less than 40 per cent of the residents were born in Stockholm.\nWhile this demand for housing was mostly dealt with by private entrepreneurs who built on pure speculation, street width and building heights were strictly regulated by the new city plans which ensured the city that evolved was given a uniform design. A trend initiated by the B\u00fcnsow House at Strandv\u00e4gen, the 1880s saw many monumental brick buildings evolve, including Gamla Riksarkivet and the Norstedt Building on Riddarholmen. Before the end of the decade, most new buildings were equipped with electricity and telephones were increasingly common. During the 1890s, the Neo-Renaissance plaster architecture was replaced by structures in brick and natural stone, largely inspired by French Renaissance architecture. Around what still was factories outside the customs of Stockholm, shacks whose sanitary conditions defied all description evolved. Before the end of the century, however, these were transformed into municipal societies, which facilitated regulation of health and construction, and by the turn of the century, the expansion had continued far beyond the city limits, with villa suburbs initiated by individuals adding a mix of purely speculative structures and more qualitative ambitions. The new century saw the introduction of Art Nouveau with the Central Post Office Building by Boberg (1898\u20131904) and Neo-Baroque with the Riksdag (1894\u20131906). Throughout the 1910s, trams were electrified and cars were rolling on the streets of Stockholm.\nDuring this period, Stockholm further developed as a cultural and educational centre. In the 19th century, a number of scientific institutes opened in Stockholm, for example the Karolinska Institutet. The General Art and Industrial Exposition, an international exhibition of World's Fair status, was held on the island of Djurg\u00e5rden in 1897.\n20th century.\nIn the late 20th century, Stockholm became a modern, technologically advanced and ethnically diverse city. Throughout the century, many industries shifted away from work-intensive activities into more high-technology and service-industry knowledge-based areas.\nThe city continued to expand and new districts were created, some with high proportions of immigrants. Meanwhile, the inner city (Norrmalm) went through a criticised as well as an admired wave of modernisation in the post-war period, the Redevelopment of Norrmalm, securing the city's geographical center as the political and business center for the future.\nIn 1923 the Stockholm municipal government moved to a new building, the Stockholm City Hall. The Stockholm International Exhibition was held in 1930. In 1967 the city of Stockholm was integrated into Stockholm County.\nThe \"Stockholm Initiative\".\nOn April 22, 1991, thirty world leaders gathered in Stockholm, among them Ingvar Carlsson, then Prime Minister of Sweden; Willy Brandt, Chair of the Socialist International and former Chancellor of Germany; Julius Nyerere, former President of Tanzania; Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway; Kalevi Sorsa, former prime minister of Finland; Edward Heath, former prime minister of the U. K.; and Benazir Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Stockholm County area: the Royal Palace Drottningholm (within Eker\u00f6 Municipality) and the Skogskyrkog\u00e5rden (The Woodland Cemetery). \nStockholm was the 1998 European City of Culture.\nLiterature.\nAuthors connected to Stockholm include the poet and songwriter Carl Michael Bellman (1740\u20131795), novelist and dramatist August Strindberg (1849\u20131912), and novelist Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg (1869\u20131941), all of whom made Stockholm part of their works. Other authors with notable heritage in Stockholm were the Nobel Prize laureate Eyvind Johnson (1900\u20131976) and the popular poet and composer Evert Taube (1890\u20131976). The novelist Per Anders Fogelstr\u00f6m (1917\u20131998) wrote a popular series of historical novels depicting life in Stockholm from the 19th to the mid-20th century.\nArchitecture.\nThe city's oldest section is Gamla stan (Old Town), located on the original small islands of the city's earliest settlements and still featuring the medieval street layout. Some notable buildings of Gamla Stan are the large German Church (\"Tyska kyrkan\") and several mansions and palaces: the \"Riddarhuset\" (the House of Nobles), the Bonde Palace, the Tessin Palace and the Oxenstierna Palace. The oldest building in Stockholm is the Riddarholmskyrkan from the late 13th century. After a fire in 1697 when the original medieval castle was destroyed, Stockholm Palace was erected in a baroque style. Storkyrkan Cathedral, the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Stockholm, stands next to the castle. It was founded in the 13th century but is clad in a baroque exterior dating to the 18th century.\nAs early as the 15th century, the city had expanded outside of its original borders. Some pre-industrial, small-scale buildings from this era can still be found in S\u00f6dermalm. During the 19th century and the age of industrialization Stockholm grew rapidly, with plans and architecture inspired by the large cities of the continent such as Berlin and Vienna. Notable works of this time period include public buildings such as the Royal Swedish Opera and private developments such as the luxury housing developments on Strandv\u00e4gen.\nIn the 20th century, a nationalistic push spurred a new architectural style inspired by medieval and renaissance ancestry as well as influences of the Jugend / Art Nouveau style. A key landmark of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Hall, was erected 1911\u20131923 by architect Ragnar \u00d6stberg. Other notable works of these times are the Stockholm Public Library and the Forest Cemetery, Skogskyrkog\u00e5rden\nModernism characterized the style of the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930) and the development of the city as it grew in that decade. New residential areas sprang up such as the development on G\u00e4rdet while industrial development added to the growth, such as the KF manufacturing industries on Kvarnholmen located in the Nacka Municipality. In the 1950s, suburban development entered a new phase with the introduction of the Stockholm metro. The modernist developments of V\u00e4llingby and Farsta where internationally praised. In the 1960s this suburban development continued but with the aesthetic of the times, the industrialised and mass-produced blocks of flats received a large amount of criticism.\nAt the same time that this suburban development was happening the most central areas of the inner city were being redesigned. Sergels Torg, with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period is the ensemble of the House of Culture, City Theatre and National Bank building, designed by architect Peter Celsing.\nMuseums.\nStockholm boasts some 70 museums, making the city host one of the largest numbers of museums in the world. Collectively, these museums are visited by over 9 million people per year.\nOne of the most renowned museums is the Nationalmuseum, with the largest national collection of art: 16,000 paintings and 30,000 objects of art handicraft. The collection dates back to the days of Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, and has since been expanded with works by artists such as Rembrandt, and Antoine Watteau, as well as constituting a main part of Sweden's art heritage, manifested in the works of Alexander Roslin, Anders Zorn, Johan Tobias Sergel, Carl Larsson, Carl Fredrik Hill and Ernst Josephson.\nThe Museum of Modern Art, or Moderna Museet, is Sweden's national museum of modern art. It has works by famous modern artists such as Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed. \nOther notable museums in Stockholm include:\nTheatres.\nDistinguished among Stockholm's many theatres are the Royal Dramatic Theatre (\"Dramaten\"), one of Europe's most renowned theatres, and the Royal Swedish Opera, inaugurated in 1773. \nOther notable theatres are the Stockholm City Theatre, the Peoples Opera (\"Folkoperan\"), the Modern Theatre of Dance (\"Moderna dansteatern\"), the China Theatre, the G\u00f6ta Lejon Theatre, the Mosebacke Theatre, and the Oscar Theatre.\nThe stages of Stockholm number in their fifties at the least, and a wide variety of plays are constantly on, from classical to newly written.\nMedia.\nStockholm is basically the media center of Sweden. It has four nationwide daily newspapers, is also the central location of the publicly funded radio (SR) and television (SVT); in addition, all other major television channels have their base in Stockholm (TV4 TV3, TV6 and Kanal 5). All major magazines are also located to Stockholm, as are the largest literature publisher, the Bonnier group.\nSports.\nThe most popular spectator sports are football and ice hockey. The three most popular football teams are AIK, Hammarby IF and Djurg\u00e5rdens IF.\nHistorically, the city was the host of the 1912 Summer Olympics. From those days stem the Stockholms Olympiastadion which has since hosted numerous sports events, notably football and athletics. Stadion is known as the home arena of Djurg\u00e5rdens IF. For Sweden men's national ice hockey team, the home arena is Avicii Arena, one of the largest spherical building in the world, but it is also hosting concerts and other events. \nStockholm also hosted all but one of the Nordic Games, a winter multi-sport event that predated the Winter Olympics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lawhead (born July 7, 1950) is an American writer known for his works of fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction, particularly Celtic historical fiction. He has written over 28 novels and numerous children's and non-fiction books.\nBiography.\nHe was born to Robert Eugene Lawhead and Lois Rowena Bissell Lawhead at Good Samaritan Hospital, Kearney, Nebraska. In 1968, Lawhead graduated from Kearney High School and entered Kearney State College as an Art major. In 1969, while at Kearney State College, he wrote a weekly humour column for the college newspaper and was a frequent contributor of poetry and short stories to \"The Shore Anthology\" and \"The Antler\". He paid his way through college largely through playing lead guitar in a college rock band named Mother Rush. Lawhead met Alice Slaikeu in 1971, and married her in 1972. He graduated from Kearney State College in 1973 with BA in Art and then went on to enroll in Northern Baptist Theological Seminary. During this time Lawhead also enrolled in a number of writing courses at nearby Wheaton College. His professional writing career began with five busy years as an editor and staff writer for Campus Life magazine. In 1980, Lawhead became the manager of the successful Christian rock act DeGarmo and Key and formed his own record company, Ariel Records. The demise of Ariel Records in 1981 prompted the beginning of Lawhead's fiction-writing career.\nIn 1981, Lawhead began to author novels, initially fantasy and science fiction, completing his first trilogy, the \"Dragon King trilogy\". In 1986, he moved to Oxford, England, to do research for The Pendragon Cycle, a reinterpretation of the legend of King Arthur in a Celtic setting combined with elements of Atlantis. Heavily rooted in the original Celtic source material which gave rise to the later and more familiar versions of the Arthurian legend, the series has received critical acclaim for its creative retelling of the Arthur legend and historical credibility.\nThe first book in the series, \"Taliesin\", won the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association's Gold Medallion Award for Fiction in 1988. Lawhead's research for The Pendragon Cycle sparked an interest in Celtic history and culture, especially Celtic Christianity, topics which have featured prominently in his work ever since.\n\"The Song of Albion\" trilogy prompted a return to England (Lawhead having left in 1987). This was a series of books set between the Celtic Otherworld and present-day Britain. In the 1990s, he published \"Byzantium\", a work of pure historical fiction, followed by \"The Celtic Crusades\" trilogy, set at the time of the Crusades, and then \"Avalon: The Return of King Arthur\", a stand-alone related to the \"Pendragon Cycle\".\nIn 2003, Lawhead published the novel \"Patrick: Son of Ireland\", a fictionalized account of the early years of Saint Patrick. In 2006, he published \"Hood\", the first book in the \"King Raven Trilogy\" \u2013 a retelling of the Robin Hood legend, transferred to Wales. In 2008, the second book in the trilogy, \"Scarlet\", won a Christy Award in the category of Visionary Fiction.\nIn 2003, Lawhead received an honorary doctorate from the University of Nebraska at Kearney.\nLawhead and his wife reside in Oxford, UK. He has two sons, Ross Lawhead, and Drake Lawhead.\nWorks.\nAdult fiction.\nMany of his books are in series following a common theme:\nDragon King trilogy:\nEmpyrion Saga:\nThe Pendragon Cycle:\n* \"Aurelia\" (prequel; forthcoming January 2025)\nSong of Albion:\nThe Celtic Crusades:\nKing Raven Trilogy:\nHero (With Ross Lawhead):\nBright Empires:\nEirlandia:\nStand-alone novels:\nChildren's fiction.\nThe Brown Ears Books:\nThe Howard Books\nThe Riverbank Series\nBooks contributed to.\nLawhead has also contributed essays or chapters to several books. His essay \"J.R.R. Tolkien: Master of Middle-earth\", which describes the impact J. R. R. Tolkien's writings had on him, is featured in the following titles:\nLawhead has contributed to one fictional compilation, writing a chapter in the serial mystery novel \"Carnage at Christhaven\" (1989 \u2013 ed. William Griffin).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27951", "revid": "14462949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27951", "title": "Servius Tullius", "text": "King of Rome from c. 578 to 535 BC\nServius Tullius was the legendary sixth king of Rome, and the second of its Etruscan dynasty. He reigned from 578 to 535\u00a0BC. Roman and Greek sources describe his servile origins and later marriage to a daughter of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, Rome's first Etruscan king, who was assassinated in 579\u00a0BC. The constitutional basis for his accession is unclear; he is variously described as the first Roman king to accede without election by the Senate, having gained the throne by popular and royal support; and as the first to be elected by the Senate alone, with support of the reigning queen but without recourse to a popular vote.\nSeveral traditions describe Servius's father as divine. Livy depicts Servius's mother as a captured Latin princess enslaved by the Romans; her child is chosen as Rome's future king after a ring of fire is seen around his head. The Emperor Claudius discounted such origins and described him as an originally Etruscan mercenary, named Mastarna, who fought for Caelius Vibenna.\nServius was a popular king, and one of Rome's most significant benefactors. He had military successes against Veii and the Etruscans, and expanded the city to include the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline hills. He is traditionally credited with the institution of the Compitalia festivals, the building of temples to Fortuna and Diana and, less plausibly, the invention of Rome's first true coinage.\nDespite the opposition of Rome's patricians, he expanded the Roman franchise and improved the lot and fortune of Rome's lowest classes of citizens and non-citizens. According to Livy, he reigned for 44 years, until murdered by his daughter Tullia and son-in-law Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. In consequence of this \"tragic crime\" and his hubristic arrogance as king, Tarquinius was eventually removed. This cleared the way for the abolition of Rome's monarchy and the founding of the Roman Republic, whose groundwork had already been laid by Servius's reforms.\nBackground.\nBefore its establishment as a Republic, Rome was ruled by kings (Latin \"reges\", singular \"rex\"). In Roman tradition, Rome's founder Romulus was the first. Servius Tullius was the sixth, and his successor Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud) was the last. The nature of Roman kingship is unclear; most Roman kings were elected by the senate, as to a lifetime magistracy, but some claimed succession through dynastic or divine right. Some were native Romans, others were foreign. Later Romans had a complex ideological relationship with this distant past. In Republican mores and institutions kingship was abhorrent; and remained so, in name at least, during the Empire. On the one hand, Romulus was held to have brought Rome into being more-or-less at a stroke, so complete and purely Roman in its essentials that any acceptable change or reform thereafter must be clothed as restoration. On the other, Romans of the Republic and Empire saw each king as contributing in some distinctive and novel way to the city's fabric and territories, or its social, military, religious, legal or political institutions. Servius Tullius has been described as Rome's \"second founder\", \"the most complex and enigmatic\" of all its kings, and a kind of \"proto-Republican magistrate\".\nAncient sources.\nThe oldest surviving source for the overall political developments of the Roman kingdom and Republic is Cicero's \"De republica\" (\"On the State\"), written in 44\u00a0BC. The main literary sources for Servius's life and achievements are the Roman historian Livy (59\u00a0BC \u2013 AD\u00a017), whose \"Ab urbe condita\" was generally accepted by the Romans as the standard, most authoritative account; Livy's near contemporary Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Plutarch (c. 46 \u2013 120 AD); their own sources included works by Quintus Fabius Pictor, Diocles of Peparethus, Quintus Ennius and Cato the Elder. Livy's sources probably included at least some official state records, he excluded what seemed implausible or contradictory traditions, and arranged his material within an overarching chronology. Dionysius and Plutarch offer various alternatives not found in Livy, and Livy's own pupil, the etruscologist, historian and emperor Claudius, offered yet another, based on Etruscan tradition.\nOrigins.\nParentage and birth.\nMost Roman sources name Servius's mother as Ocrisia, a young noblewoman taken at the Roman siege of Corniculum and brought to Rome, either pregnant by her husband, who was killed at the siege: or as a virgin. She was given to Tanaquil, wife of king Tarquinius, and though slave, was treated with the respect due her former status. In one variant, she became wife to a noble client of Tarquinius. In others, she served the domestic rites of the royal hearth as a Vestal Virgin, and on one such occasion, having damped the hearth flames with a sacrificial offering, she was penetrated and impregnated by a disembodied phallus that rose from the hearth. According to Tanaquil, this was a divine manifestation, either of the household Lar or Vulcan himself. Thus Servius was divinely fathered and already destined for greatness, despite his mother's servile status; for the time being, Tanaquil and Ocrisia kept this a secret.\nEarly life.\nServius's birth to a slave of the royal household would have made him a member of Tarquin's extended domestic \"familia\", and a slave himself. Livy describes Servius as a youth already holding an honourable position, as son of a living, noble mother and noble father. He is singled out for special favour when members of the royal household witness a nimbus of fire about his head while he sleeps, a sign of divine favour, and a great portent. In Livy's version, Servius becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the royal family (\"like a son\") through this event, and later marries their daughter Tarquinia. For Livy, this marriage undermines the traditional narrative in which Ocrisia, and thus her son Servius, are household slaves; Livy asserts that no slave, nor any of slave descent, could have been granted the great honour of marriage into Rome's ruling family. \nServius proves a loyal, responsible son-in-law. When given governmental and military responsibilities, he excels in both. Plutarch, citing Valerius Antias \"and his school\", names Servius's wife as Gegania: the nimbus of fire appears around the sleeping Servius much later, when Gegania is dying; \"a token of his birth from fire\".\nReign.\nIn Livy's account, Tarquinius Priscus had been elected king on the death of the previous king, Ancus Marcius, whose two sons were too young to inherit or offer themselves for election. When Servius's popularity and his marriage to Tarquinius's daughter made him a likely successor to the throne, these sons attempted to seize the throne for themselves. They hired two assassins, who attacked and severely wounded Tarquinius. Tanaquil immediately ordered the palace to be shut, and publicly announced from a palace window that Tarquinius had appointed Servius as regent; meanwhile, Tarquinius died of his wounds. When his death became public knowledge, the senate elected Servius as king, and the sons of Ancus fled to exile in Suessa Pometia. Livy describes this as the first occasion that the people of Rome were not involved in the election of the king. In Plutarch, Servius reluctantly consented to the kingship at the death-bed insistence of Tanaquil.\nEarly in his reign, Servius warred against Veii and the Etruscans. He is said to have shown valour in the campaign, and to have routed a great army of the enemy. His success helped him to cement his position at Rome. According to the \"Fasti Triumphales\", Servius celebrated three triumphs over the Etruscans, including on 25 November 571 BC and 25 May 567 BC (the date of the third triumph is not legible on the \"Fasti\").\nServian reforms.\nMost of the reforms credited to Servius extended voting rights to certain groups \u2013 in particular to Rome's citizen-commoners (known in the Republican era as plebs), minor landholders previously disqualified from voting by ancestry, status or ethnicity. The same reforms simultaneously defined the fiscal and military obligations of all Roman citizens. As a whole, the so-called Servian reforms probably represent a long-drawn, complex and piecemeal process of populist policy and reform, extending from Servius's predecessors, Ancus Marcius and Tarquinius Priscus, to his successor Tarquinius Superbus, and into the Middle and Late Republic. Rome's military and territorial expansion and consequent changes in its population would have made franchise regulation and reform an ongoing necessity, and their wholesale attribution to Servius \"cannot be taken at face value\".\nCuriate reform and census.\nUntil the Servian reforms, the passing of laws and judgment was the prerogative of the \"comitia curiata\" (curiate assembly), made up from thirty curiae; Roman sources describe ten curiae for each of three aristocratic tribes or clans, each supposedly based on one of Rome's central hills, and claiming patrician status by virtue of their descent from Rome's founding families. These tribes comprised approximately 200 \"gentes\" (clans), each of which contributed one senator (\"elder\") to the Senate. The senate advised the king, devised laws in his name, and was held to represent the entire \"populus Romanus\" (Roman people); but it could only debate and discuss. Its decisions had no force unless approved by the \"comitia curiata\". By the time of Servius, if not long before, the tribes of the \"comitia\" were a minority of the population, ruling a multitude who had no effective voice in their own government.\nRome's far more populous citizen-commoners could participate in this assembly in limited fashion, and perhaps offer their opinions on decisions but only the \"comitia curiata\" could vote. A minority thus exercised power and control over the majority. Roman tradition held that Servius formed a comitia centuriata of commoners to displace the \"comitia curiata\" as Rome's central legislative body. This required his development of the first Roman census, making Servius the first Roman censor. For the purposes of the census, citizens assembled by tribe in the Campus Martius to register their social rank, household, property and income. This established an individual's tax obligations, his ability to muster arms for military service when required to do so, and his assignment to a particular voting bloc.\nThe institution of the census and the \"comitia centuriata\" are speculated as Servius's attempt to erode the civil and military power of the Roman aristocracy, and seek the direct support of his newly enfranchised citizenry in civil matters; if necessary, under arms. The \"comitia curiata\" continued to function through the Regal and Republican eras, but the Servian reform had reduced its powers to those of a largely symbolic \"upper house\"; its noble members were expected to do no more than ratify decisions of the \"comitia centuriata\".\nClasses.\nThe census grouped Rome's male citizen population in classes, according to status, wealth and age. Each class was subdivided into groups called \"centuriae\" (centuries), nominally of 100 men (Latin \"centum\" = 100) but in practice of variable number, further divided as \"seniores\" (men aged 46 \u2013 60, of a suitable age to serve as \"home guards\" or city police) and \"iuniores\" (men aged 17 \u2013 45, to serve as front\u2013line troops when required). Adult male citizens were obliged, when called upon, to fulfill military service according to their means, which was supposedly assessed in archaic \"asses\". A citizen's wealth and class would, therefore, have defined their position in the civil hierarchies, and up to a point, within the military; but despite its apparent military character, and its possible origins as the mustering of the citizenry-at-arms, the system would have primarily served to determine the voting qualifications and wealth of individual citizens for taxation purposes, and the weight of their vote \u2013 wars were occasional but taxation was a constant necessity \u2013 and the comitia centuriata met whenever required to do so, in peace or war. Though each century had voting rights, the wealthiest had the most centuries, and voted first. Those beneath them were convened only in the event of deadlock or indecision; the lowest class was unlikely to vote at all.\nThe Roman army's \"centuria\" system and its order of battle are thought to be based on the civilian classifications established by the census. The military selection process picked men from civilian \"centuriae\" and slipped them into military ones. Their function depended on their age, experience, and the equipment they could afford. The wealthiest class of \"iuniores\" (aged 17\u201345) were armed as hoplites, heavy infantry with helmet, greaves, breastplate, shields (\"clipeus\"), and spears (\"hastae\"). Each battle line in the phalanx formation was composed of a single class. Military specialists, such as trumpeters, were chosen from the 5th class. The highest officers were of aristocratic origin until the early Republic, when the first plebeian tribunes were elected by the plebeians from their own number. Cornell suggests that this centuriate system made the equites, who \"consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of patricians\" but voted after infantry of the first class, subordinate to the relatively low-status infantry.\nTribal and boundary expansions.\nThe Servian reforms increased the number of tribes and expanded the city, which was protected by a new rampart, moat and wall. The enclosed area was divided into four administrative \"regiones\" (regions, or quarters); the Suburana, Esquilana, Collina and Palatina. Servius himself is said to have taken a new residence, on the Esquiline. The situation beyond the walls is unclear, but thereafter, membership of a Roman voting-tribe would have depended on residence rather than kinship, ancestry and inheritance. This would have brought significant numbers of urban and rural \"plebs\" into active political life; and a significant number of these would have been allocated to centuries of the first class, and therefore likely to vote. The city of Rome's division into \"quarters\" remained in use until 7\u00a0BC, when Augustus divided the city into 14 new \"regiones\". In modern Rome, an ancient portion of surviving wall is attributed to Servius, the remainder supposedly being rebuilt after the sack of Rome in 390/387\u00a0BC by the Gauls.\nEconomy.\nSome Roman historians believed Servius Tullius responsible for Rome's earliest true, minted coinage, replacing an earlier and less convenient currency of raw bullion. This is unlikely, though he may have introduced the official stamping of raw currency. Money played a minimal role in the Roman economy, which was almost entirely agrarian at this time. Debt and debt bondage, however, were probably rife. The form of such debts would have had little resemblance to those of cash-debtors, compelled to pay interest to money-lenders on an advance of capital. Rather, wealthy landowners would make an \"advance loan\" of seed, foodstuffs or other essentials to tenants, clients and smallholders, in return for a promise of labour services or a substantial share of the crop. The terms of such \"loans\" compelled defaulters to sell themselves, or their dependants, to their creditor; or, if smallholders, to surrender their farm. Wealthy aristocratic landholders thus acquired additional farms and service for very little outlay. Dionysius claims that Servius paid such debts \"from his own purse\", and forbade voluntary and compulsory debt bondage. In reality, these practices persisted well into the Republican era. Livy describes the distribution of land grants to poor and landless citizens by Servius and others as the political pursuit of popular support from citizens of little merit or worth.\nReligion.\nServius is credited with the construction of Diana's temple on the Aventine Hill, to mark the foundation of the so-called Latin League; His servile birth-mythos, his populist leanings and his reorganisation of the \"vici\" appear to justify the Roman belief that he founded or reformed the Compitalia festivals (held to celebrate the Lares that watched over each local community), or allowed for the first time their attendance and service by non-citizens and slaves. His personal reputation and achievements may have led to his historical association with temples and shrines to Fortuna; some sources suggest that the two were connected during Servius's lifetime, via some form of \"sacred marriage\". Plutarch explicitly identifies the \"Porta Fenestella\" (\"window gate\") of the Royal palace as the window from which Tanaquil announced Servius's regency to the people; the goddess Fortuna was said to have passed through the same window, to become Servius's consort.\nAssassination.\nIn Livy's history, Servius Tullius had two daughters, Tullia the Elder and Tullia the Younger. He arranged their marriage to the two sons of his predecessor, Lucius Tarquinius and Arruns Tarquinius. The younger Tullia and Lucius procured the murders of their respective siblings, married, and conspired to remove Servius Tullius. Tullia Minor encouraged Lucius Tarquinius to secretly persuade or bribe senators, and Tarquinius went to the senate-house with a group of armed men. Then he summoned the senators and gave a speech criticising Servius: for being a slave born of a slave; for failing to be elected by the Senate and the people during an interregnum, as had been the tradition for the election of kings of Rome; for being gifted the throne by a woman; for favouring the lower classes of Rome over the wealthy; for taking the land of the upper classes for distribution to the poor; and for instituting the census, which exposed the wealthy upper classes to popular envy.\nWhen Servius Tullius arrived at the senate-house to defend his position, Tarquinius threw him down the steps and Servius was murdered in the street by Tarquin's men. Soon after, Tullia drove her chariot over her father's body. For Livy, Tarquinius's impious refusal to permit his father-in-law's burial earned him the sobriquet \"Superbus\" (\u201carrogant\u201d or \u201cproud\u201d), and Servius's death is a \"tragic crime\" (\"tragicum scelus\"), a dark episode in Rome's history and just cause for the abolition of the monarchy. Servius thus becomes the last of Rome's benevolent kings; the place of this outrage \u2013 which Livy seems to suggest as a crossroads \u2013 is known thereafter as \"Vicus Sceleratus\" (street of shame, infamy or crime). His murder is parricide, the worst of all crimes. This morally justifies Tarquin's eventual expulsion and the abolition of Rome's aberrant, \"un-Roman\" monarchy. Livy's Republic is partly founded on the achievements and death of Rome's last benevolent king.\nHistorical appraisals.\nBirth.\nClaims of divine ancestry and divine favour were often attached to charismatic individuals who rose \"as if from nowhere\" to become dynasts, tyrants and hero-founders in the ancient Mediterranean world. Yet all these legends offer the father as divine, the mother \u2013 virgin or not \u2013 as princess of a ruling house, never as slave. The disembodied phallus and its impregnation of a virgin slave of Royal birth are unique to Servius. Livy and Dionysius ignore or reject the tales of Servius's supernatural virgin birth; though his parents came from a conquered people, both are of noble stock. His ancestry is an accident of fate, and his character and virtues are entirely Roman. He acts on behalf of the Roman people, not for personal gain; these Roman virtues are likely to find favour with the gods, and win the rewards of good fortune.\nThe details of Servius's servile birth, miraculous conception and links with divine Fortuna were doubtless embellished after his own time, but the core may have been propagated during his reign. His unconstitutional and seemingly reluctant accession, and his direct appeal to the Roman masses over the heads of the senate may have been interpreted as signs of tyranny. Under these circumstances, an extraordinary personal charisma must have been central to his success. When Servius expanded Rome's influence and boundaries, and reorganised its citizenship and armies, his \"new Rome\" was still centered on the \"Comitium\", the \"Casa Romuli\" or \"hut\" of Romulus. Servius became a second Romulus, a benefactor to his people, part human, part divine; but his slave origins remain without parallel, and make him all the more remarkable: for Cornell, this is \"the most important single fact about him\". The story of his servile birth evidently circulated far beyond Rome; Mithridates VI of Pontus sneered that Rome had made kings of \"servos vernasque Tuscorum\" (Etruscan slaves and domestic servants).\nEtruscan Servius.\nClaudius's story of Servius as an Etruscan named \"Macstarna\" (title for \"dictator\" in Etruscan) was published as an incidental scholarly comment within the \"Oratio Claudii Caesaris\" of the Lugdunum Tablet. There is some support for this Etruscan version of Servius, in wall paintings at the Fran\u00e7ois Tomb in Etruscan Vulci. They were commissioned some time in the second half of the 4th century BC. One panel shows heroic Etruscans putting foreign captives to the sword. The victims include an individual named Gneve Tarchunies Rumach, interpreted as a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius, although known Roman history records no Tarquinius of that praenomen. The victors include Aule and Caile Vipinas \u2013 known to the Romans as the Vibenna brothers \u2013 and their ally Macstrna [Macstarna], who seems instrumental in winning the day. Claudius was certain that Macstarna was simply another name for Servius Tullius, who started his career as an Etruscan ally of the Vibenna brothers and helped them settle Rome's Caelian Hill. Claudius's account evidently drew on sources unavailable to his fellow-historians, or rejected by them. There may have been two different, Servius-like figures, or two different traditions about the same figure. \"Macstarna\" may have been the name of a once celebrated Etruscan hero, or more speculatively, an Etruscan rendering of Roman \"magister\" (magistrate). Claudius's \"Etruscan Servius\" seems less a monarch than a freelance Roman \"magister\", an \"archaic condottiere\" who placed himself and his own band of armed clients at Vibenna's service, and may later have seized, rather than settled Rome's Caelian Hill. If the Etruscan Macstarna was identical with the Roman Servius, the latter may have been less monarch than some kind of proto-Republican magistrate given permanent office, perhaps a \"magister populi\", a war-leader, or in Republican parlance, a \"dictator\".\nLegacy.\nServius's political reforms and those of his successor Tarquinius Superbus undermined the bases of aristocratic power and transferred them in part to commoners. Rome's ordinary citizens became a distinct force within Roman politics, entitled to participate in government and bear arms on its behalf, despite the opposition and resentment of Rome's patricians and senate. Tarquinius was ousted by a conspiracy of patricians, not plebeians. Once in existence, the \"comitia centuriata\" could not be unmade, or its powers reduced: as Republican Rome's highest court of appeal, it had the capacity to overturn court decisions, and the Republican senate was constitutionally obliged to seek its approval. In time, the \"comitia centuriata\" legitimized the rise to power of a plebeian nobility, and plebeian consuls.\nServius's connections to the Lar and his reform of the vici connect him directly to the founding of Compitalia, instituted to publicly and piously honour his divine parentage \u2013 assuming the Lar as his father \u2013 to extend his domestic rites into the broader community, to mark his maternal identification with the lower ranks of Roman society and to assert his regal sponsorship and guardianship of their rights. Some time before the Augustan Compitalia reforms of 7 BC, Dionysius of Halicarnassus reports Servius's fathering by a Lar and his founding of Compitalia as ancient Roman traditions. In Servius, Augustus found ready association with a popular benefactor and refounder of Rome, whose reluctance to adopt kingship distanced him from its taints. Augustus brought the Compitalia and its essentially plebeian festivals, customs and political factions under his patronage and if need be, his censorial powers. He did not, however, trace his lineage and his re-founding to Servius \u2013 who even with part-divine ancestry still had servile connections \u2013 but with Romulus, patrician founding hero, ancestor of the divine Julius Caesar, descendant of Venus and Mars. Plutarch admires the Servian reforms for their imposition of good order in government, the military and public morality, and Servius himself as the wisest, most fortunate and best of all Rome's kings.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
