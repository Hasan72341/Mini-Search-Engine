It is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, with Timothy as a co-author. Its authorship is disputed, with critical commentators being evenly divided on Pauline authorship. Those who reject its authenticity point to differences in style and theology between it and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, which is undisputed.\nScholars who support its authenticity view it as having been written around 51\u201352 AD, shortly after the First Epistle. Those who see it as a later composition assign a date of around 80\u2013115 AD.\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek.\nComposition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians [...]\nThe authenticity of this epistle is still in dispute. James D. G. Dunn finds a \u201croughly even split among critical commentators on Colossians and 2 Thessalonians.\u201d A survey of 111 scholars from the British New Testament Conference in 2011 found 63 in favor of authenticity, while 13 rejected Pauline authorship and 35 felt uncertain. Even assuming that it is authentic, this epistle was not sent by Paul alone, but by three people: Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy.\nAs Professor Ernest Best, New Testament scholar, explains the problem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]f we only possessed \"Second Thessalonians\" few scholars would doubt that Paul wrote it; but when \"Second Thessalonians\" is put alongside \"First Thessalonians\" then doubts appear. There is a great dissimilarity between the two; this is not only one of words, small phrases and concepts but extends to the total structure of the two letters which is in addition different from what is taken to be the standard Pauline form. At the same time the second letter is alleged to be less intimate and personal in tone than the first, and in some of its teaching, particularly in relation to eschatology, to conflict with the first.\u2014\u200a\nThe structures of the two letters (to which Best refers) include opening greetings (a, 2 Thessalonians 1:1\u20132) and closing benedictions (1 Thessalonians 5:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:16d\u201318) which frame two, balancing, sections (AA'). In 2 Thessalonians these begin with similar successions of nine Greek words, at 1:3 and 2:13. The opening letter section (1:3\u20132:12) itself comprises two halves, 1:3\u201312 (where the introductory piece, A, is 1:3\u20135; the first development, B, is 1:6\u201310; and the paralleling and concluding development, B', is 1:11\u201312) and 2:1\u201312 (with pieces: A 2:1\u20134, B 2:5\u20137, B' 2:8\u201312).\nThe second, balancing, letter section (2:13\u20133:16c) also comprises two halves: 2:13\u20133:5 (with pieces: A 2:13\u201314, B 2:15\u201317, B' 3:1\u20135) and 3:6\u201316c (with pieces: A 3:6\u20139, B 3:10\u201312, B' 3:13-16c). Of the twelve pieces in 2 Thessalonians, seven begin with 'brother' introductions. Of the eighteen pieces in 1 Thessalonians, fourteen begin with 'brother' introductions. In both letters, the sections balance in size and focus, and in many details. In 2 Thessalonians, in 2:5 and 3:10, for example, there is a structural balance of the use of \"when I was with you...\" and \"when we were with you...\".\nSupport for authenticity.\nOne piece of evidence for the authenticity of the epistle is that it was included in Marcion's canon and the Muratorian fragment. It was also mentioned by name by Irenaeus, and quoted by Ignatius, Justin, and Polycarp.\nGeorge Milligan argued that a church which possessed an authentic letter of Paul would be unlikely to accept a fake addressed to them. This argument was similarly supported by Colin Nicholl, who has put forward a substantial argument for the authenticity of Second Thessalonians. He points out that \"the pseudonymous view is[...] more vulnerable than most of its advocates conceded.[...] The lack of consensus regarding a date and destination[...] reflects a dilemma for this position: on the one hand, the date needs to be early enough for the letter to have been accepted as Pauline[...] [on] the other hand, the date and destination need to be such that the author could be confident that no contemporary of 1 Thessalonians [...] could have exposed 2 Thessalonians as a[...] forgery.\"\nAnother scholar who argues for the authenticity of this letter is Jerome Murphy-O'Connor. Admitting that there are stylistic problems between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Thessalonians, he argues that part of the problem is due to the composite nature of 2 Thessalonians. Murphy-O'Connor, along with many others scholars, argues that the current text of 2 Thessalonians is the product of merging two or more authentic letters of Paul. Once the text of this interpolated letter is removed and the two letters compared, Murphy-O'Connor asserts that this objection is \"drastically weakened\", and concludes, \"The arguments against the authenticity of 2 Thessalonians are so weak that it is preferable to accept the traditional ascription of the letter to Paul.\"\nThose who believe Paul was the author of 2 Thessalonians also note how Paul drew attention to the authenticity of the letter by signing it himself: \"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I write in every letter.\" Bruce Metzger writes, \"Paul calls attention to his signature, which was added by his own hand as a token of genuineness to every letter of his (3:17).\" While some draw attention to this verse as an excessive attempt of a forging author to convince his readers of authenticity, a parallel stock phrase has been noted by some in the authentic Galatians 6:11. A parallel has also been noted among Cyprian where he stresses in his 9th epistle, under potential fears of the circulation of a forged letter, that examination of the style of the signature should be used in order to authenticate the letter: \"examine whether both the writing and the signature are yours and write back to us what the matter is in truth.\"\nOther scholars who hold to authenticity include Gregory Beale, Gene L. Green, Ivor H. Jones, Leon Morris, Ben Witherington III, Paul Foster, Tom Wright, and Kretzmann. According to Leon Morris in 1986, the majority of current scholars at that time still held to Paul's authorship of 2 Thessalonians.\nOpposition to authenticity.\nAt least as early as 1798, when Johann Ernst Christian Schmidt published his opinion, Paul's authorship of this epistle was questioned. More recent challenges to this traditional belief came from scholars such as William Wrede in 1903 and Alfred Loisy in 1933, who challenged the traditional view of the authorship.\nRegarding Nicholl's argument for authenticity, on the one hand, it is worth noting that at least some forged Pauline letters were written well after a date modern scholars might deem early enough for the letter to be considered Pauline, such as the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, estimated to have been written around 160-170 CE; forgers were not forced to write close in time to the writers they imitated. On the other hand, it is not clear that a forger would need to ensure his writing was not contemporaneous with 1 Thessalonians if he was not actually writing the letter to Thessalonica; furthermore, if Nicholls is correct in believing 2 Thessalonians to be authentic, then Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:2 provides evidence that forgeries in his name already existed in his own lifetime, discrediting his argument that forgers would take care to write far enough apart in time to ensure contemporaries could not denounce the forgery.\nIn his book \"Forged\", New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman puts forward some of the most common arguments against the authenticity of 2 Thessalonians. For example, he argues that the views concerning the Second Coming of Christ expressed in 2 Thessalonians differ so strikingly from those found in 1 Thessalonians that they cannot be written by the same author.\nSeveral modern scholars agree with Ehrman that 2 Thessalonians was not written by Paul but by an associate or disciple after his death. Scholars include Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Vincent Smiles, Udo Schnelle, Eugene Boring, and Joseph Kelly. Norman Perrin observes, \"The best understanding of 2 Thessalonians[...] is to see it as a deliberate imitation of 1 Thessalonians, updating the apostle's thought.\" Perrin bases this claim on his hypothesis that prayer at the time usually treated God the Father as ultimate judge, rather than Jesus.\nDaryl Schmidt performed a detailed syntactical comparison between 2 Thess and other disputed letters attributed to Paul in comparison to his undisputed letters and concluded that 2 Thess is highly unlikely to have been written by Paul. Among the undisputed letters, there are five embedded clauses at four layers of embeddedness in the longest sentence in the opening thanksgiving section of the Letter to the Romans, six clauses at four layers in 1 Corinthians, five clauses at three levels in 2 Corinthians, six clauses at one level in Philippians, and ten clauses at five levels in 1 Thessalonians. 2 Thessalonians, in contrast, has an uncharacteristic twenty-two clauses at fifteen levels of embeddedness in the equivalent section. Schmidt demonstrates similar anomalies in 2 Thess' structures of genitive constructions in non-phrase strings, and its frequent reliance on coordinating and subordinating constructions, and concludes that \u2014 in combination with other evidence \u2014 it is highly unlikely to have been written by Paul.\nBackground.\nThessalonica was the second city in Europe where Paul helped to create an organized Christian community. At some point after the first letter was sent, probably soon, some of the Thessalonians grew concerned over whether those who had died would share in the parousia. This letter was written in response to this concern. The problem then arises, as Raymond Brown points out, whether this letter is an authentic writing of Paul or written by one of his followers in his name.\nIf this letter is authentic, then it might have been written soon after Paul's first letter to this community\u2014or possibly years later. Brown notes that Paul \"most likely visited Thessalonica several times in his journeys to Macedonia\". However, if the letter is not authentic, Brown notes that \"in some ways interpretation becomes more complex.\" Brown believes that the majority of scholars who advocate pseudonymity would place it towards the end of the first century, the same time that Revelation was written. These scholars emphasize the appearance of \"that man of sin\" in the second chapter of this letter, whether this personage is identified with the Antichrist of 1 John and Revelation, or with a historical person like Caligula.\nContent.\nThe traditional view is that the second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably written from Corinth not many months after the first.\nBiblical commentator and pastor John MacArthur writes, \"The emphasis is on how to maintain a church with an effective testimony in proper response to sound eschatology and obedience to the truth.\"\nPaul opens the letter praising this church for their faithfulness and perseverance in the face of persecution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater; therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure\u2014\u200a\nThe letter contains a whole chapter regarding the second advent of Christ, among other themes and instructions.\nFrom the inference of 2:1\u20132, the Thessalonians were faced with a false teaching, saying that Christ had already returned. This error is corrected in chapter 2 (2:1\u201312), where Paul tells the Thessalonians that a great tribulation must occur before Christ's return. Seeing as how this series of events has not yet happened, his argument reads, Christ cannot have returned yet. He then expresses thanks that his readers were the elect of God, chosen for salvation and saved by his grace through faith, and thus not susceptible to the deception of the \"Great Apostasy,\" (2 Thessalonians 2:13\u201314) first mentioned here as is the \"Katechon\" (2 Thessalonians 2:6\u20137).\nIn 2 Thessalonians 2:15, Paul instructs his readers to \"[h]old fast to the traditions (, ) which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by our letter.\" Quoting this verse, in his \"On the Holy Spirit\", Basil the Great writes, \"These [traditions] have been passed on by word of mouth from Paul or from the other apostles, without necessarily being written down,\" and mentions the Trinitarian confession of faith as an example of \"unwritten tradition\". Cyril of Jerusalem shares a similar view in his \"Catechetical Lectures\", argues that the traditions stated by Paul should be preserved and memorized, at a minimum in the form of the Creed. In his homily on this verse, John Chrysostom differentiates oral tradition from written tradition. At that time, the oral tradition has been defined as the \"tradition\" and the written tradition as \"Scripture\", united together in \"the authenticity of their apostolic origin\". Everett Ferguson says Paul's reference to tradition implicates that \"what was delivered was from the Lord\", and John Stott calls the tradition () \"apostolic 'tradition'\".\nThe letter continues by encouraging the Thessalonian church to stand firm in their faith, and to \"keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us[...] do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother\" (2 Thessalonians 3:6\u20137, 14\u201315).\nPaul ends this letter by saying, \"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all\" (2 Thessalonians 3:17\u201318). Macarthur writes, \"Paul added an identifying signature (cf. 1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18) so his readers could be sure he was truly the author.\"\nA passage from this book reading \"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat\", (3:10), was later adapted by Vladimir Lenin as an adage of the Soviet Union: \"he who does not work, neither shall he eat\".\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this book are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0\nExternal links.\nOnline translations of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians\nExegetical Papers on Second Thessalonians"}

American poet Marc Smith, believing the poetry scene at the time was \"too structured and stuffy\", began experimenting by attending open-microphone poetry readings, and then turning them into slams by introducing the element of competition.\nThe performances at a poetry slam are judged as much on performance as content, and poets may compete as individuals or in teams. The judging is often handled by a panel of judges, typically five, who are usually selected from the audience. Sometimes the poets are judged by audience response.\nHistory.\nAmerican poet Marc Smith is credited with starting the poetry slam movement at the Get Me High Lounge in Chicago in November 1984. In July 1986, the original slam moved to its permanent home, the Green Mill Jazz Club. In 1987, the Ann Arbor Poetry Slam was founded by Vince Keuter. In August 1988, the first poetry slam held in New York City was hosted by Bob Holman at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.\nIn 1990, the first American National Poetry Slam took place at Fort Mason, San Francisco. \nToday, there are regular poetry slam competitions all around the globe.\nWhile slam poetry has often been ignored in traditional higher learning institutions, it slowly is finding its way into courses and programs of study. For example, at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, slam poetry is now available as a minor course of study.\nFormat.\nDifferent formats of poetry slams exist throughout the world. Generally, however, in a poetry slam, members of the audience are chosen by a master of ceremonies (MC) to act as judges for the event, though scoring can also be done by the audience. After each poet performs, a score is awarded to the performance. Scores generally range between zero and ten.\nBefore the competition begins, the host will often bring up a \"sacrificial\" poet, whom the judges will score in order to calibrate their judging.\nA single round at a standard slam consists of performances by all eligible poets. Most slams last multiple rounds, and many involve the elimination of lower-scoring poets in successive rounds. An elimination format might run 8\u20134\u20132; eight poets in the first round, four in the second, and two in the last. At the end of the slam, the poet with the highest number of points earned is the winner.\nProps, costumes, and music are typically forbidden in slams, which differs greatly from its immediate predecessor, performance poetry. \nOther rules for slams include enforcing a time limit, after which a poet's score may be docked based on how long the poem exceeded the limit for. The time limit is usually around three to four minutes.\nIn an \"Open Slam\", the most common slam type, competition is open to all who wish to compete, given the number of slots available. In an \"Invitational Slam\", only those invited to do so may compete.\nTheme slams.\nIn 1998, spoken word poet Emanuel Xavier created the House of Xavier and the Glam Slam, an annual downtown arts event staged at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. The fusion of ball culture and poetry slam competitions featured four open categories such as Best Erotic Poem in Sexy Underwear or Lingerie, Best Verbal Vogue and Best Love Poem in Fire Engine Red (alternately Best Bitter Break Up Poem in Blue). Winners of each category received a trophy and went on to compete for the Grand Prize title of Glam Slam Champion. The annual competition was first held in New York City and then London until 2010.\nSimilar to the House of Xavier's Glam Slam, a \"Theme Slam\" was one in which all performances must conform to a specified theme, genre, or formal constraint. Themes may include Nerd, Erotica, Queer, Improv, or other conceptual limitations. In theme slams, poets can sometimes be allowed to break \"traditional\" slam rules. For instance, they sometimes allow performance of work by another poet (e.g. the \"Dead Poet Slam\", in which all work must be by a deceased poet). They can also allow changes on the restrictions on costumes or props (e.g. the Swedish \"Triathlon\" slams that allow for a poet, musician, and dancer to all take the stage at the same time), changing the judging structure (e.g. having a specific guest judge), or changing the time limits (e.g. a \"1-2-3\" slam with three rounds of one minute, two minutes, and three minutes, respectively).\nTheme slams are frequently used to advocate participation by particular and perhaps underrepresented demographics (which vary from slam to slam), like younger poets and women.\nPerformative aspects.\nPoetry slams can feature a broad range of voices, styles, cultural traditions, and approaches to writing and performance. The originator of performance poetry, Hedwig Gorski, credits slam poetry for carrying on the poetics of ancient oral poetry designed to grab attention in barrooms and public squares.\nSome poets are closely associated with the vocal delivery style found in hip-hop music and draw heavily on the tradition of dub poetry, a rhythmic and politicized genre belonging to black and particularly West Indian culture. Others employ an unrhyming narrative formula. Some use traditional theatrical devices including shifting voices and tones, while others may recite an entire poem in ironic monotone. Some poets use nothing but their words to deliver a poem, while others stretch the boundaries of the format, tap-dancing or beatboxing or using highly choreographed movements.\nWhat is a dominant/successful style one year may not be passed to the next. Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz, slam poet and author of \"Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam\", was quoted in an interview on the Best American Poetry blog as saying:\nOne of the more interesting end products (to me, at least) of this constant shifting is that poets in the slam always worry that something\u2014a style, a project, a poet\u2014will become so dominant that it will kill the scene, but it never does. Ranting hipsters, freestyle rappers, bohemian drifters, proto-comedians, mystical shamans and gothy punks have all had their time at the top of the slam food chain, but in the end, something different always comes along and challenges the poets to try something new.\nBob Holman, a poetry activist and former MC of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, once called the movement \"the democratization of verse\". In 2005, Holman was also quoted as saying: \"The spoken word revolution is led a lot by women and by poets of color. It gives a depth to the nation's dialogue that you don't hear on the floor of Congress. I want a floor of Congress to look more like a National Poetry Slam. That would make me happy.\"\nCriticism.\nAt the 1993 National Poetry Slam in San Francisco, a participating team from Canada (Kedrick James, Alex Ferguson and John Sobol) wrote, printed and circulated an instant broadside titled \"Like Lambs to the Slammer\", that criticized what they perceived as the complacency, conformity, and calculated tear-jerking endemic to the poetry slam scene. Over time, slam poetry has been criticized for lacking depth and for its features, e.g., \"slam voice,\" which may limit the range of emotion it can express.\nIn an interview in the \"Paris Review\", literary critic Harold Bloom wrote\nI can't bear these accounts I read in the \"Times\" and elsewhere of these poetry slams, in which various young men and women in various late-spots are declaiming rant and nonsense at each other. The whole thing is judged by an applause meter which is actually not there, but might as well be. This isn't even silly; it is the death of art.\nPoet and lead singer of King Missile, John S. Hall, has also long been a vocal opponent, taking issue with such factors as its inherently competitive nature and what he considers its lack of stylistic diversity. He recalls seeing his first slam, at the Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9: \"I hated it. And it made me really uncomfortable and ... it was very much like a sport, and I was interested in poetry in large part because it was like the antithesis of sports. ... [I]t seemed to me like a very macho, masculine form of poetry and not at all what I was interested in.\"\nThe poet Tim Clare offers a \"for and against\" account of the phenomenon in \"Slam: A Poetic Dialogue\".\nIronically, slam poetry movement founder Marc Smith has been critical of the commercially successful Def Poetry television and Broadway live stage shows produced by Russell Simmons, decrying it as \"an exploitive entertainment [program that] diminished the value and aesthetic of performance poetry\".\nSlam poetry as a youth movement.\nSlam poetry has found popularity as a form of self-expression among many teenagers. Young Chicago Authors (YCA) provides workshops, mentoring, and competition opportunities to youth in the Chicago area. Every year YCA presents The Rooted &amp; Radical Youth Poetry Festival (previously titled Louder Than a Bomb), the world's largest team-based youth slam. San Francisco based non-profit organization Youth Speaks Inc. has also been running the Brave New Voices poetry festival since 1998. The youth poetry slam movement was the focus of a documentary film series produced by HBO and released in 2009. It featured poets from Youth Speaks, Urban Word, Louder than a Bomb and other related youth poetry slam organizations.\nIn a 2005 interview, one of slam's best known poets Saul Williams praised the youth poetry slam movement, explaining:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2012, more than 12,000 young people took part in an England-wide youth slam \"Shake the Dust\", organized by Apples and Snakes as part of the London 2012 Festival. An Open Letter to Honey Singh, a rap video featuring Rene Sharanya Verma performing at Delhi Poetry Slam, went viral on YouTube receiving over 1.5 million hits.\nInternational events.\nAt the European level, the European Poetry Slam Championship takes place every year.\nThe Poetry Slam World Cup (Coupe du Monde de Slam, organised in France) also takes place every year. \nIn Africa.\nIn 2017 poet Malika Outtara estimated that there were only fifteen African women slam poets in total.\nBurkina Faso.\nOne of the most notable figures in the slam scene in Burkina Faso is Malika Outtara. In 2019 she set up the Slamazone Foundation of which she is President, in order to fund raise for social issues in her country.\nEgypt.\nSlam Poetry has been in Egypt since the twentieth century and was introduced by Hussain Shafiq al-Misry. According to al-Misry, having a variety of jobs gave him the experience to understand the struggles of the Egyptian people in different classes of life. He had good knowledge of Arabic literature, grammar and some commonly used foreign words as well as slang; which he used to form Halamantishi poetry. Muhammad Ragab Bayyoumi in 1986 wrote an article entitled Hussein Shafiq al-Misry: Ustaz la Tilmeeth lah\" (Hussein Shafiq al-Misry: A Teacher with No Student of His) in which he introduced al-Misry's poems and explained al-Misry's literary poetry techniques. In Egypt Performance Poetry is new in popularity, the term \"Ash-Shi'r al-Mu'adda\" was recently introduced as the term for performance poetry. Poets such as \u00a0Bayram At-Tunisi, Ahmad Rami, and Kamel Ash-Shennawy paved the way after al-Misry with lyrical slam poems that use a melodic rhythm to attract the audience.\nIn the Americas.\nUnited States.\nIn 1990, the first American National Poetry Slam took place at Fort Mason, San Francisco. This slam included teams from Chicago and San Francisco, and an individual poet from New York. Soon afterward, poetry slams increased in popularity, which allowed some poets to make full-time careers in performance and competition, touring the United States and eventually the world.\nIn 1999, the American National Poetry Slam, held in major cities each year, was in Chicago. The event was covered nationally by \"The New York Times\" and \"60 Minutes\" (CBS). \"60 Minutes\" taped a 20 segment on slam poetry with live poetry scenes at Chopin Theatre.\nAs of 2011, four poets who have competed at the American National Poetry Slam have won National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) Fellowships for Literature:\nAs of 2017, one poet who has competed at American National Poetry Slam has won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry: Tyehimba Jess, who competed as a part of Chicago's Green Mill team twice.\nPoetry Slam, Inc. used to hold several national and international competitions, including the Individual World Poetry Slam, the National Poetry Slam and The Women of the World Poetry Slam.\nAs of 2017[ [update]], the Americana National Poetry Slam featured 72 certified teams, culminating in five days of competition.\nPoetry Slam, Inc. used to sanction three major annual poetry competitions (for poets 18+) on a national and international scale: the National Poetry Slam (NPS), the individual World Poetry Slam (iWPS), and the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WoWPS). The last National Poetry Slam took place in Chicago 2018, after which PSi's voting body elected to cease its three major 2019 poetry slams. The WoWPS has been held since 2020 through a new website.\nNotable American slam poets.\nA number of American poets belong to both academia and slam:\nHenry S. Taylor, winner of the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, competed in the 1997 National Poetry Slam as an individual and placed 75th out of 150.\nIn Europe.\nAustria.\nFrom 10 to 11 December 2016 Salzburg, Austria, held a world-record poetry slam competition (28 hours of classic slam poetry) and broke the so-far-record of Nuremberg, Germany (25 hours), by Michl Jakob. The winner of the competition (Friedrich Herrmann) scored one point better in the finals than the second ranked (Darryl Kiermeier). The event was organized by Lukas Wagner (Slamlabor) and took place in the SN-Saal of the Salzburger Nachrichten.\nIn Japan.\nIn Japan, Katsunori Kusunoki, a professor of communications at Toyo University, found a way to incorporate slam poetry into his students' lives; allowing them to showcase their competitiveness and love of poetry by putting together \"poetry boxing\" matches. Kusunoki created annual \"poetry boxing\" tournaments in order to provide a medium for expression and social interaction . The rules are \"16 boxers face off in pairs in competitions of stand-up verse that last for three minutes. Winners compete in series of challenges such as timed presentation and a round of improvised jousting.\" A master of ceremonies adds to the event by providing nicknames for the competitors. Kusunoki's goal was to try to get his students to open up by breaking language barriers and expressing themselves.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern.\nThe invention of the form is usually attributed to Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of 12th-century Provence, and the first sestinas were written in the Occitan language of that region. The form was cultivated by his fellow troubadours, then by other poets across Continental Europe in the subsequent centuries; they contributed to what would become the \"standard form\" of the sestina. The earliest example of the form in English appeared in 1579, though they were rarely written in Britain until the end of the 19th century. The sestina remains a popular poetic form, and many sestinas continue to be written by contemporary poets.\nHistory.\nThe oldest-known sestina is \"Lo ferm voler qu'el cor m'intra\", written around 1200 by Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of Aquitanian origin; he refers to it as \"cledisat\", meaning, more or less, \"interlock\". Hence, Daniel is generally considered the form's inventor, though it has been suggested that he may only have innovated an already existing form. Nevertheless, two other original troubadouric sestinas are recognised, the best known being \"Eras, pus vey mon benastruc\" by Guilhem Peire Cazals de Caortz; there are also two contrafacta built on the same end-words, the best known being \"Ben gran avoleza intra\" by Bertran de Born. These early sestinas were written in Old Occitan; the form started spilling into Italian with Dante in the 13th century; by the 15th, it was used in Portuguese by Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es.\nThe involvement of Dante and Petrarch in establishing the sestina form, together with the contributions of others in the country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form\u2014despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to attempt the form in French, and the only one to do so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme into his sestina.\nEnglish.\nAn early version of the sestina in Middle English is the \"Hymn to Venus\" by Elizabeth Woodville (1437\u20131492); it is an \"elaboration\" on the form, found in one single manuscript. It is a six-stanza poem that praises Venus, the goddess of love, and consists of six seven-line stanzas in which the first line of each stanza is also its last line, and the lines of the first stanza provide the first lines for each subsequent stanza.\nThe first appearance of the sestina in English print is \"Ye wastefull woodes\", comprising lines 151\u201389 of the August \u00c6glogue in Edmund Spenser's \"Shepherd's Calendar\", published in 1579. It is in unrhymed iambic pentameter, but the order of end-words in each stanza is non-standard \u2013 ending 123456, 612345, etc. \u2013 each stanza promoting the previous final end-word to the first line, but otherwise leaving the order intact; the envoi order is (1) 2 / (3) 4 / (5) 6. This scheme was set by the Spaniard Gutierre de Cetina.\nAlthough they appeared in print later, Philip Sidney's three sestinas may have been written earlier, and are often credited as the first in English. The first published (toward the end of Book I of \"The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia\", 1590) is the double sestina \"Ye Goatherd Gods\". In this variant the standard end-word pattern is repeated for twelve stanzas, ending with a three-line envoi, resulting in a poem of 75 lines. Two others were published in subsequent editions of the \"Arcadia\". The second, \"Since wailing is a bud of causeful sorrow\", is in the \"standard\" form. Like \"Ye Goatherd Gods\" it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and uses exclusively feminine endings, reflecting the Italian \"endecasillabo\". The third, \"Farewell, O sun, Arcadia's clearest light\", is the first rhyming sestina in English: it is in iambic pentameters and follows the standard end-word scheme, but rhymes formula_1 in the first stanza (the rhyme scheme necessarily changes in each subsequent stanza, a consequence of which is that the 6th stanza is in rhyming couplets). Sidney uses the same envoi structure as Spenser. William Drummond of Hawthornden published two sestinas (which he called \"sextains\") in 1616, which copy the form of Sidney's rhyming sestina. After this, there is an absence of notable sestinas for over 250 years, with John Frederick Nims noting that, \"...\u00a0there is not a single sestina in the three volumes of the Oxford anthologies that cover the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\"\nIn the 1870s, there was a revival of interest in French forms, led by Andrew Lang, Austin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, W. E. Henley, John Payne, and others. The earliest sestina of this period is Algernon Charles Swinburne's \"Sestina\". It is in iambic pentameter rhyming formula_2 in the first stanza; each stanza begins by repeating the previous end-words 6 then 1, but the following 4 lines repeat the remaining end-words \"ad lib\"; the envoi is (1) 4 / (2) 3 / (5) 6. In the same volume (\"Poems and Ballads, Second Series\", 1878) Swinburne introduces a \"double sestina\" (\"The Complaint of Lisa\") that is unlike Sidney's: it comprises 12 stanzas of 12 iambic pentameter lines each, the first stanza rhyming formula_3. Similar to his \"Sestina\", each stanza first repeats end-words 12 then 1 of the previous stanza; the rest are \"ad lib\". The envoi is (12) 10 / (8) 9 / (7) 4 / (3) 6 / (2) 1 / (11) 5.\nFrom the 1930s, a revival of the form took place across the English-speaking world, led by poets such as W. H. Auden, and the 1950s were described as the \"age of the sestina\" by James E. B. Breslin. \"Sestina: Altaforte\" by Ezra Pound, \"Paysage moralis\u00e9\" by W. H. Auden, and \"Sestina\" by Elizabeth Bishop are distinguished modern examples of the sestina. \"Histoire\" by Harry Mathews adds an additional Oulipian constraint: the end words wildly misusing ideological or prejudicial terms. The sestina remains a popular closed verse form, and many sestinas continue to be written by contemporary poets; notable examples include \"Six Bad Poets\" by Christopher Reid, \"The Guest Ellen at the Supper for Street People\" by David Ferry and \"IVF\" by Kona Macphee.\nForm.\nAlthough the sestina has been subject to many revisions throughout its development, there remain several features that define the form. The sestina is composed of six stanzas of six lines (sixains), followed by a stanza of three lines (a tercet). There is no rhyme within the stanzas; instead the sestina is structured through a recurrent pattern of the words that end each line, a technique known as \"lexical repetition\".\nIn the original form composed by Daniel, each line is of ten syllables, except the first of each stanza which are of seven. The established form, as developed by Petrarch and Dante, was in hendecasyllables. Since then, changes to the line length have been a relatively common variant, such that Stephanie Burt has written: \"sestinas, as the form exists today, [do not] require expertise with inherited meter\u00a0...\".\nThe pattern that the line-ending words follow is often explained if the numbers 1 to 6 are allowed to stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of the lines of the preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that the pattern for the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza, numerical series which corresponds, as Paolo Canettieri has shown, to the way in which the points on the dice are arranged. This genetic hypothesis is supported by the fact that Arnaut Daniel was a strong dice player and various images related to this game are present in his poetic texts.\nAnother way of visualising the pattern of line-ending words for each stanza is by the procedure known as \"retrogradatio cruciata\", which may be rendered as \"backward crossing\". The second stanza can be seen to have been formed from three sets of pairs (6\u20131, 5\u20132, 4\u20133), or two triads (1\u20132\u20133, 4\u20135\u20136). The 1\u20132\u20133 triad appears in its original order, but the 4\u20135\u20136 triad is reversed and superimposed upon it.\nThe pattern of the line-ending words in a sestina is represented both numerically and alphabetically in the following table:\nThe sixth stanza is followed by a tercet that is known variably by the French term envoi, the Occitan term tornada, or, with reference to its size in relation to the preceding stanzas, a \"half-stanza\". It consists of three lines that include all six of the line-ending words of the preceding stanzas. This should take the pattern of 2\u20135, 4\u20133, 6\u20131 (numbers relative to the first stanza); the first end-word of each pair can occur anywhere in the line, while the second must end the line. However, the end-word order of the envoi is no longer strictly enforced.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Sestina\"\n\"Time to plant tears\" (6), says the almanac (5).\nThe grandmother (2) sings to the marvelous stove (4)\nand the child (3) draws another inscrutable house (1).\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n The envoi to \"Sestina\"; the repeated words are emboldened and labelled.&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth Bishop (1965)\nThe sestina has been subject to some variations, with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas, and also to individual line length. A \"double sestina\" is the name given to either: two sets of six six-line stanzas, with a three-line envoy (for a total of 75 lines), or twelve twelve-line stanzas, with a six-line envoy (for a total of 150 lines). Examples of either variation are rare; \"Ye Goatherd Gods\" by Philip Sidney is a notable example of the former variation, while \"The Complaint of Lisa\" by Algernon Charles Swinburne is a notable example of the latter variation. In the former variation, the original pattern of line-ending words, i.e. that of the first stanza, recurs in the seventh stanza, and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout. In the second variation, the pattern of line-ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza; thus it does not, unlike the \"single\" sestina, allow for every end-word to occupy each of the stanza ends; end-words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas.\nEffect.\nThe structure of the sestina, which demands adherence to a strict and arbitrary order, produces several effects within a poem. Stephanie Burt notes that, \"The sestina has served, historically, as a complaint\", its harsh demands acting as \"signs for deprivation or duress\". The structure can enhance the subject matter that it orders; in reference to Elizabeth Bishop's \"A Miracle for Breakfast\", David Caplan suggests that the form's \"harshly arbitrary demands echo its subject's\". Nevertheless, the form's structure has been criticised; Paul Fussell considers the sestina to be of \"dubious structural expressiveness\" when composed in English and, irrespective of how it is used, \"would seem to be [a form] that gives more structural pleasure to the contriver than to the apprehender\".\nMargaret Spanos highlights \"a number of corresponding levels of tension and resolution\" resulting from the structural form, including: structural, semantic and aesthetic tensions. She believes that the aesthetic tension, which results from the \"\"conception\" of its mathematical completeness and perfection\", set against the \"\"experiences\" of its labyrinthine complexities\" can be resolved in the apprehension of the \"harmony of the whole\".\nThe strength of the sestina, according to Stephen Fry, is the \"repetition and recycling of elusive patterns that cannot be quite held in the mind all at once\". For Shanna Compton, these patterns are easily discernible by newcomers to the form; she says that: \"Even someone unfamiliar with the form's rules can tell by the end of the second stanza\u00a0... what's going on\u00a0...\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The voice often carries the melody (a series of distinct and fixed pitches) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs have a structure, such as the common ABA form, and are usually made of sections that are repeated or performed with variation later. A song without instruments is said to be a cappella.\nWritten words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in the classical tradition, it is called an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple style that are learned informally by ear are often referred to as folk songs. Songs composed for the mass market, designed to be sung by professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows, are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists; art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed in studios and an audio recording is made, or they are performed live for audience. (In some cases a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded.) Songs may also appear in theatre (e.g., opera), films and TV shows.\nA song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead. A song can be sung without accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. In popular music, a singer may perform with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. In jazz, a singer may perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. A Classical singer may perform with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs by ear and they may improvise some melody lines. In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet music format, so singers learn to read music.\nSongs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works. Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms and types, depending on the criteria used. Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word \"song\" may refer to instrumentals, such as the 19th century \"Songs Without Words\" pieces for solo piano.\nGenres.\nArt.\nArt songs are songs created for performance by classical artists, often with piano or other instrumental accompaniment, although they can be sung solo. Art songs require strong vocal technique, an understanding of language, diction, and poetry for interpretation. Though such singers may also perform popular or folk songs on their programs, these characteristics and the use of poetry are what distinguish art songs from popular songs. Art songs are a tradition from most European countries, and now other countries with classical music traditions. German-speaking communities use the term art song (\"Kunstlied\") to distinguish so-called serious compositions from folk songs (\"Volkslied\"). The lyrics are often written by a poet or lyricist and the music separately by a composer. Art songs may be more formally complicated than popular or folk songs, though many early Lieder by the likes of Franz Schubert are in simple strophic form. The accompaniment of European art songs is considered as an important part of the composition. Some art songs are so revered that they take on characteristics of national identification.\nArt songs emerge from the tradition of singing romantic love songs, often to an ideal or imaginary person and from religious songs. The troubadours and bards of Europe began the documented tradition of romantic songs, continued by the Elizabethan lutenists. Some of the earliest art songs are found in the music of Henry Purcell. The tradition of the romance, a love song with a flowing accompaniment, often in triple meter, entered opera in the 19th century and spread from there throughout Europe. It expanded into popular music and became one of the underpinnings of popular songs. While a romance generally has a simple accompaniment, art songs tend to have complicated, sophisticated accompaniments that underpin, embellish, illustrate or provide contrast to the voice. Sometimes the accompaniment performer has the melody, while the voice sings a more dramatic part.\nFolk.\nFolk songs are songs of often anonymous origin (or are public domain) that are transmitted orally. They are frequently a major aspect of national or cultural identity. Art songs often approach the status of folk songs when people forget who the author was. Folk songs are also frequently transmitted non-orally (that is, as sheet music), especially in the modern era. Folk songs exist in almost every culture. The German term \"Volkslied\" was coined in the late 18th century, in the process of collecting older songs and writing new ones. Popular songs may eventually become folk songs by the same process of detachment from their source. Folk songs are more or less in the public domain by definition, though there are many folk song entertainers who publish and record copyrighted original material. This tradition led also to the singer-songwriter style of performing, where an artist has written confessional poetry or personal statements and sings them set to music, most often with guitar accompaniment.\nThere are many genres of popular songs, including torch songs, ballads, novelty songs, anthems, rock, blues and soul songs as well as indie music. Other commercial genres include rapping. Folk songs include ballads, lullabies, love songs, mourning songs, dance songs, work songs, ritual songs and many more.\nSporting.\nA sporting song is a folk song that celebrates fox hunting, horse racing, gambling and other recreations.\nAlthough songs about boxers and successful racehorses were common in the nineteenth century, few are performed by current singers. In particular, fox-hunting is considered politically incorrect. The most famous song about a foxhunter, \"D'ye ken John Peel\" was included in \"The National Song Book\" in 1906 and is now often heard as a marching tune. A. L. Lloyd recorded two EPs of sporting ballads; \"Bold Sportsmen All\" (1958) and \"Gamblers and Sporting Blades (Songs of the Ring and the Racecourse)\" (1962). The High Level Ranters and Martin Wyndham-Read recorded an album called \"English Sporting Ballads\" in 1977. \"The Prospect Before Us\" (1976) by The Albion Dance Band contains two rarely heard hunting songs.\nLute.\nThe term lute song is given to a music style from the late 16th century to early 17th century, late Renaissance to early Baroque, that was predominantly in England and France. Lute songs were generally in strophic form or verse repeating with a homophonic texture. The composition was written for a solo voice with an accompaniment, usually the lute. It was not uncommon for other forms of accompaniments such as bass viol or other string instruments, and could also be written for more voices. The composition could be performed either solo or with a small group of instruments.\nPart.\nA part song, part-song or partsong is a form of choral music that consists of a secular (vs. ecclesiastical) song written or arranged for several vocal parts. Part songs are commonly sung by an SATB choir, but sometimes for an all-male or all-female ensemble.\nPatter.\nThe patter song is characterized by a moderately fast to very fast tempo with a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns in which each syllable of text corresponds to one note. It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but it has also been used in musicals and elsewhere.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The author is unknown; the title was given centuries later. It is one of the best-known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folk motifs: the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important example of a chivalric romance, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest that tests his prowess. It remains popular in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.\nThe story describes how Sir Gawain, who was not yet a knight of King Arthur's Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious \"Green Knight\" who dares any man to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him, after which the Green Knight stands, picks up his head, and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving the lord and the lady of the castle at which he is a guest. The poem survives in one manuscript, Cotton Nero A.x., which also includes three religious narrative poems: \"Pearl\", \"Cleanness\", and \"Patience\". All four are written in a North West Midlands dialect of Middle English, and are thought to be by the same author, dubbed the \"Pearl Poet\" or \"Gawain Poet\".\nSynopsis.\nIn Camelot on New Year's eve, King Arthur's court is exchanging gifts and waiting for the feasting to start, when the king asks to see or hear of an exciting adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak, he insists he has come for a friendly Christmas game: someone is to strike him once with his axe, on the condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day. The axe will belong to whoever accepts this deal. King Arthur is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, asks for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head, and mounts his horse. The Green Knight shows his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere, while it reminds Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel in a year and a day, before the knight rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy, and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.\nAs the date approaches, Sir Gawain leaves to find the Green Chapel and keep his part of the bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to but not described, until Gawain comes across a splendid castle, where he meets the lord of the castle and his beautiful wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel, and that he has only a few days remaining. The lord laughs, explaining that there is a path that will take him to the chapel less than two miles away, and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle until then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.\nThe lord proposes a bargain to Gawain: he goes hunting every day, and he will give Gawain whatever he catches, on the condition that Gawain give him whatever he may gain during the day; Gawain accepts. After he leaves, his wife visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts, he allows her nothing but a single kiss. When the lord returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, Gawain gives a kiss to him without divulging its source. The next day the lady returns to Gawain, who again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, but once her advances are denied, she offers Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses, but she pleads that he at least take her sash, a girdle of green and gold silk. The sash, the lady assures him, is charmed, and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die the next day, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. The lady has Gawain swear that he will keep the gift secret from her husband. That evening, the lord returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses; Gawain does not mention the sash.\nThe next day, Gawain binds the sash around his waist. Outside the Green Chapel\u2014only an earthen mound containing a cavern\u2014he finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe. As promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing, Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain does not flinch with the second swing, but again, the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily, Gawain tells him to deliver his blow, and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck, and ending the game. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet, and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be none other than the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the unnamed \"elderly lady\" Gawain saw at the castle, who is the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's stepsister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. The nick Gawain suffered at the third stroke was because of his attempt to conceal the gift of the sash. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully, but the Green Knight laughs and pronounces him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the sash as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of the blame and decide that henceforth each will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be honest.\n\"Gawain Poet\".\nThough the real name of the \"\"Gawain\" Poet\" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about them can be drawn from an informed reading of their works. The manuscript of \"Gawain\" is known in academic circles as Cotton Nero A.x., following a naming system used by one of its owners, the 16th-century Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, a collector of medieval English texts. Before the \"Gawain\" manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile in Yorkshire.\nLittle is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton's \"History\", edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the \"Gawain\" poem was not published in its entirety until 1839, which is when it was given its present title. Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, meaning the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of \"The Canterbury Tales\", though it is unlikely that they ever met, and the Gawain poet's English is considerably different from Chaucer's. The three other works found in the same manuscript as \"Gawain\" (commonly known as \"Pearl\", \"Patience\", and \"Cleanness\" or \"Purity\") are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.\nWhat is known today about the poet is general. J. R. R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.\nThe most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Gawain Poet and is thought to have written the poem \"St. Erkenwald\", which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to \"Gawain\". \"St. Erkenwald\", however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain Poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial, and most critics consider the Gawain Poet an unknown.\nVerse form.\nThe 2,530 lines and 101 stanzas that make up \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" are written in what linguists call the \"Alliterative Revival\" style of alliterative verse typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a metrical syllabic count and rhyme, the alliterative form of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a \"caesura\", at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he follows the form of his day, the Gawain Poet was freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the \"bob and wheel\", in which the \"bob\" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the \"wheel,\" longer lines with internal rhyme.\nSimilar stories.\nThe earliest known story to feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale \"Bricriu's Feast\". This story parallels \"Gawain\" in that, like the Green Knight, C\u00fa Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th-century \"Life of Caradoc\", a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes' \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\". A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century \"Perlesvaus\", in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.\nThe stories \"The Girl with the Mule\" (alternately titled \"The Mule Without a Bridle\") and \"Hunbaut\" feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In \"Hunbaut,\" Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include \"Yder\", the Lancelot-Grail, \"Hunbaut\", and \"The Knight with the Sword\". The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually, the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.\nIn the first branch of the medieval Welsh collection of tales known as The Four Branches of the Mabinogi, Pwyll exchanges places for a year with Arawn, the lord of Annwn (the Otherworld). Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn's wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. This story may, then, provide a background to Gawain's attempts to resist the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game and seduction test stories. Additionally, in both stories a year passes before the completion of the conclusion of the challenge or exchange. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a \"seduction test\" per se, as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly \"against\" the wishes of the Lord.\nAfter the writing of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", several similar stories followed. \"The Greene Knight\" (15th\u201317th century) is a rhymed retelling of nearly the same tale.\nIn it, the plot is simplified, motives are more fully explained, and some names are changed. Another story, \"The Turke and Gowin\" (15th century), begins with a Turk entering Arthur's court and asking, \"Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?\"ll. 16\u201317\nAt the end of this poem the Turk, rather than buffeting Gawain back, asks the knight to cut off his head, which Gawain does. The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. \"The Carle of Carlisle\" (17th century) also resembles \"Gawain\" in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords are hanging and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off.\nGawain obliges and strikes, but the Carle rises, laughing and unharmed. Unlike the \"Gawain\" poem, no return blow is demanded or given.\nThemes.\nTemptation and testing.\nAt the heart of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" is the test of Gawain's adherence to the code of chivalry. The typical temptation fable of medieval literature presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or \"proofs\" of moral virtue. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested.76\nSuccess in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or \"instinctive-courtesy\" that Sir Gawain can pass his test.83 Gawain does not realise, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by the lord, Bertilak de Hautdesert.\nIn addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning courtly love. The knight's code of honour requires him to do whatever a damsel asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host (Bertilak), he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.\nHunting and seduction.\nScholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in \"Gawain\". They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.\nThe deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.\nThe boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars were (and are) much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely, she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.\nMasculinity has also been associated with hunting. The theme of masculinity is present throughout. In an article by Vern L. Bullough, \"Being a Male in the Middle Ages,\" he discusses Sir Gawain and how normally, masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active. He notes that Sir Gawain is not part of this normalcy.\nNature and chivalry.\nSome argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur's peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance. Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak's wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the sin-stained girdle, nature is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense).\nIn this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.\nSeveral critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognise and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.\nThe chivalry that is represented within \"Gawain\" is one which was constructed by court nobility. The violence that is part of this chivalry is steeply contrasted by the fact that King Arthur's court is Christian, and the initial beheading event takes place while celebrating Christmas. The violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and Christian ideals, and yet it is seen as part of knighthood.\nThe question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during Gawain's interactions with Bertilak's wife. He cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour, and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess. Gawain plays a very fine line and the only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals the green girdle from Bertilak.\nGames.\nThe word (game) is found 18 times in \"Gawain\". Its similarity to the word (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a \"Christmas game\". The \"game\" of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a \"beheading game\"). The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to \"Gawain\".\nTimes and seasons.\nTimes, dates, seasons, and cycles within \"Gawain\" are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year's Eve with a beheading and culminates one year later on the next New Year's Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on All Saints Day and arrives at Bertilak's castle on Christmas Eve. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in \"a year and a day\"\u2014in other words, the next New Year's Day. Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of Troy, a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the \"Aeneid\", fell to the Greeks because of pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two nearly identical descriptions of Troy's destruction. The poem's first line reads: \"Since the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\" and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is \"After the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\".\nSymbolism.\nThe Green Knight.\nScholars have puzzled over the Green Knight's symbolism since the discovery of the poem. British medievalist C. S. Lewis said the character was \"as vivid and concrete as any image in literature\" and scholar J. A. Burrow said he was the \"most difficult character\" to interpret in \"Sir Gawain\". His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious. He appears in only two other poems: \"The Greene Knight\" and \"King Arthur and King Cornwall\".\nScholars have attempted to connect him to other mythical characters, such as Jack in the green of English tradition and to Al-Khidr, but no definitive connection has yet been established.\nHe represents a mix of two traditional figures in romance and other medieval narratives: \"the literary green man\" and \"the literary wild man.\" The Green Knight challenges Gawain to rise to the ideals of honour and religious practices. His name, the Green Knight, shows his opposition to nature: the colour green represents forces of nature, and the word \"knight\" connects him to society and civilisation. While the Green Knight represents the primitive, and uncivilised side of man's nature, he also opposes nature as well. The description of the Green Knight, which he shares with his green horse, shows the central idea of human nature's potential.\nThe colour green.\nGiven the varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, became a symbol of shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.\nThere is a possibility, as Alice Buchanan has argued, that the colour green is erroneously attributed to the Green Knight because of the poet's mistranslation or misunderstanding of the Irish word , which could either mean grey or green, or the identical word in Cornish. has been used to denote a range of colours: light blues, greys, and greens of the sea and grass.\nIn the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from \"Bricriu's Feast\"), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called \"the man of the grey mantle\" which corresponds to Welsh Brenin Llwyd or Gwynn ap Nudd. Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are or , roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.\nGirdle.\nThe girdle's symbolic meaning, in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a \"trophy\". It is not entirely clear if the \"winner\" is Sir Gawain or the Lady, Bertilak's wife. The girdle is given to Gawain by the Lady to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Bertilak comes home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host; instead, he hides it. This introduces a spiritual interpretation, that Gawain's acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In \"Sir Gawain\", the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one's acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either\u2013or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in many ways. While Gawain can resist Bertilak's wife's sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away). \nPentangle.\nThe poem contains the first recorded use of the word \"pentangle\" in English. It contains the only representation of such a symbol on Gawain's shield in the Gawain literature. What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines to describe the meaning of the pentangle; no other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail.\nThe poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an (endless knot). From lines 640 to 654, the five points of the pentangle relate directly to Gawain in five ways: five senses, his five fingers, his faith found in the five wounds of Christ, the five joys of Mary (whose face was on the inside of the shield) and finally friendship, fraternity, purity, politeness, and piety (traits that Gawain possessed around others). In line 625, it is described as (a sign set by Solomon). Solomon, the third king of Israel, in the 10th century BC, was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the archangel Michael. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over demons.\nAlong these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol was called a (nightmare spirit's foot) and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.\nGawain's pentangle also symbolises the \"phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality.\" Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain's poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a \"circular number\", since it \"reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers\".34 Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this \"process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles\".34 Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain's pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.35\nThe Lady's ring.\nGawain's refusal of the Lady's ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by her, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in \"Pearl\".\nThis is especially true of the Lady's ring, as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a (fiery sun). This red colour can be seen as symbolising royalty, divinity, and the Passion of the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for,3 but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness.4 Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as the Lady claims the girdle will.\nNumbers.\nThe poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak's wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles. The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain's virtues, for he is (faithful in five and many times five). The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the five wounds of Christ, as well as the five joys of the Virgin Mary. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of chivalry: \"friendship, generosity, chastity, courtesy, and piety\".93 All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in (the endless knot) of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken. This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain's quest. Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in knighthood through number symbolism.\nThe number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. \"Sir Gawain\" is 101\u00a0stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'fitts' of 21, 24, 34, and 22\u00a0stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22\u00a0stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.\nWounds.\nAt the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will, connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous\u2014evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful \"stiffneckedness\" will be healed among fallen mortals.121\u2013123\nInterpretations.\n\"Gawain\" as medieval romance.\nMany critics argue that \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" should be viewed as a romance. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, heroic knight, often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry's strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a quest and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a lady. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term \"romance\" implies today), but on adventure.\nGawain's function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, \"is the function of the romance hero\u00a0\u2026 to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action.\" Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view amidst the poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain \"shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way.\"\nIn viewing the poem as a medieval romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and courtly love laws under the English Order of the Garter. A slightly altered version of the Order's motto, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\", or \"Shamed be he who finds evil here,\" has been added, in a different hand, at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain's peers wearing girdles of their own as linked to the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem \"The Greene Knight\", the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the Knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter.\nStill, a possible connection to the Order is not beyond the realm of possibility.213 (footnote)\nChristian interpretations.\nThe poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare \"Sir Gawain\" to the other three poems of the \"Gawain\" manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret \"Gawain\" similarly. Comparing it to the poem \"Cleanness\" (also known as \"Purity\"), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in \"Gawain's\" case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In \"Cleanness\" the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.\nOne of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. \"Gawain\" was written around the time of the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.\nWhile the character of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of Christ in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that \"the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions.\" This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.\nFurthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ's crown of thorns at the conclusion of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to \"the thorn-crowned God\". Besserman theorises that \"with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain's \"\": untruth/renown) to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ's humiliation turned triumph).\"\nThroughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to re-evaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal.\nAnother interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.\nAn analogy is also made between Gawain's trial and the Biblical test that Adam encounters in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing him to become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.\nFeminist interpretations.\nFeminist literary critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, are the most powerful characters in the poem\u2014Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar can be seen as symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.\nIn contrast, others argue that the poem focuses mostly on the opinions, actions, and abilities of men. For example, on the surface, it appears that Bertilak's wife is a strong leading character.\nBy adopting the masculine role, she appears to be an empowered individual, particularly in the bedroom scene. This is not entirely the case, however. While the Lady is being forward and outgoing, Gawain's feelings and emotions are the focus of the story, and Gawain stands to gain or lose the most.24 The Lady \"makes the first move\", so to speak, but Gawain decides what is to become of those actions. He, therefore, is in charge of the situation and even the relationship.24\nIn the bedroom scene, both the negative and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire. Her feelings cause her to step out of the typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered. At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible.378 By convincing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e., the apple, the pact made with Bertilak\u2014and therefore the Green Knight\u2014is broken.379 Based on this, Gawain portrays himself, in what is often called his \"antifeminist diatribe\" later on, as a \"good man seduced\".379\nPostcolonial interpretations.\nFrom 1350 to 1400\u2014the period in which the poem is thought to have been written\u2014 there were several Welsh rebellions against English rule, including one by Owain Lawgoch in 1372 and another by Owain Glynd\u0175r in 1400. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common in the England\u2013Wales border, potentially placing him in the midst of such conflicts. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences between the English and Welsh play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role but differ about whether it supports the poem's colonial ideals or supplants them as the English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.\nA large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the England\u2013Wales border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that played the two cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically there was much violence between the Welsh and English into the 15th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an \"us versus them\" scenario contrasting the knowledgeable and civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.\nIn contrast to such postcolonial analyses, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak's territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are \"intelligently immoral\", choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a \"distinction\u00a0\u2026 of moral insight versus moral faith\". Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and\u2014in the case of Bertilak's appearance at Arthur's court\u2014literal sense. Lander's argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.\nGawain's journey.\nSeveral scholars have attempted to find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The Anglesey islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales. In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the (Holy Head), believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford. Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.\nGawain's trek leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott located the chapel (two miles hence) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park at (the bottom of a valley) on a hillside () in an enormous fissure (). Several have tried to replicate this expedition and others such as Michael W. Twomey have created a virtual tour of Gawain's journey entitled 'Travels with Sir Gawain' that include photographs of landscapes mentioned and particular views mentioned in the text.\nHomoerotic interpretations.\nAccording to Queer scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight represents a threat to homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed, and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, Zeikowitz claims the Green Knight blurs the lines between male homosociality and homosexuality, presumed knowledge of premodern artistic portrayals of female homosociality and homosexuality being largely doubtful, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.\nQueer scholar Carolyn Dinshaw argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that Richard II had a male lover\u2014an attempt to re-establish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. She asserts that the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. According to Dinshaw, in his other poem \"Cleanness\", he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail, and she sees this alleged 'obsession' as carrying over to \"Gawain\" in his descriptions of the Green Knight.\nBeyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. In her view, he is the passive one in the advances of Bertilak's wife, as well as in his encounters with Bertilak himself, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain's world. The poem does this by making the kisses between the Lady and Gawain sexual in nature but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Bertilak \"unintelligible\" to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world, kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.\nModern adaptations.\nBooks.\nThough the surviving manuscript dates from the fourteenth century, the first published version of the poem did not appear until as late as 1839, when Sir Frederic Madden of the British Museum recognised the poem as worth reading. Madden's scholarly, Middle English edition of the poem was followed in 1898 by the first Modern English translation\u2014a prose version by literary scholar Jessie Weston. In 1925, J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon published a scholarly edition of the Middle English text of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\"; a revised edition of this text was prepared by Norman Davis and published in 1967. The book, featuring a text in Middle English with extensive scholarly notes, is frequently confused with the translation into Modern English that Tolkien prepared, along with translations of \"Pearl\" and \"Sir Orfeo\", late in his life. Many editions of the latter work, first published in 1975, shortly after his death, list Tolkien on the cover as author rather than translator.\nMany translations into Modern English are available. Notable translators include Jessie Weston, whose 1898 prose translation and 1907 poetic translation took many liberties with the original; Theodore Banks, whose 1929 translation was praised for its adaptation of the language to modern usage; and Marie Borroff, whose imitative translation was first published in 1967 and \"entered the academic canon\" in 1968, in the second edition of the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\". In 2010, her (slightly revised) translation was published as a Norton Critical Edition, with a foreword by Laura Howes. In 2007, Simon Armitage, who grew up near the Gawain poet's purported residence, published a translation which attracted attention in the US and the United Kingdom, and was published in the United States by Norton.\nArt.\nMany 20th and 21st-century editions of the poem are, like the manuscript, illustrated. For centuries the poem's titular characters were not the subject of artists' interest, not even for the Pre-Raphaelites, though the poem was the inspiration for Christina Rossetti's \"The Prince\u2019s Progress\" (1866). This changed in the beginning of the 20th century, with five images by Frederic Lawrence (in an Arts and Crafts style) for a 1912 edition.\nHerbert Cole illustrated Ernest Rhys and Grace Rhys's \"English Fairy Tales\" (1913), and included an image of the Green Knight entering King Arthur's court, the same scene Diana Sudyka represented for the cover of Simon Armitage's 2008 edition of his translation, published by the London Folio Society. British artist and designer Dorothea Braby produced six color engravings for Gwyn Jones's 1952 translation; critic Muriel Whitaker noted that Braby's color scheme points to symbolic dualities, \"warmth and coldness, natural and supernatural, courtliness and barbarity, sensuous castle life and rigorous forest hunts\". John Howe, known for his work for J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", created a landscape featuring Gawain and the Green Knight for the jacket cover of Tolkien's translation in HarperCollins' 1996 publication of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo\". Commenting on Howe's image, John Gentile notes a connection to the wild man trope, emphasizing the Green Knight's \"beard and long hair as well as his holly cluster all show[ing] some connection to the image of the medieval Wild Man\". The artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins produced fourteen screenprints for a 2018 special edition of Armitage's translation; these images where also exhibited in 2018 at MOMA Machynlleth art gallery in Wales. Michael Eden comments that, while varied and nuanced, at least five of these images \"show a key shift from romance and fairytale-like imagery to a horror aesthetic\".\nFilm and television.\nThe poem has been adapted to film three times, twice by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as \"Gawain and the Green Knight\" 1973 which features Nigel Green in his final theatrical film as the Green Knight and Murray Head as Gawain, and again in 1984 as \"\", featuring Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain and Sean Connery as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot, described by critic Mark Kermode as \"cod antics\". Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected. On 30 July 2021, \"The Green Knight\" was released, directed by American filmmaker David Lowery for A24 and starring Dev Patel as Gawain and Ralph Ineson as the Green Knight, albeit with some significant deviations from the original story.\nThere have been at least two television adaptations, J.M. Phillips\u2019s, Gawain and the Green Knight in 1991, adapted by David Rudkin (responsible for folk-horror classic Penda\u2019s Fen) was a T.V play made by Thames Television, and the animated \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what are believed to be the actual locations. A partial adaptation appears in the \"Adventure Time\" episode \"Seventeen,\" which breaks from the original story after the main character, Finn, decapitates the Green Knight.\nTheatre.\nThe Tyneside Theatre company presented a stage version of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It was directed by Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone.\nIn 1992 Simon Corble created an adaptation with medieval songs and music for The Midsommer Actors' Company. Corble later wrote a substantially revised version which was produced indoors at the O'Reilly Theatre, Oxford in February 2014.\nIn 2025, an adaptation of Gawain and the Green Knight will be staged at the Park Theatre, written by Felix Grainger and Gabriel Fogarty-Graveson.\nOpera.\n\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer Richard Blackford on commission from the village of Blewbury, Oxfordshire. The libretto was written for the adaptation by the children's novelist John Emlyn Edwards. The \"Opera in Six Scenes\" was subsequently recorded by Decca between March and June 1979 and released on the Argo label in November 1979.\n\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" was adapted into an opera called \"Gawain\" by Harrison Birtwistle, first performed in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's \"Gwyneth and the Green Knight\", first performed in 2002. This opera uses \"Sir Gawain\" as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nSir Gawain y el Caballero Verde (Introducci\u00f3n, traducci\u00f3n y notas de Bernardo Santano Moreno &amp; Fernando Cid Lucas), Oviedo, Lengendaria Ediciones, 2025.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the subject of a criminal investigation launched by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) over unauthorized travel in Afghanistan prior to the September 11 attacks in 2001. Mahmood was among those who were listed and sanctioned by the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee in December 2001. He was also sanctioned as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States' Office of Foreign Assets Control, with an address lisiting of the Al-Qaeda Wazir Akbar Khan safe house, Kabul. \nHe has since been living in anonymity in Islamabad, authoring books on the relationship between Islam and science.\nLife and education.\nMahmood was born in Amritsar, Punjab, British India to a Punjabi Muslim family. There are conflicting reports concerning his date of birth; his personal admission noted the birth year as 1940, while the UN reports estimated it as 1938. His father, Chaudhry Muhammad Sharif Khan, was a local \"zamindar\" (lit. feudal lord). His family emigrated from India to Pakistan following religious violence during the partition of India in 1947; the family settled in Lahore, Punjab. His son Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry serves as the 22nd Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations of the Pakistan Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=\"print/6dec22\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter graduating with distinctions from a local high school standing at top of his class, Mahmood was awarded a scholarship and enrolled at the Government College University to study electrical engineering. After spending a semester, he transferred to the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science with honours in 1960. His credentials led him to join the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) where he gained another scholarship to study in the United Kingdom.\nIn 1962, Mahmood went to attend the University of Manchester where he studied for a double master's degree. First completing a masters' programme in control systems in 1965, he then received another master's degree in nuclear engineering in 1969 from the University of Manchester. While in Manchester, Mahmood was an expert on the Manhattan Project and was reportedly in contact with South African scientists in discussing the jet-nozzle method for uranium enrichment. However, it remains unclear how much interaction was taken place during that time.\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission.\nMahmood joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1968, joining the Nuclear Physics Division at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) working under Dr. Naeem Ahmad Khan. His collaboration took place with Samar Mubarakmand, Hafeez Qureshi, and he was a vital member of the group before it was discontinued in 1970. Mahmood was one of the foremost experts on civilian reactor technology and was a senior engineer at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP I)\u2014 the first commercial nuclear power plant in Pakistan. He gained notability and publicity in the Pakistan Physics Society for inventing a scientific instrument, the 'SBM probe', to detect leaks in steam pipes, a problem that was affecting nuclear plants all over the world and is still used worldwide.\nAfter witnessing the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which saw the unconditional surrender of Pakistan in 1971, Mahmood attended the winter seminar at Multan and delivered a speech on atomic science. On 20 January 1972, the President of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, approved a crash atomic weapon programme, under Munir Ahmad Khan, for the sake of \"national survival.\" Nevertheless, Mahmood continued his work at the KANUPP I engineering division.\nIn the aftermath of 'Smiling Buddha', a surprise nuclear test conducted by India in May 1974, Munir Ahmad appointed Mahmood as the director of the enrichment division at PAEC, where the majority of calculations were conducted by Dr. Khalil Qureshi\u2013 a physical chemist. Mahmood analysed the gaseous diffusion, gas centrifuge, jet-nozzle and molecular laser isotope separation method for uranium-enrichment; recommending the gas centrifuge method as economical. After submitting the report, Mahmood was asked to depart to the Netherlands to interview Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan on behalf of President Bhutto in 1974. In 1975, his proposal was approved and the work on uranium enrichment started with Mahmood as its director, a move that irked the more qualified but more difficult to manage Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, who had coveted the job for himself. His relations with Dr. Khan remained extremely tense and the pairs disagreed with each other and developed great differences. In private meetings with Munir Ahmad, Mahmood often complained and pictured him as \"egomaniac\". In 1976, Mahmood was removed from the enrichment division, Project-706, by Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Khan moved the enrichment division at the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL) under military control.\nEventually, Munir Ahmad removed Mahmood from other classified works and posted him back to the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP-I) with no reason given as a principal engineer. In the 1980s, Munir Ahmad secured Mahmood a job as project manager for the construction of the Khushab Reactor (Khushab-I) where he served as chief engineer and aided with designing the coolant systems. In 1998, he was promoted as a director of the nuclear power division and held that position until 1999.\nAfter the reactor went critical in April 1998, Mahmood said in an interview: \"\"This reactor (can produce enough plutonium for two to three nuclear weapons per year) Pakistan had \"acquired the capability to produce... boosted thermonuclear weapons and hydrogen bombs\".\" In 1998, Mahmood was honoured with the Sitara-e-Imtiaz award in a ceremony by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\nIn 1998, he was promoted as a director of the nuclear power division and held that position until 1999.\nRadical politics and Ummah Tameer-e-Nau.\nThough publicly endorsing the 1998 decision to carry out the Chagai-I nuclear tests by Prime Minister Sharif, Mahmood began appearing on news channels as an outspoken opponent of Sharif, as Mahmood vehemently opposed Pakistan becoming a signatory state of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) just like neighbouring India. In Pakistan's popular news channels and newspapers, Mahmood gave numerous interviews, wrote articles, and lobbied against Sharif when he learned that the Prime Minister had been willing to sign anti-nuclear weapons treaties, prompting the Pakistan Government to forcefully transfer Mahmood to a non-technical position at PAEC.\nSeeking premature retirement from PAEC in 1999, Mahmood moved towards publishing books and articles involving the relationship between Islam and science. Mahmood founded the Ummah Tameer-e-Nau (UTN)\u2013 a radical organisation\u2013 with his close associates. In 2000, he began attending lectures and religious sessions with Dr. Israr Ahmed who would later influence his political views and philosophy. Through UTN, Mahmood stepped into more radical politics, and began visiting Afghanistan where he wanted to be focused on rebuilding educational institutions, hospitals, and relief work.\nIn August 2001, Mahmood and his colleague Chaudhry Abdul Majeed at the UTN met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Describing the meeting, the \"New York Times\" editorial quoted: \"There is little doubt that Mahmood talked to the two al-Qaeda leaders about nuclear weapons, or that Al Qaeda desperately wanted the bomb\".\n2001 debriefing and detention.\nSince 1999 and 2000 onwards, Pakistan's intelligence community had been tracking and monitoring Mahmood whose bushy beard advertised his deep attachment to the Afghan Taliban. After the September 11 attacks in the United States, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) launched a criminal investigation against him, leveling charges of unauthorized travel to Afghanistan. Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, George Tenet, later described intelligence reports of his meeting with Al Qaeda as \"\"frustratingly vague\".\" When asked by Pakistani and American investigators about the nature of Ummah Tameer-e-Nau's (UTN) work and discussions, Mahmood said that he had nothing to do with the al-Qaeda and was only working on humanitarian issues like food, health and education. Investigators from Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were astonished and surprised at the extent of his nuclear weapons knowledge.\nDuring his debriefing, his son Dr. Asim Mahmood, a family medicine doctor, told ISI officials that: \"\"My father [Mahmood] did meet with Osama bin Laden and Osama Bin Laden seemed interested in that matter but my father showed no interest in the matter as he met him for food, water and healthcare matters on which his charity was working\".\"\nThe FIA criminal probe continued for four months and yielded no concrete results. Pressure from Pakistani society and court inquiries against the FIA's criminal probe led to Mahmood's release in 2001. His family did confirm his release but had been constantly under surveillance by the FIA; his name was placed on the \"Exit Control Lists\" so he is not allowed to travel out of Pakistan. Since his release, Mahmood has been out of the public eye and lives a quiet life in Islamabad, devoting most of his time to writing books and doing research work on Islam and science.\nDr. Bashir Syed, former president of the Association of Pakistani Scientists and Engineers of North America (APSENA), said: \"I know both of these persons and can tell you there is not an iota of truth that both these respected scientists and friends will do anything to harm the interest of their own country.\"\nMahmood-Hoodbhoy debates.\nMahmood has written over fifteen books, the most well-known being \"The Mechanics of Doomsday and Life After Death\", which is an analysis of the events leading to doomsday in light of scientific theories and Quranic knowledge. However, his scientific arguments and theories have been challenged by some prominent scientists in Pakistan. His religiosity and eccentricity began troubling the Pakistan Physics Society; his peers often quoted him as \"a rather strange man\".\nIn 1988, Mahmood was invited to the University of Islamabad to deliver a lecture on science. During his lecture at the university's 'Physics Hall' he and several other academicians debated his book. While debating, a well known Pakistani nuclear physicist, Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, and Mahmood, had an acrimonious public debate. Hoodbhoy had severely criticised Mahmood's theories and the notion of Islamic science in general, calling it \"ludicrous science.\" Mahmood protested that Dr. Hoodbhoy misrepresented his views, quoting: \"\"This is crossing all limits of decency,\" he wrote. \"But should one expect any honesty or decency from anti-Islamic sources?\"\"\nLiterature and cosmology.\nIn his writings and speeches, Mahmood has advocated for nuclear sharing with other Islamic nations which he believed would give rise to Muslim dominance in the world. He has also written a tafseer of the Quran in English.\nMahmood is reported to be fascinated \"with the role sunspots played in triggering the French and Russian Revolutions, World War II and assorted anti-colonial uprisings.\" According to his book \"\"Cosmology and Human Destiny\", Mahmood argued that sunspots have influenced major human events, including the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and World War II. He concluded that governments across the world \"are already being subjected to great emotional aggression under the catalytic effect of the abnormally high sunspot activity under which they are most likely to adapt aggression as the natural solution for their problems\". In this book, first published in 1998, he predicted that the period from 2007 to 2014 would be of great turmoil and destruction in the world. Other books written by him include a biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (\"s\u012brah\") titled \"First and the Last\", while his other books are focused more on the relation between Islam and science like \"Miraculous Quran\", \"Life After Death and Doomsday\", and \"Kitab-e-Zindagi\" (in Urdu).\nOne passage of the book reportedly states: \"At the international level, terrorism will rule; and in this scenario use of mass destruction weapons cannot be ruled out. Millions, by 2020, may die through mass destruction weapons, hunger, disease, street violence, terrorist attacks, and suicide.\"\"\nMahmood's lifelong friend, Member of Parliament Farhatullah Babar, who is currently serving as a spokesperson for the President of Pakistan, while talking to media, said: \"Mahmood predicted in \"Cosmology and Human Destiny\" that \"the year 2002 was likely to be a year of maximum sunspot activity. It means upheaval, particularly on the South Asia, with the possibility of nuclear exchanges\".\"\nMahmood has published papers concerning jinn, which are described in the Quran as beings made of fire. He has proposed that jinn could be tapped to solve the energy crisis. \"\"I think that if we develop our souls, we can develop communication with them\" ... \"Every new idea has its opponents,\" he added. \"But there is no reason for this controversy over Islam and science because there is no conflict between Islam and science\"\", Mahmood said to the \"The Wall Street Journal\" in a 1988 interview.\nNew York Times comments.\nThe New York Times has described Mahmood as \"an autodidact intellectual with grand aspirations,\" and noted that \"his fellow scientists at PAEC began to wonder if Mahmood was mentally sound.\" Mahmood made it clear that he believed Pakistan's bomb was \"the property of the whole Ummah,\" referring to the worldwide Muslim community. \"This guy was our ultimate nightmare,\" an American intelligence official told the Times in late 2001.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28837", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28837", "title": "Siege tower", "text": "Mobile structure for attacking walls\nA siege tower or breaching tower (or in the Middle Ages, a belfry) is a specialized siege engine, constructed to protect assailants and ladders while approaching the defensive walls of a fortification. The tower was often rectangular with four wheels with its height roughly equal to that of the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers or crossbowmen to stand on top of the tower and shoot arrows or quarrels into the fortification. While the towers were primarily constructed of wood and thus flammable, their builders typically incorporated whatever non-flammable coverings could be readily procured including iron and/or fresh animal skins.\nEvidence for use of siege towers in Ancient Egypt and Anatolia dates to the Bronze Age. They were used extensively in warfare of the ancient Near East after the Late Bronze Age collapse, and in Egypt by Kushites from Sudan who founded the 25th dynasty. During classical antiquity they were common among Hellenistic Greek armies of the 4th century BC and later Roman armies of Europe and the Mediterranean, while also seeing use in ancient China during the Warring States Period and Han dynasty. Siege towers were of unwieldy dimensions and, like trebuchets, were therefore mostly constructed on site of the siege. Taking considerable time to construct, siege towers were mainly built if the defense of the opposing fortification could not be overcome by ladder assault (\"escalade\"), by mining, or by breaking walls or gates with tools such as battering rams.\nThe siege tower sometimes housed spearmen, pikemen, and swordsmen or archers and crossbowmen, who shot arrows and quarrels at the defenders. Because of the size of the tower it would often be the first target of large stone catapults, but it had its own projectiles with which to retaliate.\nSiege towers were used to get troops over an enemy curtain wall. When a siege tower was near a wall, it would drop a gangplank between it and the wall. Troops could then rush onto the walls and into the castle or city. Some siege towers also had battering rams which they used to bash down the defensive walls around a city or a castle gate.\nAncient use.\nIn the First Intermediate Period tomb of General Intef at Thebes (modern Luxor, Egypt), a mobile siege tower is shown in the battle scenes. In modern Harpoot, Turkey, an artistically Akkadian style stone carved relief dated circa 2000 BC was found depicting a siege tower, the earliest known visual depiction from Anatolia (although siege towers were later described in Hittite cuneiform writing).\nSiege towers were used by the armies of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BC, under Ashurnasirpal II (r. 884 BC \u2013 859 BC). Reliefs from his reign, and subsequent reigns, depict siege towers in use with a number of other siege works, including ramps and battering rams.\nCenturies after they were employed in Assyria, the use of the siege tower spread throughout the Mediterranean. During the siege of Memphis in the 8th century BC, siege towers were built by Kush for the army led by Piye (founder of the Nubian 25th dynasty), in order to enhance the efficiency of Kushite archers and slingers. After leaving Thebes, Piye's first objective was besieging Ashmunein. He admonished his assembled army for their failures, and took personal command. He had a wooden siege tower erected from which his archers could overlook the city and fire down on the enemy.\nDuring the siege of Syracuse in 413 BC, Athenians erected a siege tower on ship hull. Alexander did the same at Tyre (322 BC) as did Marcellus in Syracuse (214 BC). Towers were used against both land and naval targets. At the time of Julius Caesar, ship towers were built with a lighter, collapsible design that could be stowed flat on the deck when not in use, lowering the center of gravity.\nThe biggest siege towers of antiquity, such as the Hellenistic Greek \"Helepolis\" (meaning \"The Taker of Cities\" in Greek) of the siege of Rhodes in 305 BC by Demetrius I of Macedon, could be as high as and as wide as . Such large engines would require a rack and pinion to be moved effectively. It was manned by 200 soldiers and was divided into nine stories; the different levels housed various types of catapults and ballistae. Subsequent siege towers down through the centuries often had similar engines.\nHowever, large siege towers could be defeated by the defenders by flooding the ground in front of the wall, creating a moat that caused the tower to get bogged in the mud. The siege of Rhodes illustrates the important point that the larger siege towers needed level ground. Many castles and hill-top towns and forts were virtually invulnerable to siege tower attack simply due to topography. Smaller siege towers might be used on top of siege-mounds, made of earth, rubble and timber mounds in order to overtop a defensive wall. For example, the remains of such a siege-ramp at Masada, Israel built by the Romans during the siege of Masada (72\u201373 AD) have survived and can still be seen today.\nOn the other hand, almost all the largest cities were on large rivers, or the coast, and so did have part of their circuit wall vulnerable to these towers. Furthermore, the tower for such a target might be prefabricated elsewhere and brought dismantled to the target city by water. In some rare circumstances, such towers were mounted on ships to assault the coastal wall of a city: at the Roman siege of Cyzicus during the Third Mithridatic War, for example, towers were used in conjunction with more conventional siege weapons.\nOne of the oldest references to the mobile siege tower in Ancient China was a written dialogue primarily discussing naval warfare. In the Chinese \"Yuejueshu\" (Lost Records of the State of Yue) written by the later Han dynasty author Yuan Kang in the year 52 AD, Wu Zixu (526 BC \u2013 484 BC) purportedly discussed different ship types with King Hel\u00fc of Wu (r. 514 BC \u2013 496 BC) while explaining military preparedness. Before labeling the types of warships used, Wu said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nowadays in training naval forces we use the tactics of land forces for the best effect. Thus great wing ships correspond to the army's heavy chariots, little wing ships to light chariots, stomach strikers to battering rams, castle ships to mobile assault towers, and bridge ships to light cavalry.\nMedieval and later use.\nWith the collapse of the Western Roman Empire into independent states, and the Eastern Roman Empire on the defensive, the use of siege towers reached its height during the medieval period. Siege towers were used when the Avars laid siege unsuccessfully to Constantinople in 626, as the \"Chronicon Paschale\" recounts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And in the section from the Polyandrion Gate as far as the Gate of St Romanus he prepared to station twelve lofty siege towers, which were advanced almost as far as the outworks, and he covered them with hides.\nAt this siege, the attackers also made use mobile armoured shelters known as sows or cats, which were used throughout the medieval period and allowed workers to fill in moats with protection from the defenders (thus levelling the ground for the siege towers to be moved to the walls). However, the construction of a sloping talus at the base of a castle wall (as was common in crusader fortification) could have reduced the effectiveness of this tactic to an extent.\nSiege towers also became more elaborate during the medieval period; at the siege of Kenilworth in 1266, for example, 200 archers and 11 catapults operated from a single tower. Even then, the siege lasted almost a year, making it the longest siege in all of English history. They were not invulnerable either, as during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Ottoman siege towers were sprayed by the defenders with Greek fire.\nSiege towers became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon. They had only ever existed to get assaulting troops over high walls and towers and large cannons also made high walls obsolete as fortification took a new direction. However, later constructions known as \"battery towers\" took on a similar role in the gunpowder age; like siege-towers, these were built out of wood on-site for mounting siege artillery. One of these was built by the Russian military engineer Ivan Vyrodkov during the siege of Kazan in 1552 (as part of the Russo-Kazan Wars), and could hold ten large-calibre cannon and fifty lighter cannons. Likely, it was a development of the gulyay-gorod (that is a mobile fortification assembled on wagons or sleds from prefabricated wall-sized shields with holes for cannons). Later battery towers were often used by the Ukrainian Cossacks.\nDuring the Imjin War, the Japanese utilized siege towers to scale the walls of Jinju but were beaten back several times by Korean cannons. In the early 19th century, the Joseon Army utilized siege towers to lay siege to Jeonju where the last of Hong Gyeong-Rae's Rebellion made their stand but were beaten back several times by the rebels.\nModern parallels.\nIn modern warfare, some vehicles used by police tactical units, counterterrorists, and special forces can be fitted with mechanical assault ladders with ramps. These are essentially modernized siege towers with elements of escalade ladders, and are used to raid a structure through its upper levels. These assault ladders are not as large or as tall as their predecessors, and are typically only capable of reaching roughly the third or fourth floor of a structure.\nOn 1 March 2007, police officers entered Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen, Denmark using boom cranes in a manner similar to siege towers. The officers were placed in containers that the crane operators raised and placed against the structure's windows, from which the officers then entered.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Islamic terminology \"shar\u012b\u02bfah\" refers to immutable, intangible divine law, in contrast to \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence), which refers to its interpretations by Islamic scholars. Sharia, or fiqh as traditionally known, has always been used alongside customary law from the very beginning in Islamic history; it has been elaborated and developed over the centuries by legal opinions issued by qualified jurists \u2013 reflecting the tendencies of different schools \u2013 and integrated with various economic, penal and administrative laws issued by Muslim rulers; and implemented for centuries by judges in the courts until recent times, when secularism was widely adopted in Islamic societies.\nTraditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources for al-sharia: the Qur'an, \"sunnah\" (or authentic ahadith), \"ijma\" (lit. consensus) (may be understood as \"ijma al-ummah\" () \u2013 a whole Islamic community consensus, or \"ijma al-aimmah\" () \u2013 a consensus by religious authorities), and \"analogical reasoning\". It distinguishes two principal branches of law, rituals (\"Ibadah\") and social dealings (\"Muamalat\"); subsections family law, relationships (commercial, political / administrative) and criminal law, in a wide range of topics assigning actions \u2013 capable of settling into different categories according to different understandings \u2013 to categories (ahkam) mainly as: mandatory, recommended, neutral, abhorred, and prohibited. Beyond legal norms, Sharia also enters many areas that are considered private practises today, such as belief, worshipping, ethics, clothing and lifestyle, and gives to those in command duties to intervene and regulate them.\nOver time with the necessities brought by sociological changes, on the basis of interpretative studies legal schools have emerged, reflecting the preferences of particular societies and governments, as well as Islamic scholars or imams on theoretical and practical applications of laws and regulations. Legal schools of Sunni Islam \u2014 Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi\u02bdi and Hanbali etc.\u2014 developed methodologies for deriving rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as \"ijtihad\", a concept adopted by Shiism in much later periods meaning mental effort. Although Sharia is presented in addition to its other aspects by the contemporary Islamist understanding, as a form of governance some researchers approach traditional s\u012brah narratives with skepticism, seeing the early history of Islam not as a period when Sharia was dominant, but a kind of \"secular Arabic expansion\" and dating the formation of Islamic identity to a much later period.\nApproaches to Sharia in the 21st century vary widely, and the role and mutability of Sharia in a changing world has become an increasingly debated topic in Islam. Beyond sectarian differences, fundamentalists advocate the complete and uncompromising implementation of \"exact/pure sharia\" without modifications, while modernists argue that it can/should be brought into line with human rights and other contemporary issues such as democracy, minority rights, freedom of thought, women's rights and banking by new jurisprudences. In fact, some of the practices of Sharia have been deemed \"incompatible\" with human rights, gender equality and freedom of speech and expression or even \"evil\". In Muslim majority countries, traditional laws have been widely used with or changed by European models. Judicial procedures and legal education have been brought in line with European practice likewise. While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to Sharia, its rules are largely retained only in family law and penalties in some. The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought calls by Islamic movements for full implementation of Sharia, including \"hudud\" corporal punishments, such as stoning through various propaganda methods ranging from civilian activities to terrorism.\nEtymology and usage.\nContemporary usage.\nThe word \"shar\u012b\u02bfah\" is used by Arabic-speaking peoples of the Middle East to designate a prophetic religion in its totality. For example, \"shar\u012b\u02bfat M\u016bs\u0101\" means \"law\" or \"religion of Moses\" and \"shar\u012b\u02bfatu-n\u0101\" can mean \"our religion\" in reference to any monotheistic faith. Within Islamic discourse, \"\u0161ar\u012b\u02bfah\" refers to religious regulations governing the lives of Muslims. For many Muslims, the word means simply \"justice,\" and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to Sharia. Sharia is the first of Four Doors and the lowest level on the path to God in Sufism and in branches of Islam that are influenced by Sufism, such as Ismailism and Alawism. It is necessary to reach from Sharia to Tariqa, from there to Ma'rifa and finally to haqiqa. In each of these gates, there are 10 levels that the dervish must pass through.\nJan Michiel Otto summarizes the evolutionary stages of understanding by distinguishing four meanings conveyed by the term \"Sharia\" in discourses.\nA related term \"\" (, Islamic law), which was borrowed from European usage in the late 19th century, is used in the Muslim world to refer to a legal system in the context of a modern state.\nEtymology.\nThe primary meanings of the Arabic word \"\u0161ar\u012b\u02bfah\", derived from the root \"\u0161-r-\u0295\". The lexicographical studies records two major areas of the word can appear without religious connotation. In texts evoking a pastoral or nomadic environment, \"\u0161ar\u012b\u02bfah\" and its derivatives refers to watering animals at a permanent water-hole or to the seashore. Another area of use relates to notions of stretched or lengthy. The word is cognate with the Hebrew \"sara\u02bf\" () and is likely to be the origin of the meaning \"way\" or \"path\". Some scholars describe it as an archaic Arabic word denoting \"pathway to be followed\" (analogous to \"Halakha\", or Jewish law), or \"path to the water hole\" and argue that its adoption as a metaphor for a divinely ordained way of life arises from the importance of water in an arid desert environment.\nUse in religious texts.\nIn the Quran, and its cognate occur once each, with the meaning \"way\" or \"path\". The word was widely used by Arabic-speaking Jews during the Middle Ages, being the most common translation for the word in the 10th-century Arabic translation of the Torah by Saadia Gaon. A similar use of the term can be found in Christian writers. The Arabic expression ( 'God's Law') is a common translation of () and ('God's Law' in Greek in the New Testament [Rom. 7: 22]). In Muslim literature, designates the laws or message of a prophet or God, in contrast to , which refers to a scholar's interpretation thereof.\nIn older English-language law-related works in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, the word used for Sharia was sheri. It, along with the French variant , was used during the time of the Ottoman Empire, and is from the Turkish borrowed from Arabic \"\u0161ar\u02bf\" which is from the same root as \"\u0161ar\u012b\u02bfah\".\nHistorical origins.\nAccording to the traditionalist (\"Athar\u012b\") Muslim view, the major precepts of Sharia were passed down directly from the Islamic prophet Muhammad without \"historical development\" and the emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (\"fiqh\") also goes back to the lifetime of Muhammad. In this view, his companions and followers took what he did and approved of as a model (sunnah) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of hadith. These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists Abu Hanifa, Malik ibn Anas, al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who are viewed as the founders of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi\u02bfi, and Hanbali legal schools (\"madh\u0101hib\") of Sunni jurisprudence.\nModern historians have presented alternative theories of the formation of fiqh while they have accepted the general outlines of the traditionalist account at first. In the late 19th century, an influential revisionist hypothesis was advanced by Ign\u00e1c Goldziher and elaborated by Joseph Schacht in the mid-20th century. Schacht and other scholars argued that having conquered much more populous agricultural and urban societies with already existing laws and legal needs, the initial Muslim efforts to formulate legal norms\nregarded the Quran and Muhammad's hadiths as just one source of law, with jurist personal opinions, the legal practice of conquered peoples, and the decrees and decisions of the caliphs also being valid sources. According to this theory, most canonical hadiths did not originate with Muhammad but were actually created at a later date, despite the efforts of hadith scholars to weed out fabrications.\nAfter it became accepted that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources, proponents of rules of jurisprudence supported by the hadith would extend the chains of transmission of the hadith back to Muhammad's companions. In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was al-Shafi'i, who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work \"al-risala\", but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of Muhammad's hadiths.\nSome articles that may be considered precursors of Sharia law and rituals can be found in the pre-Islamic Arabic religions; pilgrimage is mentioned in pre-Islamic Safaitic-Arabic inscriptions, and continuity can be observed in certain details, especially in today's hajj and umrah rituals. The veiling order, which distinguishes between slaves and free women in Islam, also coincides with similar distinctions seen in pre-Islamic civilizations.\nQisas was a practice used as a resolution tool in inter-tribal conflicts in pre-Islamic Arab society. The basis of this resolution was that a member from the tribe to which the murderer belonged was handed over to the victim's family for execution, equivalent to the social status of the murdered person. The \"condition of social equivalence\" meant the execution of a member of the murderer's tribe who was equivalent to the murdered person. For example, only a slave could be killed for a slave, and a woman for a woman. In other cases, \"compensatory payment (Diya)\" could be paid to the family of the murdered. On top of this pre-Islamic understanding added a debate about whether a Muslim can be executed for a non-Muslim during the Islamic period. The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara 178: \"Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, slave versus slave, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well.\"\nModern historians generally adopt intermediate positions regarding origins, suggesting that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam. It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the early conquests and modified others, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the community. Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics. At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles. As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school's founder. In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.\nTraditional jurisprudence (\"fiqh\").\n\"Fiqh\" is traditionally divided into the fields of \"u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh\" (lit. the roots of \"fiqh\"), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and \"fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh\" (lit. the branches of \"fiqh\"), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.\nPrinciples of jurisprudence (\"u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh\").\nClassical Islamic jurisprudence refers how to elaborate and interpret religious sources that are considered reliable within the framework of \"procedural principles\" within its context such as linguistic and \"rhetorical tools\" to derive judgments for new situations by taking into account certain purposes and mesalih. Textual phrases usually dealt with under simple antithetical headings: general and particular, command and prohibition, obscure and clear, truth and metaphor. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date.\nThe sources of judgment in classical fiqh are roughly divided into two: Manq\u016bl\u0101t (Quran and hadith) and Aqliyy\u0101t (ijma, qiyas, ijtihad and others). Some of them (Aqliyy\u0101t) are considered to be the product of scholastic theology and Aristotelian logic. It was an important area of debate among traditional fiqh scholars how much space should be given to rational methods in creating provisions such as extracting provisions from religious texts, as well as expanding, restricting, abolishing or postponing these provisions according to new situations, considering the purpose and benefit, together with new sociologies, in the face of changing conditions.\nIn this context, in the Classical period, the ulema were divided into groups (among other divisions such as political divisions) regarding the place of \"'Aql\" vis-\u00e0-vis naql: those who rely on narration (Atharists, Ahl al-Hadith), those who rely on reason (Ahl al-Kal\u0101m, Mu'tazila and Ahl al-Ra'y) and those who tried to find a middle way between the two attitudes such as Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari in theology (syncretists). In the classical age of Islam, there were violent conflicts between rationalists (aqliyyun; al-mu\u02bftazila, kalamiyya) and traditionalist (naqliyyun, literalists, Ahl al-Hadith) groups and sects regarding the Quran and hadith or the place of reason in understanding the Quran and hadith, as can be seen in the Mihna example. Although the rationalists initially seemed to gain the upper hand in this conflict, with the rise of literalism, the Mutazila sank into history and literalism continued to live by gaining supporters.\nIn this context, the formulation of the Sunni view can be summarized as follows; Human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity. However, use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (\"ijma\u02bf\") and analogical reasoning (\"qiyas\"). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of \"ijtihad\", which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.\nThe theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (\"\u02bfaql\") as a source of law in place of \"qiyas\" and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.\nSources for Ahkam al-Sharia.\nIslamic scholar Rashid Rida (1865\u20131935 CE) lists the four basic sources of Islamic law, agreed upon by all Sunni Muslims: \"the [well-known] sources of legislation in Islam are four: the \"Qur'an\", the \"Sunnah\", the consensus of the \"ummah\" and \"ijtihad\" undertaken by competent jurists\" \nWhile traditional understanding strongly denies that Quran may have changed,(Al Hejr:9) the authenticity of hadiths could only be questioned through the chain of narration, though some western researchers suggests that primary sources may have also been evolved.\nA small number of verses in the Quran are about general rules of governance, inheritance, marriage, crime and punishment. There are notable exceptions to some of these rules, as in Al-Ahzab 49; jurists state that they are specific to Muhammad alone. Although the Quran does not impose a specific legal-management system, it emphasizes custom in nearly 40 verses and commands justice. (An-Nahl; 90) The practices prescribed in the Quran are considered as reflections of contextual legal understandings, as can be clearly seen in some examples such as Qisas and diya. The following statement in the Quran is thought to be the general rule of testimony in Islamic jurisprudence, except for crime and punishment \u2013 for example, debt, shopping, etc.; O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing...with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her... Rules of inheritance was also mentioned in the Quran, in regards to certain family members having their share..[Quran https://]\nIn a different example, in the necklace story of Aisha, called Asbab al-Nuzul for surah An-Nur :11-20 four witnesses were required for the accusation of adultery. In addition, those who made accusations that did not meet the specified conditions would be punished with 80 lashes. The jurisprudence of later periods stipulates that witnesses must be men, covering all hadd crimes and people who did not have credibility and honesty in society (slaves, non-adl; sinners, infidels) could not testify against believers. In addition, the Islamic judiciary did not require proof of the issues defined as tazir. The statement in the Qur'an that determines the status of slaves in community is; \"ma malakat aymanuhum\" meaning \"those whom your right hands possess\".\nOf the few criminal cases listed as crimes in the Quran, only a few of them are punished by the classical books of Sharia as determined by the verses of the Quran and are called hudud laws. How the verse Al-Ma'idah 33, which describes the crime of hirabah, should be understood is a matter of debate even today. The verse talks about the punishment of criminals by killing, hanging, having their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, and being exiled from the earth, in response to an -abstract- crime such as \"fighting against Allah and His Messenger\". Today, commentators \u2013 in the face of the development of the understanding of law and the increasing reactions to corporal punishment- claim that the verse determines the punishment of \"concrete sequential criminal acts\" \u2013 such as massacre, robbery and rape \u2013 in addition to rebellion against the legitimate government, and that the punishment to be given depends on the existence of these preconditions. \nAlthough for many Muslim sects, hadith was second to that of the Quran in authority, the majority of Sharia rules derived from hadith rather than the Quran. The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic. Early Islamic scholars developed personal criteria for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains. These studies narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand \"sound (seeming to collectors)\" hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations. The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed mutawatir; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge. The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages. Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.\nIn Imam Malik's usage, hadith did not consist only of the words claimed to belong to Muhammad as is the case with Shiite Muslims. While hadith does not appear to be an important source of decision for early fiqh scholars such as Abu Hanifa, for later scholars, hadith is perceived as the words of Muhammad merely and is considered as a strong and separate source of decision alongside the Quran. Today, Quranists do not consider hadiths as a valid source of religious rulings.\nAims of Sharia and public interest.\n\"Maq\u0101\u1e63id\" (aims or purposes) of Sharia and \"ma\u1e63la\u1e25a\" (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times. Ab\u016b H\u0101mid al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Izz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam and Abu Ishaq al-Shatibi used maslaha and madas\u0131d as equivalent terms. Synonyms for the term maq\u0101\u1e63id a\u0161-\u0161ar\u012b\u02bfa are the expressions maq\u0101\u1e63id a\u0161-\u0161\u0101ri\u02bf (\"intentions of the legislature\"), maq\u0101\u1e63id at-ta\u0161r\u012b\u02bf (\"intentions of the legislature \"), ru\u1e25 a\u0161 -\u0161ar\u012b\u02bfa (\"Spirit of Sharia\"), \u1e25ikmat at-ta\u0161r\u012b\u02bf (\"Wisdom of Legislation\") and falsafat at-ta\u0161r\u012b\u02bf (\"Philosophy of Legislation\").\nThey were first clearly articulated by al-Ghazali (d. 1111), who argued that \"Maq\u0101\u1e63id\" and \"maslaha\" was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.\nAlthough most classical-era jurists recognized \"maslaha\" and \"maqasid\" as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law. Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning. Others regarded them as an \"independent\" source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture. Taking maqasid and maslaha as an \"independent\" source of sharia \u2013 rather than an auxiliary one \u2013 will pave the way for the re-critique and reorganization of ahkam in the context of maqasid and maslaha, thus (including hudud), which is often criticized in terms of today's values and seen as problematic, in terms of the purposes of Sharia and social benefits will be replaced by new ones. Abdallah bin Bayyah goes further with an approach that prioritizes purpose and benefit among the sources of Sharia and declares it to be the heart of \"usul-al fiqh\".\nWhile the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence. These scholars expanded the inventory of \"maqasid\" to include such aims of Sharia as reform and women's rights (Rashid Rida); justice and freedom (Mohammed al-Ghazali); and human rights and dignity (Yusuf al-Qaradawi).\nIjtihad.\nIjtihad lit.\u2009'physical' or 'mental effort' refers to independent reasoning by an expert in Islamic law, or exertion of a jurist's mentality in finding a solution to a legal question in contrast with \"taqlid\" (conformity to precedent ijtihad). According to theory, \"ijtihad\" requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, religious texts, and principles of jurisprudence (\"usul al-fiqh\"), and is not employed where authentic and trusted texts (Qur'an and hadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (\"ijma\"). An Islamic scholar who perform \"ijtihad\" is called \"mujtahid\". In the general understanding, beyond the limitation of ijtihad to those situations that do not have a clear ruling in the Quran and hadiths, scholars who have the ability to give general judgments are also ranked with definitions such as \"mujtahid mutlaq\", \"mujtahid in sect\", \"mujtahid in issue\". Rulings based on ijtihad are not decisions that require obligatory implementation for other Muslims.\nThroughout the first five Islamic centuries, \"ijtihad\" continued to practise amongst Sunni Muslims. The controversy surrounding \"ijtihad\" started with the beginning of the twelfth century. By the 14th century, Islamic Fiqh prompted leading Sunni jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and then \"ijtihad\" was gradually restricted. In the modern era, this gave rise to a perception amongst Orientalist scholars and sections of the Muslim public that the so-called \"gate of \"ijtihad\"\" was closed at the start of the classical era.\nStarting from the 18th century, Islamic reformers began calling for abandonment of \"taqlid\" and emphasis on \"ijtihad\", which they saw as a return to Islamic origins. The advocacy of \"ijtihad\" has been particularly associated with Islamic Modernism and Salafiyya movements. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of \"ijtihad\" which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical understandings.\nShia jurists did not use the term \"ijtihad\" until the 12th century. With the exception of Zaydis, the early Imami Shia were unanimous in censuring \"Ijtihad\" in the field of law (\"Ahkam\") until the Shiite embrace of various doctrines of Mu'tazila and classical Sunnite \"Fiqh\". After the victory of the \"Usulis\" who based law on principles (usul) over the \"Akhbaris\" (\"traditionalists\") who emphasized on reports or traditions (\"khabar\") by the 19th century, \"Ijtihad\" would become a mainstream Shia practice.\nThe classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as \"istihsan\" (juristic preference), \"istislah\" (consideration of public interest) and \"istishab\" (presumption of continuity).\nConsidering that, as a rule, there was a hierarchy and power ranking among the sources of Sharia; for example, a subcategory or an auxiliary source will not be able to eliminate a provision clearly stated in the main source or prohibit a practice that was not prohibited though it was known and practiced during the prophetic period. If we look at an example such as the abolition of the validity of Mut'a marriage, is touched upon in the , and not prohibited (Sunnis translate the words used in the relevant verse with terms used to describe the ordinary marriage event) according to Sunnis is banned by Muhammad towards the end of his lifetime, and according to Shiites, by Omar, \"according to his own opinion\" and relying on power. The Shiite sect did not accept the jurisprudence of Omar, whose political and religious authority they rejected from the beginning.\nAhkam al-shar'iyya (Decision types; labels).\nFiqh is concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms, seeking to establish not only what is and is not legal, but also what is morally right and wrong. Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as \"the five decisions\" (\"al-a\u1e25k\u0101m al-khamsa\"): mandatory (\"far\u1e0d\" or \"w\u0101jib\"), recommended (\"mand\u016bb\" or \"musta\u1e25abb\"), neutral (\"mub\u0101\u1e25\"), reprehensible (\"makr\u016bh\"), and forbidden (\"\u1e25ar\u0101m\").\nIt is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action. Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court. Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while neutral actions entail no judgment from God. Jurists disagree on whether the term \"\u1e25al\u0101l\" covers the first three or the first four categories. The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (\"\u1e0dar\u016bra\") and on the underlying intention (\"niyya\"), as expressed in the legal maxim \"acts are [evaluated according] to intention.\"\nHanafi fiqh does not consider both terms as synonymous and makes a distinction between \"fard\" and \"wajib\"; In Hanafi fiqh, two conditions are required to impose the fard rule. 1. Nass, (only verses of the Qur'an can be accepted as evidence here, not hadiths) 2.The expression of the text referring to the subject must be clear and precise enough not to allow other interpretations. The term wajib is used for situations that do not meet the second of these conditions.\nHowever, this understanding may not be sufficient to explain every situation. For example, Hanafis accept 5 daily prayers as fard. However, some religious groups such as Quranists and Shiites, who do not doubt that the Quran existing today is a religious source, infer from the same verses that it is clearly ordered to pray 2 or 3 times, not 5 times. In addition, in religious literature, wajib is widely used for all kinds of religious requirements, without expressing any fiqh definition.\nAs seen above and in many other examples, classifications and labels have a relative character shaped by the understanding of the people and groups who make them. For example, believing in the existence and miracles of Awliya is presented as a \"condition\" for orthodox Islam by many prominent Sunni creed writers such as Al-Tahawi and Nasafi and is accepted in traditional Sunnis and Shi'ism. However, this understanding, along with expressions of respect and visits to the graves of saints, are seen as unacceptable heresy by puritanical and revivalist Islamic movements such as Salafism, Wahhabism and Islamic Modernism.\nAbout six verses address the way a woman should dress when in public; Muslim scholars have differed as how to understand these verses, with some stating that a Hijab is a command (fard) to be fulfilled and others say simply not.\nIslamic primary law sources, like the legal systems of classical antiquity and the ancient Near East, does not contain a true equivalent of the modern concept of rape, which is in turn based on the modern notions of individual autonomy and inviolability of the body, particularly the female body. Classical jurisprudence, attempted to fill this gap by likening rape to defined crimes such as adultery and hirabah. In some cases, this approach has had detrimental consequences for the victims. In Afghanistan and Dubai, some women who made accusations of rape have been charged with fornication or adultery. The statement in the Qur'an that determines the status of slaves and concubines in the understanding of Sharia is as follows; \"ma malakat aymanuhum\" or \"milk al-yamin\" meaning \"those whom your right hands possess\". Hence, sexual use of female slaves was considered within of their definition that \"they are the well-earned rewards or properties of their masters\", and with a few exceptions, unrestricted sexual and physical use of their bodies has been legitimized by the ulama in traditional Islamic law.\nA special religious decision, which is \"specific to\" a person, group, institution, event, situation, belief and practice in different areas of life, and usually includes the approval/disapproval of a judgment, is called fatwa. Tazir penalties, which are outside the Qisas and Hudud laws, have not been codified, and their discretion and implementation are under the initiative and authority of the judge or political authority. Mustafa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk points out some another developments in the Islamic creed, leading changes in ahkam such as determining the conditions of takfir according to theologians; First Muslims believed that God lived in the sky as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal says: \"Whoever says that Allah is everywhere is a heretic, an infidel, should be invited to repent, but if he does not, be killed.\" This understanding changes later and gives way to the understanding that \"God cannot be assigned a place and He is everywhere.\"\nJudgment that concerns individuals is personal and, for example, in an Islamic Qisas or compensation decisions, jurist must take into account \"personal labels\" such as the gender, freedom, religious and social status such as mu'min, kafir, musta'min, dhimmi, apostate, etc. Similar distinctions also apply to witnessing practices, which have a fundamental value in the establishment of judicial provisions, such as the identification of the criminals. Islamic preachers constantly emphasize the importance of adalah, and in trials, the judge is not expected to observe equality among those on trial, but is expected to act fairly or balanced. Traditional fiqh states that legal and religious responsibility begins with rushd.\nBranches and details (\"fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh\").\nThe domain of \"fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh\" (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into \"\u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t\" (rituals or acts of worship) and \"mu\u02bf\u0101mal\u0101t\" (social relations). Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into \"the four quarters\", called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries. Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects. For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics. Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a \"book\" (\"kitab\"). The special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work.\nSome historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories. Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as \"hudud\". Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply. Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of \"lex talionis\" that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (\"qisas\"), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (\"diya\") or pardon the perpetrator instead; only \"diya\" is imposed for non-intentional harm. Other criminal cases belong to the category of \"ta\u02bfz\u012br\", where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion. \nWhich crime falls into which category may vary depending on understanding. For example, according to some verses and hadiths, those who avoided alms and prayers were the ones to be fought against,) and according to some understandings, they were people who had abandoned religion \u2013 theologians debated whether worship was a part of faith \u2013 and according to classical fiqh sects, they were people who should be killed. However, even if today's dominant understanding defines the abandonment of worship as sinfulness, does not approve of giving worldly punishment for them. However, in Sharia governments, their testimony against a devout Muslim may not be accepted, they may be humiliated and barred from certain positions because of this tag. In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to Sharia.\nThe two major genres of \"fur\u016b\u02bf\" literature are the \"mukhtasar\" (concise summary of law) and the \"mabsut\" (extensive commentary). \"Mukhtasars\" were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges. A \"mabsut\", which usually provided a commentary on a \"mukhtasar\" and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions. The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance. At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions. Other juristic genres include the \"qaw\u0101\u02bfid\" (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.\nClassical jurisprudence has been described as \"one of the major intellectual achievements of Islam\" and its importance in Islam has been compared to that of theology in Christianity.\nSchools of law.\nThe main Sunni schools of law (\"madhhabs\") are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali madhhabs. They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab. These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world. For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia. The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs. The Zahiri school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought. The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the Twelver, Zaidi and Ismaili madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools. The Ibadi legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.\nThe transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of \"takhayyur\" (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and \"talfiq\" (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the Salafi and Wahhabi movements. Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.\nPre-modern Islamic legal system.\nJurists.\nSharia was traditionally interpreted by muftis. During the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were private legal specialists who normally also held other jobs. They issued fatwas (legal opinions), generally free of charge, in response to questions from laypersons or requests for consultation coming from judges, which would be stated in general terms. Fatwas were regularly upheld in courts, and when they were not, it was usually because the fatwa was contradicted by a more authoritative legal opinion. The stature of jurists was determined by their scholarly reputation. The majority of classical legal works, written by author-jurists, were based in large part on fatwas of distinguished muftis. These fatwas functioned as a form of legal precedent, unlike court verdicts, which were valid only for the given case. Although independent muftis never disappeared, from the 12th century onward Muslim rulers began to appoint salaried muftis to answer questions from the public. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while Shia jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.\nIslamic law was initially taught in study circles that gathered in mosques and private homes. The teacher, assisted by advanced students, provided commentary on concise treatises of law and examined the students' understanding of the text. This tradition continued to be practiced in \"madrasas\", which spread during the 10th and 11th centuries. Madrasas were institutions of higher learning devoted principally to study of law, but also offering other subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. The madrasa complex usually consisted of a mosque, boarding house, and a library. It was maintained by a \"waqf\" (charitable endowment), which paid salaries of professors, stipends of students, and defrayed the costs of construction and maintenance. At the end of a course, the professor granted a license (\"ijaza\") certifying a student's competence in its subject matter. Students specializing in law would complete a curriculum consisting of preparatory studies, the doctrines of a particular madhhab, and training in legal disputation, and finally write a dissertation, which earned them a license to teach and issue fatwas.\nCourts.\nA judge (qadi) was in charge of the qadi's court (\"mahkama\"), also called the Sharia court. Qadis were trained in Islamic law, though not necessarily to a level required to issue fatwas. Court personnel also included a number of assistants performing various roles. Judges were theoretically independent in their decisions, though they were appointed by the ruler and often experienced pressure from members of the ruling elite where their interests were at play. The role of qadis was to evaluate the evidence, establish the facts of the case, and issue a verdict based on the applicable rulings of Islamic jurisprudence. The qadi was supposed to solicit a fatwa from a mufti if it was unclear how the law should be applied to the case. Since Islamic legal theory does not recognize the distinction between private and public law, court procedures were identical for civil and criminal cases, and required a private plaintiff to produce evidence against the defendant. The main type of evidence was oral witness testimony. The standards of evidence for criminal cases were so strict that a conviction was often difficult to obtain even for apparently clear-cut cases. Most historians believe that because of these stringent procedural norms, qadi's courts at an early date lost their jurisdiction over criminal cases, which were instead handled in other types of courts.\nIf an accusation did not result in a verdict in a qadi's court, the plaintiff could often pursue it in another type of court called the \"mazalim\" court, administered by the ruler's council. The rationale for \"mazalim\" (lit. wrongs, grievances) courts was to address the wrongs that Sharia courts were unable to address, including complaints against government officials. Islamic jurists were commonly in attendance and a judge often presided over the court as a deputy of the ruler. \"Mazalim\" verdicts were supposed to conform to the spirit of Sharia, but they were not bound by the letter of the law or the procedural restrictions of qadi's courts.\nThe police (\"shurta\"), which took initiative in preventing and investigating crime, operated its own courts. Like the mazalim courts, police courts were not bound by the rules of Sharia and had the powers to inflict discretionary punishments. Another office for maintaining public order was the \"muhtasib\" (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud in economic transactions and infractions against public morality. The \"muhtasib\" took an active role in pursuing these types of offenses and meted out punishments based on local custom.\nPunishments.\nThe classical Islamic legal tradition did not have a separate category for criminal law as does modern law. The classical Islamic jurisprudence typically divided the subject matter of law into four \"quarters\", that is rituals, sales, marriage, and injuries. In modern usage, Islamic criminal law has been extracted and collated from that classical Islamic jurisprudence literature into three categories of rules: As crimes against God they cannot be forgiven but the punishments are seldom enforced as they can be averted by the slightest doubts or ambiguities.\nSocio-political context.\nThe social fabric of pre-modern Islamic societies was largely defined by close-knit communities organized around kinship groups and local neighborhoods. Conflicts between individuals had the potential to escalate into a conflict between their supporting groups and disrupt the life of the entire community. Court litigation was seen as a last resort for cases where informal mediation had failed. This attitude was reflected in the legal maxim \"amicable settlement is the best verdict\" (\"al-sulh sayyid al-ahkam\"). In court disputes, qadis were generally less concerned with legal theory than with achieving an outcome that enabled the disputants to resume their previous social relationships. This could be accomplished by avoiding a total loss for the losing side or simply giving them a chance to articulate their position in public and obtain a measure of psychological vindication. Islamic law required judges to be familiar with local customs, and they exercised a number of other public functions in the community, including mediation and arbitration, supervision of public works, auditing waqf finances, and looking after the interests of orphans.\nUnlike pre-modern cultures where the ruling dynasty promulgated the law, Islamic law was formulated by religious scholars without involvement of the rulers. The law derived its authority not from political control, but rather from the collective doctrinal positions of the legal schools (madhhabs) in their capacity as interpreters of the scriptures. The ulema (religious scholars) were involved in management of communal affairs and acted as representatives of the Muslim population vis-\u00e0-vis the ruling dynasties, who before the modern era had limited capacity for direct governance. Military elites relied on the ulema for religious legitimation, with financial support for religious institutions being one of the principal means through which these elites established their legitimacy. In turn, the ulema depended on the support of the ruling elites for the continuing operation of religious institutions. Although the relationship between secular rulers and religious scholars underwent a number of shifts and transformations in different times and places, this mutual dependence characterized Islamic history until the start of the modern era. Additionally, since Sharia contained few provisions in several areas of public law, Muslim rulers were able to legislate various collections of economic, criminal and administrative laws outside the jurisdiction of Islamic jurists, the most famous of which is the \"qanun\" promulgated by Ottoman sultans beginning from the 15th century. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658\u20131707) issued a hybrid body of law known as Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, based on Hanafi fatwas as well as decisions of Islamic courts, and made it applicable to all religious communities on the Indian subcontinent. This early attempt to turn Islamic law into semi-codified state legislation sparked rebellions against Mughal rule.\nWomen, non-Muslims, slaves.\nIn both the rules of civil disputes and application of penal law, classical Sharia distinguishes between men and women, between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between free persons and slaves.\nTraditional Islamic law assumes a patriarchal society with a man at the head of the household. Different legal schools formulated a variety of legal norms which could be manipulated to the advantage of men or women, but women were generally at a disadvantage with respect to the rules of inheritance and witness testimony, where in some cases a woman's witness testimony is effectively treated as half of that of a man. Various financial obligations imposed on the husband acted as a deterrent against unilateral divorce and commonly gave the wife financial leverage in divorce proceedings. Women were active in Sharia courts as both plaintiffs and defendants in a wide variety of cases, though some opted to be represented by a male relative.\nSharia was intended to regulate affairs of the Muslim community. Non-Muslims residing under Islamic rule had the legal status of dhimmi, which entailed a number of protections, restrictions, freedoms and legal inequalities, including payment of the jizya tax. Dhimmi communities had legal autonomy to adjudicate their internal affairs. Cases involving litigants from two different religious groups fell under jurisdiction of Sharia courts, where (unlike in secular courts) testimony of non-Muslim witnesses against a Muslim was inadmissible in criminal cases or at all. This legal framework was implemented with varying degree of rigor. In some periods or towns, all inhabitants apparently used the same court without regard for their religious affiliation. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb imposed Islamic law on all his subjects, including provisions traditionally applicable only to Muslims, while some of his predecessors and successors are said to have abolished jizya. According to Ottoman records, non-Muslim women took their cases to a Sharia court when they expected a more favorable outcome on marital, divorce and property questions than in Christian and Jewish courts. Over time, non Muslims in the Ottoman Empire could be more or less likely to use Islamic courts. For example, in 1729 at the Islamic court in Galata only two percent of cases involved non-Muslims whereas in 1789 non-Muslims were a part of thirty percent of cases. Ottoman court records also reflect the use of Islamic courts by formerly non-Muslim women. As it was illegal for non-Muslims to own Muslims and for non-Muslim men to marry Muslim women in the Ottoman empire, conversion to Islam would have been an option for non-Muslim women to free themselves of a spouse or master they did not want to subject to. However, this would likely lead to them being shunned by their former community.\nClassical fiqh acknowledges and regulates slavery as a legitimate institution. It granted slaves certain rights and protections, improving their status relative to Greek and Roman law, and restricted the scenarios under which people could be enslaved. However, slaves could not inherit or enter into a contract, and were subject to their master's will in a number of ways. The labor and property of slaves were owned by the master, who was also entitled to sexual submission of his unmarried slaves.\nFormal legal disabilities for some groups coexisted with a legal culture that viewed Sharia as a reflection of universal principles of justice, which involved protection of the weak against injustices committed by the strong. This conception was reinforced by the historical practice of Sharia courts, where peasants \"almost always\" won cases against oppressive landowners, and non-Muslims often prevailed in disputes against Muslims, including such powerful figures as the governor of their province. In family matters the Sharia court was seen as a place where the rights of women could be asserted against their husband's transgressions.\nUnder colonial rule.\nStarting from the 17th century, European powers began to extend political influence over lands ruled by Muslim dynasties, and by the end of the 19th century, much of the Muslim world came under colonial domination. The first areas of Islamic law to be impacted were usually commercial and criminal laws, which impeded colonial administration and were soon replaced by European regulations. Islamic commercial laws were also replaced by European (mostly French) laws in Muslim states which retained formal independence, because these states increasingly came to rely on Western capital and could not afford to lose the business of foreign merchants who refused to submit to Islamic regulations.\nThe first significant changes to the legal system of British India were initiated in the late 18th century by the governor of Bengal Warren Hastings. Hastings' plan of legal reform envisioned a multi-tiered court system for the Muslim population, with a middle tier of British judges advised by local Islamic jurists, and a lower tier of courts operated by qadis. Hastings also commissioned a translation of the classic manual of Hanafi fiqh, \"Al-Hidayah\", from Arabic into Persian and then English, later complemented by other texts. These translations enabled British judges to pass verdicts in the name of Islamic law based on a combination of Sharia rules and common law doctrines, and eliminated the need to rely on consultation by local ulema, whom they mistrusted. In the traditional Islamic context, a concise text like \"Al-Hidayah\" would be used as a basis for classroom commentary by a professor, and the doctrines thus learned would be mediated in court by judicial discretion, consideration of local customs and availability of different legal opinions that could fit the facts of the case. The British use of \"Al-Hidayah\", which amounted to an inadvertent codification of Sharia, and its interpretation by judges trained in Western legal traditions anticipated later legal reforms in the Muslim world.\nBritish administrators felt that Sharia rules too often allowed criminals to escape punishment, as exemplified by Hastings' complaint that Islamic law was \"founded on the most lenient principles and on an abhorrence of bloodshed\". In the course of the 19th century, criminal laws and other aspects of the Islamic legal system in India were supplanted by British law, with the exception of Sharia rules retained in family laws and some property transactions. Among other changes, these reforms brought about abolition of slavery, prohibition of child marriage, and a much more frequent use of capital punishment. The resulting legal system, known as \"Anglo-Muhammadan law\", was treated by the British as a model for legal reforms in their other colonies. Like the British in India, colonial administrations typically sought to obtain precise and authoritative information about indigenous laws, which prompted them to prefer classical Islamic legal texts over local judicial practice. This, together with their conception of Islamic law as a collection of inflexible rules, led to an emphasis on traditionalist forms of Sharia that were not rigorously applied in the pre-colonial period and served as a formative influence on the modern identity politics of the Muslim world.\nOttoman Empire.\nDuring the colonial era, Muslim rulers concluded that they could not resist European pressure unless they modernized their armies and built centrally administered states along the lines of Western models. In the Ottoman Empire, the first such changes in the legal sphere involved placing the formerly independent waqfs under state control. This reform, passed in 1826, enriched the public treasury at the expense of the waqfs, thereby depleting the financial support for traditional Islamic legal education. Over the second half of the 19th century, a new hierarchical system of secular courts was established to supplement and eventually replace most religious courts. Students hoping to pursue legal careers in the new court system increasingly preferred attending secular schools over the traditional path of legal education with its dimming financial prospects. \nThe Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century saw reorganization of both Islamic civil law and sultanic criminal law after the model of the Napoleonic Code. In the 1870s, a codification of civil law and procedure (excepting marriage and divorce), called the \"Mecelle\", was produced for use in both Sharia and secular courts. It adopted the Turkish language for the benefit of the new legal class who no longer possessed competence in the Arabic idiom of traditional jurisprudence. The code was based on Hanafi law, and its authors selected minority opinions over authoritative ones when they were felt to better \"suit the present conditions\". The Mecelle was promulgated as a \"qanun\" (sultanic code), which represented an unprecedented assertion of the state's authority over Islamic civil law, traditionally the preserve of the ulema. The 1917 Ottoman Law of Family Rights adopted an innovative approach of drawing rules from minority and majority opinions of all Sunni madhhabs with a modernizing intent. The Republic of Turkey, which emerged after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, abolished its Sharia courts and replaced Ottoman civil laws with the Swiss Civil Code, but Ottoman civil laws remained in force for several decades in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq.\nNation states.\nWesternization of legal institutions and expansion of state control in all areas of law, which began during the colonial era, continued in nation-states of the Muslim world. Sharia courts at first continued to exist alongside state courts as in earlier times, but the doctrine that sultanic courts should implement the ideals of Sharia was gradually replaced by legal norms imported from Europe. Court procedures were also brought in line with European practice. Though the Islamic terms \"qadi\" and \"mahkama\" (qadi's/Sharia court) were preserved, they generally came to mean judge and court in the Western sense. While in the traditional Sharia court all parties represented themselves, in modern courts they are represented by professional lawyers educated in Western-style law schools, and the verdicts are subject to review in an appeals court. In the 20th century, most countries abolished a parallel system of Sharia courts and brought all cases under a national civil court system.\nIn most Muslim-majority countries, traditional rules of classical fiqh have been largely preserved only in family law. In some countries religious minorities such as Christians or Shia Muslims have been subject to separate systems of family laws. Many Muslims today believe that contemporary Sharia-based laws are an authentic representation of the pre-modern legal tradition. In reality, they generally represent the result of extensive legal reforms made in the modern era. As traditional Islamic jurists lost their role as authoritative interpreters of the laws applied in courts, these laws were codified by legislators and administered by state systems which employed a number of devices to effect changes, including:\nThe most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the Egyptian Islamic scholar Muhammad \u02bfAbduh (1849\u20131905). Abduh viewed only Sharia rules pertaining to religious rituals as inflexible, and argued that the other Islamic laws should be adapted based on changing circumstances in consideration of social well-being. Following precedents of earlier Islamic thinkers, he advocated restoring Islam to its original purity by returning to the Quran and the sunna instead of following the medieval schools of jurisprudence. He championed a creative approach to ijtihad that involved direct interpretation of scriptures as well as the methods of \"takhayyur\" and \"talfiq\".\nOne of the most influential figures in modern legal reforms was the Egyptian legal scholar Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri (1895\u20131971), who possessed expertise in both Islamic and Western law. Sanhuri argued that reviving Islamic legal heritage in a way that served the needs of contemporary society required its analysis in light of the modern science of comparative law. He drafted the civil codes of Egypt (1949) and Iraq (1951) based on a variety of sources, including classical fiqh, European laws, existing Arab and Turkish codes, and the history of local court decisions. Sanhuri's Egyptian code incorporated few classical Sharia rules, but he drew on traditional jurisprudence more frequently for the Iraqi code. Sanhuri's codes were subsequently adopted in some form by most Arab countries.\nAside from the radical reforms of Islamic family law carried out in Tunisia (1956) and Iran (1967), governments often preferred to make changes that made a clear break from traditional Sharia rules by imposing administrative hurdles rather than changing the rules themselves, in order to minimize objections from religious conservatives. Various procedural changes have been made in a number of countries to restrict polygamy, give women greater rights in divorce, and eliminate child marriage. Inheritance has been the legal domain least susceptible to reform, as legislators have been generally reluctant to tamper with the highly technical system of Quranic shares. Some reforms have faced strong conservative opposition. For example, the 1979 reform of Egyptian family law, promulgated by Anwar Sadat through presidential decree, provoked an outcry and was annulled in 1985 by the supreme court on procedural grounds, to be later replaced by a compromise version. The 2003 reform of Moroccan family law, which sought to reconcile universal human rights norms and the country's Islamic heritage, was drafted by a commission that included parliamentarians, religious scholars and feminist activists, and the result has been praised by international rights groups as an example of progressive legislation achieved within an Islamic framework.\nIslamization.\nThe Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought the topic of Sharia to international attention in the form of numerous political campaigns in the Muslim world calling for full implementation of Sharia. A number of factors have contributed to the rise of these movements, classified under the rubric of Islamism or political Islam, including the failure of authoritarian secular regimes to meet the expectations of their citizens, and a desire of Muslim populations to return to more culturally authentic forms of socio-political organization in the face of a perceived cultural invasion from the West. Shiite leaders such as Ayatollah Khomeini drew on leftist anticolonialist rhetoric by framing their call for Sharia as a resistance struggle. They accused secular leaders of corruption and predatory behavior, and claimed that a return to Sharia would replace despotic rulers with pious leaders striving for social and economic justice. In the Arab world these positions are often encapsulated in the slogan \"Islam is the solution\" (\"al-Islam huwa al-hall\").\nFull implementation of Sharia theoretically refers to expanding its scope to all fields of law and all areas of public life. In practice, Islamization campaigns have focused on a few highly visible issues associated with the conservative Muslim identity, particularly women's hijab and the \"hudud\" criminal punishments (whipping, stoning and amputation) prescribed for certain crimes. For many Islamists, \"hudud\" punishments are at the core of the divine Sharia because they are specified by the letter of scripture rather than by human interpreters. Modern Islamists have often rejected, at least in theory, the stringent procedural constraints developed by classical jurists to restrict their application. To the broader Muslim public, the calls for Sharia often represent, even more than any specific demands, a vague vision of their current economic and political situation being replaced by a \"just utopia\".\nA number of legal reforms have been made under the influence of these movements, starting from the 1970s when Egypt and Syria amended their constitutions to specify Sharia as the basis of legislation. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 represented a watershed for Shiism advocates, demonstrating that it was possible to replace a secular regime with a theocracy. Several countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, and some Nigerian states have incorporated hudud rules into their criminal justice systems, which, however, retained fundamental influences of earlier Westernizing reforms. In practice, these changes were largely symbolic, and aside from some cases brought to trial to demonstrate that the new rules were being enforced, hudud punishments tended to fall into disuse, sometimes to be revived depending on the local political climate. The supreme courts of Sudan and Iran have rarely approved verdicts of stoning or amputation, and the supreme courts of Pakistan and Nigeria have never done so. Nonetheless, Islamization campaigns have also had repercussions in several other areas of law, leading to curtailment of rights of women and religious minorities, and in the case of Sudan contributing to the breakout of a civil war.\nAdvocates of Islamization have often been more concerned with ideology than traditional jurisprudence and there is no agreement among them as to what form a modern Sharia-based \"Islamic state\" should take. This is particularly the case for the theorists of Islamic economics and Islamic finance, who have advocated both free-market and socialist economic models. The notion of \"Sharia-compliant\" finance has become an active area of doctrinal innovation and its development has had a major impact on business operations around the world.\nContemporary applications.\nAccording to human rights groups, some of the classical Sharia practices involve serious violations of basic human rights, gender equality and freedom of expression, and the practices of countries governed by Sharia are criticized. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (ECtHR) ruled in several cases that Sharia is \"incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy\". \"Human rights concept\" have been categorically excluded by the governments of countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia under Sharia, claiming that it belongs to secular and western values, while the Cairo conference by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation declared that human rights can only be respected if they are compatible with Islam.\nMuslim-majority countries.\nThe legal systems of most Muslim-majority countries can be classified as either secular or mixed. Sharia plays no role in secular legal systems. In mixed legal systems, Sharia rules are allowed to influence some national laws, which are codified and may be based on European or Indian models, and the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than the ulema (traditional Islamic scholars).\nSaudi Arabia and some other Persian Gulf states possess what may be called classical Sharia systems, where national law is largely uncodified and formally equated with Sharia, with ulema playing a decisive role in its interpretation. Iran has adopted some features of classical Sharia systems, while also maintaining characteristics of mixed systems, like codified laws and a parliament.\nConstitutional law.\nConstitutions of many Muslim-majority countries refer to Sharia as a source or the main source of law, though these references are not in themselves indicative of how much the legal system is influenced by Sharia, and whether the influence has a traditionalist or modernist character. The same constitutions usually also refer to universal principles such as democracy and human rights, leaving it up to legislators and the judiciary to work out how these norms are to be reconciled in practice. Conversely, some countries (e.g., Algeria), whose constitution does not mention Sharia, possess Sharia-based family laws. Nisrine Abiad identifies Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as states with \"strong constitutional consequences of Sharia \"on the organization and functioning of power\".\nFamily law.\nExcept for secular systems, Muslim-majority countries possess Sharia-based laws dealing with family matters (marriage, inheritance, etc.). These laws generally reflect influence of various modern-era reforms and tend to be characterized by ambiguity, with traditional and modernist interpretations often manifesting themselves in the same country, both in legislation and court decisions. In some countries (e.g., parts of Nigeria), people can choose whether to pursue a case in a Sharia or secular court.\nCriminal law.\nCountries in the Muslim world generally have criminal codes influenced by civil law or common law, and in some cases a combination of Western legal traditions. Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. In the course of Islamization campaigns, several countries (Libya, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mauritania, and Yemen) inserted Islamic criminal laws into their penal codes, which were otherwise based on Western models. In some countries only \"hudud\" penalties were added, while others also enacted provisions for \"qisas\" (law of retaliation) and \"diya\" (monetary compensation). Iran subsequently issued a new \"Islamic Penal Code\". The criminal codes of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to Islamic law, without specifying the penalties. Some Nigerian states have also enacted Islamic criminal laws. Laws in the Indonesian province of Aceh provide for application of discretionary (\"ta'zir\") punishments for violation of Islamic norms, but explicitly exclude \"hudud\" and \"qisas\". Brunei has been implementing a \"Sharia Penal Code\", which includes provisions for stoning and amputation, in stages since 2014. The countries where \"hudud\" penalties are legal do not use stoning and amputation routinely, and generally apply other punishments instead.\nProperty law.\nSharia recognizes the concept of \"haqq\". \"Haqq\" refers to personal rights of the individual and the right to generate and accumulate wealth. The various ways in which property can be acquired under Sharia are purchase, inheritance, bequest, physical or mental effort, \"diya\" and donations. Certain concepts relating to property under Sharia are \"Mulk\", \"Waqf\", \"Mawat\" and \"Motasarruf\".\nCourt procedures.\nSharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves. In Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have preserved traditional procedure in Sharia courts, trials are conducted solely by the judge, and there is no jury system. There is no pre-trial discovery process, and no cross-examination of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding precedents under the principle of \"stare decisis\", and unlike civil law, Sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes.\nThe rules of evidence in Sharia courts traditionally prioritize oral testimony, and witnesses must be Muslim. In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of Sharia, such as those found in Hanbali jurisprudence, which forms the basis of law in Saudi Arabia.\nEvidences / testimonies.\nIn Criminal cases: A confession, an oath, or the oral testimony of Muslim witnesses are the main evidence admissible in traditional sharia courts for hudud crimes, i.e., the religious crimes of adultery, fornication, rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, apostasy, drinking intoxicants and theft.\nAccording to classical jurisprudence, testimony must be from at least two free Muslim male witnesses, or one Muslim male and two Muslim females, who are not related parties and who are of sound mind and reliable character. Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, fornication or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some fiqhs allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male.\nForensic evidence (\"i.e.\", fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other circumstantial evidence may likewise rejected in hudud cases in favor of eyewitnesses in some modern interpretations. In the case of regulations that were part of local Malaysian legislation that did not go into effect, this could cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases. In Pakistan, DNA evidence is rejected in paternity cases on the basis of legislation that favors the presumption of children's legitimacy, while in sexual assault cases DNA evidence is regarded as equivalent to expert opinion and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nIn civil cases;Quran https:// recommends written financial contracts with reliable witnesses, although there is dispute about equality of female testimony.\nMarriage is solemnized as a written financial contract, in the presence of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice (Mahr) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman. The brideprice is considered by a Sharia court as a form of debt. Written contracts were traditionally considered paramount in Sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts. Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.\nIn commercial and civil contracts, such as those relating to exchange of merchandise, agreement to supply or purchase goods or property, and others, oral contracts and the testimony of Muslim witnesses historically triumphed over written contracts. Islamic jurists traditionally held that written commercial contracts may be forged. Timur Kuran states that the treatment of written evidence in religious courts in Islamic regions created an incentive for opaque transactions, and the avoidance of written contracts in economic relations. This led to a continuation of a \"largely oral contracting culture\" in Muslim-majority nations and communities.\nIn lieu of written evidence, oaths are traditionally accorded much greater weight; rather than being used simply to guarantee the truth of ensuing testimony, they are themselves used as evidence. Plaintiffs lacking other evidence to support their claims may demand that defendants take an oath swearing their innocence, refusal thereof can result in a verdict for the plaintiff. Taking an oath for Muslims can be a grave act; one study of courts in Morocco found that lying litigants would often \"maintain their testimony right up to the moment of oath-taking and then to stop, refuse the oath, and surrender the case.\" Accordingly, defendants are not routinely required to swear before testifying, which would risk casually profaning the Quran should the defendant commit perjury.\nDiya.\nIn classical jurisprudence monetary compensation for bodily harm (\"diya\" or blood money) is assessed differently for different classes of victims. For example, for Muslim women the amount was half that assessed for a Muslim man. \"Diya\" for the death of a free Muslim man is twice as high as for Jewish and Christian victims according to the Maliki and Hanbali madhhabs and three times as high according to Shafi'i rules. Several legal schools assessed \"diya\" for Magians (\"majus\") at one-fifteenth the value of a free Muslim male.\nModern countries which incorporate classical \"diya\" rules into their legal system treat them in different ways. The Pakistan Penal Code modernized the Hanafi doctrine by eliminating distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims. In Iran, \"diya\" for non-Muslim victims professing one of the faiths protected under the constitution (Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians) was made equal to \"diya\" for Muslims in 2004, though according to a 2006 US State Department report, the penal code still discriminates against other religious minorities and women. According to Human Rights Watch and the US State Department, in Saudi Arabia Jewish or Christian male plaintiffs are entitled to half the amount a Muslim male would receive, while for all other non-Muslim males the proportion is one-sixteenth.\nRole of fatwas.\nThe spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world has displaced traditional muftis from their historical role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts. Instead, fatwas have increasingly served to advise the general public on other aspects of Sharia, particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life. Modern fatwas deal with topics as diverse as insurance, sex-change operations, moon exploration and beer drinking. Most Muslim-majority states have established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas, and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population. State-employed muftis generally promote a vision of Islam that is compatible with state law of their country.\nModern public and political fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world and beyond. Ayatollah Khomeini's proclamation condemning Salman Rushdie to death for his novel \"The Satanic Verses\" is credited with bringing the notion of fatwa to world's attention, although some scholars have argued that it did not qualify as one. Together with later militant fatwas, it has contributed to the popular misconception of the fatwa as a religious death warrant.\nModern fatwas have been marked by an increased reliance on the process of \"ijtihad\", i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (\"taqlid\"), and some of them are issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti. The most notorious examples are the fatwas of militant extremists. When Osama bin Laden and his associates issued a fatwa in 1998 proclaiming \"jihad against Jews and Crusaders\", many Islamic jurists, in addition to denouncing its content, stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or proclaim a jihad. New forms of ijtihad have also given rise to fatwas that support such notions as gender equality and banking interest, which are at variance with classical jurisprudence.\nIn the internet age, a large number of websites provide fatwas in response to queries from around the world, in addition to radio shows and satellite television programs offering call-in fatwas. Erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals in recent times have sometimes given rise to complaints about a \"chaos\" in the modern practice of issuing fatwas. There exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An International Islamic Fiqh Academy was created by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, but its legal opinions are not binding. The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of different muftis or heed their rulings in real life.\nRole of \"hisba\".\nThe classical doctrine of \"hisba\", associated with the Quranic injunction of \"enjoining good and forbidding wrong\", refers to the duty of Muslims to promote moral rectitude and intervene when another Muslim is acting wrongly. Historically, its legal implementation was entrusted to a public official called \"muhtasib\" (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud, disturbance of public order and infractions against public morality. This office disappeared in the modern era everywhere in the Muslim world, but it was revived in Arabia by the first Saudi state, and later instituted as a government committee responsible for supervising markets and public order. It has been aided by volunteers enforcing attendance of daily prayers, gender segregation in public places, and a conservative notion of hijab. Committee officers were authorized to detain violators before a 2016 reform. With the rising international influence of Wahhabism, the conception of \"hisba\" as an individual obligation to police religious observance has become more widespread, which led to the appearance of activists around the world who urge fellow Muslims to observe Islamic rituals, dress code, and other aspects of Sharia.\nIn Iran, \"hisba\" was enshrined in the constitution after the 1979 Revolution as a \"universal and reciprocal duty\", incumbent upon both the government and the people. Its implementation has been carried out by official committees as well as volunteer forces (\"basij\"). Elsewhere, policing of various interpretations of Sharia-based public morality has been carried out by the Kano State Hisbah Corps in the Nigerian state of Kano, by \"Wilayatul Hisbah\" in the Aceh province of Indonesia, by the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice in the Gaza Strip, and by the Taliban during their 1996\u20132001 and 2021\u2013present rule of Afghanistan. Religious police organizations tend to have support from conservative currents of public opinion, but their activities are often disliked by other segments of the population, especially liberals, urban women, and younger people.\nIn Egypt, a law based on the doctrine of hisba had for a time allowed a Muslim to sue another Muslim over beliefs that may harm society, though because of abuses it has been amended so that only the state prosecutor may bring suit based on private requests. Before the amendment was passed, a hisba suit brought by a group of Islamists against the liberal theologian Nasr Abu Zayd on charges of apostasy led to the annulment of his marriage. The law was also invoked in an unsuccessful blasphemy suit against the feminist author Nawal El Saadawi. Hisba has also been invoked in several Muslim-majority countries as rationale for blocking pornographic content on the internet and for other forms of faith-based censorship.\nMuslim-minority countries.\nSharia also plays a role beyond religious rituals and personal ethics in some countries with Muslim minorities. For example, in Israel Sharia-based family laws are administered for the Muslim population by the Ministry of Justice through the Sharia Courts. In India, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act provides for the use of Islamic law for Muslims in several areas, mainly related to family law. In England, the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal makes use of Sharia family law to settle disputes, though this limited adoption of Sharia is controversial.\nSupport and opposition.\nSupport.\nA 2013 survey based on interviews of 38,000 Muslims, randomly selected from urban and rural parts in 39 countries using area probability designs, by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that a majority\u2014in some cases \"overwhelming\" majority\u2014of Muslims in a number of countries support making \"Sharia\" or \"Islamic law\" the law of the land, including Afghanistan (99%), Iraq (91%), Niger (86%), Malaysia (86%), Pakistan (84%), Morocco (83%), Bangladesh (82%), Egypt (74%), Indonesia (72%), Jordan (71%), Uganda (66%), Ethiopia (65%), Mali (63%), Ghana (58%), and Tunisia (56%). In Muslim regions of Southern-Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the support is less than 50%: Russia (42%), Kyrgyzstan (35%), Tajikistan (27%), Kosovo (20%), Albania (12%), Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%), Azerbaijan (8%). Regional averages of support were 84% in South Asia, 77% in Southeast Asia, 74% in the Middle-East/North Africa, 64%, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 18% in Southern-Eastern Europe, and 12% in Central Asia.\nHowever, while most of those who support implementation of Sharia favor using it in family and property disputes, fewer supported application of severe punishments such as whippings and cutting off hands, and interpretations of some aspects differed widely. According to the Pew poll, among Muslims who support making Sharia the law of the land, most do not believe that it should be applied to non-Muslims. In the Muslim-majority countries surveyed this proportion varied between 74% (of 74% in Egypt) and 19% (of 10% in Kazakhstan), as percentage of those who favored making Sharia the law of the land.\nIn all of the countries surveyed, respondents were more likely to define Sharia as \"the revealed word of God\" rather than as \"a body of law developed by men based on the word of God\". In analyzing the poll, Amaney Jamal has argued that there is no single, shared understanding of the notions \"Sharia\" and \"Islamic law\" among the respondents. In particular, in countries where Muslim citizens have little experience with rigid application of Sharia-based state laws, these notions tend to be more associated with Islamic ideals like equality and social justice than with prohibitions. Other polls have indicated that for Egyptians, the word \"Sharia\" is associated with notions of political, social and gender justice.\nIn 2008, Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has suggested that Islamic and Orthodox Jewish courts should be integrated into the British legal system alongside ecclesiastical courts to handle marriage and divorce, subject to agreement of all parties and strict requirements for protection of equal rights for women. His reference to the Sharia sparked a controversy. Later that year, Nicholas Phillips, then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, stated that there was \"no reason why Sharia principles [...] should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution.\" A 2008 YouGov poll in the United Kingdom found 40% of Muslim students interviewed supported the introduction of Sharia into British law for Muslims. Michael Broyde, professor of law at Emory University specializing in alternative dispute resolution and Jewish law, has argued that Sharia courts can be integrated into the American religious arbitration system, provided that they adopt appropriate institutional requirements as American rabbinical courts have done.\nOpposition.\nIn the Western world, Sharia has been called a source of \"hysteria\", \"more controversial than ever\", the one aspect of Islam that inspires \"particular dread\". On the Internet, \"dozens of self-styled counter-jihadis\" emerged to campaign against Sharia law, describing it in strict interpretations resembling those of Salafi Muslims. Also, fear of Sharia law and of the ideology of extremism among Muslims as well as certain congregations donating money to terrorist organizations within the Muslim community reportedly spread to mainstream conservative Republicans in the United States. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich won ovations calling for a federal ban on Sharia law.\nThe issue of \"liberty versus Sharia\" was called a \"momentous civilisational debate\" by right-wing pundit Diana West.\nIn 2008 in Britain, the future Prime Minister (David Cameron) declared his opposition to \"any expansion of Sharia law in the UK.\" In Germany, in 2014, the Interior Minister (Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re) told a newspaper (\"Bild\"), \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil.\"\nSome countries and jurisdictions have explicit bans on Sharia law. In Canada, for example, sharia law has been explicitly banned in Quebec by a 2005 unanimous vote of the National Assembly, while the province of Ontario allows family law disputes to be arbitrated only under Ontario law. In the U.S., opponents of Sharia have sought to ban it from being considered in courts, where it has been routinely used alongside traditional Jewish and Catholic laws to decide legal, business, and family disputes subject to contracts drafted with reference to such laws, as long as they do not violate secular law or the U.S. constitution. After failing to gather support for a federal law making observing Sharia a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison, anti-Sharia activists have focused on state legislatures. By 2014, bills aimed against use of Sharia have been introduced in 34 states and passed in 11. A notable example of this would be 2010 Oklahoma State Question 755, which sought to permanently ban the use of Sharia law in courts. While approved by voters, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals placed an injunction on the law. Citing the unconstitutionality of the law's impartial focus on a specific religion, the law was struck down and never took effect. These bills have generally referred to banning foreign or religious law in order to thwart legal challenges.\nAccording to Jan Michiel Otto, Professor of Law and Governance in Developing Countries at Leiden University, \"[a]nthropological research shows that people in local communities often do not distinguish clearly whether and to what extent their norms and practices are based on local tradition, tribal custom, or religion. Those who adhere to a confrontational view of Sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to Sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture, even if high-ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite.\"\nContemporary debates and controversies.\nCompatibility with democracy.\nIt has been argued that the extent to which Sharia is compatible with democracy depends on how it is culturally interpreted, with a cultural position that Sharia represents the human attempt to interpret God's message associated with a greater preference for democracy than an Islamist interpretation that Sharia law is the literal word of God.\nGeneral Muslim views.\nScholars John Esposito and Natana J. DeLong-Bas distinguish four attitudes toward Sharia and democracy prominent among contemporary Muslims:\nAccording to Polls conducted by Gallup and Pew Research Center in Muslim-majority countries, most Muslims see no contradiction between democratic values and religious principles, desiring neither theocracy nor a secular democracy but rather a political model where democratic institutions and values can coexist with the values and principles of Sharia.\nIslamic political theories.\nMuslih and Browers identify three major perspectives on democracy among prominent Muslim thinkers who have sought to develop modern, distinctly Islamic theories of socio-political organization conforming to Islamic values and law:\nEuropean Court of Human Rights.\nIn 1998, the Constitutional Court of Turkey banned and dissolved Turkey's Refah Party over its announced intention to introduce Sharia-based laws, ruling that it would change Turkey's secular order and undermine democracy. On appeal by Refah the European Court of Human Rights determined that \"sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy\". Refah's Sharia-based notion of a \"plurality of legal systems, grounded on religion\" was ruled to contravene the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was determined that it would \"do away with the State's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms\" and \"infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy\". In an analysis, Maurits S. Berger found the ruling to be \"nebulous\" and surprising from a legal point of view, since the Court neglected to define what it meant by \"Sharia\" and would not, for example, be expected to regard Sharia rules for Islamic rituals as contravening European human rights values. Kevin Boyle also criticized the decision for not distinguishing between extremist and mainstream interpretations of Islam and implying that peaceful advocacy of Islamic doctrines (\"an attitude which fails to respect [the principle of secularism]\") is not protected by the European Convention provisions for freedom of religion.\nCompatibility with freedom of religion.\nApostasy.\nAccording to Islam, religious conversion away from Islam (apostasy from Islam) is a sin, while \"there is no compulsion in religion\". \nA number of liberal and progressive Islamic scholars have argued that apostasy should not be viewed as a crime.\nOthers argue that the death penalty is an inappropriate punishment, inconsistent with the Qur'anic verses such as Al-Baqara 256 containing \"no compulsion in religion\"; or that it was a man-made rule enacted in the early Islamic community to prevent and punish the equivalent of desertion or treason. According to Khaled Abou El Fadl, some Muslims do not believe that apostasy requires punishment. Typically there is a waiting period to allow time to repent and to return to Islam.\nEarly Islamic jurists set the standard for apostasy from Islam so high that practically no apostasy verdict could be passed before the 11th century, but later jurists lowered the bar for applying the death penalty, allowing judges to interpret the apostasy law in different ways, which they did sometimes leniently and sometimes strictly. In the late 19th century, criminal penalties for apostasy fell into disuse, although civil penalties were still applied. Wael Hallaq writes that \"[in] a culture whose lynchpin is religion, religious principles and religious morality, apostasy is in some way equivalent to high treason in the modern nation-state\". Some Islamic jurists continue to regard apostasy as a crime deserving the death penalty.\nSome Sharia interpreters believe apostasy should be enforced only if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder (\"fitna\").\nTwenty-three Muslim-majority countries, as of 2013[ [update]], penalized apostasy from Islam through their criminal laws.\nAs of 2014[ [update]], apostasy from Islam was a capital offense in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In other countries, Sharia courts could use family laws to void the Muslim apostate's marriage and to deny child-custody rights as well as inheritance rights. In the years 1985\u20132006, four individuals were legally executed for apostasy from Islam: \"one in Sudan in 1985; two in Iran, in 1989 and 1998; and one in Saudi Arabia in 1992.\" While modern states have rarely prosecuted apostasy, Islamists have tended to exploit apostasy for political gain. In a 2008\u20132012 Pew Research Center poll, public support for capital punishment for apostasy among Muslims ranged from 78% in Afghanistan to less than 1% in Kazakhstan, reaching over 50% in 6 of the 20 countries surveyed.\nSome Sharia courts have limited the freedom of religion for Muslims.\nThe death penalty or other punishment for apostasy in Islam is a violation of universal human rights, and an issue of freedom of religion and conscience.\nCompatibility with human rights.\nGovernments of several predominantly Muslim countries have criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-Western countries. Iran declared in the UN assembly that UDHR was \"a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law. Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as the imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and Islam. In 1990, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, a group representing all Muslim-majority nations, met in Cairo to respond to the UDHR, then adopted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam.\nAnn Elizabeth Mayer points to notable absences from the Cairo Declaration: provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association, and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Article 24 of the Cairo declaration states that \"all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic \"shari'a\"\".\nIn 2009, the journal \"Free Inquiry\" summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: \"We are deeply concerned with the changes to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by a coalition of Islamic states within the United Nations that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters\u2014in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam.\"\nH. Patrick Glenn states that Sharia is structured around the concept of mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women and non-Islamic people). Bassam Tibi states that the Sharia framework and human rights are incompatible. Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that Sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish \"Sharia\" from \"siyasah\" (politics).\nLGBTQ rights.\nHomosexual intercourse is illegal in classical Sharia, with different penalties, including capital punishment, stipulated depending on the situation and legal school. In pre-modern Islam, the penalties prescribed for homosexual acts were \"to a large extent theoretical\" according to the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", owing in part to stringent procedural requirements for their harsher (\"hudud\") forms and in part to prevailing social tolerance toward same-sex relationships. Historical instances of prosecution for homosexual acts are rare, and those which followed Sharia rules are even rarer. Public attitudes toward homosexuality in the Muslim world turned more negative starting from the 19th century through the gradual spread of Islamic fundamentalist movements such as Salafism and Wahhabism, and under the influence of sexual notions prevalent in Europe at that time. A number of Muslim-majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under colonial rule. In recent decades, prejudice against LGBT individuals in the Muslim world has been exacerbated by increasingly conservative attitudes and the rise of Islamist movements, resulting in Sharia-based penalties enacted in several countries. The death penalty for homosexual acts is currently a legal punishment in Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, some northern states in Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, parts of Somalia, and Yemen, all of which have Sharia-based criminal laws. It is unclear whether the laws of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates provide for the death penalty for gay sex, \"as they have never been carried out\". Criminalization of consensual homosexual acts and especially making them liable to capital punishment has been condemned by international rights groups. According to polls, the level of social acceptance for homosexuality ranges from 52% among Muslims in the U.S. to less than 10% in a number of Muslim-majority nations.\nWomen.\nPersonal status and child marriage.\nSharia is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic-majority nations. These personal status laws determine rights of women in matters of marriage, divorce, and child custody. A 2011 UNICEF report mentions that Sharia law provisions differ for women in financial matters from general human rights provisions. In many countries, in legal proceedings relating to Sharia-based personal status law, in financial cases, a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's before a court.\nThe 1917 codification of Islamic family law in the Ottoman Empire distinguished between the age of competence for marriage, which was set at 18 for boys and 17 for girls, and the minimum age for marriage, which followed the traditional Hanafi limits of 12 for boys and 9 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century, most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13\u201316 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.\nProperty rights.\nIslamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, such as property rights which women in the West did not possess until \"comparatively recent times\". Starting with the 20th century, Western legal systems evolved to expand women's rights, but women's rights in the Muslim world have to varying degree remained tied to the Quran, hadiths and their traditional interpretations by Islamic jurists. Sharia grants women the right to inherit property from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran. A woman's inheritance can be unequal if she inherits from her father, as daughters inherit half as much as their brothers.[Quran https://]\nDomestic violence.\nJonathan A.C. Brown says:\nThe vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, Ata' bin Abi Rabah, counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. Darimi, a teacher of both Tirmidhi and Muslim bin Hajjaj as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even Ibn Hajar, the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.\nThe Surah 4:34, in the Quran, has been debated for domestic violence and also has been subject to varied interpretations. According to some interpretations, Sharia condones certain forms of domestic violence against women, when a husband suspects \"nushuz\" (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife only after admonishing and staying away from the bed does not work. These interpretations have been criticized as inconsistent with women's rights in domestic abuse cases. Musawah, CEDAW, KAFA and other organizations have proposed ways to modify Sharia-inspired laws to improve women's rights in Muslim-majority nations, including women's rights in domestic abuse cases.\nOthers believe that wife-beating is not consistent with a more modernist perspective of the Quran. Many Imams and scholars who learned Shariah in traditional Islamic seminaries object to the misuse of this verse to justify domestic violence. Muslims for White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 2010 with Imams and Muslim leaders committing to join with others to work to end violence against women. Khutbah campaigns were held in many parts of the world to speak out against domestic violence and encourage Muslim congregants to eradicate domestic abuse.\nRape.\nRape is considered a serious crime in the Sharia law since the Islamic prophet Muhammad ordered rapists to be punished by stoning according to the Hadith. The terms \"ghasaba\" and \"ightasaba\" have been used by traditional jurists when discussing sexual assault and its punishment. Imam Al-Sh\u0101fi'\u012b defined rape as: \"Forcing a woman to commit zin\u0101 against her will\". To the \u1e24anafis, illegal intercourse is considered rape when there is no consent and no deliberate action from the victim. In M\u0101lik's view, rape refers to any kind of unlawful sexual intercourse by usurpation and without consent. This includes instances when the condition of the victims prevents them from expressing their resistance, such as insanity, sleep, or being underage. The Hanbalis, similar to the M\u0101likis, consider the use of any kind of force as a denial of consent from the victim. The threat of starvation or suffering the cold of winter is also regarded as being against one's will.\nSlavery.\nSharia authorized the institution of slavery, using the words \"abd\" (slave) and the phrase \"ma malakat aymanukum\" (\"that which your right hand owns\") to refer to women slaves seized as captives of war. Under Islamic law, Muslim men could have sexual relations with female captives and slaves. Sharia, in Islam's history, provided a religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women and men but allowed for the manumission of slaves. A slave woman who bore a child to her Muslim master (\"umm al-walad\") could not be sold, becoming legally free upon her master's death and the child was considered free and a legitimate heir of the father.\nTerrorism.\nSome extremists have used their interpretation of Islamic scriptures and Sharia, in particular the doctrine of jihad, to justify acts of war and terror against Muslim as well as non-Muslim individuals and governments. The expert on terrorism Rachel Ehrenfeld wrote that the \"Sharia's finance (Islamic banking) is a new weapon in the arsenal of what might be termed fifth-generation warfare (5GW)\". However, Sharia-compliant financing actually requires a person to stay away from weapons manufacturing.\nIn classical fiqh, the term \"jihad\" refers to armed struggle against oppressors. Classical jurists developed an elaborate set of rules pertaining to jihad, including prohibitions on harming those who are not engaged in combat. According to Bernard Lewis, \"[a]t no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism\" and the terrorist practice of suicide bombing \"has no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law or tradition\". In the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse. While modernist Islamic scholars have emphasized defensive and non-military aspects of jihad, some radicals have advanced aggressive interpretations that go beyond the classical theory. For al-Qaeda ideologues, in jihad, all means are legitimate, including targeting Muslim non-combatants and the mass killing of non-Muslim civilians.\nSome modern ulema, such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Sulaiman Al-Alwan, have supported attacks against Israeli army reservists and hence should be considered soldiers, while Hamid bin Abdallah al-Ali declared that suicide attacks in Chechnya were justified as a \"sacrifice\". Many prominent Islamic scholars, including al-Qaradawi himself, have issued condemnations of terrorism in general terms. For example, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia has stated that \"terrorizing innocent people [...] constitute[s] a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by Islam\", while Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, Grand Imam of al-Azhar and former Grand Mufti of Egypt has stated that \"attacking innocent people is not courageous; it is stupid and will be punished on the Day of Judgment\".\nBlasphemy.\nIn classical fiqh, blasphemy refers to any form of cursing, questioning, or annoying God, Muhammad or anything considered sacred in Islam, including denying one of the Islamic prophets or scriptures, insulting an angel or refusing to accept a religious commandment. Jurists of different schools prescribed different punishments for blasphemy against Islam by Muslims and non-Muslims, ranging from imprisonment or fines to the death penalty. In some cases, Sharia allows non-Muslims to escape death by converting and becoming a devout follower of Islam. In the modern Muslim world, the laws pertaining to blasphemy vary by country, and some countries prescribe punishments consisting of fines, imprisonment, flogging, hanging, or beheading.\nBlasphemy laws were rarely enforced in pre-modern Islamic societies, but in the modern era, some states and radical groups have used charges of blasphemy to burnish their religious credentials and gain popular support at the expense of liberal Muslim intellectuals and religious minorities.\nBlasphemy, as interpreted under Sharia, is controversial. Representatives of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation have petitioned the United Nations to condemn \"defamation of religions\" because \"Unrestricted and disrespectful freedom of opinion creates hatred and is contrary to the spirit of peaceful dialogue\". The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam subjects free speech to unspecified Sharia restrictions: Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that \"Everyone shall have the right to express his opinion freely in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the Shariah.\" Others, in contrast, consider blasphemy laws to violate freedom of speech, stating that freedom of expression is essential to empowering both Muslims and non-Muslims, and point to the abuse of blasphemy laws in prosecuting members of religious minorities, political opponents, and settling personal scores. In Pakistan, blasphemy laws have been used to convict more than a thousand people, about half of them Ahmadis and Christians. While none have been legally executed, two Pakistani politicians, Shahbaz Bhatti and Salmaan Taseer, have been assassinated over their criticism of the blasphemy laws. The Pakistani blasphemy laws are based upon colonial-era legislation, which made it a \"crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship\", with these laws being modified between 1980 and 1986 by the military government of General Zia-ul Haq to make them more severe. A number of clauses were added by the government in order to \"Islamicise\" the laws and deny the Muslim character of the Ahmadi minority.\nComparison with other legal systems.\nJewish law.\nIslamic legal tradition has a number of parallels with Judaism. In both religions, revealed law holds a central place, in contrast to Christianity which does not possess a body of revealed law, and where theology rather than law is considered to be the principal field of religious study. Both Islamic and Jewish law (\"Halakha\") are derived from formal textual revelations (Quran and Pentateuch) as well as less formal, orally transmitted prophetic traditions (\"hadith\" and \"mishna\"). According to some scholars, the words \"sharia\" and \"halakha\" both mean literally \"the path to follow\". The \"fiqh\" literature parallels rabbinical law developed in the Talmud, with fatwas being analogous to rabbinic \"responsa\".\nHowever, the emphasis on \"qiyas\" in classical Sunni legal theory is both more explicitly permissive than Talmudic law with respect to authorizing individual reason as a source of law, and more implicitly restrictive, in excluding other, unauthorized forms of reasoning.\nCommon law systems.\nEarly Islamic law developed a number of legal concepts that anticipated similar such concepts that later appeared in English common law. Similarities exist between the royal English contract protected by the action of debt and the Islamic \"Aqd\", between the English assize of novel disseisin and the Islamic \"Istihqaq\", and between the English jury and the Islamic \"Lafif\" in classical Maliki jurisprudence. The law schools known as Inns of Court also parallel Madrasahs. The methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy (\"Qiyas\") are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems, as are the English trust and agency institutions to the Islamic \"Waqf\" and \"Hawala\" institutions, respectively.\nElements of Islamic law also have other parallels in Western legal systems. For example, the influence of Islam on the development of an international law of the sea can be discerned alongside that of the Roman influence. George Makdisi has argued that the madrasa system of attestation paralleled the legal scholastic system in the West, which gave rise to the modern university system. The triple status of \"faqih\" (\"master of law\"), \"mufti\" (\"professor of legal opinions\") and \"mudarris\" (\"teacher\"), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms \"magister\", \"professor\" and \"doctor\", respectively, although they all came to be used synonymously in both East and West.\nMakdisi suggested that the medieval European doctorate, \"licentia docendi\" was modeled on the Islamic degree \"ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta\", of which it is a word-for-word translation, with the term \"ifta\"' (issuing of fatwas) omitted. He also argued that these systems shared fundamental freedoms: the freedom of a professor to profess his personal opinion and the freedom of a student to pass judgement on what he is learning.\nThere are differences between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, Sharia classically recognizes only natural persons, and never developed the concept of a legal person, or corporation, i.e., a legal entity that limits the liabilities of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives. Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting. Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have played a significant role in retarding economic development in the Middle East. However, the rise of monopoly wealth and corporations have proven to also be detrimental to the economic equality of a society. Ziauddin Sardar also suggests that the promotion of equitable wealth distribution and suppression of monopoly capital are a part of Islam's message that emphasises genuine equity and justice.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For Muslims, the sunnah is what all the Muslims of Muhammad's time supposedly saw, followed, and passed on to the next generations. However, what constitutes the Sunnah, and its interpretation,\u00a0depends significantly on the specific Islamic sect and school of thought. Sunnis rely on six major canonical hadith collections to document the Sunnah, known as \"Kutub al-Sittah\". For Shias, the sunnah is generally documented in \"Kutub al-'Arba'a\", which give preference to hadiths attributed to the Prophet's family (\"Ahl al-Bayt\") and the Twelve Imams. For Ibadis, the sunnah is documented in the two hadith collections \"Jami Sahih\" and \"Tartib al-Musnad\". Sufis hold that Muhammad transmitted his sunnah, including his spiritual values, \"through a series of Sufi teachers\". \nAccording to classical Islamic theories, the sunnah is embodied in the hadith: verbally transmitted records of the teachings, actions, deeds, and sayings, attributed to Muhammad. Alongside the Qur'an, the Hadith contains the divine revelations (\"wahy\") delivered through Muhammad that make up the primary sources of Islamic law, beliefs, and theology. The sunnah is classified into different types based on Muhammad's specific words (), his actions such as habits and practices (), and silent approvals (). However, some Muslims, such as \"Ahl al-Kalam\" and the Mu'tazilites, have distinguished between the\u00a0Sunnah\u00a0and\u00a0Hadith, accepting the Sunnah as an authoritative practice while being critical of the Hadith's reliability as a source for Islamic law. The Quranist stance on the Sunnah varies from\u00a0outright rejection to an approach that considers external sources as\u00a0secondary and dependent on the Qur'an\u00a0for verification.\nHistorically, in pre-Islamic Arabia, the term referred to 'manner of acting', (Urf) whether good or bad and recording of it was also an Arab tradition. Later, \"good traditions\" began to be referred to as sunnah and the concept of \"Muhammad's sunnah\" was established. During the early Islamic period, it included precedents set by both Muhammad, and his companions. In addition, the sunnah of Muhammad was not necessarily associated with hadith. The strict focus of Muhammad\u2019s example\u2014especially as recorded in hadith\u2014as the only authoratative source of \"sunnah\" was established later, particularly by the scholar Al-Shafi\u2018i (d. 820 CE), in the late second century of Islam. The term (, lit.\u2009'the Sunnah') then eventually came to be viewed as synonymous with the sunnah of Muhammad, based on hadith reports, distinct from other practices.\nDefinitions and usage.\n' ( ; pl.: ' ) is an Arabic word that means: \nIts religious definition can be:\nIslam Web gives two slightly different definitions:\nIt was first used with the meaning of \"law\" in the Syro-Roman law book before it became widely used in Islamic jurisprudence.\nSunnah and hadith.\nIn the context of biographical records of Muhammad, sunnah often stands synonymous with hadith since most of the personality traits of Muhammad are known from descriptions of him, his sayings and his actions from hadith. According to Seyyed Nasr, the hadith contains the words of Muhammad, while the sunnah contains his words and actions along with pre-Islamic practices of which he approved. In the context of sharia, Malik ibn Anas and the Hanafi scholars are assumed to have differentiated between the two: for example Malik is said to have rejected some traditions that reached him because, according to him, they were against the \"established practice of the people of Medina\".\n\"Sunnah Salat\".\nIn addition to being \"the way\" of Islam or the traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community, sunnah is often used as a synonym for (encouraged) rather than / (obligatory), regarding some commendable action (usually the saying of a prayer).\n\"Ahl as-Sunnah\".\nSunni Muslims are also referred to as (\"people of the tradition and the community (of Muhammad)\") or for short. Some early Sunn\u00ee Muslim scholars (such as Abu Hanifa, al-Humayd\u00ee, Ibn Ab\u00ee '\u00c2sim, Ab\u00fb D\u00e2w\u00fbd, and Ab\u00fb Nasr al-Marwaz\u00ee) reportedly used the term \"the sunnah\" narrowly to refer to Sunni Doctrine as opposed to the creeds of Shia and other non-Sunni Islamic sects. Sunnah literally means \"face\", \"nature\", \"lifestyle\", etc. In the time of Muhammad's companion, newly converted Muslims accepted and rejected some set of creed by using reason. So many early Muslim scholars started writing books on creed entitled as \"sunnah\".\nIn the Quran.\nThe word \"sunna\" appears several times in the Qur'an, but there is no specific mention of sunnah of the messenger or prophet (, or ), i.e. the way/practice of Muhammad (there are several verses calling on Muslims to obey Muhammad\u2014see below). Four verses (8.38, 15.13, 18.55) use the expression \"\", which is thought to mean \"the way or practice of the ancients\". It is described as something \"that has passed away\" or prevented unbelievers from accepting God. \"\" (the \"way of God\") appears eight times in five verses. In addition, verse 17.77 talks of both the way of other, earlier Muslim messengers (Ibrahim, Musa, etc.), and of \"our way\", i.e. God's way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[This is] the way (\"sunna\") of those whom we sent [as messengers] before you, and you will not find any change in Our way (\"sunnatuna\").\nThis indicates to some scholars (such as Javed Ahmad Ghamidi) that sunnah predates both the Quran and Muhammad, and is actually the tradition of the prophets of God, specifically the tradition of Abraham. Christians, Jews and the Arab descendants of Ishmael, the Arabized Arabs or Ishmaelites, when Muhammad reinstituted this practice as an integral part of Islam.\nHistory and etymology.\nPrior to the \"golden age of classical Islamic jurisprudence\", the \"ancient schools\" of law prevailed.\nThe traditions not directly sourced from hadith or practice of Muhammad and instead traced solely to some Sahabah were also acknowledged as a source of jurisprudence. These were regarded by scholars of Islam \u2013 such as Nawawi \u2013 as \"unrecorded hadith\" which, while not explicitly attributed to Muhammad himself \u2013 were clearly practiced by the first generation of Muhammad's followers. Al-Nawawi has listed Zubayr ibn al-Awwam's ruling regarding ethics of sitting down during eating and drinking in his book, Riyadh as Shaliheen, by basing the ethic in az-Zubayr practice, which was narrated by his son, Abdulah. Another manners and ethic ruling based on az-Zubayr is the prohibition of sleeping after S\u00fcbuh, as well as the one concerning the ethics of sitting down while drinking.\nOther examples of this kind of \"sunnah\" also include:\nAccording to historians (particularly Daniel W. Brown), the classical Islamic definition of sunnah as the customs and practices of Muhammad (only) was not the original one.\nIn al-\u1e6cabar\u012b's history of early Islam, the term \"Sunnah of the Prophet\" is not only used \"surprisingly infrequently\", but used to refer to \"political oaths or slogans used by rebels\", or \"a general standard of justice and right conduct\", and not \"to specific precedents set by Muhammad\", let alone hadith. An early theological writing by Hasan al-Basri (\"Risala fi'l Qadar\") also is \"empty of references to specific cases\" when mentioning \"Sunnah of the Prophet\".\nDaniel Brown states that the first extant writings of Islamic legal reasoning were \"virtually hadith-free\" and argues that other examples of a lack of connection between sunnah and hadith can be found in:\nAccording to one source (Ahmad Kazemi Moussavi and Karim Douglas Crow), early Sunni scholars often considered sunnah equivalent to the biography of Muhammed (\"sira\"). As the hadith came to be better documented and the scholars who validated them gained prestige, the sunnah came often to be known mostly through the hadith, especially as variant or fictional biographies of Muhammad spread.\nFour Madhhabs.\nThe golden age, starting with the creation of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali, and other schools of fiqh in the second century of Islam, limited sunnah to \"traditions traced back to the Prophet Muhammad himself\" (\"sunna al-nabawiyyah\"). The ancient regional schools of law, located in several major cities of the new Arab empire of Islam, including Mecca, Kufa, Basra, and Syria, had a more flexible definition of sunnah than is now commonly used. This being the \"acceptable norms\" or \"custom\", which included examples of Muhammad's companions, the rulings of the Caliphs, and practices that \"had gained general acceptance among the jurists of that school\".\nAb\u016b \u02bfAbdull\u0101h Muhammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b (150\u2013204 AH), known as al-Shafi'i, argued against flexible sunnah and the use of precedents from multiple sources, emphasizing the final authority of a hadith of Muhammad, so that even the Qur'an was \"to be interpreted in the light of traditions (i.e. hadith), and not vice versa\". While the sunnah has often been called \"second to the Quran\", hadith has also been said to \"rule over and interpret the Quran\".\nAl-Shafi\u02bfi \"forcefully argued\" that the sunnah stands \"on equal footing with the Quran\" (according to scholar Daniel Brown), both being divine revelation. As Al-Shafi'i put it, \"the command of the Prophet is the command of God\" This, though, contradicts another point Shafi made, which was the sunnah was below the Quran.\nSunnah of Muhammad outranked all other, and \"broad agreement\" developed that \"hadith must be the basis for authentication of any sunnah\", (according to M. O. Farooq). Al-Shafi\u02bfi's success was such that later writers \"hardly ever thought of sunnah as comprising anything but that of the Prophet\".\nSystemization of hadith.\nWhile the earliest Muslim lawyers \"felt no obligation\" to provide documentation of hadith when arguing their case, and the sunnah was not recorded and written during Muhammad's lifetime, (according to scholar Khaled Abou El Fadl), all this changed with the triumph of al-Shafi'i and a \"broad agreement\" that hadith should be used to authenticate sunnah (according to M. O. Farooq), over the course of the second century, when legal works began incorporating Prophetic hadith.\nHadith was now systematically collected and documented, but several generations having passed since the time of its occurrence meant that \"many of the reports attributed to the Prophet are apocryphal or at least are of dubious historical authenticity\" (according to Abou El Fadl). \"In fact, one of the most complex disciplines in Islamic jurisprudence is one which attempts to differentiate between authentic and inauthentic traditions.\"\nClassical Islam.\nIslam jurists divide sunnah into that which has no legal consequences \u2013 \"al-sunna al-\u02bf\u0101d\u012byah\" (the \"personal habits and preferences\" of Muhammad); and that which is binding on Muslims \u2013 \"al-sunna al-hud\u0101\". The literalist Z\u0101hir\u012b school disagrees holding that there was no sunnah whose fulfillment is not rewarded or neglect punished, while classical Islam holds that following non-binding \"al-sunna al-\u02bf\u0101d\u012byah\" is meritorious but not obligatory.\nSufis see the \"division between binding and non-binding\" sunnah as \"meaningless\". Muhammad is \"al-ins\u0101n al-k\u0101mil\", the perfect man, \"labib-Allah\" beloved of God, an intercessor, a \"channel of divine light\". Imitating his every action is \"the ultimate expression\" of piety. or in the words of Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Know that the key to joy is following the sunnah and imitating the Prophet in all his comings and goings, words and deeds, extending to his manner of eating, rising, sleeping and speaking. I do not say this only in relation to requirements of religion [\"\u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t\"], for there is no escaping these; rather, this includes every area of behavior [\"\u02bf\u0101d\u0101t\"].\nModernist Islam.\nIn the 19th century, \"social and political turmoil\" starting with the decline of the Mughal Empire, caused some Muslims to seek a more humanized figure of Muhammad. The miracle-performing \"larger than life\" prophetic figure was de-emphasized in favor of \"a practical model for restoration of the Muslim community\", a virtuous, progressive social reformer. Nasserist Egypt, for example, celebrated the \"imam of socialism\" rather than the cosmic \"perfect man\". One who argued against the idea of sunnah as divine revelation, and for the idea that Muhammad's mission was simply to transmit the Quran was Ghulam Ahmed Perwez (1903\u20131985). He quoted the Quranic verse \"The messenger has no duty except to proclaim [the message]\" (Q.5:99), and pointed out several other verses where God corrects something Muhammad has done or said (8:67), (9:43), (66:1), thus demonstrating Muhammad's lack of supernatural knowledge.\nThis era of rapid social and technological change, decline of Muslim power, and replacement of classical madhhab by Western-inspired legal codes in Muslim lands, also suggested a turn away from the \"detailed precedents in civil and political affairs\", called for by traditional hadith, \"for if worldly matters require detailed prophetic guidance, then every age will require a new prophet to accommodate changing circumstances\".\nIslamic revivalism.\nWith de-colonialization in the late 20th century, a new Islamic revival emerged. Activists rather than theorists, they sought \"to restore Islam to ascendency\", and in particular to restore Sharia to the law of the lands of Islam it had been before being replaced by \"secular, Western-inspired law codes\" of colonialism and modernity. Like modernists, revivalists \"vehemently rejected\" \"taqlid\" and were not particularly interested in the classical schools of law (\"madhhab\"). But revivalists like Abul A'la Maududi and Mustafa al-Siba'i support for \"the authority of sunnah and the authenticity of hadith in general\" was \"unwavering\", as was their opposition to \"Hadith denialism\". At the same time they agreed that restoring relevant Sharia required \"some reformulation\" of the law, which would require a return to sources, which required agreement on how the sources were to be \"interpreted and understand\" and reassessment of hadith. This involved examining hadith content (\"matn\") for its spirit and relevance \"within the context of the Sharia as a whole\" according to the method of scholars of Islamic law (\"fuqaha\") and weeding out corrupted hadith inconsistent with \"reason, with human nature, and with historical conditions\". Shibli Nomani, Abul A'la Maududi, Rashid Rida, and Mohammed al-Ghazali being proponents of this effort.\nAlternatives to classical hadith-based sunnah.\nAlthough \"most writers agree\"\u2014including skeptics\u2014that \"sunnah and hadith must stand or fall together\", some (Fazlur Rahman Malik, Javed Ahmad Ghamidi) have attempted to \"establish a basis for sunnah independent of hadith\", working around the problem of hadithic authenticity raised by modernist and Western critics, while reaching back to a pre-al-Shafi\u02bfi meaning of sunnah.\n\"Living sunnah\".\nIn the 1960s, Fazlur Rahman Malik, an Islamic modernist and former head of Pakistan's Central Institute for Islamic Research, advanced the idea that the (prophetic) sunnah\u2014the normative example of Muhammad\u2014should be understood as \"a general umbrella concept,\" not one \"filled with absolutely specific content\" or that was static over the centuries. He argued that Muhammad had come as a \"moral reformer\" and not a \"pan-legit\", and that the specifics of the sunnah would be agreed upon community of his followers, evolving with changing times as a \"living and on-going process\". He accepted the criticism of Western and Muslim scholars that the content of many hadith and \"isnad\" (chain of transmitters) had been tampered with by Muslims trying to prove the Muhammad had made a specific statement\u2014but this did not make them fraudulent or forgeries, because if \"Hadith verbally speaking does not go back to the Prophet, its spirit certainly does\". Instead these collections of hadith of al-Bukhari and al-Muslim's were \"ijma\" (consensus or agreement of the Muslim scholars\u2014which is another classical source of Islamic law). Doing so, they follow the spirit of Muhammad's mission, and \"resurrect\" the legal methodology of the pre-Shafi'i \"Ancient schools\". But just as second and third century Muslims could re-formulate hadith and law around a prophetic spirit, so can modern Muslims\u2014redefining \"riba\" and replacing medieval laws against bank interest with measures that help the poor without harming economic productivity.\nSunnah from practice not hadith.\nSome of the most basic and important features of the sunnah \u2013 worship rituals like \"salat\" (ritual prayer), \"zakat\" (ritual tithing), \"hajj\" (pilgrimage to Mecca), \"sawm\" (dawn to dusk fasting during Ramadan) \u2013 are known to Muslim from being passed down 'from the many to the many' (according to scholars of fiqh such as Al-Shafi'i), bypassing books of hadith, (which were more often consulted for answers to details not agreed upon or not frequently practiced) and issues of authenticity.\nModernist Rashid Rida thought this \"the only source of sunnah that is beyond dispute\". S.M. Yusuf argued \"practice is best transmitted through practice\", and a more reliable way to establish sunnah than hadith. He also believed that the passing down of practice from generation to generation independent of hadith explained why early schools of law did not differentiate between sunnah of the caliphate and sunnah of the prophet.\nAccording to Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, another Modernist, this passing down by continuous practice of the Muslim community (which also indicates consensus, \"ijma\") was similar to how the Qur\u2019\u0101n has been \"received by the \"ummah\"\" (Muslim community) through the consensus of the Muhammad's companions and through their perpetual recitation. Consequently, Ghamidi sees this more limited sunnah of continuous practice as the true sunnah \u2013 equally authentic to the Quran, but shedding orthodox sunnah and avoiding problematic basis of the hadith.\n\"Inner states\".\nSufi thinkers \"emphasized personal spirituality and piety rather than the details of fiqh\".\nAccording to the view of some Sufi Muslims who incorporate both the outer and inner reality of Muhammad, the deeper and true sunnah are the noble characteristics and inner state of Muhammad \u2013 \"Khuluqin Azim\" or \"Exalted Character\". To them Muhammad's attitude, his piety, the quality of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by sunnah in Islam, rather than the external aspects alone. They argue that the external custom of Muhammad loses its meaning without the inner attitude and also many hadiths are simply custom of the Arabs, not something that is unique to Muhammad.\nBasis of importance.\nThe Qur'an contains numerous commands to follow Muhammad. Among the Quranic verses quoted as demonstrating the importance of hadith/sunnah to Muslims are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Say: Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.\nWhich appears in several verses: https://, https://, https://, https://\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Your fellow man is neither misguided nor astray. Nor does he speak of his own whims.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since We have sent you a messenger from among yourselves\u2014reciting to you Our revelations, purifying you, teaching you the Book and wisdom, and teaching you what you never knew\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.\nThe teachings of \"wisdom\" (\"hikma\") have been declared to be a function of Muhammad along with the teachings of the scripture. Several Quranic verses mention \"wisdom\" (\"hikmah\") coupled with \"scripture\" or \"the book\" (i.e. the Quran) \u2013 \"al-kit\u0101b wa al-\u1e25ikma\". Mainstream scholars starting with al-Shafi'i believe \"hikma\" refers to the sunnah, and this connection between sunnah and the Quran is evidence of the sunnah's divinity and authority.\nTherefore, along with the Quran, the \"sunnah\" was revealed. Modern Sunni scholars have examined both the \"sira\" and the \"hadith\" in order to justify modifications to jurisprudence (\"fiqh\"). Hence, the imitation of Muhammad helps Muslims to know and be loved by God.\nAnother piece of evidence for the divinity of the Sunnah\u2014according to its supporters\u2014are verses in the Quran that refer to revelations not found \"in\" the Quran. For example, there is no verse mentioning the original direction of prayer (the \"qibla\") in the Quran, but God in the Quran does say He appointed the original qibla ( https://). Other events mentioned in the Quran that already happened without Quranic command or description include a dream in which Muhammad would enter Mecca ( https://); Muhammad's marriage to Zayd's ex-wife ( https://); and the dispute over the division of spoils after the Battle of Badr [ https://]; all \"definitive proof that besides the Quran other commands came to the Prophet by the agency of wa\u1e25y\", according to revivalist Abul A'la Maududi.\nYet another piece of evidence offered is that \"Prophet witness\" is \"the chief guarantee\" of what is divine revelation. In other words, \"Muslims only know the Quran is revelation because of Muhammad's testimony to this fact. If prophetic word is not to be trusted, then the Quran itself is open to suspicion.\" Since the Quran is not, the sunnah must be trustworthy.\nAlternative view.\nThe minority argument against the sunnah of Muhammad being divine revelation (\"wa\u1e25y\") goes back to the \"ahl al-Kalam\" who al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b argued against in the second century of Islam. Their modern \"Quranists\", the modern successors of the \"ahl al-Kalam\", argue that the sunnah falls short of the standard of the Quran in divinity. Specifically because\nProviding examples.\nAccording to John Burton, paraphrasing Al-Shafi'i, \"it must be remembered that the Quran text are couched in very general terms which it is the function of the sunnah to expand and elucidate, to make God's meaning absolutely clear.\"\nThere are a number of verses in the Quran where \"to understand the context, as well as the meaning\", Muslims need to refer to the record of the life and example of Muhammad.\nIt is thought that verses 16:44 and 64 indicate that Muhammed's mission \"is not merely that of a deliveryman who simply delivers the revelation from Allah to us, rather, he has been entrusted with the most important task of explaining and illustrating\" the Quran.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u02f9We sent them\u02fa with clear proofs and divine Books. And We have sent down to you \u02f9O Prophet\u02fa the Reminder, so that you may explain to people what has been revealed for them, and perhaps they will reflect.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have revealed to you the Book only to clarify for them what they differed about, and as a guide and mercy for those who believe.\nFor example, while the Quran presents the general principles of praying, fasting, paying zakat, or making pilgrimage, they are presented \"without the illustration found in Hadith, for these acts of worship remain as abstract imperatives in the Qur'an\".\nTypes of sunnah.\nSunnah upon which \"fiqh\" is based may be divided into:\nIt may be also divided into sunnah that is binding for Muslims and that which is not. Ibn Qutaybah (213-276 AH) distinguished between:\nIn the terminology of \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence), sunnah denotes whatever though not obligatory, is \"firmly established (\"thabata\") as called for (\"matlub\")\" in Islam \"on the basis of a legal proof (\"dal\u00eel shar`\u00ee\").\nSciences of sunnah.\nAccording to scholar Gibril Fouad Haddad, the \"sciences of the Sunnah\" (\"'ul\u00fbm as-Sunna\") refer to:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the biography of the Prophet (\"as-s\u00eera\"), the chronicle of his battles (\"al-magh\u00e2z\u00ee\"), his everyday sayings and acts or \"ways\" (\"sunan\"), his personal and moral qualities (\"ash-sham\u00e2'il\"), and the host of the ancillary had\u00eeth sciences such as the circumstances of occurrence (\"asb\u00e2b al-wur\u00fbd\"), knowledge of the abrogating and abrogated had\u00eeth, difficult words (\"ghar\u00eeb al-had\u00eeth\"), narrator criticism (\"al-jarh wat-ta`d\u00eel\"), narrator biographies (\"al-rij\u00e2l\"), etc., as discussed in great detail in the authoritative books of al-Khat\u00eeb al-Baghd\u00e2d\u00ee.\nIn Shia community.\nShia Muslims do not follow the \"Kutub al-Sittah\" (six major hadith collections) followed in Sunni Islam, therefore in Shia and Sunni Islam, the sunnah refer to different collections of religious canonical literature.\nThe primary collections of Shia community were written by three authors known as the \"Three Muhammads\", and they are:\nUnlike Akhbari Twelver Shiites, Usuli Twelver Shiite scholars do not believe that everything in the four major books of the Shia is authentic.\nIn Shia \"hadees\" one often finds sermons attributed to Ali in The Four Books or in the Nahj al-Balagha.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The terms safer sex and protected sex are sometimes preferred, to indicate that even highly effective prevention practices do not completely eliminate all possible risks. It is also sometimes used colloquially to describe methods aimed at preventing pregnancy that may or may not also lower STI risks.\nThe concept of safe sex emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global AIDS epidemic, and possibly more specifically to the AIDS crisis in the United States. Promoting safe sex is now one of the main aims of sex education and STI prevention, especially reducing new HIV infections. Safe sex is regarded as a harm reduction strategy aimed at reducing the risk of STI transmission.\nAlthough some safe sex practices (like condoms) can also be used as birth control (\"contraception\"), most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs. Likewise, some safe sex practices, such as partner selection and low-risk sex behavior, might not be effective forms of contraception.\nHistory.\nAlthough strategies for avoiding STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea have existed for centuries and the term \"safe sex\" existed in English as early as the 1930s, the use of the term to refer to STI-risk reduction dates to the mid-1980s in the United States. It emerged in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.\nA year before the HIV virus was isolated and named, the San Francisco chapter of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence published a small pamphlet titled \"Play Fair!\" out of concern over widespread STIs among the city's gay male population. It specifically named illnesses (Kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia) that would later be understood as symptoms of advanced HIV disease (AIDS). The pamphlet advocated a range of safe-sex practices, including abstinence, condoms, personal hygiene, use of personal lubricants, and STI testing/treatment. It took a casual, sex-positive approach while also emphasizing personal and social responsibility. In May 1983\u2014the same month HIV was isolated and named in France\u2014the New York City-based HIV/AIDS activists Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen published similar advice in their booklet, \"\". Both publications included recommendations that are now standard advice for reducing STI (including HIV) risks.\nSafe sex as a form of STI risk reduction appeared in journalism as early as 1984, in the British publication \"The Daily Intelligencer\": \"The goal is to reach about 50 million people with messages about safe sex and AIDS education.\"\nAlthough \"safe sex\" is used by individuals to refer to protection against both pregnancy and HIV/AIDS or other STI transmissions, the term was born in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is believed that the term \"safe sex\" was used in the professional literature in 1984, in the content of a paper on the psychological effect that HIV/AIDS may have on gay and bisexual men.\nA year later, the same term appeared in an article in \"The New York Times.\" This article emphasized that most specialists advised their AIDS patients to practice safe sex. The concept included limiting the number of sexual partners, using prophylactics, avoiding bodily fluid exchange, and resisting the use of drugs that reduced inhibitions for high-risk sexual behavior. Moreover, in 1985, the first safe sex guidelines were established by the 'Coalition for Sexual Responsibilities'. According to these guidelines, safe sex was practiced by using condoms also when engaging in anal or oral sex.\nAlthough the term \"safe sex\" was primarily used in reference to sexual activity between men, in 1986 the concept was spread to the general population. Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner's sexual history and limiting the number of sexual partners. The first book on this subject, \"Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS\", appeared in the same year. It had 88 pages that described both positive and negative approaches to sexual life. Sexual behavior was loosely sorted into safe (kissing, hugging, massage, body-to-body rubbing, mutual masturbation, exhibitionism, phone sex, and use of separate sex toys); possibly safe (use of condoms); or unsafe.\nIn 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for TV commercials featuring condoms. During the same year, the Catholic Church in the United States issued their own safer sex guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the Vatican urged chastity and heterosexual marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops' guidelines.\nA 2006 survey found that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects), and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects).\nThe term \"safer sex\" in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various sexual activities is a continuum. \"Safer sex\" is thought to make it more obvious to individuals that any type of sexual activity carries a certain degree of risk. The term \"safe sex\" is still in common use in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\nThe term \"safe love\" has also been used, notably by the French Sidaction in the promotion of men's underpants incorporating a condom pocket and including the red ribbon symbol in the design, which were sold to support the charity.\nPractices.\nA range of safe-sex practices are commonly recommended by Sexual Health Educators and Public Health Agencies. Many of these practices can reduce (but not eliminate) risk of transmitting or acquiring STIs.\nPhone sex/cybersex/sexting.\nSexual activities, such as phone sex, cybersex, and sexting, that do not include direct contact with the skin or bodily fluids of sexual partners, carry no STI risks and, thus, are forms of safe sex.\nNon-penetrative sex.\nA range of sex acts called \"non-penetrative sex\" or \"outercourse\" can significantly reduce STI risks. Non-penetrative sex includes practices such as kissing, mutual masturbation, circle jerks, manual sex, rubbing or stroking. According to the Health Department of Western Australia, this sexual practice may prevent pregnancy and most STIs. However, non-penetrative sex may not protect against infections that can be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact, such as herpes and human papilloma virus. Mutual masturbation and manual sex carry some STI risk, especially if there is skin contact or shared bodily fluids with sexual partners, although the risks are significantly lower than other sexual activities.\nCondoms, dental dams, gloves.\nBarriers, such as condoms, dental dams, and medical gloves can prevent contact with body fluids (such as blood, vaginal fluid, semen, rectal mucus), and other means of transmitting STIs (like skin, hair and shared objects) during sexual activity.\nOil-based lubrication can break down the structure of latex condoms, dental dams or gloves, reducing their effectiveness for STI protection. Personal lubricants can also be water-based or silicone-based.\nWhile use of external condoms can reduce STI risks during sexual activity, they are not 100% effective. One study has suggested condoms might reduce HIV transmission by 85% to 95%; effectiveness beyond 95% was deemed unlikely because of slippage, breakage, and incorrect use. It also said, \"In practice, inconsistent use may reduce the overall effectiveness of condoms to as low as 60\u201370%\".p.\u00a040.\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (often abbreviated as \"PrEP\") is the use of prescription drugs by those who do not have HIV to prevent HIV infection. PrEP drugs are taken \"prior\" to HIV exposure to prevent the transmission of the virus, usually between sexual partners. PrEP drugs do not prevent other STI infections or pregnancy.\nAs of 2018, the most-widely approved form of \"PrEP\" combines two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) in one pill. That drug combination is sold under the brand name Truvada by Gilead Sciences. It is also sold in generic formulations worldwide. Other drugs and modalities are being studied for use as PrEP.\nDifferent countries have approved different protocols for using the tenofovir/emtricitabine-combination drug as \"PrEP\". That two-drug combination has been shown to prevent HIV infection in different populations when taken daily, intermittently, and on demand. Numerous studies have found the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination to be over 90% effective at preventing HIV transmission between sexual partners. AVAC has developed a tool to track trends in PrEP uptake across the globe. In 2025, Gilead announced approval for a PrEP shot that is effective for 6 months at a time, increasing the likelihood of adequate suppression.\nTreatment as prevention.\nTreatment as Prevention (often abbreviated as \"TasP\") is the practice of testing for and treating HIV infection as a way to prevent further spread of the virus. Those having knowledge of their HIV-positive status can use safe-sex practices to protect themselves and their partners (such as using condoms, sero-sorting partners, or choosing less-risky sexual activities). And, because HIV-positive people with durably suppressed or undetectable amounts of HIV in their blood \"cannot transmit HIV to sexual partners\", sexual activity with HIV-positive partners on effective treatment is a form of safe sex (to prevent HIV infection). This fact has given rise to the concept of \"U=U\" (\"Undetectable = Untransmittable\").\nOther forms of safe sex.\nOther methods proven effective at reducing STI risks during sexual activity are:\nIneffective methods.\nMost methods of contraception are not effective at preventing the spread of STIs. This includes birth control pills, vasectomy, tubal ligation, periodic abstinence, IUDs and multiple non-barrier methods of pregnancy prevention. However, condoms, when used correctly, significantly reduces the risks of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancy.\nThe spermicide nonoxynol-9 has been claimed to reduce the likelihood of STI transmission. However, a technical report from 2001 by the World Health Organization has shown that nonoxynol-9 is an irritant and can produce tiny tears in mucous membranes, which may increase the risk of transmission by offering pathogens more easy points of entry into the system. They reported that nonoxynol-9 lubricant do not have enough spermicide to increase contraceptive effectiveness cautioned they should not be promoted. There is no evidence that spermicidal condoms are better at preventing STI transmission compared to condoms that do not have spermicide. If used properly, spermicidal condoms can prevent pregnancy, but there is still an increased risk that nonoxynyl-9 can irritate the skin, making it more susceptible for infections.\nThe use of a diaphragm or contraceptive sponge provides some women with better protection against certain sexually transmitted infections, but they are not effective for all STIs.\nHormonal methods of preventing pregnancy (such as oral contraceptives [i.e. 'The pill'], depoprogesterone, hormonal Intrauterine devices, the vaginal ring, and the patch) offer no protection against STIs. The copper IUD and the hormonal IUD provide an up to 99% protection against pregnancies but no protection against STIs. Women with copper intrauterine device \"may\" be subject to greater risk of infection from bacterial infectious such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, although this is debated.\nCoitus interruptus (or \"pulling out\"), in which the penis is removed from the vagina or mouth before ejaculation, may reduce transmission of STIs or rates of pregnancy but still carries significant risk. This is because pre-ejaculate, a fluid that oozes from the penile urethra before ejaculation, may contain STI pathogens. Additionally, the microbes responsible for some diseases, including genital warts and syphilis, can be transmitted through skin-to-skin or mucous membrane contact.\nAnal sex.\nUnprotected anal penetration is considered a high-risk sexual activity because the thin tissues of the anus and rectum can be easily damaged. Slight injuries can allow the passage of bacteria and viruses, including HIV. This includes penetration of the anus by fingers, hands, or sex toys such as dildos. Condoms may be more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex, increasing the risk of STI transmission.\nThe main risk that individuals are exposed to when performing anal sex is the transmission of HIV. Other possible infections include hepatitis A, B and C; intestinal parasite infections like \"Giardia\"; and bacterial infections such as \"Escherichia coli.\"\nIt's recommended anal sex be avoided by couples in which one of the partners has been diagnosed with an STI until the treatment has proven to be effective.\nTo make anal sex safer, the couple can ensure that the anal area is clean and the bowel empty and the partner on whom anal penetration occurs should be able to relax. Regardless of whether anal penetration occurs by using a finger or the penis, the condom is the best barrier method to prevent transmission of STI. Enemas can increase the risk of HIV infection and lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis.\nSince the rectum can be easily damaged, the use of lubricants is highly recommended even when penetration occurs by using the finger. Especially for beginners, using a condom on the finger is both a protection measure against STI and a lubricant source. Most condoms are lubricated and they allow less painful and easier penetration. Oil-based lubricants can damage latex condoms, causing them to fail; water-based and silicone-based lubricants are available instead. Non-latex condoms are available for people who are allergic to latex made out of polyurethane or polyisoprene. Polyurethane condoms can safely be used with oil-based lubricant. The internal condom may also be used effectively by the anal receiving partner.\nAnal stimulation with a sex toy can be done with similar safety measures to anal penetration with a penis by using a condom on the sex toy if possible. Certain sex toys are easier to clean to a level of safety, and others are incapable of being cleaned thoroughly. In the 21st century, developments in sex technology have increased the availability of consumer devices intended for intimate use. Some manufacturers, such as Lovense, produce silicone-based products designed for compatibility with common safer-sex materials. Public-health guidance recommends using water- or silicone-based lubricants with latex and similar barriers, as oil-based lubricants can weaken these materials and increase the risk of condom failure.\nIt is important that sexual partners wash and clean their penis after anal intercourse if they intend to penetrate the vagina. Bacteria from the rectum are easily transferred to the vagina, which may cause vaginal and urinary tract infections.\nWhen anal\u2013oral contact occurs, protection is recommended since this is a risky sexual behavior in which illnesses such as hepatitis A or STIs can be easily transmitted, as well as enteric infections. The dental dam or non-vented plastic wrap are effective protection means whenever anilingus is performed.\nSex toys.\nPutting a condom on a sex toy provides better sexual hygiene and can help to prevent transmission of infections if the sex toy is shared, provided the condom is replaced when used by a different partner. Some sex toys are made of porous materials, and pores retain viruses and bacteria, which makes it necessary to clean sex toys thoroughly, preferably with use of cleaners specifically for sex toys. Glass is non-porous and medical grade glass sex toys are more easily sterilized between uses.\nAll sex toys should be properly cleaned after use. The way in which a sex toy is cleaned varies on the type of material it is made of. Some sex toys can be boiled or cleaned in a dishwasher. Most sex toys come with advice on the best way to clean and store them and these instructions should be carefully followed. A sex toy should be cleaned not only when it is shared with other individuals but also when it is used on different parts of the body (such as mouth, vagina or anus). In cases in which one of the partners is treated for an STI, it is recommended that the couple not share sex toys until the treatment has proved to be effective.\nToys should be made of body-safe materials. Only materials that can be safely placed in the mouth and safely placed on the skin are safe to use. A number of toys are made of materials that are toxic and impossible to properly clean. These cheap and poisonous materials often degrade quickly over time. Some soft toys are made of medical grade silicone which is properly non-porous and non-reactive with the body. Toys from unreputable sellers may be mis-labeled. Other commonly recognized as safe materials include glass and titanium. If the material has additives such as pigments or softeners, those may also be toxic. The list of safe materials often overlaps with Body piercing materials.\nA sex toy should regularly be checked for scratches or breaks that can be breeding grounds for bacteria. It is best if the damaged sex toy is replaced by a new undamaged one. Even more hygiene protection should be considered by pregnant women when using sex toys. Sharing any type of sex toy that may draw blood, like whips or needles, is not recommended, and is not safe.\nAbstinence.\nSexual abstinence reduces STIs and pregnancy risks associated with sexual contact, but STIs may also be transmitted through non-sexual means, or by rape. HIV may be transmitted through contaminated needles used in tattooing, body piercing, or injections. Medical or dental procedures using contaminated instruments can also spread HIV, while some health-care workers have acquired HIV through occupational exposure to accidental injuries with needles. Evidence does not support the use of abstinence-only sex education. Abstinence-only sex education programs have been found to be ineffective in decreasing rates of HIV infection in the developed world and unplanned pregnancy. Abstinence-only sex education primarily relies on the consequences of character and morality while health care professionals are concerned about matters regarding health outcomes and behaviors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is from . The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally, tiny burrows may appear on the skin from eggs that are about to hatch. In a first-ever infection, the infected person usually develops symptoms within two to six weeks. During a second infection, symptoms may begin within 24 hours. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just in certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection in the skin.\nVarious names have been given to this condition and the name 'seven year itch' has been recorded in many documents from the 1800s. Although the 1952 play \"The Seven Year Itch\" and modern treatment methods have generally changed this name to refer to human relationships, the condition was historically very difficult to treat. \nScabies is caused by infection with the female mite \"Sarcoptes scabiei \"var.\" hominis\", an ectoparasite. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often, only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. Scabies most often spreads during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sexual activity or living together. Spread of the disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, group homes, and prisons, increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher disease rates. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease, not essentially different but an infestation by huge numbers of mites that typically only affects those with a poor immune system; the number of mites also makes them much more contagious. In these cases, the spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is tiny and at the limit of detection with the human eye. It is not readily obvious; factors that aid in detection are good lighting, magnification, and knowing what to look for. Diagnosis is based either on detecting the mite (confirmed scabies), detecting typical lesions in a typical distribution with typical histological features (clinical scabies), or detecting atypical lesions or atypical distribution of lesions with only some histological features present (suspected scabies).\nSeveral medications are available to treat those infected, including oral and topical ivermectin, permethrin, crotamiton, and lindane creams. Sexual contacts within the last month and people who live in the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.\nScabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children, along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections. As of 2015, it affects about 204\u00a0million people (2.8% of the world population). It is equally common in both sexes. The young and the old are more commonly affected. It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates. Other animals do not spread human scabies; similar infection in other animals is known as sarcoptic mange, and is typically caused by slightly different but related mites.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe characteristic symptoms of a scabies infection include intense itching and superficial burrows. Because the host develops the symptoms as a reaction to the mites' presence over time, typically a delay of four to six weeks occurs between the onset of infestation and the onset of itching. Similarly, symptoms often persist for one to several weeks after successful eradication of the mites. As noted, those re-exposed to scabies after successful treatment may exhibit symptoms of the new infestation in a much shorter period\u2014as little as one to four days.\nItching.\nIn the classic scenario, the itch is made worse by warmth and is usually experienced as being worse at night, possibly because distractions are fewer. As a symptom, it is less common in the elderly.\nRash.\nThe superficial burrows of scabies usually occur in the area of the finger webs, feet, ventral wrists, elbows, back, buttocks, and external genitals. Except in infants and the immunosuppressed, infection generally does not occur in the skin of the face or scalp. The burrows are created by the excavation of the adult mite in the epidermis. Acropustulosis, or blisters and pustules on the palms and soles of the feet, are characteristic symptoms of scabies in infants.\nIn most people, the trails of the burrowing mites are linear or S-shaped tracks in the skin, often accompanied by rows of small, pimple-like mosquito or insect bites. Lesions are symmetrical and mainly affect the hands, wrists, axillae, thighs, buttocks, waist, soles of the feet, areola, and vulva in females, and penis and scrotum in males. The neck and above are usually not affected, except in cases of crusted scabies and infestations of infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Symptoms typically appear two to six weeks after infestation for individuals never before exposed to scabies. For those having been previously exposed, the symptoms can appear within several days after infestation. However, symptoms may appear after several months or years.\nCrusted scabies.\nThe elderly, disabled, and people with impaired immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or those on immunosuppressive medications, are susceptible to crusted scabies (also called Norwegian scabies). On those with weaker immune systems, the host becomes a more fertile breeding ground for the mites, which spread over the host's body, except the face. The mites in crusted scabies are not more virulent than in noncrusted scabies but are much more numerous, sometimes up to two million. People with crusted scabies exhibit scaly rashes, slight itching, and thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites. For this reason, persons with crusted scabies are more contagious to others than those with typical scabies. Such areas make eradication of mites particularly difficult, as the crusts protect the mites from topical miticides/scabicides, necessitating prolonged treatment of these areas.\nCause.\nScabies mite.\nIn the 18th century, Italian biologists Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo and Diacinto Cestoni (1637\u20131718) described the mite now called \"Sarcoptes scabiei\", variety \"hominis\", as the cause of scabies. \"Sarcoptes\" is a genus of skin parasites and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as scab mites. These organisms have eight legs as adults and are placed in the same phylogenetic class (Arachnida) as spiders and ticks.\n\"S. scabiei\" mites are under 0.5\u00a0mm in size; they are sometimes visible as pinpoints of white. Gravid females tunnel into the dead, outermost layer (stratum corneum) of a host's skin and deposit eggs in the shallow burrows. The eggs hatch into larvae in three to ten days. These young mites move about on the skin and molt into a \"nymphal\" stage, before maturing as adults, which live three to four weeks in the host's skin. Males roam on top of the skin, occasionally burrowing into the skin. In general, the total number of adult mites infesting a healthy hygienic person with non-crusted scabies is small, about 11 females in burrows, on average.\nThe movement of mites within and on the skin produces an intense itch, which has the characteristics of a delayed cell-mediated inflammatory response to allergens. IgE antibodies are present in the serum and the site of infection, which react to multiple protein allergens in the body of the mite. Some of these cross-react to allergens from house dust mites. Immediate antibody-mediated allergic reactions (wheals) have been elicited in infected persons, but not in those not infected; immediate hypersensitivity of this type is thought to explain the observed far more rapid allergic skin response to reinfection seen in persons who have been infected previously, especially within the previous year or two.\nTransmission.\nScabies is contagious and can be contracted through prolonged physical contact with an infested person. This includes sexual intercourse, although a majority of cases are acquired through other forms of skin-to-skin contact. Less commonly, scabies infestation can happen through the sharing of clothes, towels, and bedding, but this is not a major mode of transmission; individual mites can survive for only two to three days, at most, away from human skin at room temperature. As with lice, a latex condom is ineffective against scabies transmission during intercourse, because mites typically migrate from one individual to the next at sites other than the sex organs.\nHealthcare workers are at risk of contracting scabies from patients, because they may be in extended contact with them.\nPathophysiology.\nThe symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction of the host's body to mite proteins, though exactly which proteins remains a topic of study. The mite proteins are also present in the gut, and in mite feces, which are deposited under the skin. The allergic reaction is both of the delayed (cell-mediated) and immediate (antibody-mediated) type, and involves IgE (antibodies are presumed to mediate the very rapid symptoms on reinfection). The allergy-type symptoms (itching) continue for some days, and even several weeks, after all mites are killed. New lesions may appear for a few days after mites are eradicated. Nodular lesions from scabies may continue to be symptomatic for weeks after the mites have been killed.\nRates of scabies are negatively related to temperature and positively related to humidity.\nDiagnosis.\nScabies may be diagnosed clinically in geographical areas where it is common when diffuse itching presents along with either a lesion in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another household member. The classical sign of scabies is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nSymptoms of early scabies infestation mirror other skin diseases, including dermatitis, syphilis, erythema multiforme, various urticaria-related syndromes, allergic reactions, ringworm-related diseases, and other ectoparasites such as lice and fleas.\nPrevention of passing on scabies to other people.\nMass-treatment programs that use topical permethrin or oral ivermectin have been effective in reducing the prevalence of scabies in several populations. The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic), to reduce rates of recurrence. Since mites can survive for only two to three days without a host, other objects in the environment pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted scabies. Therefore, cleaning is of little importance. Rooms used by those with crusted scabies require thorough cleaning.\nManagement.\nTreatment.\nSeveral medications are effective in treating scabies. Treatment should involve the entire household and any others who have had recent, prolonged contact with the infested individual. In addition to treating the infestation, options to control itchiness include antihistamines and prescription anti-inflammatory agents. Bedding, clothing and towels used during the previous three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer.\nTreatment protocols for crusted scabies are significantly more intense than for common scabies.\nPermethrin.\nPermethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, is the most effective treatment for scabies, and remains the treatment of choice. It is applied from the neck down, usually before sleep, and left on for about 8 to 14 hours, then washed off in the morning. Care should be taken to coat the entire skin surface, not just symptomatic areas; any patch of skin left untreated can provide a \"safe haven\" for one or more mites to survive. One application is normally sufficient, as permethrin kills eggs, hatchlings, and adult mites, though many physicians recommend a second application three to seven days later as a precaution. Crusted scabies may require multiple applications or supplemental treatment with oral ivermectin (below). Permethrin may cause slight irritation of the skin that is usually tolerable. In recent years, concern is growing about permethrin-resistant scabies, although some researchers refer to this as pseudo-resistance.\nIvermectin.\nOral ivermectin is effective in eradicating scabies, often in a single dose. It is the treatment of choice for crusted scabies, and is sometimes prescribed in combination with a topical agent. It has not been tested on infants, and is not recommended for children under six years of age.\nTopical ivermectin preparations are effective for scabies in adults. It has also been useful for sarcoptic mange, the veterinary analog of human scabies.\nOne review found that the efficacy of permethrin is similar to that of systemic or topical ivermectin. A separate review found that although oral ivermectin is usually effective for the treatment of scabies, it does have a higher treatment failure rate than topical permethrin. Another review found that oral ivermectin provided a reasonable balance between efficacy and safety. A study has demonstrated that scabies is markedly reduced in populations taking ivermectin regularly; the drug is widely used for treating scabies and other parasitic diseases, particularly among the poor and disadvantaged in the tropics, beginning with the developer Merck providing the drug at no cost to treat onchocerciasis from 1987.\nOthers.\nOther treatments include lindane, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, malathion, and sulfur preparations. Lindane is effective, but concerns over potential neurotoxicity have limited its availability in many countries. It is banned in California, but may be used in other states as a second-line treatment. Sulfur ointments or benzyl benzoate are often used in the developing world due to their low cost; some 10% sulfur solutions have been shown to be effective, and sulfur ointments are typically used for at least a week, though many people find the odor of sulfur products unpleasant. Crotamiton has been found to be less effective than permethrin in limited studies. Crotamiton or sulfur preparations are sometimes recommended instead of permethrin for children, due to concerns over dermal absorption of permethrin.\nCommunities.\nScabies is endemic in many developing countries, where it tends to be particularly problematic in rural and remote areas. In such settings, community-wide control strategies are required to reduce the rate of disease, as treatment of only individuals is ineffective due to the high rate of reinfection. Large-scale mass drug administration strategies may be required where coordinated interventions aim to treat whole communities in one concerted effort. Although such strategies have shown to be able to reduce the burden of scabies in these kinds of communities, debate remains about the best strategy to adopt, including the choice of drug.\nThe resources required to implement such large-scale interventions in a cost-effective and sustainable way are significant. Furthermore, since endemic scabies is largely restricted to poor and remote areas, it is a public health issue that has not attracted much attention from policymakers and international donors.\nEpidemiology.\nScabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children, along with tinea and pyoderma. As of 2010, it affects about 100\u00a0million people (1.5% of the population) and its frequency is not related to gender. The mites are distributed around the world and equally infect all ages, races, and socioeconomic classes in different climates. Scabies is more often seen in crowded areas with unhygienic living conditions. Globally as of 2009, an estimated 300\u00a0million cases of scabies occur each year, although various parties claim the figure is either over- or underestimated. About 1\u201310% of the global population is estimated to be infected with scabies, but in certain populations, the infection rate may be as high as 50\u201380%.\nHistory.\nScabies has been observed in humans since ancient times. Archeological evidence from Egypt and the Middle East suggests scabies was present as early as 494\u00a0BC. In the fourth century BC, Aristotle reported on \"lice\" that \"escape from little pimples if they are pricked\" \u2013 a description consistent with scabies. Arab physician Ibn Zuhr is believed to have been the first to provide a clinical description of the scabies mites.\nRoman encyclopedist and medical writer Aulus Cornelius Celsus (\"circa\" 25 BC \u2013 50 AD) is credited with naming the disease \"scabies\" and describing its characteristic features. The parasitic etiology of scabies was documented by Italian physician Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo (1663\u20131696) in his 1687 letter, \"Observations concerning the fleshworms of the human body\". Bonomo's description established scabies as one of the first human diseases with a well-understood cause.\nIn Europe in the late 19th through mid-20th centuries, a sulfur-bearing ointment called by the medical eponym of Wilkinson's ointment was widely used for topical treatment of scabies. The contents and origins of several versions of the ointment were detailed in correspondence published in the \"British Medical Journal\" in 1945.\nIn the 1995 documentary \"Anne Frank Remembered\", Bloeme Evers-Emden told of how she was selected from Auschwitz and sent to a work camp where conditions were sufficiently improved that she was able to survive until the liberation. She said Anne Frank was rejected for this transfer because she had contracted scabies.\nScabies in animals.\nScabies may occur in some domestic and wild animals; the mites that cause these infestations are of different subspecies from the one typically causing the human form. These subspecies can infest animals that are not their usual hosts, but such infections do not last long. Scabies-infected animals experience severe itching and secondary skin infections. They often lose weight and become frail.\nThe most frequently diagnosed form of scabies in domestic animals is sarcoptic mange, caused by the subspecies \"Sarcoptes scabiei canis\", most commonly in dogs and cats. Sarcoptic mange is transmissible to humans who come into prolonged contact with infested animals, and is distinguished from human scabies by its distribution on skin surfaces covered by clothing. Scabies-infected domestic fowl develop what is known as \"scaly leg\". Domestic animals that have gone feral and have no veterinary care are frequently affected by scabies. Nondomestic animals have also been observed to develop scabies. Gorillas, for instance, are known to be susceptible to infection by contact with items used by humans, and it is a fatal disease of wombats.\nScabies is also a concern for cattle.\nSociety and culture.\nThe International Alliance for the Control of Scabies was started in 2012, and brings together over 150 researchers, clinicians, and public-health experts from more than 15 countries. It has managed to bring the global health implications of scabies to the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, the WHO has included scabies on its official list of neglected tropical diseases and other neglected conditions.\nResearch.\nMoxidectin is being evaluated as a treatment for scabies. It is established in veterinary medicine to treat a range of parasites, including sarcoptic mange. Its advantage over ivermectin is its longer half-life in humans, thus the potential duration of action.\nTea tree oil (TTO) exhibits scabicidal action in a laboratory setting.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28849", "revid": "31830686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28849", "title": "Shiva", "text": "Major deity in Hinduism\nShiva (; , IAST: ), also known as Mahadeva (; , IAST: , ]) and Hara, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the Supreme Being in Shaivism, one of the major traditions within Hinduism.\nIn the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe. In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary partner of Shiva. Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism. Shiva is known as \"The Destroyer\" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu. \nShiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient yogi who lives an ascetic life on Kailasa as well as a householder with his wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi (the first yogi), regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and the arts. The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent king Vasuki around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on his forehead (the eye that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the trishula or trident as his weapon, and the damaru. He is usually worshiped in the aniconic form of lingam.\nThough associated with Vedic minor deity Rudra, Shiva may have non-Vedic roots, evolving as an amalgamation of various older non-Vedic and Vedic deities, including the Rigvedic storm god Rudra who may also have non-Vedic origins, into a single major deity. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia (especially in Java and Bali).\nEtymology and other names.\nAccording to the Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary, the word \"\" (, also transliterated as \"shiva\") means \"auspicious, propitious, gracious, benign, kind, benevolent, friendly\". The root words of in folk etymology are \"\u015b\u012b\" which means \"in whom all things lie, pervasiveness\" and \"va\" which means \"embodiment of grace\".\nThe word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda (c.\u20091700\u20131100 BCE), as an epithet for several Rigvedic deities, including Rudra. The term Shiva also connotes \"liberation, final emancipation\" and \"the auspicious one\"; this adjectival usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic literature. The term evolved from the Vedic \"Rudra-Shiva\" to the noun \"Shiva\" in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the \"creator, reproducer and dissolver\".\nSharma presents another etymology with the Sanskrit root \"-\", which means \"to injure\" or \"to kill\", interpreting the name to connote \"one who can kill the forces of darkness\".\nThe Sanskrit word ' means \"relating to the god Shiva\", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect. It is used as an adjective to characterise certain beliefs and practices, such as Shaivism.\nSome authors associate the name with the Tamil word ' meaning \"red\", noting that Shiva is linked to the Sun (', \"the Red one\", in Tamil) and that Rudra is also called \"Babhru\" (brown, or red) in the Rigveda. The \"Vishnu sahasranama\" interprets \"Shiva\" to have multiple meanings: \"The Pure One\", and \"the One who is not affected by three Gu\u1e47as of Prak\u1e5bti (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas)\".\nShiva is known by many names such as Viswanatha (lord of the universe), Mahadeva, Mahandeo, Mahasu, Mahesha, Maheshvara, Shankara, Shambhu, Rudra, Hara, Trilochana, Devendra (chief of the gods), Neelakanta, Subhankara, Trilokinatha (lord of the three realms), and Ghrneshwar (lord of compassion). The highest reverence for Shiva in Shaivism is reflected in his epithets ' (\"Great god\"; ' \"Great\" and \"deva\" \"god\"), ' (\"Great Lord\"; ' \"great\" and ' \"lord\"), and ' (\"Supreme Lord\").\nSahasranama are medieval Indian texts that list a thousand names derived from aspects and epithets of a deity. There are at least eight different versions of the \"Shiva Sahasranama\", devotional hymns (\"stotras\") listing many names of Shiva. The version appearing in Book 13 () of the \"Mahabharata\" provides one such list. Shiva also has \"Dasha-Sahasranamas\" (10,000 names) that are found in the \"Mahanyasa\". The \"Shri Rudram Chamakam\", also known as the \"\u015aatarudriya\", is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.\nHistorical development and literature.\nAssimilation of traditions.\nThe Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the Indian subcontinent, such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia, such as Bali, Indonesia. Shiva-Rudra may have non-Vedic tribal roots, having \"his origins in primitive tribes, signs and symbols,\" but the oldest literary attestion is the associated Vedic minor deity Rudra, who may also have non-Aryan origins. The figure of Shiva as he is known today is an amalgamation of various older deities into a single figure, due to the process of Sanskritization and the emergence of the Hindu synthesis in post-Vedic times. How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation. According to Vijay Nath:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Vishnu and Siva [...] began to absorb countless local cults and deities within their folds. The latter were either taken to represent the multiple facets of the same god or else were supposed to denote different forms and appellations by which the god came to be known and worshipped. [...] Siva became identified with countless local cults by the sheer suffixing of \"Isa\" or \"Isvara\" to the name of the local deity, e.g., Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara.\"\nAn example of assimilation took place in Maharashtra, where a regional deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri. Khandoba has been assimilated as a form of Shiva himself, in which case he is worshipped in the form of a lingam. Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.\nMyths about Shiva that were \"roughly contemporary with early Christianity\" existed that portrayed Shiva with many differences than how he is thought of now, and these mythical portrayals of Shiva were incorporated into later versions of him. For instance, he and the other gods, from the highest gods to the least powerful gods, were thought of as somewhat human in nature, creating emotions they had limited control over and having the ability to get in touch with their inner natures through asceticism like humans. In that era, Shiva was widely viewed as both the god of lust and of asceticism. In one story, he was seduced by a prostitute sent by the other gods, who were jealous of Shiva's ascetic lifestyle he had lived for 1000 years.\nPre-Vedic elements.\nPrehistoric art.\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the Mesolithic from Bhimbetka rock shelters have been interpreted by some authors as depictions of Shiva. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways.\nIndus Valley and the Pashupati seal.\nOf several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic, seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals. This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as \"Pashupati\" (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit '), an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra. Sir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined. Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns. Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion.\nGavin Flood states that it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure. He characterises these views as \"speculative\", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull. John Keay writes that \"he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati\", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra. Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.\nThe interpretation of the seal continues to be disputed. McEvilley, for example, states that it is not possible to \"account for this posture outside the yogic account\". Asko Parpola states that other archaeological finds such as the early Elamite seals dated to 3000\u20132750 BCE show similar figures and these have been interpreted as \"seated bull\" and not a yogi, and the bovine interpretation is likely more accurate. Gregory L. Possehl in 2002, associated it with the water buffalo, and concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would \"go too far\".\nProto-Indo-European elements.\nThe Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The similarities between the iconography and theologies of Shiva with Greek and European deities have led to proposals for an Indo-European link for Shiva, or lateral exchanges with ancient central Asian cultures. His contrasting aspects such as being terrifying or blissful depending on the situation, are similar to those of the Greek god Dionysus, as are their iconic associations with bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing and carefree life. The ancient Greek texts of the time of Alexander the Great call Shiva \"Indian Dionysus\", or alternatively call Dionysus \"god of the Orient\". Similarly, the use of phallic symbol as an icon for Shiva is also found for Irish, Nordic, Greek (Dionysus) and Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward. Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous non-Aryan tribal origins.\nVedic elements.\nRudra.\nShiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, a Rigvedic deity with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring storm. He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity. In RV 2.33, he is described as the \"Father of the Rudras\", a group of storm gods.\nFlood notes that Rudra is an ambiguous god, peripheral in the Vedic pantheon, possibly indicating non-Vedic origins. Nevertheless, both Rudra and Shiva are akin to Wodan, the Germanic God of rage (\"w\u00fctte\") and the wild hunt.\nAccording to Sadasivan, during the development of the Hindu synthesis attributes of the Buddha were transferred by Brahmins to Shiva, who was also linked with Rudra. The Rigveda has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text. Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (Rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (Shiva).\nThe term Shiva also appears simply as an epithet, that means \"kind, auspicious\", one of the adjectives used to describe many different Vedic deities. While fierce ruthless natural phenomenon and storm-related Rudra is feared in the hymns of the Rigveda, the beneficial rains he brings are welcomed as Shiva aspect of him. This healing, nurturing, life-enabling aspect emerges in the Vedas as Rudra-Shiva, and in post-Vedic literature ultimately as Shiva who combines the destructive and constructive powers, the terrific and the gentle, as the ultimate recycler and rejuvenator of all existence.\nThe Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (\"vahana\") of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.\nAgni.\nRudra and Agni have a close relationship. The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual transformation into Rudra-Shiva. The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the \"Nirukta\", an important early text on etymology, which says, \"Agni is also called Rudra.\" The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fire myth of plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.\nIn the \"\u015aatarudr\u012bya\", some epithets of Rudra, such as (\"Of golden red hue as of flame\") and (\"Flaming bright\"), suggest a fusing of the two deities. Agni is said to be a bull, and Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, Nandi. The horns of Agni, who is sometimes characterised as a bull, are mentioned. In medieval sculpture, both Agni and the form of Shiva known as Bhairava have flaming hair as a special feature.\nIndra.\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the Saivite fertility myths and some of the phallic characteristics of Shiva are inherited from Indra. Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda the term \" is used to refer to Indra. (2.20.3, 6.45.17, and 8.93.3.) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull. In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra.\nIndra himself may have been adopted by the Vedic Aryans from the Bactria\u2013Margiana Culture. According to Anthony,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, Verethraghna, were transferred to the adopted god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the \"Rig Veda\". He was associated more than any other deity with \"Soma\", a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from \"Ephedra\") probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers.\nThe texts and artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, although not identical generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly in their respective mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras in a manner similar to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.\nDevelopment.\nA few texts such as \"Atharvashiras Upanishad\" mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The \"Kaivalya Upanishad\" similarly, states Paul Deussen \u2013 a German Indologist and professor of philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who \"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart.\nRudra's evolution from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" (400\u2013200 BCE), according to Gavin Flood, presenting the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva is identified as the creator of the cosmos and liberator of Selfs from the birth-rebirth cycle. The Svetasvatara Upanishad set the tone for early Shaivite thought, especially in chapter 3 verse 2 where Shiva is equated with Brahman: \"Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second\". The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSelf-realization and Shaiva Upanishads\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHe who sees himself in all beings,\nAnd all beings in him,\nattains the highest Brahman,\nnot by any other means.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014\"Kaivalya Upanishad 10\"\nShaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya\" (2nd-century BCE) and in the \"Mahabharata\".\nThe earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva's trident and phallic symbolism in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire (30\u2013375 CE) that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.\nThe Shaiva Upanishads are a group of 14 minor Upanishads of Hinduism variously dated from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 17th century. These extol Shiva as the metaphysical unchanging reality Brahman and the Atman (Self), and include sections about rites and symbolisms related to Shiva.\nThe Shaiva Puranas, particularly the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the various aspects of Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (\"Tirtha\") associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider Self within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, \"dvaita\"), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, \"advaita\"), and that Shiva is the Self, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty-four monism Agama texts.\nShiva-related literature developed extensively across India in the 1st millennium CE and through the 13th century, particularly in Kashmir and Tamil Shaiva traditions. Shaivism gained immense popularity in Tamilakam as early as the 7th century CE, with poets such as Appar and Sambandar composing rich poetry that is replete with present features associated with the deity, such as his tandava dance, the mulavam (dumru), the aspect of holding fire, and restraining the proud flow of the Ganga upon his braid. The monist Shiva literature posit absolute oneness, that is Shiva is within every man and woman, Shiva is within every living being, Shiva is present everywhere in the world including all non-living being, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and Shiva. The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork and texts in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.\nPosition within Hinduism.\nShaivism.\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition. Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere. Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions. Shiva is also part of 'Om' (\u0950) as a 'U' (\u0909).\nThe Shaivism theology is broadly grouped into two: the popular theology influenced by Shiva-Rudra in the Vedas, Epics and the Puranas; and the esoteric theology influenced by the Shiva and Shakti-related Tantra texts. The Vedic-Brahmanic Shiva theology includes both monist (\"Advaita\") and devotional traditions (\"Dvaita\"), such as Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta and Lingayatism. Shiva temples feature items such as linga, Shiva-Parvati iconography, bull Nandi within the premises, and relief artwork showing aspects of Shiva.\nThe Tantric Shiva (\"\"\") tradition ignored the mythologies and Puranas related to Shiva, and depending on the sub-school developed a variety of practices. For example, historical records suggest the tantric Kapalikas (literally, the 'skull-men') co-existed with and shared many Vajrayana Buddhist rituals, engaged in esoteric practices that revered Shiva and Shakti wearing skulls, begged with empty skulls, and sometimes used meat as a part of ritual. The esoteric tradition within Kashmir Shaivism has featured the \"Krama\" and \"Trika\" sub-traditions. The Krama sub-tradition focussed on esoteric rituals around Shiva-Kali pair. The Trika sub-tradition developed a theology of triads involving Shiva, combined it with an ascetic lifestyle focusing on personal Shiva in the pursuit of monistic self-liberation.\nVaishnavism.\nThe Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva. Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents Vishnu as supreme. However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the \"Bhagavata Purana\" while praising Krishna as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalised form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality. The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu. The Skanda Purana, for example, states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Vishnu is no one but Shiva, and he who is called Shiva is but identical with Vishnu.\u2014\u200a\nBoth traditions include legends about who is superior, about Shiva paying homage to Vishnu, and Vishnu paying homage to Shiva. However, in texts and artwork of either tradition, the mutual salutes are symbolism for complementarity. The Mahabharata declares the unchanging Ultimate Reality (Brahman) to be identical to Shiva and to Vishnu, that Vishnu is the highest manifestation of Shiva, and Shiva is the highest manifestation of Vishnu.\nShaktism.\nThe goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.\nThe earliest evidence of the tradition of reverence for the feminine with Rudra-Shiva context, is found in the Hindu scripture \"Rigveda\", in a hymn called the Devi Sukta.\nThe \"Devi Upanishad\" in its explanation of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the \"Devi Mahatmya\", a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to be as important as the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half-man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.\nSmarta tradition.\nIn the Smarta tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is a part of its Panchayatana puja. This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent, set in a quincunx pattern. Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference (Ishta Devata).\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasises that all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualise aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, recognise the Absolute symbolised by the icons, on the path to realising the nondual identity of one's Atman (Self) and the Brahman. Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometres from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.\nYoga.\nShiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself \u2013 the transcendental reality. He is the Lord of Yogis, and the teacher of Yoga to sages. As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme guru who \"teaches in silence the oneness of one's innermost self (\"atman\") with the ultimate reality (\"Brahman\").\" Shiva is also an archetype for \"samhara\" () or \"dissolution\" which includes transcendence of human misery by the dissolution of \"maya\", which is why Shiva is associated with Yoga. \nThe theory and practice of Yoga, in different styles, has been a part of all major traditions of Hinduism, and Shiva has been the patron or spokesperson in numerous Hindu Yoga texts. These contain the philosophy and techniques for Yoga. These ideas are estimated to be from or after the late centuries of the 1st millennium CE, and have survived as Yoga texts such as the \"Isvara Gita\" (literally, 'Shiva's song'), which Andrew Nicholson \u2013 a professor of Hinduism and Indian Intellectual History \u2013 states have had \"a profound and lasting influence on the development of Hinduism\".\nOther famed Shiva-related texts influenced Hatha Yoga, integrated monistic (\"Advaita Vedanta\") ideas with Yoga philosophy and inspired the theoretical development of Indian classical dance. These include the \"Shiva Sutras\", the \"Shiva Samhita\", and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism such as the 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that \"people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally do nothing for others\", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand interconnectedness, and thus benefit both the individual and the world towards a more blissful state of existence.\nTrimurti.\nThe Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer. These three deities have been called \"the Hindu triad\" or the \"Great Triple deity\". However, the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism feature many triads of gods and goddesses, some of which do not include Shiva.\nAttributes.\nShiva is traditionally represented with distinctive attributes and symbols:\nForms and depictions.\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox. His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence. This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology. \nDestroyer and Benefactor.\nIn Yajurveda, two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: ') and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: ') forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that \"all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-\u015aiva sect of later ages are to be found here\". In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\", as well as a figure of honour, delight, and brilliance.\nThe duality of Shiva's fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted names. The name Rudra reflects Shiva's fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name \"Rudra\" is derived from the root \"rud-\", which means \"to cry, howl\". Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form \"raudra\", which means \"wild, of \"rudra\" nature\", and translates the name \"Rudra\" as \"the wild one\" or \"the fierce god\". R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as \"terrible\". Hara is an important name that occurs three times in the Anushasanaparvan version of the \"Shiva sahasranama\", where it is translated in different ways each time it occurs, following a commentorial tradition of not repeating an interpretation. Sharma translates the three as \"one who captivates\", \"one who consolidates\", and \"one who destroys\". Kramrisch translates it as \"the ravisher\". Another of Shiva's fearsome forms is as \"time\" and \"great time\", which ultimately destroys all things. The name appears in the \"Shiva Sahasranama\", where it is translated by Ram Karan Sharma as \"(the Supreme Lord of) Time\". Bhairava \"terrible\" or \"frightful\" is a fierce form associated with annihilation. In contrast, the name , \"beneficent\" or \"conferring happiness\" reflects his benign form. This name was adopted by the great Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara (c.\u2009788\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009820), who is also known as Shankaracharya. The name (Sanskrit: swam-on its own; bhu-burn/shine) \"self-shining/ shining on its own\", also reflects this benign aspect.\nAscetic and householder.\nShiva is depicted as both an ascetic yogi and as a householder (grihasta), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society. When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating. His epithet Mah\u0101yogi (\"the great Yogi: \"\" = \"great\", \"Yogi\" = \"one who practices Yoga\") refers to his association with yoga. While Vedic religion was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the Epic period that the concepts of tapas, yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts.\nAs a family man and householder, he has a wife, Parvati, and two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. His epithet (\"The husband of \") refers to this idea, and Sharma notes that two other variants of this name that mean the same thing, and , also appear in the \"sahasranama\". in epic literature is known by many names, including the benign . She is identified with Devi, the Divine Mother; Shakti (divine energy) as well as goddesses like Tripura Sundari, Durga, Kali, Kamakshi and Minakshi. The consorts of Shiva are the source of his creative energy. They represent the dynamic extension of Shiva onto this universe. His son Ganesha is worshipped throughout India and Nepal as the Remover of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings and Lord of Obstacles. Kartikeya is worshipped in Southern India (especially in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka) by the names Subrahmanya, Subrahmanyan, Shanmughan, Swaminathan and Murugan, and in Northern India by the names Skanda, Kumara, or Karttikeya.\nSome regional deities are also identified as Shiva's children. As one story goes, Shiva is enticed by the beauty and charm of Mohini, Vishnu's female avatar, and procreates with her. As a result of this union, Shasta \u2013 identified with regional deities Ayyappan and Aiyanar \u2013 is born. In outskirts of Ernakulam in Kerala, a deity named Vishnumaya is stated to be offspring of Shiva and invoked in local exorcism rites, but this deity is not traceable in Hindu pantheon and is possibly a local tradition with \"vaguely Chinese\" style rituals, states Saletore. In some traditions, Shiva has daughters like the serpent-goddess Manasa and Ashokasundari. According to Doniger, two regional stories depict demons Andhaka and Jalandhara as the children of Shiva who war with him, and are later destroyed by Shiva.\nIconographic forms.\nThe depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Sanskrit \u0928\u091f\u0930\u093e\u091c; \"Na\u1e6dar\u0101ja\") is a form (') of Shiva as \"Lord of Dance\". The names Nartaka (\"dancer\") and Nityanarta (\"eternal dancer\") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama. His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the Puranic period. In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: ') are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular. The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world. When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava, and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati. \"Lasya\" is regarded as the female counterpart of \"Tandava\". The \"Tandava\"-\"Lasya\" dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world.\nDakshinamurti (Sanskrit \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f; \", \"[facing] south form\")\" represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom and giving exposition on the \"shastras\". Dakshinamurti is depicted as a figure seated upon a deer-throne surrounded by sages receiving instruction. Dakshinamurti's depiction in Indian art is mostly restricted to Tamil Nadu.\nBhikshatana (Sanskrit \u092d\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u091f\u0928; \"Bhik\u1e63\u0101\u1e6dana\", \"wandering about for alms, mendicancy\") depicts Shiva as a divine medicant. He is depicted as a nude four-armed man adorned with ornaments who holds a begging bowl in his hand and is followed by demonic attendants. He is associated with his penance for committing brahmicide as Bhirava and with his encounters with the sages and their wives in the Deodar forest.\nTripurantaka (Sanskrit \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0915; \"\", \"ender of Tripura\") is associated with his destruction of the three cities (Tripura) of the Asuras. He is depicted with four arms, the upper pair holding an axe and a deer, and the lower pair wielding a bow and arrow. \nArdhanarishvara (Sanskrit: \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0928\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930; \"Ardhan\u0101r\u012b\u015bvara\", \"the lord who is half woman\") is conjunct form of Shiva with Parvati. Adhanarishvara is depicted with one half of the body as male and the other half as female. Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa.\nKalyanasundara-murti (Sanskrit \u0915\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923\u0938\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0930-\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f, literally \"icon of beautiful marriage\") is the depiction of Shiva's marriage to Parvati. The divine couple are often depicted performing the \"panigrahana\" (Sanskrit \"accepting the hand\") ritual from traditional Hindu wedding ceremonies. The most basic form of this \"murti\" consists of only Shiva and Parvati together, but in more elaborate forms they are accompanied by other persons, sometimes including Parvati's parents, as well as deities (often with Vishnu and Lakshmi standing as Parvati's parents, Brahma as the officiating priest, and various other deities as attendants or guests).\nSomaskanda is the depiction of Shiva, Parvati, and their son Skanda (Kartikeya), popular during the Pallava Dynasty in southern India.\nAstamurti (Sanskrit: \u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f) is an iconographic depiction of Shiva as composed of eight attributes: Rudra, \u015aarva, Pa\u015bupati, Ugra, A\u015bani, Bhava, Mah\u0101deva, and \u012a\u015b\u0101na\u2014some of which overlap with Pa\u00f1c\u0101nana, described below.\nPa\u00f1c\u0101nana (Sanskrit: \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0928\u0928), also called the \"pa\u00f1cabrahma\", is a form of Shiva depicting him as having five faces which correspond to his five divine activities (\"pa\u00f1cak\u1e5btya\"): creation (\"s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di\"), preservation (\"sthithi\"), destruction (\"sa\u1e43h\u0101ra\"), concealing grace (\"tirobh\u0101va\"), and revealing grace (\"anugraha\"). Five is a sacred number for Shiva. One of his most important mantras has five syllables ().\nShiva's body is said to consist of five mantras, called the . As forms of God, each of these have their own names and distinct iconography: These are represented as the five faces of Shiva and are associated in various texts with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action. Doctrinal differences and, possibly, errors in transmission, have resulted in some differences between texts in details of how these five forms are linked with various attributes. The overall meaning of these associations is summarised by Stella Kramrisch,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Through these transcendent categories, \u015aiva, the ultimate reality, becomes the efficient and material cause of all that exists.\nAccording to the \"Pa\u00f1cabrahma Upanishad\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One should know all things of the phenomenal world as of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of is of the character of the fivefold Brahman. (\"Pa\u00f1cabrahma Upanishad\" 31)\nIn the hymn of Manikkavacakar's Thiruvasagam, he testifies that Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram had, by the pre-Chola period, an abstract or 'cosmic' symbolism linked to five elements (Pancha Bhoota) including ether. Nataraja is a significant visual interpretation of Brahman and a dance posture of Shiva. Sharada Srinivasan notes that, Nataraja is described as Satcitananda or \"Being, Consciousness and Bliss\" in the Shaiva Siddhanta text \"Kunchitangrim Bhaje\", resembling the Advaita doctrine, or \"abstract monism,\" of Adi Shankara, \"which holds the individual Self (J\u012bv\u0101tman) and supream Self (Param\u0101tm\u0101) to be one,\" while \"an earlier hymn to Nataraja by Manikkavachakar identifies him with the unitary supreme consciousness, by using Tamil word Or Unarve, rather than Sanskrit Chit.\" This may point to an \"osmosis\" of ideas in medieval India, states Srinivasan.\nLingam.\nThe \"Linga Purana\" states, \"Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless\". The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature. The \"Linga Purana\" and the \"Shiva Gita\" texts builds on this foundation. Linga, states Alain Dani\u00e9lou, means sign. It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something. It accompanies the concept of Brahman, which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less.\nThe \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" states one of the three significations, the primary one, of \"Lingam\" as \"the imperishable Purusha\", the absolute reality, where says the \"linga\" as \"sign\", a mark that provides the existence of Brahman, thus the original meaning as \"sign\". Furthermore, it says \"Shiva, the Supreme Lord, has no li\u016bga\", \"liuga\" ( IAST: ) meaning Shiva is transcendent, beyond any characteristic and, specifically the sign of gender.\nApart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, he is also represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is the shape of a vertical rounded column in the centre of a lipped, disk-shaped object, the \"yoni\", symbolism for the goddess Shakti. In Shiva temples, the \"linga\" is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice. According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, \"linga\" literally means 'mark, sign or emblem', and also refers to a \"mark or sign from which the existence of something else can be reliably inferred\". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolised by Shiva.\nSome scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view \"linga\" as merely a phallic symbol, although this interpretation is criticised by others, including Swami Vivekananda, Sivananda Saraswati, Stella Kramrisch, Swami Agehananda Bharati, S. N. Balagangadhara, and others. According to Moriz Winternitz, the \"linga\" in the Shiva tradition is \"only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva\", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult. According to Sivananda Saraswati, westerners who are curiously passionate and have impure understanding or intelligence, incorrectly assume Siva Linga as a phallus or sex organ. Later on, Sivananda Saraswati mentions that, this is not only a serious mistake, but also a grave blunder.\nThe worship of the lingam originated from the famous hymn in the \"Atharva-Veda Samhit\u00e2\" sung in praise of the \"Yupa-Stambha\", the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless \"Stambha\" or \"Skambha\", and it is shown that the said \"Skambha\" is put in place of the eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the \"Soma\" plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the \"Yupa-Skambha\" gave place in time to the \"Shiva-Linga\". In the text \"Linga Purana\", the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.\nThe oldest known archaeological \"linga\" as an icon of Shiva is the Gudimallam lingam from 3rd-century BCE. In Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, twelve major temples of Shiva are called Jyotirlinga, which means \"linga of light\", and these are located across India.\nAvatars.\nPuranic scriptures contain occasional references to \"ansh\" \u2013 literally 'portion, or avatars of Shiva', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in Shaivism. The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars, however such mention is unusual and the avatars of Shiva is relatively rare in Shaivism compared to the well emphasised concept of Vishnu avatars in Vaishnavism.\nSome Vaishnava literature reverentially link Shiva to characters in its Puranas. For example, in the \"Hanuman Chalisa\", Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" and the \"Vishnu Purana\" claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva. Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva.\nFestivals.\n \nThere is a \"Shivaratri\" in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day, but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks \"Maha Shivaratri\" which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\".\nMaha Shivaratri is a major Hindu festival, but one that is solemn and theologically marks a remembrance of \"overcoming darkness and ignorance\" in life and the world, and meditation about the polarities of existence, of Shiva and a devotion to humankind. It is observed by reciting Shiva-related poems, chanting prayers, remembering Shiva, fasting, doing Yoga and meditating on ethics and virtues such as self-restraint, honesty, noninjury to others, forgiveness, introspection, self-repentance and the discovery of Shiva. The ardent devotees keep awake all night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on pilgrimage to Jyotirlingam shrines. Those who visit temples, offer milk, fruits, flowers, fresh leaves and sweets to the lingam. Some communities organise special dance events, to mark Shiva as the lord of dance, with individual and group performances. According to Jones and Ryan, Maha Sivaratri is an ancient Hindu festival which probably originated around the 5th-century.\nAnother major festival involving Shiva worship is Kartik Purnima, commemorating Shiva's victory over the three demons known as Tripurasura. Across India, various Shiva temples are illuminated throughout the night. Shiva icons are carried in procession in some places.\nThiruvathira is a festival observed in Kerala dedicated to Shiva. It is believed that on this day, Parvati met Shiva after her long penance and Shiva took her as his wife. On this day Hindu women performs the Thiruvathirakali accompanied by Thiruvathira paattu (folk songs about Parvati and her longing and penance for Shiva's affection).\nRegional festivals dedicated to Shiva include the Chithirai festival in Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of Minakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Minakshi in marriage to Shiva.\nSome Shaktism-related festivals revere Shiva along with the goddess considered primary and Supreme. These include festivals dedicated to Annapurna such as \"Annakuta\" and those related to Durga. In Himalayan regions such as Nepal, as well as in northern, central and western India, the festival of Teej is celebrated by girls and women in the monsoon season, in honour of goddess Parvati, with group singing, dancing and by offering prayers in Parvati-Shiva temples.\nThe ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions related to Shiva, such as those that became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India, celebrate the Kumbha Mela festival. This festival cycles every 12 years, in four pilgrimage sites within India, with the event moving to the next site after a gap of three years. The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna. In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (\"Nagas\") get the honour of starting the event by entering the \"Sangam\" first for bathing and prayers.\nIn Pakistan, major Shivaratri celebration occurs at the Umarkot Shiv Mandir in the Umarkot. The three-day Shivarathri celebration at the temple is attended by around 250,000 people.\nBeyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism.\nIndonesia.\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been \"Batara Guru\", which is derived from Sanskrit \"Bhatt\u0101raka\" which means \"noble lord\". He is conceptualised as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him. Batara Guru's wife in Southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualised with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others. In contrast to Hindu religious texts, whether Vedas or Puranas, in Javanese puppetry (wayang) books, Batara Guru is the king of the gods who regulates and creates the world system. In the classic book that is used as a reference for the puppeteers, it is said that Sanghyang Manikmaya or Batara Guru was created from a sparkling light by Sang Hyang Tunggal, along with the blackish light which is the origin of Ismaya. Shiva has been called Sad\u0101\u015biva, Paramasiva, Mah\u0101deva in benevolent forms, and K\u0101la, Bhairava, Mah\u0101k\u0101la in his fierce forms.\nThe Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivite traditions found in the Indian subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of Shaiva Siddhanta (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).\nDuring the pre-Islamic period on the island of Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were considered very close and allied religions, though not identical religions. The medieval-era Indonesian literature equates Buddha with Siwa (Shiva) and Janardana (Vishnu). This tradition continues in predominantly Hindu Bali Indonesia in the modern era, where Buddha is considered the younger brother of Shiva.\nCentral Asia.\nThe worship of Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the influence of the Hephthalite Empire and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (\"Yajnopavita\"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that the Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.\nSikhism.\nThe Japuji Sahib of the Guru Granth Sahib says: \"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi.\" In the same chapter, it also says: \"Shiva speaks, and the Siddhas listen.\" In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh has mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.\nBuddhism.\nThe Siva Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya depicts Shiva as conversing with the Buddha and reciting a gatha.Shiva is mentioned in the Buddhist Tantras and worshipped as the fierce deity Mah\u0101k\u0101la in Vajrayana, Chinese Esoteric, and Tibetan Buddhism. In the cosmologies of Buddhist Tantras, Shiva is depicted as passive, with Shakti being his active counterpart: Shiva as \"Praj\u00f1a\" and Shakti as \"Up\u0101ya\".\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Maheshvara, a deva living in Akanishta Devaloka. In Theravada Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Ishana, a deva residing in the 6th heaven of Kamadhatu along with Sakra Indra. In Vajrayana Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Mahakala, a dharma protecting Bodhisattva. In most forms of Buddhism, the position of Shiva is lesser than that of Mahabrahma or Sakra Indra. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, Shiva (Maheshvara) becomes a buddha called Bhasmeshvara Buddha (\"Buddha of ashes\").\nIn China and Taiwan, Shiva, better known there as Mahe\u015bvara (Chinese: \u5927\u81ea\u5728\u5929; pinyin: D\u00e0z\u00ecz\u00e0iti\u0101n; or Chinese: \u6469\u91af\u9996\u7f85\u5929 pinyin: M\u00f3x\u012bsh\u01d2ulu\u00f3ti\u0101n) is considered one of the \"Twenty Devas\" (Chinese: \u4e8c\u5341\u8af8\u5929, pinyin: \u00c8rsh\u00ed Zh\u016bti\u0101n) or the \"Twenty-Four Devas\" (Chinese: \u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u8af8\u5929, pinyin: \u00c8rsh\u00eds\u00ec zh\u016bti\u0101n) who are a group of \"dharmapalas\" that manifest to protect the Buddhist dharma. Statues of him are often enshrined in the Mahavira Halls of Chinese Buddhist temples along with the other \"devas\". In Kizil Caves in Xinjiang, there are numerous caves that depict Shiva in the buddhist shrines through wall paintings. In addition, he is also regarded as one of thirty-three manifestations of Avalokitesvara in the Lotus Sutra. In Mahayana Buddhist cosmology, Mahe\u015bvara resides in Akani\u1e63\u1e6dha, highest of the \u015auddh\u0101v\u0101sa (\"Pure Abodes\") wherein An\u0101g\u0101mi (\"Non-returners\") who are already on the path to Arhathood and who will attain enlightenment are born. \nDaikokuten, one of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japan, is considered to be evolved from Shiva. The god enjoys an exalted position as a household deity in Japan and is worshipped as the god of wealth and fortune. The name is the Japanese equivalent of Mah\u0101k\u0101la, the Buddhist name for Shiva.\nIn popular culture.\nIn contemporary culture, Shiva is depicted in art, films, and books. He has been referred to as \"the god of cool things\" and a \"bonafide rock hero\". One popular film was the 1967 Kannada movie \"Gange Gowri\".\nA 1990s television series of DD National titled \"Om Namah Shivay\" was also based on legends of Shiva. Amish Tripathi's 2010 book \"Shiva Trilogy\" has sold over a million copies. \"Devon Ke Dev...Mahadev\" (2011\u20132014), a television serial about Shiva on the Life OK channel was among the most watched shows at its peak popularity. Another popular film was the 2022 Gujarati language movie \"Har Har Mahadev\".\nShiva was also featured in the manga \"Record of Ragnarok\" (, \"Sh\u016bmatsu no Waruky\u016bre\") by Shinya Umemura and Takumi Fukui. In the series, Shiva serves as a fighter for the Gods. Despite making an appearance in the series, the show was banned in India due to the series's controversial portrayal of Shiva.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The signs and symptoms depend on the stage it presents: primary, secondary, latent or tertiary. The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration usually between 1\u00a0cm and 2\u00a0cm in diameter), though there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis, a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. Latent syphilis has no symptoms and can last years. In tertiary syphilis, there are gummas (soft, non-cancerous growths), neurological problems, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as \"the great imitator\", because it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.\nSyphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity. It may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other diseases caused by \"Treponema\" bacteria include yaws (\"T. pallidum\" subspecies \"pertenue\"), pinta (\"T. carateum\"), and nonvenereal endemic syphilis (\"T. pallidum\" subspecies \"endemicum\"). These three diseases are not typically sexually transmitted. Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) recommends for all pregnant women to be tested.\nThe risk of sexual transmission of syphilis can be reduced by using a latex or polyurethane condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine benzylpenicillin injected into a muscle. In those who have a severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment, people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer.\nIn 2015, about 45.4\u00a0million people had syphilis infections, of which six million were new cases. During 2015, it caused about 107,000 deaths, down from 202,000 in 1990. After decreasing dramatically with the availability of penicillin in the 1940s, rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries, often in combination with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is believed to be partly due to unsafe drug use, increased prostitution, and decreased use of condoms.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nSyphilis can present in one of four different stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary, and may also occur congenitally. There may be no symptoms. It was referred to as \"the great imitator\" by Sir William Osler due to its varied presentations.\nPrimary.\nPrimary syphilis is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of another person. Approximately 2\u20136 weeks after contact (with a range of 10\u201390 days) a skin lesion, called a chancre, appears at the site and this contains infectious bacteria. This is classically (40% of the time) a single, firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration with a clean base and sharp borders approximately 0.3\u20133.0\u00a0cm in size. The lesion may take on almost any form. In the classic form, it evolves from a macule to a papule and finally to an erosion or ulcer. Occasionally, multiple lesions may be present (~40%), with multiple lesions being more common when coinfected with HIV. Lesions may be painful or tender (30%), and they may occur in places other than the genitals (2\u20137%). The most common location in women is the cervix (44%), the penis in heterosexual men (99%), and anally and rectally in men who have sex with men (34%). Lymph node enlargement frequently (80%) occurs around the area of infection, occurring seven to 10\u00a0days after chancre formation. The lesion may persist for three to six weeks if left untreated.\nSecondary.\nSecondary syphilis occurs approximately four to ten weeks after the primary infection. While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest, symptoms most commonly involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. There may be a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles. The rash may become maculopapular or pustular. It may form flat, broad, whitish, wart-like lesions on mucous membranes, known as condyloma latum. All of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious. Other symptoms may include fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss, hair loss, and headache. Rare manifestations include liver inflammation, kidney disease, joint inflammation, periostitis, inflammation of the optic nerve, uveitis, and interstitial keratitis. The acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks; about 25% of people may present with a recurrence of secondary symptoms. Many people who present with secondary syphilis (40\u201385% of women, 20\u201365% of men) do not report previously having had the classical chancre of primary syphilis.\nLatent.\nLatent syphilis is defined as having serologic proof of infection without symptoms of disease. It develops after secondary syphilis and is divided into early latent and late latent stages. Early latent syphilis is defined by the World Health Organization as less than 2 years after original infection. Early latent syphilis is infectious as up to 25% of people can develop a recurrent secondary infection (during which bacteria are actively replicating and are infectious). Two years after the original infection the person will enter late latent syphilis and is not as infectious as in the early phase. The latent phase of syphilis can last many years after which, without treatment, approximately 15\u201340% of people can develop tertiary syphilis.\nTertiary.\nTertiary syphilis may occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection and may be divided into three different forms: gummatous syphilis (15%), late neurosyphilis (6.5%), and cardiovascular syphilis (10%). Without treatment, a third of infected people develop tertiary disease. People with tertiary syphilis are not infectious.\nGummatous syphilis or late benign syphilis usually occurs 1 to 46 years after the initial infection, with an average of 15\u00a0years. This stage is characterized by the formation of chronic gummas, which are soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation which may vary considerably in size. They typically affect the skin, bone, and liver, but can occur anywhere.\nCardiovascular syphilis usually occurs 10\u201330\u00a0years after the initial infection. The most common complication is syphilitic aortitis, which may result in aortic aneurysm formation.\nNeurosyphilis refers to an infection involving the central nervous system. Involvement of the central nervous system in syphilis (either asymptomatic or symptomatic) can occur at any stage of the infection. It may occur early, being either asymptomatic or in the form of syphilitic meningitis; or late as meningovascular syphilis, manifesting as general paresis or tabes dorsalis.\nMeningovascular syphilis involves inflammation of the small and medium arteries of the central nervous system. It can present between 1\u201310 years after the initial infection. Meningovascular syphilis is characterized by stroke, cranial nerve palsies and spinal cord inflammation. Late symptomatic neurosyphilis can develop decades after the original infection and includes 2 types; general paresis and tabes dorsalis. General paresis presents with dementia, personality changes, delusions, seizures, psychosis and depression. Tabes dorsalis is characterized by gait instability, sharp pains in the trunk and limbs, impaired positional sensation of the limbs as well as having a positive Romberg's sign. Both tabes dorsalis and general paresis may present with Argyll Robertson pupil which are pupils that constrict when the person focuses on near objects (accommodation reflex) but do not constrict when exposed to bright light (pupillary reflex).\nCongenital.\nCongenital syphilis is that which is transmitted during pregnancy or during birth. Two-thirds of syphilitic infants are born without symptoms. Common symptoms that develop over the first couple of years of life include enlargement of the liver and spleen (70%), rash (70%), fever (40%), neurosyphilis (20%), and lung inflammation (20%). If untreated, late congenital syphilis may occur in 40%, including saddle nose deformation, Higoum\u00e9nakis' sign, saber shin, or Clutton's joints among others. Infection during pregnancy is also associated with miscarriage. The main dental defects seen in congenital syphilis are the peg-shaped, notched incisors known as Hutchinson's teeth and so-called mulberry molars (also known as Moon or Fournier molars), defective permanent molars with rounded, deformed crowns resembling a mulberry.\nCause.\nBacteriology.\n\"Treponema pallidum\" subspecies \"pallidum\" is a spiral-shaped, Gram-negative, highly mobile bacterium. Two other human diseases are caused by related \"Treponema pallidum\" subspecies, yaws (subspecies \"pertenue\") and bejel (subspecies \"endemicum\"), and one further caused by the very closely related \"Treponema carateum\", pinta. Unlike subspecies \"pallidum\", they do not cause neurological disease. Humans are the only known natural reservoir for subspecies \"pallidum\". It is unable to survive more than a few days without a host. This is due to its small genome (1.14\u00a0Mbp) failing to encode the metabolic pathways necessary to make most of its macronutrients. It has a slow doubling time of greater than 30\u00a0hours. The bacterium is known for its ability to evade the immune system and its invasiveness.\nTransmission.\nSyphilis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her baby; the bacterium is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin. It is thus transmissible by kissing near a lesion, as well as manual, oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Approximately 30% to 60% of those exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease. Its infectivity is exemplified by the fact that an individual inoculated with only 57 organisms has a 50% chance of being infected. Most new cases in the United States (60%) occur in men who have sex with men; and in this population 20% of syphilis cases were due to oral sex alone. Syphilis can be transmitted by blood products, but the risk is low due to screening of donated blood in many countries. The risk of transmission from sharing needles appears to be limited.\nIt is not generally possible to contract syphilis through toilet seats, daily activities, hot tubs, or sharing eating utensils or clothing. This is mainly because the bacteria die very quickly outside of the body, making transmission by objects extremely difficult.\nDiagnosis.\nSyphilis is difficult to diagnose clinically during early infection. Confirmation is either via blood tests or direct visual inspection using dark field microscopy. Blood tests are more commonly used, as they are easier to perform. Diagnostic tests are unable to distinguish between the stages of the disease.\nBlood tests.\nBlood tests are divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests.\nNontreponemal tests are used initially and include venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests. False positives on the nontreponemal tests can occur with some viral infections, such as varicella (chickenpox) and measles. False positives can also occur with lymphoma, tuberculosis, malaria, endocarditis, connective tissue disease, and pregnancy.\nBecause of the possibility of false positives with nontreponemal tests, confirmation is required with a treponemal test, such as \"Treponema pallidum\" particle agglutination assay (TPHA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-Abs). Treponemal antibody tests usually become positive two to five weeks after the initial infection and remain positive for many years. Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of leukocytes (predominately lymphocytes) and high protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in the setting of a known syphilis infection.\nDirect testing.\nDark field microscopy of serous fluid from a chancre may be used to make an immediate diagnosis. Hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced staff members, and testing must be done within 10\u00a0minutes of acquiring the sample. Two other tests can be carried out on a sample from the chancre: direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. DFA uses antibodies tagged with fluorescein, which attach to specific syphilis proteins, while PCR uses techniques to detect the presence of specific syphilis genes. These tests are not as time-sensitive, as they do not require living bacteria to make the diagnosis.\nPrevention.\nVaccine.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], there is no vaccine effective for prevention. Several vaccines based on treponemal proteins reduce lesion development in an animal model but research continues.\nSex.\nCondom use reduces the likelihood of transmission during sex, but does not eliminate the risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states, \"Correct and consistent use of latex condoms can reduce the risk of syphilis only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. However, a syphilis sore outside of the area covered by a latex condom can still allow transmission, so caution should be exercised even when using a condom.\"\nAbstinence from intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective at reducing the transmission of syphilis. The CDC states, \"The surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, is to abstain from sexual contact or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected.\"\nCongenital disease.\nCongenital syphilis in the newborn can be prevented by screening mothers during early pregnancy and treating those who are infected. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends universal screening of all pregnant women, while the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all women be tested at their first antenatal visit and again in the third trimester. If they are positive, it is recommended their partners also be treated. Congenital syphilis is still common in the developing world, as many women do not receive antenatal care at all, and the antenatal care others receive does not include screening. It still occasionally occurs in the developed world, as those most likely to acquire syphilis are least likely to receive care during pregnancy. Several measures to increase access to testing appear effective at reducing rates of congenital syphilis in low- to middle-income countries. Point-of-care testing to detect syphilis appeared to be reliable, although more research is needed to assess its effectiveness and into improving outcomes in mothers and babies.\nScreening.\nThe CDC recommends that sexually active men who have sex with men be tested at least yearly. The USPSTF also recommends screening among those at high risk.\nSyphilis is a notifiable disease in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, and the United States. This means health care providers are required to notify public health authorities, which will then ideally provide partner notification to the person's partners. Physicians may also encourage patients to send their partners to seek care. Several strategies have been found to improve follow-up for STI testing, including email and text messaging of reminders for appointments.\nTreatment.\nHistoric use of mercury.\nAs a form of chemotherapy, elemental mercury had been used to treat skin diseases in Europe as early as 1363. As syphilis spread, preparations of mercury were among the first medicines used to combat it. Mercury is in fact highly anti-microbial: by the 16th century it was sometimes found to be sufficient to halt development of the disease when applied to ulcers as an inunction or when inhaled as a suffumigation. It was also treated by ingestion of mercury compounds. Once the disease had gained a strong foothold, however, the amounts and forms of mercury necessary to control its development exceeded the human body's ability to tolerate it, and the treatment became worse and more lethal than the disease. Nevertheless, medically directed mercury poisoning became widespread through the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in Europe, North America, and India. Mercury salts such as mercury (II) chloride were still in prominent medical use as late as 1916, and considered effective and worthwhile treatments.\nEarly infections.\nThe first-line treatment for uncomplicated syphilis (primary or secondary stages) remains a single dose of intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin. The bacterium is highly vulnerable to penicillin when treated early, and a treated individual is typically rendered non-infective in about 24 hours. Doxycycline and tetracycline are alternative choices for those allergic to penicillin; due to the risk of birth defects, these are not recommended for pregnant women. Resistance to macrolides, rifampicin, and clindamycin is often present. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, may be as effective as penicillin-based treatment. It is recommended that a treated person avoid sex until the sores are healed. In comparison to azithromycin for treatment in early infection, there is lack of strong evidence for superiority of azithromycin to benzathine penicillin G.\nLate infections.\nFor neurosyphilis, due to the poor penetration of benzathine penicillin into the central nervous system, those affected are given large doses of intravenous penicillin G for a minimum of 10 days. If a person is allergic to penicillin, ceftriaxone may be used or penicillin desensitization attempted. Other late presentations may be treated with once-weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin for three weeks. Treatment at this stage solely limits further progression of the disease and has a limited effect on damage which has already occurred. Serologic cure can be measured when the non-treponemal titers decline by a factor of 4 or more in 6\u201312 months in early syphilis or 12\u201324 months in late syphilis.\nJarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction.\nOne of the potential side effects of treatment is the Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction. It frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours, with symptoms of fever, muscle pains, headache, and a fast heart rate. It results from the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the immune system in response to lipoproteins released from rupturing syphilis bacteria.\nPregnancy.\nPenicillin is an effective treatment for syphilis in pregnancy but there is no agreement on which dose or route of delivery is most effective.\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2012, about 0.5% of adults were infected with syphilis, with 6\u00a0million new cases. In 1999, it is believed to have infected 12\u00a0million additional people, with greater than 90% of cases in the developing world. It affects between 700,000 and 1.6\u00a0million pregnancies a year, resulting in miscarriages, stillbirths, and congenital syphilis. During 2015, it caused about 107,000 deaths, down from 202,000 in 1990. In sub-Saharan Africa, syphilis contributes to approximately 20% of perinatal deaths. Rates are proportionally higher among intravenous drug users, those who are infected with HIV, and men who have sex with men. In the United States about 55,400 people are newly infected each year as of 2014[ [update]]. African Americans accounted for almost half of all cases in 2010. As of 2014, syphilis infections continue to increase in the United States. In the United States as of 2020, rates of syphilis have increased by more than threefold; in 2018 approximately 86% of all cases of syphilis in the United States were in men. In 2021, preliminary CDC data illustrated that 2,677 cases of congenital syphilis were found in the population of 332 million in the United States.\nSyphilis was very common in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. Flaubert found it universal among 19th-century Egyptian prostitutes. In the developed world during the early 20th century, infections declined rapidly with the widespread use of antibiotics, until the 1980s and 1990s. Since 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and Europe, primarily among men who have sex with men. Rates of syphilis among US women have remained stable during this time, while rates among UK women have increased, but at a rate less than that of men. Increased rates among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s. This has been attributed to unsafe sexual practices, such as sexual promiscuity, prostitution, and decreasing use of barrier protection.\nLeft untreated, it has a mortality rate of 8% to 58%, with a greater death rate among males. The symptoms of syphilis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th centuries, in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment, and partly due to virulence of the bacteria. With early treatment, few complications result. Syphilis increases the risk of HIV transmission by two to five times, and coinfection is common (30\u201360% in some urban centers). In 2015, Cuba became the first country to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.\nHistory.\nOrigin, spread and discovery.\nPaleopathologists have known for decades that syphilis was present in the Americas before European contact. The situation in Afro-Eurasia has been murkier and caused considerable debate. According to the Columbian theory, syphilis was brought to Spain by the men who sailed with Christopher Columbus in 1492 and spread from there, with a serious epidemic in Naples beginning as early as 1495. Contemporaries believed the disease sprang from American roots, and in the 16th century physicians wrote extensively about the new disease inflicted on them by the returning explorers.\nMost evidence supports the Columbian origin hypothesis. However, beginning in the 1960s, examples of probable treponematosis\u2014the parent disease of syphilis, bejel, and yaws\u2014in skeletal remains shifted the opinion of some towards a \"pre-Columbian\" origin. A 2024 study published in \"Nature\" supported an emergence postdating human occupation in the Americas.\nWhen living conditions changed with urbanization, elite social groups began to practice basic hygiene and started to separate themselves from other social tiers. Consequently, treponematosis was driven out of the age group in which it had become endemic. It then began to appear in adults as syphilis. Because they had never been exposed as children, they were not able to fend off serious illness. Spreading the disease via sexual contact also led to victims being infected with a massive bacterial load from open sores on the genitalia. Adults in higher socioeconomic groups then became very sick with painful and debilitating symptoms lasting for decades. Often, they died of the disease, as did their children who were infected with congenital syphilis. The difference between rural and urban populations was first noted by Ellis Herndon Hudson, a clinician who published extensively about the prevalence of treponematosis, including syphilis, in times past. The importance of bacterial load was first noted by the physician Ernest Grin in 1952 in his study of syphilis in Bosnia.\nThe most compelling evidence for the validity of the pre-Columbian hypothesis is the presence of syphilitic-like damage to bones and teeth in medieval skeletal remains. While the absolute number of cases is not large, new ones are continually discovered, most recently in 2015. At least fifteen cases of acquired treponematosis based on evidence from bones, and six examples of congenital treponematosis based on evidence from teeth, are now widely accepted. In several of the twenty-one cases the evidence may also indicate syphilis.\nIn 2020, a group of leading paleopathologists concluded that enough evidence had been collected to prove that treponemal disease, almost certainly including syphilis, had existed in Europe prior to the voyages of Columbus. There is an outstanding issue, however. Damaged teeth and bones may seem to hold proof of pre-Columbian syphilis, but there is a possibility that they point to an endemic form of treponemal disease instead. As syphilis, bejel, and yaws vary considerably in mortality rates and the level of human disease they elicit, it is important to know which one is under discussion in any given case, but it remains difficult for paleopathologists to distinguish among them. (The fourth of the treponemal diseases is pinta, a skin disease and therefore unrecoverable through paleopathology.) Ancient DNA (aDNA) holds the answer, because just as only aDNA suffices to distinguish between syphilis and other diseases that produce similar symptoms in the body, it alone can differentiate spirochetes that are 99.8 percent identical with absolute accuracy. Progress on uncovering the historical extent of syndromes through aDNA remains slow, however, because the bacterium responsible for treponematosis is rare in skeletal remains and fragile, making it notoriously difficult to recover and analyse. Precise dating to the medieval period is not yet possible but work by Kettu Majander et al. uncovering the presence of several different kinds of treponematosis at the beginning of the early modern period argues against its recent introduction from elsewhere. Therefore, they argue, treponematosis\u2014possibly including syphilis\u2014almost certainly existed in medieval Europe.\nDespite significant progress in tracing the presence of syphilis in past historic periods, definitive findings from paleopathology and aDNA studies are still lacking for the medieval period. Evidence from art is therefore helpful in settling the issue. Research by Marylynn Salmon has demonstrated that deformities in medieval subjects can be identified by comparing them to those of modern victims of syphilis in medical drawings and photographs. One of the most typical deformities, for example, is a collapsed nasal bridge called saddle nose. Salmon discovered that it appeared often in medieval illuminations, especially among the men tormenting Christ in scenes of the crucifixion. The association of saddle nose with evil is an indication that the artists were thinking of syphilis, which is typically transmitted through sexual intercourse with promiscuous partners, a mortal sin in medieval times.\nIt remains mysterious why the authors of medieval medical treatises so uniformly refrained from describing syphilis or commenting on its existence in the population. Many may have confused it with other diseases such as leprosy (Hansen's disease) or elephantiasis. The great variety of symptoms of treponematosis, the different ages at which the various diseases appear, and its widely divergent outcomes depending on climate and culture, would have added greatly to the confusion of medical practitioners, as indeed they did right down to the middle of the 20th century. In addition, evidence indicates that some writers on disease feared the political implications of discussing a condition more fatal to elites than to commoners. Historian Jon Arrizabalaga has investigated this question for Castile with startling results revealing an effort to hide its association with elites.\nThe first written records of an outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1495 in Naples, Italy, during a French invasion (Italian War of 1494\u20131495). Since it was claimed to have been spread by French troops, it was initially called the \"French disease\" by the people of Naples. The disease reached London in 1497 and was recorded at St Bartholomew's Hospital as infecting 10 out of the 20 patients. In 1530, the pastoral name \"syphilis\" (the name of a character) was first used by the Italian physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro as the title of his Latin poem in dactylic hexameter, (\"Syphilis or The French Disease\"), describing the ravages of the disease in Italy. In Great Britain it was also called the \"Great Pox\".\nIn the 16th through 19th centuries, syphilis was one of the largest public health burdens in prevalence, symptoms, and disability, although records of its true prevalence were generally not kept because of the fearsome and sordid status of sexually transmitted infections in those centuries. According to a 2020 study, more than 20% of individuals in the age range 15\u201334 years in late 18th-century London were treated for syphilis. At the time the causative agent was unknown but it was well known that it was spread sexually and also often from mother to child. Its association with sex, especially sexual promiscuity and prostitution, made it an object of fear and revulsion and a taboo. The magnitude of its morbidity and mortality in those centuries reflected that, unlike today, there was no adequate understanding of its pathogenesis and no truly effective treatments. Its damage was caused not so much by great sickness or death early in the course of the disease but rather by its gruesome effects decades after infection as it progressed to neurosyphilis with tabes dorsalis. Mercury compounds and isolation were commonly used, with treatments often worse than the disease.\nThe causative organism, \"Treponema pallidum\", was first identified by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann, in 1905. The first effective treatment for syphilis was arsphenamine, discovered by Sahachiro Hata in 1909, during a survey of hundreds of newly synthesized organic arsenical compounds led by Paul Ehrlich. It was manufactured and marketed from 1910 under the trade name Salvarsan by Hoechst AG. This organoarsenic compound was the first modern chemotherapeutic agent.\nDuring the 20th century, as both microbiology and pharmacology advanced greatly, syphilis, like many other infectious diseases, became more of a manageable burden than a scary and disfiguring mystery, at least in developed countries among those people who could afford to pay for timely diagnosis and treatment. Penicillin was discovered in 1928, and effectiveness of treatment with penicillin was confirmed in trials in 1943, at which time it became the main treatment.\nMany famous historical figures, including Franz Schubert, Arthur Schopenhauer, \u00c9douard Manet, Charles Baudelaire, and Guy de Maupassant are believed to have had the disease. Friedrich Nietzsche was long believed to have gone mad as a result of tertiary syphilis, but that diagnosis has recently come into question.\nArts and literature.\nThe earliest known depiction of an individual with syphilis is Albrecht D\u00fcrer's \"Syphilitic Man\" (1496), a woodcut believed to represent a Landsknecht, a Northern European mercenary. The myth of the or \"poison women\" of the 19th century is believed to be partly derived from the devastation of syphilis, with classic examples in literature including John Keats' .\nThe Flemish artist Stradanus designed a print called \"Preparation and Use of Guayaco for Treating Syphilis\", a scene of a wealthy man receiving treatment for syphilis with the tropical wood guaiacum sometime around 1590.\nTuskegee and Guatemala studies.\nThe \"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\" was an infamous, unethical and racist clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. Whereas the purpose of this study was to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis, the African-American men in the study were told they were receiving free treatment for \"bad blood\" from the United States government.\nThe Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Researchers enrolled 600 poor, African American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama in the study. Of these men, 399 had contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201 did not have the disease. Medical care, hot meals and free burial insurance were given to those who participated. The men were told that the study would last six months, but in the end, it continued for 40 years. After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they were only being studied and would not be treated. Facing insufficient participation, the Macon County Health Department nevertheless wrote to subjects to offer them a \"last chance\" to get a special \"treatment\", which was not a treatment at all, but a spinal tap administered exclusively for diagnostic purposes. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic had been proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told they were being treated for \"bad blood\"\u2014a colloquialism describing various conditions such as fatigue, anemia and syphilis\u2014which was a leading cause of death among southern African American men.\nThe 40-year study became a textbook example of criminally negligent medical ethics because researchers had knowingly withheld treatment with penicillin and because the subjects had been misled concerning the purposes of the study. The revelation in 1972 of these study failures by a whistleblower, Peter Buxtun, led to major changes in U.S. law and regulation on the protection of participants in clinical studies. Now studies require informed consent, communication of diagnosis, and accurate reporting of test results.\nSimilar experiments were carried out in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. It was done during the administration of American President Harry S. Truman and Guatemalan President Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo with the cooperation of some Guatemalan health ministries and officials. Doctors infected soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections, without the informed consent of the subjects and treated most subjects with antibiotics. The experiment resulted in at least 83 deaths. In October 2010, the U.S. formally apologized to Guatemala for the ethical violations that took place. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated \"Although these events occurred more than 64 years ago, we are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health. We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices.\" The experiments were led by physician John Charles Cutler who also participated in the late stages of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.\nNames.\nSyphilis was first called or the \"great pox\" by the French. Other historical names have included \"button scurvy\", sibbens, frenga, and dichuchwa, among others. Since it was a disgraceful disease, the disease was known in several countries by the name of their neighbouring, often hostile country. The English, the Germans, and the Italians called it \"the French disease\", while the French referred to it as the \"Neapolitan disease\". The Dutch called it the \"Spanish/Castilian disease\". To the Turks it was known as the \"Christian disease\", whilst in India, the Hindus and Muslims named the disease after each other.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The nuclear fission bomb was detonated in the Pokhran Test Range of the Indian Army in Rajasthan. As per the United States military intelligence, the operation was named as \"Happy Krishna\". The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) described the test as a peaceful nuclear explosion. \nThe bomb was built by scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) headed by Raja Ramanna, in assistance with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) headed by B. D. Nag Chaudhuri under the supervision of the Atomic Energy Commission headed by Homi Sethna. A CIRUS nuclear reactor given by Canada and heavy water (used as a neutron moderator) supplied by the United States were used in the production of nuclear material for the bomb. The preparations for the test and the detonation was conducted in extreme secrecy. It was tightly controlled by prime minister Indira Gandhi with very few people outside the team of scientists being aware of the test. \nThe device was of the implosion-type design with a plutonium core. It had a hexagonal cross section, in diameter, and weighed . It was assembled, mounted on a hexagonal metal tripod, and was transported to the test site on rails. The test was conducted at 8.05 IST on 18 May 1974. The data on the exact nuclear yield of the test has been varied and scarce, and sources indicate that the bomb might have yielded between six and ten kilotons.\nIt was the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The test led to the formation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to control nuclear proliferation. After the test, India carried out a series of nuclear tests named Pokhran-II in 1998.\nBackground.\nThe origins of India's nuclear programme can be traced back to 1945 when Homi Bhabha established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research with the aid of Tata Group. After Indian independence, the Atomic Energy Act was passed on 15 April 1948, that established the Indian Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC). India was involved in the development of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but ultimately did not sign it. In 1954, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was established which was responsible for the atomic energy development programme and was allocated a significant amount of the defence budget in the subsequent years. In 1956, the first nuclear reactor named \"APSARA\" became operational at Trombay, becoming the first operating reactor in Asia. A CIRUS reactor was given to India as a part of an understanding with Canada and the United States under the Atoms for Peace programme. India set up an indigenous programme to manufacture uranium nuclear fuel for the reactor, as opposed to importing from other countries. In July 1958, then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru authorized \"Project Phoenix\" to build a reprocessing plant with a capacity to produce 20 tons of plutonium fuel a year using the PUREX process, designed by the Vitro Corporation of America. The construction of the plutonium plant began in 1961, and it was commissioned in mid-1964. \nThe civilian nuclear program to produce electricity from nuclear energy was also established during this period with plans to construct new nuclear power plants for the purpose. Nehru's discussions with Bhabha and Kenneth Nichols, a US Army engineer, showed his approach and intention to create nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence. In 1962, India was engaged in a war with China and with China pursuing its own atomic development programme, it accelerated India's need to develop nuclear weapons. During this period, India signed an agreement with Soviet Union to help build nuclear reactors in India.\nDevelopment.\nWith two reactors operational in early 1960s, Bhabha was involved in learning and development of know-how to manufacture nuclear weapons. The atomic energy act was amended in 1962 to give far more control to the central government. Bhabha was also aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and made several public speeches on the matter. He also estimated that a nuclear device with a 10 kt yield would cost US$350,000. The reactors were not producing fuel at the expected rate and with Nehru's death in 1964, the programme slowed down. The incoming prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave approval for the Subterranean Nuclear Explosion Project in 1964 under Bhabha's insistence. However, Shastri did not want to commit to a weapons test yet, and later appointed physicist Vikram Sarabhai as the head of the nuclear programme. Because of Sarabhai's non-violent Gandhian beliefs, he directed the programme towards peaceful purposes rather than military development. Meanwhile, the design work on the bomb proceeded under physicist Raja Ramanna, who continued the nuclear weapons technology research after Bhabha's death in 1966.\nAfter Shastri's death in 1966, Indira Gandhi became the prime minister and work on the nuclear weapons programme resumed. Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer, was put in charge of plutonium development. The project for the design and manufacturing of the nuclear device employed just 75 scientists because of the secret nature of the project. Ramanna led the project with P. K. Iyengar serving as his deputy and the leadership team also included Sethna and Sarabhai. The weapons programme was directed towards the production of plutonium rather than uranium and then in 1969, enough plutonium had been accumulated for the production of a single nuclear bomb. In 1968\u201369, Iyengar led a team to the Soviet Union and toured the nuclear research facilities at Dubna. Upon his return to India, Iyengar set about developing a plutonium fueled fast breeder reactor named \"Purnima\" under Mahadeva Srinivasan. In 1969, R. Chidambaram was engaged for researching the use of plutonium. \nSimultaneous work on the fabrication of the bomb core and implosion design was conducted by teams led by physicist V. S. Ramamurthy. The detonation system development began in April 1970 with Pranab R. Dastidar collaborating with W. D. Patwardhan at the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (ERDL) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In July, physicist B. D. Nagchaudhuri was appointed as the scientific adviser to the Defense Minister and as Director of the DRDO. Nagchaudhuri and Ramanna worked together to recruit the team and set up the requirements necessary for a nuclear weapon test. Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) of the DRDO developed the explosive lenses for the implosion system. Srinivasan and K. Subba Rao were tasked with developing fission models and prediction of the test's efficiency. In April 1971, Nagchaudhuri appointed N. S. Venkatesan as the new Director of TBRL to help develop the implosion system. V.K. Iya was in charge of developing the neutron initiator system. In the same year, Sethna succeeded Sarabhai as the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. \nIn December 1971, during the Indo-Pakistani War, the U.S. government sent a carrier battle group led by the into the Bay of Bengal in an attempt to intimidate India. The Soviet Union responded by sending its own naval force to deter the U.S. from involving militarily. This event is indicated as a reason for India's pursuance of the nuclear programme. After India gained military and political initiative over Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, the work on building a nuclear device continued. The hardware began to be built in early 1972 and the Prime Minister authorised the development of a nuclear test device in September 1972.\nNuclear test.\nThe Indian Army was involved in the test preparations at the Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. The project was code named \"Operation Smiling Buddha\" (MEA designation: \"Pokhran-I\") while as per the United States military intelligence, the operation was named as \"Happy Krishna\". The preparations were carried by civilian scientists assisted by the Indian Army. Indira Gandhi maintained tight control of all aspects of the preparations of the test, which was conducted in extreme secrecy. Besides Gandhi, only her advisers Parmeshwar Haksar and D. P. Dhar were kept informed. Dhar had protested the test, fearing that the sanctions that would follow, would affect the Indian economy. The Indian Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram was informed only a few days prior and Swaran Singh, the Minister of External Affairs, was given only 48 hours notice. General G. G. Bewoor, Indian army chief, and Lieutenant-General T. N. Raina, the commander of Indian Western Command were the only military commanders who knew about the test. The test was called a Peaceful Nuclear Explosive (PNE). The device was detonated on 18 May 1974 at 8.05 IST with Dastidar pushing the firing button.\nThe nuclear yield of the test has been difficult to determine with unclear data provided by Indian sources. Although politicians had given multiple numbers ranging from 2\u00a0kt to 20\u00a0kt, the official yield was initially set at 12\u00a0kt. Independent seismic data from outside and analysis of the crater features indicated a lower figure. Analysts estimate the yield at 4 to 6\u00a0kt, using conventional seismic magnitude-to-yield conversion formulas. Later, both Sethna and Iyengar conceded the official yield to be an exaggeration. Iyengar has stated that the yield was 8\u201310\u00a0kt, that the device was designed to yield 10\u00a0kt, and that the yield was 8\u00a0kt \"exactly as predicted\".\nWeapon design.\nThe device was of the implosion-type design with a plutonium core, similar to \"Fat Man\", the American nuclear bomb detonated over Nagasaki in 1945. The implosion system was assembled at the TBRL of the DRDO in Chandigarh. The detonation system was developed at the HEMRL of the DRDO in Pune. The 6\u00a0kg of plutonium came from the CIRUS reactor at BARC and the neutron initiator was of the polonium\u2013beryllium type, code-named \"Flower\". The entire nuclear bomb was engineered and assembled by Indian engineers at BARC before transportation to the test site. The fully assembled device had a hexagonal cross section, in diameter, and weighed . The device was mounted on a hexagonal metal tripod, and was transported to the shaft on rails which the army kept covered with sand.\nAftermath.\nDomestic reaction.\nIndian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gained much popularity after the test, which had flagged from its heights after the 1971 war with Pakistan. The overall popularity and image of the Congress Party was enhanced and it was well received in the Indian Parliament. In 1975, Sethna, Ramanna and Nagchaudhuri were honoured with the \"Padma Vibhushan\", India's second highest civilian award. Five other project members received the \"Padma Shri\", India's fourth highest civilian award. India consistently maintained that this was a peaceful nuclear bomb test and that it had no intentions of militarising its nuclear programme, but according to independent monitors, this test was part of an accelerated Indian nuclear programme. In 1997 Raja Ramanna, speaking to the \"Press Trust of India\", maintained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Pokhran test was a bomb, I can tell you now... An explosion is an explosion, a gun is a gun, whether you shoot at someone or shoot at the ground... I just want to make clear that the test was not all that peaceful.\nInternational reaction.\nWhile India continued to state that the test was for peaceful purposes, it encountered opposition from many quarters. In reaction to the tests, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was established to check international nuclear proliferation. The NSG decided in 1992 to require full-scope IAEA safeguards for any new nuclear export deals, which effectively ruled out nuclear exports to India. It was only waived as part of the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement in 2008.\nThe plutonium used in the test had been enriched in the reactor supplied by Canada, using heavy water (used as neutron moderator) supplied by the United States. Both the countries reacted negatively, especially in light of then ongoing negotiations on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the economic aid both countries had provided to India. Canada concluded that the test violated a 1971 understanding between the two states, and froze nuclear energy assistance for the two heavy water reactors then under construction. However, the United States concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactor. New Zealand's Prime Minister Norman Kirk commented that, \"The announcement of an underground nuclear explosion by India raises more urgently than ever the need for international agreement to end all nuclear testing.\"\nPakistan did not view the test as a peaceful nuclear explosion, and cancelled scheduled talks with India. In June 1974, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said that Pakistan considered this as an intimidation and would not accept India's superiority in the subcontinent. In 2011, Pakistani nuclear physicist Pervez Hoodbhoy stated that he believed the test pressed Pakistan into developing nuclear weapons of its own.\nOther tests.\nDespite many proposals, India did not carry out further nuclear tests until 1998. Code named as \"Operation Shakti\" (officially known as Pokhran-II) was carried out at the Pokhran test site, using technology designed and built over the preceding two decades.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Shea Municipal Stadium ( ), typically shortened to Shea Stadium, was a multi-purpose stadium in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park in Queens, New York City. Opened in 1964, it was home to the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1964 to 2008, as well as the New York Jets of the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL) from 1964 to 1983.\nThe stadium was named in honor of William Shea, who was most responsible for bringing National League baseball back to New York after the Dodgers and Giants left for California in 1957. It was demolished in 2009 following the opening of the adjacent Citi Field, the ballpark built to replace it and the current home of the Mets. The former footprint of Shea Stadium is part of Citi Field's parking lots.\nHistory.\nPlanning and construction.\nThe origins of Shea Stadium go back to the relocations of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants in 1957, which left New York without a National League baseball team.\nPrior to the Dodgers' departure, New York City official Robert Moses tried to interest owner Walter O'Malley in the site as the location for a new stadium, but O'Malley refused, unable to agree on location, ownership, and lease terms. O'Malley preferred to pay construction costs himself so he could own the stadium outright. He wanted total control over revenue from parking, concessions, and other events.\nNew York City, in contrast, wanted to build the stadium, rent it, and retain the ancillary revenue rights to pay off its construction bonds. Additionally, O'Malley wanted to build his new stadium in Brooklyn, while Moses insisted on Flushing Meadows. When Los Angeles offered O'Malley what New York City would not\u2014complete ownership of a stadium\u2014he left for southern California in a preemptive bid to install the Dodgers there before a new or existing major league franchise could beat him to it. At the same time, Horace Stoneham moved his New York Giants from Manhattan's Polo Grounds to San Francisco (although he originally considered moving them to Minneapolis), ensuring that there would be two National League teams in California, and preserving the long standing rivalry with the Dodgers that continues to this day.\nIn , the National League agreed to grant an expansion franchise to the owners of the New York franchise in the abortive Continental League, provided that a new stadium be built. Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. had to personally wire all National League owners and assure them that the city would build a stadium.\nUnlike O'Malley, the owners of the franchise that would eventually become the Mets felt Queens was the logical home for their new team's ballpark. From the outset, they wanted to secure the loyalties of both Dodgers and Giants fans, and feared a team in Manhattan or Brooklyn would be seen as a \"de facto\" revival of the respective borough's former franchise, thus possibly alienating fans in the other borough. A club playing in Flushing Meadows (located roughly the same distance from Manhattan and Brooklyn) would not only likely avoid the same perception, but presumably capture the loyalty of fans in Queens as well, thus potentially confining support for the New York Yankees of the American League to their home borough of The Bronx on the mainland.\nNevertheless, Moses and William A. Shea, the New York lawyer who had led the effort to bring National League baseball back to New York, faced a problem. New York state law of the time did not allow cities to borrow money in order to build a stadium. The only way for the city to finance a stadium would be to demonstrate that the stadium could pay for itself. With this in mind, Moses and Shea proposed to have the new team pay substantial rent in order to pay off 30-year bonds. This provision would come back to haunt the Mets years later; they would never live up to that monetary commitment, and the ensuing financial woes would be an albatross around the team for years.\nOn October 6, 1961, the Mets signed a 30-year stadium lease, with an option for a 10-year renewal. Rent for what was originally budgeted as a $9 million facility was set at $450,000 annually, with a reduction of $20,000 each year until it reached $300,000 annually.\nIn their inaugural season in 1962, the expansion Mets played in the Polo Grounds, sharing the facility with the New York Titans of the upstart American Football League which had begun play in 1960. The original plans were for both teams to move to a new stadium in 1963. In October 1962, Mets official Tom Meany said, \"Only a series of blizzards or some other unforeseen trouble might hamper construction.\" That unforeseen trouble surfaced in a number of ways: the severe winter of 1962\u20131963, along with the bankruptcies of two subcontractors and labor issues. The result was that both the Mets and the football team (by then renamed the Jets) were forced to play at the Polo Grounds for one more year.\nIt was originally to be called \"Flushing Meadow Park Municipal Stadium\" \u2013 the name of the public park within which it was built \u2013 but an ultimately successful movement was launched to name it in honor of Shea.\nOpening.\nAfter 29 months of construction and $28.5 million spent, Shea Stadium opened on April 17, 1964, with the Pittsburgh Pirates beating the Mets 4\u20133 before a crowd of There were no prior exhibition games or events, and the stadium was barely finished in time for the home opener. Because of a jurisdictional dispute between Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Local 1106 of the Communications Workers of America, the telephone and telegraph wiring was not finished in time for opening day. The stadium opened five days before the 1964\u201365 New York World's Fair, across Roosevelt Avenue. Although not officially part of the fair grounds, the stadium sported steel panels on its exterior in the blue-and-orange colors of the Fair, the same team colors of the Mets. The panels were removed in 1980.\nDemolition.\nIn accordance with New York City law, in 2009 Shea Stadium was dismantled, rather than imploded. The company with the rights to sell memorabilia was given two weeks after the final game to remove seats, signage and other potentially sellable and collectible items before demolition was to begin. The seats were the first ($869 per pair plus tax, a combination of '86 and '69, the team's two World Series championship years), followed by other memorabilia such as the foul poles, dugouts, stadium signage, and the giant letters that spelled out \"SHEA\" at the front of the building.\nAfter salvaging operations concluded, demolition of the ballpark began on October 14, 2008. On October 18, the scoreboard in right field was demolished, with the bleachers, batter's eye and bullpens shortly thereafter.\nBy November 10, the field, dugouts and the rest of the field level seats had been demolished.\nOn January 31, 2009, Mets fans all over New York came to Shea Stadium for one final farewell. Fans took a tour of the site, told stories, and sang songs. The last remaining section of seats was demolished on February 18. Fans stood in awe as the remaining structure of Shea Stadium (one section of ramps) was torn down at 11:22 am.\nThe locations of Shea's home plate, pitcher's mound, and bases are marked in Citi Field's parking lot. The plaques feature engravings of the neon baseball players that graced the exterior of the stadium from 1988 onward.\nRedevelopment.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], Mets owner Steve Cohen is trying to build a park, casino and entertainment complex at the site, called Metropolitan Park, which has the support of the New York City Council and mayor Eric Adams, but is pending approval by the New York State Legislature and the New York State Gaming Commission. The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Metropolitan Park would be built on the site. Local coalition Fed Up opposes the park alienation, instead advocating for a \u201cPhoenix Meadows Vision Plan\u201d which would create public green space over the parking lot. \nStadium usage.\nBaseball.\nShea Stadium was the home of the New York Mets starting in 1964, and it hosted what would be its only All-Star Game that first year, with Johnny Callison of the Philadelphia Phillies hitting a walk-off home run in the ninth inning to win the only Mid-Summer Classic held in the Queens ballpark for the National League. A month earlier, on Father's Day, Callison's teammate, future Hall of Fame member and U.S. Senator Jim Bunning, pitched a perfect game against the Mets.\nThe stadium was often criticized by baseball purists for many reasons, even though it was retrofitted to be a baseball-only stadium after the Jets left. The upper deck was one of the highest in the majors. The lower boxes were farther from the field than similar seats in other parks because they were still on the rails that had swiveled them into position for football. Outfield seating was sparse, in part because the stadium was designed to be fully enclosed.\nAt one time, Shea's foul territory was one of the most expansive in the majors. This was very common for ballparks built during the 1960s, in part due to the need to accommodate the larger football field. This was also because, as mentioned, the stadium was designed to be fully enclosed (which never happened). However, seats added over the years in the lower level greatly reduced the size of foul territory by the dawn of the 21st century. On the plus side, Shea always had a natural grass surface, in contrast to other multi-purpose stadiums such as Three Rivers Stadium, Veterans Stadium, and Riverfront Stadium, which were built during the same era but had artificial turf.\nShea Stadium hosted postseason baseball in 1969, 1973, 1986, 1988, 1999, 2000, and 2006; it hosted the World Series in 1969, 1973, 1986, and 2000. It had the distinction of being the home of the 1969 \"Miracle Mets\"\u2014led by former Brooklyn Dodger Gil Hodges that defied 100\u20131 odds and won the World Series, after seven straight seasons in last or next-to-last place. Shea became famous for the bedlam that took place after the Mets won the decisive Game 5 of the World Series, as fans stormed the field in celebration. Similar scenes took place a few weeks earlier after the Mets clinched the National League East title, and then defeated the Atlanta Braves in the first National League Championship Series to win the pennant.\nTommie Agee, Lenny Dykstra, Todd Pratt, Robin Ventura, and Benny Agbayani hit post-season, walk-off home runs at Shea (although, while the ball hit by Ventura over the fence may have been the most famous of the postseason walk-off hits, it was famously called \"the Grand Slam Single\", because when he hit the game-winning ball over the fence, he was mobbed by his teammates before he could reach second base, and never wound up touching second base, third base and home plate. It was not ruled a home run as he never circled the bases completely. It probably made Ventura, known for his penchant for hitting grand slams, and the hit itself even more famous, because he never circled the bases, technically not making it a homer).\nAgee was the only player in the history of the ballpark to hit a fair ball into the upper deck in left field. The spot was marked with a sign featuring Agee's number 20 and the date, which was April 10, 1969. Teammate Cleon Jones said the ball was still rising when it hit the seats, so it very likely could have been the longest home run hit at Shea. It came in the second inning, and Agee hit another in the seventh over the center field wall; both solo shots were off of Montreal Expos starter Larry Jaster, and the Mets \nIn 1971, Dave Kingman \u2013 then with the San Francisco Giants and later to play for the Mets on two occasions \u2013 hit a home run that smashed off the windshield of the Giants' team bus, parked behind the left field bullpen.\nFor many years, the Mets' theme song, \"Meet the Mets\", was played at Shea before every home game. Jane Jarvis, a local jazz artist, played the popular songs on the Thomas organ at Mets games for many years at the stadium.\nOn October 3, 2004, it was the venue for the last game in the history of the Montreal Expos, and the Mets won 8\u20131. Montreal's major league story ended where it had started 35 years earlier: at Shea Stadium. The following year, the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., and became the Nationals.\nThe last game played at Shea Stadium was a 4\u20132 loss to the Florida Marlins on September 28, 2008. However, the Mets were in the thick of the playoff chase until the last day. A win would have meant another game for Shea as the Mets were scheduled to play the Milwaukee Brewers in a one-game playoff for the National League Wild Card berth. Following the game, there was a \"Shea Goodbye\" tribute in which many players from the Mets' glory years entered the stadium and touched home plate one final time so that fans could pay their last respects to the players and the stadium the Mets called home for 45 years. The ceremony ended with Tom Seaver throwing a final pitch to Mike Piazza; then, as the Beatles' \"In My Life\" played on the stadium speakers, the two former Met stars walked out of the centerfield gate and closed it behind them, followed by a display of blue and orange fireworks set to Fanfare for the Common Man.\nThree National League Division Series were played at Shea Stadium. The Mets won all three, and never lost a Division Series game at Shea.\nSeven National League Championship Series were played at Shea Stadium.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The decisive seventh game of this series was played at Shea Stadium, marking the only time that the Mets lost the deciding game of a National League Championship Series at Shea.\nFour World Series were played in Shea Stadium.\nThe Yankees' World Series win in 2000 was the only time that a visiting team won a World Series at Shea Stadium. The Mets won both their World Series titles at Shea Stadium (in Game 5 in 1969, and Game 7 in 1986).\nThe New York Yankees played their home games in Shea Stadium during the 1974 and 1975 seasons while Yankee Stadium was being renovated. The move to Shea was helped by the city and the Mets, with the former helping in setting up office space in Flushing Meadows Park. Joe DiMaggio participated in his final Old Timers Day game in 1975 at Shea.\nOn the afternoon of April 15, 1998, the Yankees also played one home game at Shea, against the Anaheim Angels after a beam collapsed at Yankee Stadium two days before, destroying several rows of seats. With the Mets playing a game at Shea that evening against the Chicago Cubs, the Yankees used the visitor's locker room and dugout and the Angels used the home dugout and old locker room of the New York Jets. Former Mets star Darryl Strawberry, by then playing for the Yankees, hit a home run during the game. Stadium operators partially raised the Mets' home run apple signal before lowering it back down, to the delight of the crowd. The Yankees won the game, 6\u20133.\nShea Stadium also hosted the first extra-inning regular season baseball opener played in New York, on March 31, 1998, when the Mets opened their season against their rival Philadelphia Phillies, playing the longest scoreless opening day game in the National League and the longest one in Major League Baseball since 1926. The Mets won the game 1\u20130 in the bottom of the 14th inning.\nDuring the 1977 New York City blackout the stadium was plunged into darkness at approximately 9:30\u00a0p.m. during a game between the Mets and the Chicago Cubs. It occurred during the bottom of the sixth inning, with the Mets trailing the Cubs 2\u20131 and Lenny Randle at bat. Jane Jarvis, Shea's organist (affectionately known as Shea's \"Queen of Melody\") played \"Jingle Bells\" and \"White Christmas\". The game was eventually completed on September 16, with the Cubs defeating the Mets 5\u20132.\nBoxing.\nShea Stadium held boxing matches in the mid-1960s.\nFootball.\nThe New York Jets of the American Football League and later, the National Football League played at Shea for 20 seasons, from 1964 through 1983 (excluding their first home game in 1977, played at Giants Stadium). The stadium hosted three Jets playoff games: the AFL Championship in 1968 (defeating the Oakland Raiders, 27\u201323), an AFL Inter-Divisional Playoff in 1969 (a 13\u20136 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs) and the 1981 AFC Wild Card Playoff game (lost 31\u201327 to the Buffalo Bills).\nFor most of the Jets' tenure at Shea, they were burdened by onerous lease terms imposed at the insistence of the Mets. Until 1978, the Jets could not play their first home game until the Mets' season was finished. For instance, in 1969, the defending Super Bowl champion Jets did not play a home game until October 20 due to the Mets advancing to (and winning) the World Series. As a result, the 1969 Jets opened with five consecutive road games, and then played all seven home games in consecutive weeks before closing with two road games. Even after 1978, the Mets' status as Shea's primary tenants would require the Jets to go on long road trips (switching Shea from baseball to football configuration was a complex process involving electrical, plumbing, field, and other similar work). The stadium was also not well maintained in the 1970s. The Jets moved to Giants Stadium for the 1984 season, enticed by the more than 15,000 additional seats there. Fans ripped apart Shea after the last game of the 1983 season, which also was the last game for Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw, who threw two touchdown passes to lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 34\u20137 victory. Even the scoreboard operator had a field day, displaying the home team as the \"N.J. Jets\".\nIt was at Shea Stadium on December 16, 1973, that O. J. Simpson became the first running back to gain 2,000 yards in a single season (and, to date, the only player to do it in 14 games or fewer). In the 1983 season, a Jets game against the Los Angeles Rams featured an 85-yard touchdown run by rookie Eric Dickerson, as well as a brawl between Rams offensive tackle Jackie Slater and Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau when Slater blindsided Gastineau after the Jet performed his infamous \"Sack Dance\" over fallen Rams quarterback Vince Ferragamo.\nThe NFL's New York Giants played their 1975 season at Shea while Giants Stadium was being built. The Giants were 5\u20139 that year (2\u20135 at Shea). Their coach was Bill Arnsparger and their quarterback was Craig Morton. The Giants played their final five home games of 1973 and all seven in 1974 at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut; Yankee Stadium was closed in October 1973 for a massive renovation, which was completed in time for the 1976 baseball season.\nOn the night of October 9, 1965, Shea Stadium hosted the football rivalry between Army and Notre Dame for the only time. The Fighting Irish blanked the Cadets, 17\u20130, beginning a 15-game winning streak for Notre Dame in the storied series.\nIn 1966, the Brooklyn Dodgers of the minor Continental Football League unsuccessfully sued the Jets in an attempt to use the stadium; the team wound up playing on Randall's Island and soon folded. In 1974, the New York Stars of the nascent World Football League also made inquiries to play at Shea, whose schedule was already overcrowded by the Mets, Jets and Yankees (and the following year, the Giants; see below). The Stars also moved out to Randall's Island, playing only a handful of games before shifting to Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThe football field at Shea extended from around home plate to centerfield, with the baseline seating rotating out to fill left and right fields.\nSoccer.\nThe first soccer game at Shea Stadium occurred during International Soccer League tournament play on June 17, 1965.\nThe original New York Cosmos beat the Washington Diplomats, 2\u20130, in an NASL playoff game at Shea on August 17, 1976.\nNew York United of the American Soccer League called Shea home in 1980.\nConcerts.\nOn Sunday, August 15, 1965, The Beatles opened their 1965 North American tour there to a record audience of 55,600. \"Beatlemania\" was at one of its peaks at their Shea concert. Film footage shows many teenagers and women crying, screaming, and even fainting. The crowd noise was such that security guards can be seen covering their ears as the Beatles entered the field. The sound of the crowd was so deafening that none of the Beatles (or anyone else) could hear what they were playing. Nevertheless, it was the first concert to be held at a major stadium and set records for attendance and revenue generation, demonstrating that outdoor concerts on a large scale could be successful and profitable, and led the Beatles to return to Shea for a successful encore on August 23, 1966.\nThe next major music event to play Shea Stadium after the Beatles' successful appearances was the Summer Festival for Peace on August 6, 1970. It was a day-long fundraiser, which featured many of the era's biggest-selling and seminal rock, folk, blues and jazz performers including: Janis Joplin, Paul Simon, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Steppenwolf, The James Gang, Miles Davis, Tom Paxton, John Sebastian, and others.\nThe next music show at Shea Stadium was the historic concert by Grand Funk Railroad in 1971, which broke the Beatles' then-record for fastest ticket sales. Humble Pie was the opening band. The same filmmakers for the documentary of the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont were commissioned to film it, but to date, a final film has not been released.\nThe stadium subsequently hosted numerous concerts, including Jethro Tull with opening act Robin Trower in July 1976 (billed as Tull v. Boeing because of the proximity to LaGuardia Airport), The Who with opening acts The Clash and David Johansen in October 1982 (two concerts), and Simon &amp; Garfunkel in August 1983. On August 18, 1983, The Police played in front of 70,000 fans at Shea, a concert that the band's singer and bassist Sting described as \"like playing the top of Everest\", and announced near the end of the concert: \"We'd like to thank the Beatles for lending us their stadium.\" The Rolling Stones performed at Shea for a six-night run in October 1989, and Elton John and Eric Clapton played a concert in August 1992. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band ended The Rising Tour with three concerts at Shea in early October 2003, with Bob Dylan making a special guest appearance at the final show to perform \"Highway 61 Revisited\" with Springsteen.\nThe last concert event was a two-night engagement by Billy Joel on July 16 and 18, 2008. The concert was dubbed \"The Last Play at Shea\", and featured many special guest appearances, including former Beatle Paul McCartney who closed the second show with an emotional rendition of the Beatles classic \"Let It Be\". Other artists that joined Joel on stage for the shows were former Shea performer Roger Daltrey of The Who, Tony Bennett, Don Henley, John Mayer, John Mellencamp, Garth Brooks, and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. The concert was the subject of a documentary film of the same name, which is used along with Shea's history to tell the story of changes in American suburban life.\nPete Flynn was a Shea groundskeeper who did the improbable by driving the Beatles from the stage to a centerfield gate in 1965, then driving Paul McCartney from the stadium's rear entrance to the stage to perform at Billy Joel's \"Last Play at Shea\" concert 43 years later in 2008.\nOther events.\nThe 1978 International Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses was held at Shea Stadium from July 12 to 16, 1978.\nDuring his tour of America in October 1979, Pope John Paul II was also among those hosted by Shea Stadium. On the morning of the Pontiff's visit, Shea Stadium was awash in torrential rain, causing ankle-deep mud puddles, and threatened to ruin the event. But as the Popemobile entered the stadium, the rain stopped although the deep mud remained.\nOn December 9, 1979, as part of the halftime show of a National Football League game between the New York Jets and New England Patriots, a model airplane group put on a remote control airplane display. The grand finale was a remote control airplane, weighing 40\u00a0lbs, made to look like a red flying lawnmower. The pilot lost control of the airplane, and it crashed into the stands, hitting Kevin Rourke, of Lynn, Massachusetts and John Bowen of Nashua, New Hampshire. Both suffered serious head injuries; Rourke survived but Bowen died four days later.\nBetween 1972 and 1980, Shea also hosted a Showdown at Shea event three separate times, by the then World Wrestling Federation. In 1980, it hosted a simulcast of the first fight between Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard, won by Duran.\nFrom 1970 to 1987, the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) played its annual all-star game at various major league stadiums. The games were interleague contests between the CCBL and the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL). The 1982 and 1986 games were played at Shea. The 1986 contest starred game MVP and future Cincinnati Reds all-star pitcher Jack Armstrong.\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the stadium became a staging area for rescuers, its parking lots filled with food, water, medical supplies, even makeshift shelters where relief workers could sleep. Ten days later Shea reopened for the first post-attack sporting event in New York where the Mets beat the Braves, behind a dramatic home run by Mets catcher Mike Piazza.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the television serial drama \"Mad Men\", the main character, Don Draper, has his secretary buy a pair of tickets for the Beatles' concert at Shea Stadium in 1965.\nThe Rutles film \"All You Need is Cash\" refers to the ballpark as Che Stadium, \"named after the Cuban guerilla leader, Che Stadium.\"\nIn the 1966-1968 live action Batman TV series, Shea Stadium was parodied as Spayed Stadium in the episode \"Catwoman Goes to College\".\nIn 1987, Marvel Comics rented Shea Stadium to re-enact the wedding of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson.\nIn the 2007 documentary series \"Seven Ages of Rock\", Shea Stadium was named the most hallowed venue in all of rock music.\nIn \"\", the stadium was destroyed in a fight between Godzilla and Crackler.\nShea Stadium was used for filming the 1973 movie \"Bang The Drum Slowly\" starring Robert De Niro and Michael Moriarty and the 1978 film \"The Wiz\". In the latter film, the exterior pedestrian ramps were used for a motorcycle chase scene with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross.\nA scene in the 2002 movie \"Two Weeks Notice\" takes place at Shea.\nIn \"Men in Black\", a Mets game at Shea was featured in the film, with outfielder Bernard Gilkey dropping a fly ball after being distracted by an alien spacecraft in the sky. Shea was also featured in \"Men in Black 3\" which is where K and J intercept Griffin and the ArcNet in 1969 before Boris the Animal can capture it.\nShea Stadium was also the setting for two episodes of \"The King of Queens\": \"Doug Out\" (1999) and \"Catching Hell\" (2005).\nThe exterior part of the Stadium is featured in the 2006 videogame \"\".\n1975: Four teams, one year and one stadium.\nThe Mets, Yankees, Jets and Giants all called Shea home in 1975, the only time in professional sports history that two baseball teams and two football teams shared the same facility in the same year.\nAs Yankee Stadium was being renovated and Giants Stadium was nearing completion, there were scheduling clashes between the four teams once the calendar turned to September. Neither the Jets nor the Giants could play \"home\" games at Shea Stadium until the baseball season ended for the Mets and Yankees. The matter was simplified when neither baseball team qualified for the postseason; still, there was a two-week overlap as the NFL season started on Sunday, September 21 while the MLB campaign ended on Sunday, September 28. This meant the Jets opened at home on Sunday, October 5, the third week of the season, and the Giants on Sunday, October 12, the season's fourth week. It also meant that the Giants and Jets had to play a combined 14 home games in the final 12 weeks of the 14-week NFL season. To do so, the Giants played two Saturday afternoon home games, neither of which were televised, and both of which were played the day before a Jets' Sunday home game. New York football fans thus enjoyed either the Jets or the Giants hosting a Sunday home game every weekend from October 5 through December 21. Shea wound up hosting all four teams on consecutive Sundays: Mets (September 21), Yankees (September 28), Jets (October 5) and Giants (October 12).\nIn total, the \"Big Four\" drew 3,738,546 customers to Shea: 1,730,566 by the Mets (76 home dates); 1,288,048 by the Yankees (71 home dates); 361,102 by the Jets (seven home games) and 358,830 by the Giants (also seven). Having both the Giants and Jets share Shea Stadium for one season foreshadowed what was to come in the future with the Meadowlands, after the Jets left Flushing Meadows for New Jersey following the 1983 NFL season. \nFeatures.\nDesign.\nShea was a circular stadium, with the grandstand forming about two-thirds of a circle around the field and ending a short distance beyond the foul lines. The remainder of the perimeter was mostly empty space beyond the outfield fences. This space was occupied by the bullpens, scoreboards, and a section of bleachers beyond the left field fence. The stadium boasted 54 restrooms, 21 escalators, seats for 57,343 fans (although as seating configuration changed constantly over the life of the stadium, that number varied often, dropping to 55,601 by the 1986 World Series, and then increased again over following years to between approximately 56,000 and 57,000, until its closing), and a massive 86' x 175' scoreboard. Also, rather than the standard light towers, Shea featured lamps along its upper reaches. Some deemed Shea a showplace, praised for its convenience, even its \"elegance\". The stadium's scoreboard in right field, one of the largest in MLB when it opened, weighed over 60 tons. One of its distinctive features was a giant rearview slide projector screen on the top center of the scoreboard; it was intended to display a picture of the current player at bat (a groundbreaking innovation at the time); however, due to lighting issues (it only worked at night when the light was really low; during day games, the picture would not show up at all), it was not used very often and was eventually covered with a giant Mets logo (or a Jets logo when they played).\nThe stadium was located close to LaGuardia Airport. For many years, interruptions for planes flying overhead were common at Shea; the noise was so loud that radio and television broadcasts could not be heard. Players would usually ask for time during noisy flight approaches and takeoffs.\nShea was originally designed with two motor-operated stands that allow the field level seats to rotate on underground tracks, allowing the stadium to be converted between a baseball and an American football/soccer configuration. In 1981, a new Mitsubishi DiamondVision screen was installed in left field. After the New York Jets football team moved to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1984, the Mets took over operation of the stadium and retrofitted it for exclusive baseball use. As part of the refitting, Shea Stadium's exterior was painted blue and neon signs of baseball player silhouettes were added to the windscreens prior to the 1988 season. Around the same time, the original scoreboard was removed, and a new one installed in its place (fitting into the shell left behind by the old one) allowing for a much greater space for information and entertainment after the original message board above the main scoreboard was covered up by the Budweiser advertisement in 1982. Also, after years of injuries to players crashing into the wooden outfield wall, most notably to 1973 star player Rusty Staub, where one injury caused a dislocated shoulder and forced him to miss or play severely injured during that Championship Season, the original wall finally had padding added to it, as most in baseball already did, greatly reducing injuries to outfielders.\nBanks of ramps that provided access from the ground to the upper levels were built around the outside circumference of the stadium. The ramps were not walled in and were visible from outside the stadium. The ramps were originally partly covered with many rectangular panels in blue and orange, the Mets' colors. These panels can be seen in the 1970s movie \"The Wiz\", which used the exterior pedestrian ramps for a motorcycle chase scene with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. The 1960s-style decorations were removed in 1980. The banks of ramps resulted in the outer wall of the stadium jutting out where the banks existed.\nThe design also allowed for Shea Stadium to be expandable to 90,000 seats, simply by completely enclosing the grandstand. It was also designed to be later enclosed by a dome if warranted. In March 1965, a plan was formally announced to add a glass dome and add 15,000 seats. The Mets strongly objected to the proposal. The idea was later dropped after engineering studies concluded that the stadium's foundation would be unable to support the weight of the dome.\nThe distances to the right and left field foul poles were initially both . There was a horizontal orange line that determined where a batted ball was a home run or still in play. In 1978, Manager Joe Torre suggested moving in the fences to in the corners with a wall in front of the original brick wall, to decrease the number of disputed calls.\nOriginally, all of the seats were wooden, with each level having a different color. The field boxes were yellow, the loge level seats were brown, the mezzanine seats were blue, and the upper deck seats were green. Each level above the field level was divided into box seats below the entrance/exit portals and reserved seats above the portals. The box seats were a darker shade than the reserved seats. The game ticket was the same color as the seat that it represented, and the signs in the lobby for that section were the same color as the seat and the ticket. Before the 1980 baseball season, they were replaced with red (upper deck), green (mezzanine), blue (loge), and orange (field level) plastic seats.\nUnlike Yankee Stadium, Shea was built on an open field, so there was no need to have it conform to the surrounding streets.\nBefore Shea Stadium closed in 2008, it was the only stadium in the major leagues with orange foul poles. This tradition is carried on at Citi Field as the foul poles there are the same color.\nIn 2003, large murals celebrating the Mets' two world championships were added, covering the two ends of the grandstand. The 1986 mural was removed after the 2006 season because of deterioration (the wall was re-painted solid blue, and a window was opened on the mezzanine level where fans could view the progress of Citi Field), but the 1969 mural survived until the final game at the end of 2008.\nWith its refurbishment in 1988, the scoreboard was topped by a representation of the New York Skyline, a prominent part of the team logo. After the September 11 terrorist attack, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were kept unlit, with a red-white-and-blue ribbon placed over them. The scoreboard was demolished in October 2008, but the skyline was preserved and is now located on the Shake Shack in Citi Field's \"Taste Of The City\" food court behind the giant scoreboard in center field.\nDuring the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the construction of Citi Field was visible beyond the left and center field walls of Shea.\nFrom 1973 to 1979, fans could estimate the distance of home run balls, since there were several signs beyond the outfield wall giving the distance in feet from home plate, in addition to the nine markers within the field.\nHome Run Apple.\nThe Home Run Apple came out of a magic hat after every Mets home run at Shea Stadium. It was first installed in May 1980 as a symbol of the Mets' advertising slogan \"The Magic Is Back!\" (the hat originally said \"Mets Magic\" in script but was changed in the mid-1980s to a simple \"Home Run\" in block capital letters). A bigger apple was placed in center field at Citi Field. The original apple was installed inside Citi Field's bullpen gate and was visible from outside, on 126th Street. In 2010, the original Shea apple was relocated outside the Citi Field, in front of the Jackie Robinson Rotunda.\nSeating capacity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHomages.\nFour players in the National League named their children after Shea Stadium.\nJon Matlock, who played center for the Jets at the stadium, named his daughter Shea.

{"id": "28857", "revid": "13266769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28857", "title": "Signal transduction", "text": "Cascade of intracellular and molecular events for transmission/amplification of signals\nSignal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events. Proteins responsible for detecting stimuli are generally termed receptors, although in some cases the term sensor is used. The changes elicited by ligand binding (or signal sensing) in a receptor give rise to a biochemical cascade, which is a chain of biochemical events known as a signaling pathway.\nWhen signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks, which allow cellular responses to be coordinated, often by combinatorial signaling events. At the molecular level, such responses include changes in the transcription or translation of genes, and post-translational and conformational changes in proteins, as well as changes in their location. These molecular events are the basic mechanisms controlling cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and many other processes. In multicellular organisms, signal transduction pathways regulate cell communication in a wide variety of ways.\nEach component (or node) of a signaling pathway is classified according to the role it plays with respect to the initial stimulus. Ligands are termed \"first messengers\", while receptors are the \"signal transducers\", which then activate \"primary effectors\". Such effectors are typically proteins and are often linked to second messengers, which can activate \"secondary effectors\", and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules. As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay, noise, signal feedback and feedforward and interference, which can range from negligible to pathological. With the advent of computational biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and disease, including signaling rewiring mechanisms underlying responses to acquired drug resistance.\nStimuli.\nThe basis for signal transduction is the transformation of a certain stimulus into a biochemical signal. The nature of such stimuli can vary widely, ranging from extracellular cues, such as the presence of EGF, to intracellular events, such as the DNA damage resulting from replicative telomere attrition. Traditionally, signals that reach the central nervous system are classified as senses. These are transmitted from neuron to neuron in a process called synaptic transmission. Many other intercellular signal relay mechanisms exist in multicellular organisms, such as those that govern embryonic development.\nLigands.\nThe majority of signal transduction pathways involve the binding of signaling molecules, known as ligands, to receptors that trigger events inside the cell. The binding of a signaling molecule with a receptor causes a change in the conformation of the receptor, known as \"receptor activation\". Most ligands are soluble molecules from the extracellular medium which bind to cell surface receptors. These include growth factors, cytokines and neurotransmitters. Components of the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin and hyaluronan can also bind to such receptors (integrins and CD44, respectively). In addition, some molecules such as steroid hormones are lipid-soluble and thus cross the plasma membrane to reach cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors. In the case of steroid hormone receptors, their stimulation leads to binding to the promoter region of steroid-responsive genes.\nNot all classifications of signaling molecules take into account the molecular nature of each class member. For example, odorants belong to a wide range of molecular classes, as do neurotransmitters, which range in size from small molecules such as dopamine to neuropeptides such as endorphins. Moreover, some molecules may fit into more than one class, e.g. epinephrine is a neurotransmitter when secreted by the central nervous system and a hormone when secreted by the adrenal medulla.\nSome receptors such as HER2 are capable of ligand-independent activation when overexpressed or mutated. This leads to constitutive activation of the pathway, which may or may not be overturned by compensation mechanisms. In the case of HER2, which acts as a dimerization partner of other EGFRs, constitutive activation leads to hyperproliferation and cancer.\nMechanical forces.\nThe prevalence of basement membranes in the tissues of eumetazoans means that most cell types require attachment to survive. This requirement has led to the development of complex mechanotransduction pathways, allowing cells to sense the stiffness of the substratum. Such signaling is mainly orchestrated in focal adhesions, regions where the integrin-bound actin cytoskeleton detects changes and transmits them downstream through YAP1. Calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins and selectins can also mediate mechanotransduction. Specialised forms of mechanotransduction within the nervous system are responsible for mechanosensation: hearing, touch, proprioception and balance.\nOsmolarity.\nCellular and systemic control of osmotic pressure (the difference in osmolarity between the cytosol and the extracellular medium) is critical for homeostasis. There are three ways in which cells can detect osmotic stimuli: as changes in macromolecular crowding, ionic strength, and changes in the properties of the plasma membrane or cytoskeleton (the latter being a form of mechanotransduction). These changes are detected by proteins known as osmosensors or osmoreceptors. In humans, the best characterised osmosensors are transient receptor potential channels present in the primary cilium of human cells. In yeast, the HOG pathway has been extensively characterised.\nTemperature.\nThe sensing of temperature in cells is known as thermoception and is primarily mediated by transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, animal cells contain a conserved mechanism to prevent high temperatures from causing cellular damage, the heat-shock response. Such response is triggered when high temperatures cause the dissociation of inactive HSF1 from complexes with heat shock proteins Hsp40/Hsp70 and Hsp90. With help from the ncRNA \"hsr1\", HSF1 then trimerizes, becoming active and upregulating the expression of its target genes. Many other thermosensory mechanisms exist in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\nLight.\nIn mammals, light controls the sense of sight and the circadian clock by activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone cells. In the case of the circadian clock, a different photopigment, melanopsin, is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.\nReceptors.\nReceptors can be roughly divided into two major classes: intracellular and extracellular receptors.\nExtracellular receptors.\nExtracellular receptors are integral transmembrane proteins and make up most receptors. They span the plasma membrane of the cell, with one part of the receptor on the outside of the cell and the other on the inside. Signal transduction occurs as a result of a ligand binding to the outside region of the receptor (the ligand does not pass through the membrane). Ligand-receptor binding induces a change in the conformation of the inside part of the receptor, a process sometimes called \"receptor activation\". This results in either the activation of an enzyme domain of the receptor or the exposure of a binding site for other intracellular signaling proteins within the cell, eventually propagating the signal through the cytoplasm.\nIn eukaryotic cells, most intracellular proteins activated by a ligand/receptor interaction possess an enzymatic activity; examples include tyrosine kinase and phosphatases. Often, such enzymes are covalently linked to the receptor. Some of them create second messengers such as cyclic AMP and IP3, the latter controlling the release of intracellular calcium stores into the cytoplasm. Other activated proteins interact with adaptor proteins that facilitate signaling protein interactions and coordination of signaling complexes necessary to respond to a particular stimulus. Enzymes and adaptor proteins are both responsive to various second messenger molecules.\nMany adaptor proteins and enzymes activated as part of signal transduction possess specialized protein domains that bind to specific secondary messenger molecules. For example, calcium ions bind to the EF hand domains of calmodulin, allowing it to bind and activate calmodulin-dependent kinase. PIP3 and other phosphoinositides do the same thing to the Pleckstrin homology domains of proteins such as the kinase protein AKT.\nG protein\u2013coupled receptors.\nG protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of integral transmembrane proteins that possess seven transmembrane domains and are linked to a heterotrimeric G protein. With nearly 800 members, this is the largest family of membrane proteins and receptors in mammals. Counting all animal species, they total over 5000. Mammalian GPCRs are classified into five major families: rhodopsin-like, secretin-like, metabotropic glutamate, adhesion and frizzled/smoothened, with a few GPCR groups being difficult to classify due to low sequence similarity, e.g. vomeronasal receptors. Other classes exist in eukaryotes, such as the \"Dictyostelium\" cyclic AMP receptors and fungal mating pheromone receptors.\nSignal transduction by a GPCR begins with an inactive G protein coupled to the receptor; the G protein exists as a heterotrimer consisting of G\u03b1, G\u03b2, and G\u03b3 subunits. Once the GPCR recognizes a ligand, the conformation of the receptor changes to activate the G protein, causing G\u03b1 to bind a molecule of GTP and dissociate from the other two G-protein subunits. The dissociation exposes sites on the subunits that can interact with other molecules. The activated G protein subunits detach from the receptor and initiate signaling from many downstream effector proteins such as phospholipases and ion channels, the latter permitting the release of second messenger molecules. The total strength of signal amplification by a GPCR is determined by the lifetimes of the ligand-receptor complex and receptor-effector protein complex and the deactivation time of the activated receptor and effectors through intrinsic enzymatic activity; e.g. via protein kinase phosphorylation or b-arrestin-dependent internalization.\nA study was conducted where a point mutation was inserted into the gene encoding the chemokine receptor CXCR2; mutated cells underwent a malignant transformation due to the expression of CXCR2 in an active conformation despite the absence of chemokine-binding. This meant that chemokine receptors can contribute to cancer development.\nTyrosine, Ser/Thr and Histidine-specific protein kinases.\nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins with an intracellular kinase domain and an extracellular domain that binds ligands; examples include growth factor receptors such as the insulin receptor. To perform signal transduction, RTKs need to form dimers in the plasma membrane; the dimer is stabilized by ligands binding to the receptor. The interaction between the cytoplasmic domains stimulates the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the intracellular kinase domains of the RTKs, causing conformational changes. Subsequent to this, the receptors' kinase domains are activated, initiating phosphorylation signaling cascades of downstream cytoplasmic molecules that facilitate various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and metabolism. Many Ser/Thr and dual-specificity protein kinases are important for signal transduction, either acting downstream of [receptor tyrosine kinases], or as membrane-embedded or cell-soluble versions in their own right. The process of signal transduction involves around 560 known protein kinases and pseudokinases, encoded by the human kinome\nAs is the case with GPCRs, proteins that bind GTP play a major role in signal transduction from the activated RTK into the cell. In this case, the G proteins are members of the Ras, Rho, and Raf families, referred to collectively as small G proteins. They act as molecular switches usually tethered to membranes by isoprenyl groups linked to their carboxyl ends. Upon activation, they assign proteins to specific membrane subdomains where they participate in signaling. Activated RTKs in turn activate small G proteins that activate guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as SOS1. Once activated, these exchange factors can activate more small G proteins, thus amplifying the receptor's initial signal. The mutation of certain RTK genes, as with that of GPCRs, can result in the expression of receptors that exist in a constitutively activated state; such mutated genes may act as oncogenes.\nHistidine-specific protein kinases are structurally distinct from other protein kinases and are found in prokaryotes, fungi, and plants as part of a two-component signal transduction mechanism: a phosphate group from ATP is first added to a histidine residue within the kinase, then transferred to an aspartate residue on a receiver domain on a different protein or the kinase itself, thus activating the aspartate residue.\nIntegrins.\nIntegrins are produced by a wide variety of cells; they play a role in cell attachment to other cells and the extracellular matrix and in the transduction of signals from extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of integrins changes the protein's conformation, clustering it at the cell membrane to initiate signal transduction. Integrins lack kinase activity; hence, integrin-mediated signal transduction is achieved through a variety of intracellular protein kinases and adaptor molecules, the main coordinator being integrin-linked kinase. As shown in the adjacent picture, cooperative integrin-RTK signaling determines the timing of cellular survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation.\nImportant differences exist between integrin-signaling in circulating blood cells and non-circulating cells such as epithelial cells; integrins of circulating cells are normally inactive. For example, cell membrane integrins on circulating leukocytes are maintained in an inactive state to avoid epithelial cell attachment; they are activated only in response to stimuli such as those received at the site of an inflammatory response. In a similar manner, integrins at the cell membrane of circulating platelets are normally kept inactive to avoid thrombosis. Epithelial cells (which are non-circulating) normally have active integrins at their cell membrane, helping maintain their stable adhesion to underlying stromal cells that provide signals to maintain normal functioning.\nIn plants, there are no bona fide integrin receptors identified to date; nevertheless, several integrin-like proteins were proposed based on structural homology with the metazoan receptors. Plants contain integrin-linked kinases that are very similar in their primary structure with the animal ILKs. In the experimental model plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\", one of the integrin-linked kinase genes, \"ILK1\", has been shown to be a critical element in the plant immune response to signal molecules from bacterial pathogens and plant sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress. ILK1 protein interacts with the high-affinity potassium transporter HAK5 and with the calcium sensor CML9.\nToll-like receptors.\nWhen activated, toll-like receptors (TLRs) take adapter molecules within the cytoplasm of cells in order to propagate a signal. Four adaptor molecules are known to be involved in signaling, which are Myd88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM. These adapters activate other intracellular molecules such as IRAK1, IRAK4, TBK1, and IKKi that amplify the signal, eventually leading to the induction or suppression of genes that cause certain responses. Thousands of genes are activated by TLR signaling, implying that this method constitutes an important gateway for gene modulation.\nLigand-gated ion channels.\nA ligand-gated ion channel, upon binding with a ligand, changes conformation to open a channel in the cell membrane through which ions relaying signals can pass. An example of this mechanism is found in the receiving cell of a neural synapse. The influx of ions that occurs in response to the opening of these channels induces action potentials, such as those that travel along nerves, by depolarizing the membrane of post-synaptic cells, resulting in the opening of voltage-gated ion channels.\nAn example of an ion allowed into the cell during a ligand-gated ion channel opening is Ca2+; it acts as a second messenger initiating signal transduction cascades and altering the physiology of the responding cell. This results in amplification of the synapse response between synaptic cells by remodelling the dendritic spines involved in the synapse.\nIntracellular receptors.\nIntracellular receptors, such as nuclear receptors and cytoplasmic receptors, are soluble proteins localized within their respective areas. The typical ligands for nuclear receptors are non-polar hormones like the steroid hormones testosterone and progesterone and derivatives of vitamins A and D. To initiate signal transduction, the ligand must pass through the plasma membrane by passive diffusion. On binding with the receptor, the ligands pass through the nuclear membrane into the nucleus, altering gene expression.\nActivated nuclear receptors attach to the DNA at receptor-specific hormone-responsive element (HRE) sequences, located in the promoter region of the genes activated by the hormone-receptor complex. Due to their enabling gene transcription, they are alternatively called inductors of gene expression. All hormones that act by regulation of gene expression have two consequences in their mechanism of action; their effects are produced after a characteristically long period of time and their effects persist for another long period of time, even after their concentration has been reduced to zero, due to a relatively slow turnover of most enzymes and proteins that would either deactivate or terminate ligand binding onto the receptor.\nNucleic receptors have DNA-binding domains containing zinc fingers and a ligand-binding domain; the zinc fingers stabilize DNA binding by holding its phosphate backbone. DNA sequences that match the receptor are usually hexameric repeats of any kind; the sequences are similar but their orientation and distance differentiate them. The ligand-binding domain is additionally responsible for dimerization of nucleic receptors prior to binding and providing structures for transactivation used for communication with the translational apparatus.\nSteroid receptors are a subclass of nuclear receptors located primarily within the cytosol. In the absence of steroids, they associate in an aporeceptor complex containing chaperone or heatshock proteins (HSPs). The HSPs are necessary to activate the receptor by assisting the protein to fold in a way such that the signal sequence enabling its passage into the nucleus is accessible. Steroid receptors, on the other hand, may be repressive on gene expression when their transactivation domain is hidden. Receptor activity can be enhanced by phosphorylation of serine residues at their N-terminal as a result of another signal transduction pathway, a process called crosstalk.\nRetinoic acid receptors are another subset of nuclear receptors. They can be activated by an endocrine-synthesized ligand that entered the cell by diffusion, a ligand synthesised from a precursor like retinol brought to the cell through the bloodstream or a completely intracellularly synthesised ligand like prostaglandin. These receptors are located in the nucleus and are not accompanied by HSPs. They repress their gene by binding to their specific DNA sequence when no ligand binds to them, and vice versa.\nCertain intracellular receptors of the immune system are cytoplasmic receptors; recently identified NOD-like receptors (NLRs) reside in the cytoplasm of some eukaryotic cells and interact with ligands using a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif similar to TLRs. Some of these molecules like NOD2 interact with RIP2 kinase that activates NF-\u03baB signaling, whereas others like NALP3 interact with inflammatory caspases and initiate processing of particular cytokines like interleukin-1\u03b2.\nSecond messengers.\nFirst messengers are the signaling molecules (hormones, neurotransmitters, and paracrine/autocrine agents) that reach the cell from the extracellular fluid and bind to their specific receptors. Second messengers are the substances that enter the cytoplasm and act within the cell to trigger a response. In essence, second messengers act as chemical relays from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, thus carrying out intracellular signal transduction.\nCalcium.\nThe release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol results in its binding to signaling proteins that are then activated; it is then sequestered in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria. Two combined receptor/ion channel proteins control the transport of calcium: the InsP3-receptor that transports calcium upon interaction with inositol triphosphate on its cytosolic side; and the ryanodine receptor named after the alkaloid ryanodine, similar to the InsP3 receptor but having a feedback mechanism that releases more calcium upon binding with it. The nature of calcium in the cytosol means that it is active for only a very short time, meaning its free state concentration is very low and is mostly bound to organelle molecules like calreticulin when inactive\nCalcium is involved in numerous cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release from nerve endings, and cell migration. Its activation is primarily mediated through three main pathways: G-protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways, and gated ion channels. Calcium regulates proteins either directly or indirectly by binding to enzymes such as calmodulin-dependent kinases.\nLipid messengers.\nLipophilic second messenger molecules are derived from lipids residing in cellular membranes; enzymes stimulated by activated receptors activate the lipids by modifying them. Examples include diacylglycerol and ceramide, the former required for the activation of protein kinase C.\nNitric oxide.\nNitric oxide (NO) acts as a second messenger because it is a free radical that can diffuse through the plasma membrane and affect nearby cells. It is synthesised from arginine and oxygen by the NO synthase and works through activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which, when activated, produces another second messenger, cGMP. NO can also act through covalent modification of proteins or their metal cofactors; some have a redox mechanism and are reversible. It is toxic in high concentrations and causes damage during stroke, but is the cause of many other functions like the relaxation of blood vessels, apoptosis, and penile erections.\nRedox signaling.\nIn addition to nitric oxide, other electronically activated species are also signal-transducing agents in a process called redox signaling. Examples include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Redox signaling also includes active modulation of electronic flows in semiconductive biological macromolecules.\nCellular responses.\nGene activations and metabolism alterations are examples of cellular responses to extracellular stimulation that require signal transduction. Gene activation leads to further cellular effects, since the products of responding genes include instigators of activation; transcription factors produced as a result of a signal transduction cascade can activate even more genes. Hence, an initial stimulus can trigger the expression of a large number of genes, leading to physiological events like the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream and the migration of neutrophils to sites of infection. The set of genes and their activation order to certain stimuli is referred to as a genetic program.\nMammalian cells require stimulation for cell division and survival; in the absence of growth factor, apoptosis ensues. Such requirements for extracellular stimulation are necessary for controlling cell behavior in unicellular and multicellular organisms; signal transduction pathways are perceived to be so central to biological processes that a large number of diseases are attributed to their dysregulation.\nThree basic signals determine cellular growth:\nThe combination of these signals is integrated into altered cytoplasmic machinery which leads to altered cell behaviour.\nMajor pathways.\nFollowing are some major signaling pathways, demonstrating how ligands binding to their receptors can affect second messengers and eventually result in altered cellular responses.\nHistory.\nThe earliest notion of signal transduction can be traced back to 1855, when Claude Bernard proposed that ductless glands such as the spleen, the thyroid and adrenal glands, were responsible for the release of \"internal secretions\" with physiological effects. Bernard's \"secretions\" were later named \"hormones\" by Ernest Starling in 1905. Together with William Bayliss, Starling had discovered secretin in 1902. Although many other hormones, most notably insulin, were discovered in the following years, the mechanisms remained largely unknown.\nThe discovery of nerve growth factor by Rita Levi-Montalcini in 1954, and epidermal growth factor by Stanley Cohen in 1962, led to more detailed insights into the molecular basis of cell signaling, in particular growth factors. Their work, together with Earl Wilbur Sutherland's discovery of cyclic AMP in 1956, prompted the redefinition of endocrine signaling to include only signaling from glands, while the terms autocrine and paracrine began to be used. Sutherland was awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, while Levi-Montalcini and Cohen shared it in 1986.\nIn 1970, Martin Rodbell examined the effects of glucagon on a rat's liver cell membrane receptor. He noted that guanosine triphosphate disassociated glucagon from this receptor and stimulated the G-protein, which strongly influenced the cell's metabolism. Thus, he deduced that the G-protein is a transducer that accepts glucagon molecules and affects the cell. For this, he shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alfred G. Gilman. Thus, the characterization of RTKs and GPCRs led to the formulation of the concept of \"signal transduction\", a word first used in 1972. Some early articles used the terms \"signal transmission\" and \"sensory transduction\". In 2007, a total of 48,377 scientific papers\u2014including 11,211 review papers\u2014were published on the subject. The term first appeared in a paper's title in 1979. Widespread use of the term has been traced to a 1980 review article by Rodbell: Research papers focusing on signal transduction first appeared in large numbers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nSignal transduction in Immunology.\nThe purpose of this section is to briefly describe some developments in immunology in the 1960s and 1970s, relevant to the initial stages of transmembrane signal transduction, and how they impacted our understanding of immunology, and ultimately of other areas of cell biology.\nThe relevant events begin with the sequencing of myeloma protein light chains, which are found in abundance in the urine of individuals with multiple myeloma. Biochemical experiments revealed that these so-called Bence Jones proteins consisted of 2 discrete domains \u2013one that varied from one molecule to the next (the V domain) and one that did not (the Fc domain or the Fragment crystallizable region). An analysis of multiple V region sequences by Wu and Kabat identified locations within the V region that were hypervariable and which, they hypothesized, combined in the folded protein to form the antigen recognition site. Thus, within a relatively short time a plausible model was developed for the molecular basis of immunological specificity, and for mediation of biological function through the Fc domain. Crystallization of an IgG molecule soon followed ) confirming the inferences based on sequencing, and providing an understanding of immunological specificity at the highest level of resolution.\nThe biological significance of these developments was encapsulated in the theory of clonal selection which holds that a B cell has on its surface immunoglobulin receptors whose antigen-binding site is identical to that of antibodies that are secreted by the cell when it encounters an antigen, and more specifically a particular B cell clone secretes antibodies with identical sequences. The final piece of the story, the Fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane provided all the ingredients for a new model for the initiation of signal transduction; viz, receptor dimerization.\nThe first hints of this were obtained by Becker et al who demonstrated that the extent to which human basophils\u2014for which bivalent Immunoglobulin E (IgE) functions as a surface receptor \u2013 degranulate, depends on the concentration of anti IgE antibodies to which they are exposed, and results in a redistribution of surface molecules, which is absent when monovalent ligand is used. The latter observation was consistent with earlier findings by Fanger et al. These observations tied a biological response to events and structural details of molecules on the cell surface. A preponderance of evidence soon developed that receptor dimerization initiates responses (reviewed in ) in a variety of cell types, including B cells.\nSuch observations led to a number of theoretical (mathematical) developments. The first of these was a simple model proposed by Bell which resolved an apparent paradox: clustering forms stable networks; i.e. binding is essentially irreversible, whereas the affinities of antibodies secreted by B cells increase as the immune response progresses. A theory of the dynamics of cell surface clustering on lymphocyte membranes was developed by DeLisi and Perelson who found the size distribution of clusters as a function of time, and its dependence on the affinity and valence of the ligand. Subsequent theories for basophils and mast cells were developed by Goldstein and Sobotka and their collaborators, all aimed at the analysis of dose-response patterns of immune cells and their biological correlates. For a recent review of clustering in immunological systems see.\nLigand binding to cell surface receptors is also critical to motility, a phenomenon that is best understood in single-celled organisms. An example is a detection and response to concentration gradients by bacteria -\u2013the classic mathematical theory appearing in.

Because polynomials are among the simplest functions, and because computers can directly evaluate polynomials, this theorem has both practical and theoretical relevance, especially in polynomial interpolation. The original version of this result was established by Karl Weierstrass in 1885 using the Weierstrass transform.\nMarshall H. Stone considerably generalized the theorem and simplified the proof. His result is known as the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem. The Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem generalizes the Weierstrass approximation theorem in two directions: instead of the real interval [\"a\", \"b\"], an arbitrary compact Hausdorff space X is considered, and instead of the algebra of polynomial functions, a variety of other families of continuous functions on formula_1 are shown to suffice, as is detailed below. The Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem is a vital result in the study of the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space.\nFurther, there is a generalization of the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem to noncompact Tychonoff spaces, namely, any continuous function on a Tychonoff space is approximated uniformly on compact sets by algebras of the type appearing in the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem and described below.\nA different generalization of Weierstrass' original theorem is Mergelyan's theorem, which generalizes it to functions defined on certain subsets of the complex plane.\nWeierstrass approximation theorem.\nThe statement of the approximation theorem as originally discovered by Weierstrass is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"f\"(\"x\")\u00a0\u2212 \"p\"(\"x\")\nThe page for Bernstein polynomials outlines a constructive proof of the above theorem.\nDegree of approximation.\nFor differentiable functions, Jackson's inequality bounds the error of approximations by polynomials of a given degree: if formula_2 has a continuous k-th derivative, then for every formula_3 there exists a polynomial formula_4 of degree at most formula_5 such that formula_6.\nHowever, if formula_2 is merely continuous, the convergence of the approximations can be arbitrarily slow in the following sense: for any sequence of positive real numbers formula_8 decreasing to 0 there exists a function formula_2 such that formula_10 for every polynomial formula_11 of degree at most formula_5.\nApplications.\nAs a consequence of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, one can show that the space C[\"a\", \"b\"] is separable: the polynomial functions are dense, and each polynomial function can be uniformly approximated by one with rational coefficients; there are only countably many polynomials with rational coefficients. Since C[\"a\", \"b\"] is metrizable and separable it follows that C[\"a\", \"b\"] has cardinality at most 2\u21350. (Remark: This cardinality result also follows from the fact that a continuous function on the reals is uniquely determined by its restriction to the rationals.)\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, real version.\nThe set C[\"a\", \"b\"] of continuous real-valued functions on [\"a\", \"b\"], together with the supremum norm is a Banach algebra, (that is, an associative algebra and a Banach space such that for all \"f\", \"g\"). The set of all polynomial functions forms a subalgebra of C[\"a\", \"b\"] (that is, a vector subspace of C[\"a\", \"b\"] that is closed under multiplication of functions), and the content of the Weierstrass approximation theorem is that this subalgebra is dense in C[\"a\", \"b\"].\nStone starts with an arbitrary compact Hausdorff space X and considers the algebra C(\"X\", R) of real-valued continuous functions on X, with the topology induced by the supremum norm. He wants to find subalgebras of C(\"X\", R) which are dense. It turns out that the crucial property that a subalgebra must satisfy is that it \"separates points\": a set A of functions defined on X is said to separate points if, for every two different points x and y in X there exists a function p in A with \"p\"(\"x\") \u2260 \"p\"(\"y\"). Now we may state:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (real numbers)\u2014 Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space and A is a subalgebra of C(\"X\", R) which contains a non-zero constant function. Then A is dense in C(\"X\", R) if and only if it separates points.\nThis implies Weierstrass' original statement since the polynomials on [\"a\", \"b\"] form a subalgebra of C[\"a\", \"b\"] which contains the constants and separates points.\nLocally compact version.\nA version of the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem is also true when X is only locally compact. Let C0(\"X\", R) be the space of real-valued continuous functions on X that vanish at infinity; that is, a continuous function \"f\" is in C0(\"X\", R) if, for every \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0, there exists a compact set \"K\" \u2282 \"X\" such that on \"X\"\u00a0\\\u00a0\"K\". Again, C0(\"X\", R) is a Banach algebra with the supremum norm. A subalgebra A of C0(\"X\", R) is said to vanish nowhere if not all of the elements of A simultaneously vanish at a point; that is, for every x in X, there is some \"f\" in A such that \"f\"\u2009(\"x\") \u2260 0. The theorem generalizes as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (locally compact spaces)\u2014 Suppose X is a \"locally compact\" Hausdorff space and A is a subalgebra of C0(\"X\", R). Then A is dense in C0(\"X\", R) (given the topology of uniform convergence) if and only if it separates points and vanishes nowhere.\nThis version clearly implies the previous version in the case when X is compact, since in that case C0(\"X\", R) \n C(\"X\", R). There are also more general versions of the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem that weaken the assumption of local compactness.\nApplications.\nThe Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem can be used to prove the following two statements, which go beyond Weierstrass's result.\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, complex version.\nSlightly more general is the following theorem, where we consider the algebra formula_13 of complex-valued continuous functions on the compact space formula_1, again with the topology of uniform convergence. This is a C*-algebra with the *-operation given by pointwise complex conjugation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (complex numbers)\u2014 Let formula_1 be a compact Hausdorff space and let formula_16 be a separating subset of formula_13. Then the complex unital *-algebra generated by formula_16 is dense in formula_13.\nThe complex unital *-algebra generated by formula_16 consists of all those functions that can be obtained from the elements of formula_16 by throwing in the constant function 1 and adding them, multiplying them, conjugating them, or multiplying them with complex scalars, and repeating finitely many times.\nThis theorem implies the real version, because if a net of complex-valued functions uniformly approximates a given function, formula_22, then the real parts of those functions uniformly approximate the real part of that function, formula_23, and because for real subsets, formula_24 taking the real parts of the generated complex unital (selfadjoint) algebra agrees with the generated real unital algebra generated.\nAs in the real case, an analog of this theorem is true for locally compact Hausdorff spaces.\nThe following is an application of this complex version.\n \"e\"2\"\u03c0inx\", \"n\" \u2208 Z is dense in C([0, 1]/{0, 1}), where we identify the endpoints of the interval [0, 1] to obtain a circle. An important consequence of this is that the \"en\" are an orthonormal basis of the space L2([0, 1]) of square-integrable functions on [0, 1]. \nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, quaternion version.\nFollowing , consider the algebra C(\"X\", H) of quaternion-valued continuous functions on the compact space X, again with the topology of uniform convergence. \nIf a quaternion \"q\" is written in the form formula_25\nLikewise \nThen we may state:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (quaternion numbers)\u2014 Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space and A is a subalgebra of C(\"X\", H) which contains a non-zero constant function. Then A is dense in C(\"X\", H) if and only if it separates points.\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, C*-algebra version.\nThe space of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space formula_1 i.e. formula_13 is the canonical example of a unital commutative C*-algebra formula_32. The space \"X\" may be viewed as the space of pure states on formula_32, with the weak-* topology. Following the above cue, a non-commutative extension of the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which remains unsolved, is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConjecture\u2014 If a unital C*-algebra formula_32 has a C*-subalgebra formula_35 which separates the pure states of formula_32, then formula_37.\nIn 1960, Jim Glimm proved a weaker version of the above conjecture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (C*-algebras)\u2014If a unital C*-algebra formula_32 has a C*-subalgebra formula_35 which separates the pure state space (i.e. the weak-* closure of the pure states) of formula_32, then formula_41.\nLattice versions.\nLet X be a compact Hausdorff space. Stone's original proof of the theorem used the idea of lattices in C(\"X\", R). A subset L of C(\"X\", R) is called a lattice if for any two elements \"f\", \"g\" \u2208 \"L\", the functions max{\u2009\"f\", \"g\"}, min{\u2009\"f\", \"g\"}also belong to L. The lattice version of the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (lattices)\u2014 Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and L is a lattice in C(\"X\", R) with the property that for any two distinct elements x and y of X and any two real numbers a and b there exists an element \"f\"\u2009 \u2208 \"L\" with \u2009\"f\"\u2009(\"x\") \n \"a\" and \u2009\"f\"\u2009(\"y\") \n \"b\". Then L is dense in C(\"X\", R).\nThe above versions of Stone\u2013Weierstrass can be proven from this version once one realizes that the lattice property can also be formulated using the absolute value |\u2009\"f\"\u2009| which in turn can be approximated by polynomials in \"f\". A variant of the theorem applies to linear subspaces of C(\"X\", R) closed under max:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (max-closed)\u2014Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space and B is a family of functions in C(\"X\", R) such that\nThen B is dense in C(\"X\", R).\nMore precise information is available:\nSuppose X is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and L is a lattice in C(\"X\", R). The function \"\u03c6\" \u2208 C(\"X\", R) belongs to the closure of L if and only if for each pair of distinct points \"x\" and \"y\" in X and for each \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0 there exists some \"f\"\u2009 \u2208 \"L\" for which |\u2009\"f\"\u2009(\"x\") \u2212 \"\u03c6\"(\"x\")| &lt; \"\u03b5\" and |\u2009\"f\"\u2009(\"y\") \u2212 \"\u03c6\"(\"y\")| &lt; \"\u03b5\".\nBishop's theorem.\nAnother generalization of the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem is due to Errett Bishop. Bishop's theorem is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nS\" : g \u2208 \"A\"}. Suppose that \"f\"\u2009 \u2208 C(\"X\", C) has the following property:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"f\"\n gives a short proof of Bishop's theorem using the Krein\u2013Milman theorem in an essential way, as well as the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem: the process of . See also .\nNachbin's theorem.\nNachbin's theorem gives an analog for Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem for algebras of complex valued smooth functions on a smooth manifold. Nachbin's theorem is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNachbin's theorem\u2014Let A be a subalgebra of the algebra C\u221e(\"M\") of smooth functions on a finite dimensional smooth manifold M. Suppose that A separates the points of M and also separates the tangent vectors of M: for each point \"m\" \u2208 \"M\" and tangent vector \"v\" at the tangent space at \"m\", there is a \"f\" \u2208 A such that d\"f\"(\"x\")(\"v\") \u2260 0. Then A is dense in C\u221e(\"M\").\nEditorial history.\nIn 1885 it was also published in an English version of the paper whose title was \"On the possibility of giving an analytic representation to an arbitrary function of real variable\". According to the mathematician Yamilet Quintana, Weierstrass \"suspected that any analytic functions could be represented by power series\".\nSee also.\n \"P\"(\"x\") for some finely spaced \"x\" \n \"xn\" is a bad way to attempt to find a polynomial approximating \"f\" uniformly. A better approach, explained e.g. in , p. 160, eq. (51) ff., is to construct polynomials P uniformly approximating \"f\" by taking the convolution of \"f\" with a family of suitably chosen polynomial kernels.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nHistorical works.\nThe historical publication of Weierstrass (in German language) is freely available from the digital online archive of the \"http://\":"}

It is usually understood specifically to entail \"figurative\" comparison: thus \"a wolf is like a dog\" is merely a literal comparison, whereas the figurative \"a man is like a wolf\" is a simile.74 In the words of Michael Israel, Jennifer Riddle Harding, and Vera Tobin, \"basically, a simile is just a way of describing a target by asserting its similarity to some unexpected entity\".126\nIn English, similes are often made explicit by the word \"like\", as in \"Odysseus is like a weasel\", but the comparison in a simile can be made explicit in quite different ways, as in \"the retirement of Yves Saint Laurent is the fashion equivalent of the breakup of the Beatles\". Sometimes, extra information is included to explain precisely how the comparison is intended to work, as in \"my kitchen is approximately \"the size of\" a postage stamp\".\nDefinition.\nSimiles are often compared (or contrasted) with metaphors. Similes compare two things explicitly, in English often using the words \"like\" or \"as\", whereas metaphors often create an implicit comparison (i.e., saying something \"is\" something else). Thus \"Odysseus is a weasel\" is a metaphor, while \"Odysseus is like a weasel\" is a simile.128\nHowever, there are two schools of thought regarding the relationship between similes and metaphors. The first defines them as opposites, such that a statement cannot be both a simile and a metaphor \u2014 if it uses a comparison word such as \"like\" then it is a simile; if not, it is a metaphor. The second school considers metaphor to be the broader category, in which similes are a subcategory \u2014 according to which every simile is also a metaphor (but not vice-versa). These two schools reflect differing definitions and usages of the word \"metaphor\" and regardless of whether it encompasses similes, both agree that similes always involve a direct comparison word such as \"like\" or \"as\".\nThe word \"simile\" derives from the Latin word \"similis\" (\"similar, like\"), while \"metaphor\" derives from the Greek word \"metapherein\" (\"to transfer\"). As in the case of metaphors, the thing that is being compared is called the tenor, and the thing it is being compared to is called the vehicle. Author and lexicographer Frank J. Wilstach compiled a dictionary of similes in 1916, with a second edition in 1924.\nUses.\nIn literature.\nSometimes similes and metaphors function in much the same way, as in \"O My Luve's like a red, red rose\" in the Robert Burns poem \"A Red, Red Rose\": this could be turned into the metaphor \"my love is a red rose\" without confusing the reader. However, because similes are explicit, it is possible for them to be more elaborate than metaphors while remaining comprehensible, as in the following examples:\nHow far that little candle throws his beams!\nSo shines a good deed in a naughty world.\nStopping her from going was like trying to catch a bullet with a pair of tweasers, impossible.\nLearning to drive was like a deer learning how to walk for the first time. Stumbling until you get it right.\nAuthors sometimes use similes to establish a comparison explicitly, using metaphors thereafter once the comparison has been established (the same process can happen in everyday conversations, either with the metaphor or the simile coming first).\nIn comedy.\nSimiles are used extensively in British comedy, notably in the slapstick era of the 1960s and 1970s. In comedy, the simile is often used in negative style: \"he was as daft as a brush.\" They are also used in a comedic context where a sensitive subject is broached, and the comedian will test the audience with a response to a subtle implicit simile before going deeper. The sitcom \"Blackadder\" featured the use of extended similes, normally said by the title character. For example:\nBaldrick: I have a plan, sir.\nBlackadder: Really, Baldrick? A cunning and subtle one?\nBaldrick: Yes, sir.\nBlackadder: As cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University?\nIn languages other than English.\nGiven that similes emphasize affinities between different objects, they occur in many cultures and languages.\nArabic.\nSayf al-Din al-Amidi discussed Arabic similes in 1805: http://.\nVietnamese.\nThuy Nga Nguyen and Ghil'ad Zuckermann (2012) classify Vietnamese similes into two types: Meaning Similes and Rhyming Similes.\nThe following is an example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhereas the above Vietnamese example is of a rhyming simile, the English simile \"(as) poor as a church mouse\" is only a semantic simile.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28861", "revid": "48219523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28861", "title": "Serengeti", "text": "Geographical region in Tanzania\nThe Serengeti ( ) ecosystem is a geographical region in Africa, spanning the Mara and Arusha Regions of Tanzania. The protected area within the region includes approximately of land, including the Serengeti National Park and several game reserves. The Serengeti hosts one of the world's largest land animal migration (in terms of total body weight), which helps secure it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.\nThe Serengeti is also renowned for its large lion population and is one of the best places to observe prides in their natural environment. Approximately 70 large mammal and 500 bird species are found there. This high diversity is a function of diverse habitats, including riverine forests, swamps, kopjes, grasslands, and woodlands. Blue wildebeest, gazelles, zebras, and buffalos are some of the commonly found large mammals in the region. The Serengeti also contains the Serengeti District of Tanzania. \nThe name \"Serengeti\" is often said to be derived from the word \"seringit\" in the Maasai language, Maa, meaning \"endless plains\". This etymology does not appear in Maa dictionaries.\nHistory.\nFor eons, African wildlife have roamed freely across the vast rolling plains of the Serengeti, which was sparsely inhabited by humans. This changed when nomadic pastoralists of the Maasai began to migrate to the area in the early 1800s.\nThe Maasai, however, were struck by drought and disease. Thousands died in the 1880s from a cholera epidemic and in 1892 from smallpox. Making matters worse, their cattle were wiped out by Rinderpest (a bovine viral disease). Later in the 20th century the Tanzanian government re-settled the Maasai around the Ngorongoro Crater. Poaching, and the absence of fires (which had been caused by humans), allowed dense woodlands and thickets to develop over the next 30\u201350 years. Tsetse fly populations now prevented any significant human settlement in the area. \nBy the mid-1970s, wildebeest and Cape buffalo populations had recovered and were increasingly cropping the grass, reducing the amount of fuel available for fires. The reduced intensity of fires has allowed acacia to once again become established.\nIn the 21st century, mass rabies vaccination programmes for domestic dogs in the Serengeti have not only indirectly prevented hundreds of human deaths, but also protected wildlife species such as the endangered African wild dog.\nGreat migration.\nEach year around the same time, the circular great wildebeest migration begins in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of the southern Serengeti in Tanzania and loops clockwise through the Serengeti National Park and north towards the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya. This migration is naturally caused by the availability of grazing. The initial phase lasts from about January to March, when the calving season begins \u2013 a time when there is plenty of rain-ripened grass available for the 260,000 zebras that precede 1.7 million wildebeest and the following hundreds of thousands of other plains game, including around 470,000 gazelles.\nDuring February, the wildebeest are on the short grass plains of the southeast part of the ecosystem, grazing and giving birth to approximately 500,000 calves in 2 to 3 weeks. Few calves are born ahead of time and of these, hardly any survive, largely because very young calves are more noticeable to predators when mixed with older calves from the previous year. As the rains end in May, the animals start moving northwest into the areas around the Grumeti River, where they typically remain until late June. The crossings of the Grumeti and Mara rivers beginning in July are a popular safari attraction because crocodiles are lying in wait. The herds arrive in Kenya in late July / August, where they stay for the rest of the dry season, except that the Thomson's and Grant's gazelles move only east/west. In early November, with the start of the short rains, the migration starts moving south again, to the short grass plains of the southeast, usually arriving in December in plenty of time for calving in February.\nAbout 250,000 wildebeests die during the journey from Tanzania to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in southwestern Kenya, of . Death is usually from thirst, hunger, exhaustion, or predation, including by big cats.\nEcology.\nThe Serengeti has some of East Africa's finest game areas. Besides being known for the great migration, the Serengeti is also famous for its abundant large predators. The ecosystem is home to over 3,000 lions, 1,000 African leopards, and 7,700 to 8,700 spotted hyenas (\"Crocuta crocuta).\" The East African cheetah is also present in Serengeti.\nAfrican wild dogs are relatively scarce in much of the Serengeti. This is particularly true in places such as Serengeti National Park (where they became extinct in 1992), in which lions and spotted hyenas, predators that steal wild dog kills and are a direct cause of wild dog mortality, are abundant.\nThe Serengeti is also home to a diversity of grazers, including Cape buffalo, African elephant, warthog, Grant's gazelle, eland, waterbuck, and topi. The Serengeti can support this remarkable variety of grazers only because each species, even those closely related, has a different diet. For example, wildebeests prefer to consume shorter grasses, while plains zebras prefer taller grasses. Similarly, dik-diks eat the lowest leaves of a tree, impalas eat the leaves that are higher up, and giraffes eat leaves that are even higher.\nThe governments of Tanzania and Kenya maintain a number of protected areas, including national parks, conservation areas, and game reserves, that give legal protection to over 80 percent of the Serengeti.

It links the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea via the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, separating Turkey's European and Asian sides. It has an area of , and its dimensions are . Its greatest depth is .\nName.\nThe Sea of Marmara is named after the largest island on its south side, called Marmara Island because it is rich in marble (Greek , \"m\u00e1rmaron\" 'marble').\nIn classical antiquity, it was known as the Propontis, from the Greek \"pro\" 'in front of' + \"pontos\" 'sea, specifically the Black Sea', since the Ancient Greeks sailed through it to reach the Black Sea.\nMythology.\nIn Greek mythology, a storm on the Propontis brought the Argonauts back to an island they had left, precipitating a battle in which either Jason or Heracles killed King Cyzicus, who had mistaken them for his Pelasgian enemies.\nGeography and hydrology.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Sea of Marmara as follows:\n\"On the West\". The Dardanelles limit of the Aegean Sea [A line joining Kum Kale (26\u00b011'E) and Cape Helles].\n\"On the Northeast\". A line joining Cape Rumili with Cape Anatoli (41\u00b013\u2032N).\nThe sea's south coast is heavily indented and includes the Gulf of \u0130zmit (), the Gulf of Gemlik (), the Gulf of Band\u0131rma (), and the Gulf of Erdek ().\nThe surface salinity of the Marmara averages about 22 parts per thousand, which is slightly more than that of the Black Sea, but only about two-thirds that of most oceans. The water is much more saline at the bottom of the sea, averaging a salinity of around 38 parts per thousand, similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea. This high-density saline water does not migrate to the surface as is also the case with the Black Sea. Water from the Susurluk, Biga (Granicus), and G\u00f6nen Rivers also reduces the salinity of the sea, though with less effect than on the Black Sea. With little land in Thrace draining southward, almost all of these rivers flow from Anatolia.\nIslands.\nThere are two main groups of islands in the Sea of Marmara. To the north lie the Princes' Islands, an archipelago made up of the inhabited islands of K\u0131naliada, Burgazada, Heybeliada, B\u00fcy\u00fckada and Sedef Adas\u0131 and several uninhabited islands including Sivriada, Yass\u0131ada, Ka\u015f\u0131kadas\u0131 and Tav\u015fanadas\u0131. The inhabited islands are readily accessible by ferry from both the European and Asian shores of \u0130stanbul and the entire archipelago forms part of the conurbation.\nTo the south lie the Marmara Islands, an archipelago made up of the eponymous Marmara Island and three other inhabited islands \u2013 Av\u015fa, Pa\u015faliman\u0131 and Ekinlik \u2013 as well as of seventeen largely uninhabited islands including the prison island of Imral\u0131 whose most famous prisoner, since 1999, has been the PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan. These islands lie within Bal\u0131kesir province and are most readily accessible from Tekirda\u011f in Thrace or Erdek on the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara. In high summer additional ferries travel to Av\u015fa and Marmara Islands from the centre of \u0130stanbul to facilitate a growing tourist trade.\nThere are also a few individual islands elsewhere in the Sea of Marmara, such as Ko\u00e7 Adas\u0131, off Tuzla, which is privately owned by the Ko\u00e7 family of industrialists.\nEnvironmental challenges.\nThe North Anatolian Fault runs under the sea and has triggered several major earthquakes, such as the Izmit and D\u00fczce in August and November 1999 respectively. The August 1999 earthquake is commonly referred to as the Marmara Earthquake since its epicentre lay under the Sea and most of the places worst affected by the quake and ensuing tsunami lay along its shores.\nIn a storm on 29 December 1999, the Russian oil tanker broke in two in the Sea of Marmara, spilling more than 1,500 tonnes of oil into the water.\nThe main cities in Turkey, especially Istanbul, the largest city, are around the Marmara Sea, a small inland sea. Despite its limited size, the basin is home to about one-third of the country's population. Rapid population growth and uncontrolled construction in this area have put heavy pressure on the sea. For many years, waste was dumped into the Marmara Sea with little or no treatment, surpassing the sea's ability to handle it. As a result, many species in the sea have disappeared, and fishing was banned in the \"East Bay\" of the Marmara Sea for years due to severe pollution.\nOne of the most serious environmental problems in the Marmara Sea in recent years has been mucilage, a thick, sticky substance that appears for up to six months. The mucilage outbreak began in January 2021 and lasted until June 2021. It caused habitat loss, economic issues, and disrupted vital ecosystem services, such as fishing.\nTowns and cities.\nTowns and cities on the coast of the Sea of Marmara include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is Canada's oldest incorporated city, established by royal charter on May 18, 1785, during the reign of George III. The Port of Saint John is Canada's third-largest by tonnage with a cargo base that includes dry and liquid bulk, break bulk, containers, and cruise. The city has a strong industrial base, including oil refining and manufacturing, as well as significant finance and tourism sectors and research institutions such as the New Brunswick Museum and the University of New Brunswick. Saint John was the most populous city in New Brunswick for more than 230 years until the 2016 census, when it was overtaken by Moncton. It is currently the second-largest city in the province, with a population of 69,895 over an area of .\nFrench explorer Samuel de Champlain landed at Saint John Harbour on June 24, 1604, the feast of St. John the Baptist, and named the Saint John River in his honour; the indigenous Mi'kmaq and Wolastoqiyik peoples called the river \"Wolastoq\". The Saint John area was an important location for trade and defence in Acadia during the French colonial era, and Fort La Tour, in the city's harbour, was a pivotal battleground during the Acadian Civil War.\nAfter more than a century of ownership disputes between the French and English over the land surrounding Saint John, the British government deported the Acadians in 1755 following the destruction of Fort Menagoueche, which was reconstructed as Fort Frederick. Following the pillaging and burning of Fort Frederick by American privateers, Fort Howe was constructed across the river above the harbour in 1779. In 1785, the City of Saint John was established by uniting the two communities of Parr-town and Carleton on opposite sides of the harbour after the arrival of thousands of refugees from the newly founded United States who wished to remain British after the American Revolution. During the next century, immigration via Partridge Island, especially during the Great Famine, would fundamentally change the city's demographics and culture.\nHistory.\nThe Saint John area had been inhabited by peoples of the Wabanaki Confederacy for thousands of years. The northwestern coastal region of the Bay of Fundy was home to the Passamaquoddy Nation, while the Saint John River valley north of the bay became the domain of the Wolastoqiyik Nation. The Mi'kmaq also frequented the Saint John area due to the harbour and coast being an important hunting ground for seals. The area around the harbour, where the city is, has been traditionally called Menahkwesk by the Wolastoqiyik people, who continue to reside in and around the city. In precolonial times, the Wolastoqiyik lived in mostly self-sustaining villages living largely off bass, sturgeon, salmon, corn, wild roots and berries.\nIn 1604, Samuel de Champlain landed at Saint John Harbour, though he did not settle the area. Saint John played a crucial role in trade and defense for Acadia during the French colonial era, with Fort La Tour in the city's harbour becoming a pivotal battleground during the Acadian Civil War. At the end of the Seven Years' War, the British took the region from the French.\nThe population of Saint John grew with immigration from the former Thirteen Colonies and Europe. In 1785, Saint John became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada. Immigration led to the building of North America's first quarantine station, Partridge Island.\nThe city became a shipyard of global stature, producing vessels such as the 1851 ship , which became the fastest in the world, and witnessing the development of the automated foghorn by Robert Foulis.\nAs the city grew in strategic importance to English power and capital, unrest grew among many of its working class. Black Saint Johners faced restrictions on trade, fishing and voting, compelling the majority of the city's Black community to settle in Portland (the city's north end), which later became amalgamated with Saint John. In 1849, Canada's first labour union, the Laborer's Benevolent Association (now ILA local 273) was formed by longshoremen. Between 1840 and 1860, sectarian violence became rampant in Saint John as tensions escalated in response to the poor living conditions of poor Irish Catholics, resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. Saint John experienced a cholera outbreak in 1854 that claimed over 1,500 lives, as well as the Great Fire of Saint John in 1877 that destroyed 40% of the city and left 13,000 people homeless. Although the fire caused damages exceeding $10 million (equivalent to approximately $256 million today), Saint John quickly embarked on rebuilding. Nevertheless, the aftermath prompted many residents to leave the city.\nGeography and climate.\nPhysical geography.\nSituated in the south-central portion of the province, along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy at the mouth of the Saint John River, the city is split by the south-flowing river and the east side is bordered on the north by the Kennebecasis River where it meets the Saint John River at Grand Bay. The city hosts many beaches and is just east of New River Beach Provincial Park. Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour. The city land area is , and the metropolitan area covers .\nStonehammer UNESCO Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations that date back to the Precambrian era and some of the rocks may be a billion years old.\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the Bay of Fundy through a narrow gorge several hundred metres wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the Reversing Falls where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy\u00a0\u2013 the \"St. Croix Highlands\" and the \"Caledonia Highlands\". The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high tide is approximately 8 metres (28\u00a0ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\nArchitecture.\nSaint John, especially in its Uptown region, features a multitude of architectural styles spanning from the 19th and early 20th centuries, with residences and buildings containing Victorian, Romanesque Revival, and Second Empire architectural styles. Over time, the city would see the use of Georgian, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire and Queen Anne style architecture.\nAs Saint John rebuilt from the Great Fire in 1877, buildings would start to be constructed using brick and stone rather than wood. During the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the most popular styles in the city were Queen Anne and Romanesque architecture. In 1911, a proposed city hall was to share Gothic and Second Empire architectural styles. Over time, the city would no longer adopt some of these styles. Buildings in Saint John also feature stone carvings and sculptures.\nIn 1982, Saint John introduced the Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area, which serves to preserve historic districts and buildings in the city. The Saint John Preservation Areas By-Law regulates exterior work done to these properties in a way that preserves the historic architecture in buildings built prior to 1915.\nList of notable buildings in Saint John:\nParks and nature.\nSaint John is home to the historic King's Square, an urban park located in the city's Uptown region. Multiple historic buildings are located by the park, including the Saint John City Market, the Imperial Theatre, as well as the former Admiral Beatty Hotel. King's Square's counterpart, Queen Square, is another urban park located a few blocks south from it. Queen Square features an annual outdoor farmers market which runs through the summer months.\nLocated in west Saint John is the Irving Nature Park, located in the city's west side and measuring . Saint John is also home to Rockwood Park, a large municipal park located to the east of the Millidgeville neighbourhood. Designed in the 19th century by landscape designer Calvert Vaux, one of the designers for New York City's Central Park, It features 2,200 acres of park area, ten lakes, and 55 trails and footpaths.\nNeighbourhoods.\nAccording to Saint John mapping data, the city has 33 neighborhoods categorized into four groups: North, East, South and West.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Saint John is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"\"). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about . Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed . The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually . The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John was on June 20, 2024. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 11, 1948.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2021 census conducted by Statistics Canada, Saint John had a population of people that were living in of total private dwellings. The population density was , and is most densely populated in Uptown Saint John. The median total household income was $62,800. Of the city's population aged between 25 and 64, held a bachelor's degree or higher, held a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree, and had a high school diploma or equivalent. The median age was 44 years.\nAt the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Saint John CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.\nEthnicity.\nHistorically, as one of Canada's main ports, Saint John has been a centre for immigration from all over the world. The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 White refugees after the American Revolution. In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city.\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Famine of Ireland raged between 1845 and 1849, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"Black 47\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.\nAs of the 2021 census, approximately 86.4% of the residents were white, while 10.9% were visible minorities and 2.8% were Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups were Black (2.7%), South Asian (2.4%), Arab (1.5%), Chinese (1.4%), and Filipino (0.9%).\nLanguage.\n87.2% of residents spoke English as a mother tongue. Other common first languages were French (3.7%), Arabic (1.5%) Chinese languages (1.0%) and Tagalog (0.5%).\nReligion.\n58.5% of residents were Christian, down from 79.6% in 2011. 29.7% were Catholic, 20.6% were Protestant, 5.1% were Christian n.o.s, and 3.0% were other Christian denominations or related traditions. 36.0% of the population were non-religious or secular, up from 18.4% in 2011. Other religions accounted for 5.5% of the population, up from 2.0% in 2011. The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (3.1%) and Hinduism (1.0%).\nEconomy.\nSaint John's location along the Bay of Fundy has been of major importance to the city's prosperity. The bay's dramatic tidal range prevents the harbour from icing over, allowing the city to be accessible all year round. Shipbuilding, shipping and lumber trade rose as prominent industries. By 1840, one-third of New Brunswick's timber, as well as two-thirds of its sawn lumber and manufactured wood products, were exported through Saint John. At one point, Saint John was British North America's biggest shipbuilding city, constructing many well-known ships, including the \"Marco Polo\". However, these industries suffered a decline in trade due to technological advancements, which was only made worse with the Great Fire of Saint John in 1877. Shipbuilding in Saint John permanently ceased in 2003 following the closure of the Saint John shipyard, which had been idle for the past three years.\nToday, Saint John benefits from industries such as tourism, reporting a tourism expenditure of $282 million in 2018. Port of Saint John, the city's port, allows for a capacity of three cruise ships, and has been a cruise ship destination since 1989, first welcoming the MS \"Cunard Princess\". Saint John receives around 80 cruise ships annually. As of the 2023 cruise schedule, Saint John is scheduled to receive 190,680 passengers' worth of cruise ships. The port also carries over 20 million metric tonnes of cargo annually.\nArts and culture.\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. TD Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL.\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like Miller Brittain and Fred Ross have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Paris Crew, Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\nHeavy industry.\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest oil refinery as well as the country's largest dry dock. K.C. Irving and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal, a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The Moosehead Brewery (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the New Brunswick Power Corporation which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station, Bell Aliant which operates out of the former New Brunswick Telephone headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area, and numerous information technology companies. There are also a number of call centres which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\nMaritime industries.\nSaint John is a major Canadian port, and the only city on the Bay of Fundy. Until the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 multi-purpose patrol frigates for the Canadian Navy. However, the Irving family closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax leaving the Saint John dry dock sitting idle.\nEcological research on surrounding marine life of the Bay of Fundy and the Saint John and Kennebecasis Rivers is centred in the city. The University of New Brunswick's Marine Biology department in Saint John as well as local NGO's and the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans heads the majority of research and monitoring work on marine life and environments.\nTraditional fisheries (lobster, scallops etc.) still make up the livelihood for many Saint Johners today. Aquaculture, primarily Atlantic Salmon farming, has grown to be a major employer in the region as the decline of other traditional wild fisheries has unfolded in recent decades. Cooke Aquaculture, one of the largest companies in the industry is headquartered in Saint John.\nPrior to the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for Montreal, Quebec when shipping was unable to traverse the sea ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River. The Canadian Pacific Railway opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of Maine and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round icebreaker services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to shortline operator New Brunswick Southern Railway. The Canadian National Railway still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from Moncton. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including containers and bulk cargo.\nExports.\nSaint John is a major exporter to the United States, with 96.3% of the city's exports being sent past the border according to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. This was particularly highlighted in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats against the country due to research by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce concluding that Saint John is the most vulnerable Canadian city in the potentiality of a trade war between both countries with a trade exposure index of 131.1%, which is nearly 50% higher than the second-ranked city of Calgary. The study highlighted the Irving Oil Refinery, noting that over 80% of its exports go to the United States. Irving announced a tariff response plan as a result of this, in which all tariff costs on oil exported to the country will be absorbed by U.S. customers.\nCulture.\nThe city is the birthplace of several notable artists, actors and musicians, including Walter Pidgeon, Donald Sutherland, Louis B. Mayer, and Miller Brittain.\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet Kay Smith, painters Jack Humphrey, Miller Brittain, Bruno Bobak, Fred Ross, sculptor John Hooper and folk-singer Stompin' Tom Connors. Poet Bliss Carman once wrote about Saint John, \"All the beauty and mystery Of life were there, adventure bold, Youth, and the glamour of the sea, And all its sorrows old.\"\nArts organization include InterAction School of Performing Arts, New Brunswick Youth Orchestra, Symphony New Brunswick, The Imperial Theatre, and the Saint John Free Public Library, among others.\nFilm and television.\nSaint John, as well as New Brunswick as a whole, entered the film industry in 1924 with the now-lost silent film \"Blue Water\", produced by the once-successful Ernest Shipman. The film featured soon-to-be Hollywood star Norma Shearer, though it had a short-lived screening and failed to succeed commercially. Saint John made a return to film with the \"Bravery in the Field\" (1979), a short drama film by the National Film Board of Canada both set and filmed in the city which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.\nSaint John is notably one of the filming locations for \"Children of a Lesser God\" (1986), a romance drama film that received five nominations at the 59th Academy Awards. Marlee Matlin, in her film debut, won Best Actress, making her not only the youngest Best Actress winner but also the first deaf winner in Oscar history. William Hurt, who made a return to the city for filming \"The 4th Floor\" (1999), befriended some Saint John residents during his time there for filming of \"Children of a Lesser God\". Other films shot in Saint John include \"The Secret Life of Algernon\" (1997), crime drama \"Blue Hill Avenue\" (2001), \"Jericho Mansions\" (2003), \"Geraldine's Fortune\" (2004), black comedy thriller \"Stuck\" (2007), romantic drama \"Still Mine\" (2012), and Steven Bernstein's depiction of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas \"Last Call\" (2017), of which most extras were from Saint John. Additionally, filming for Taylor Olson's upcoming film titled \"Unseen\" took place in the city between April and May 2024.\nIn television, Saint John was featured in an episode of \"Hotel Impossible\", as well as in ARD television documentary \"Verr\u00fcckt nach Meer\". Saint John was additionally a filming location for \"Canada Russia '72\" (2006), a docudrama miniseries about the Summit Series.\nMuseums.\nSaint John features multiple museums such as the Hatheway Labour Exhibit Centre, the New Brunswick Black History Society's Black History Heritage Centre located in the Brunswick Square mall, the Carleton Martello Tower, Fort Howe, the Loyalist House, the Saint John Jewish Historical Museum, the Saint John Firefighters Museum, the Saint John Police Museum, as well as the New Brunswick Museum, Canada's first public museum. The New Brunswick museum was located in Market Square until an announcement was made in 2022 to move locations. The new location of the Saint John Museum is set to open in 2028 on Douglas avenue. before Saint John also had the Barbour's General Store, but it was later demolished in July 2023 after having received excessive fire damage in early 2022.\nNational Historic sites.\nSaint John is home to several National Historic Sites, including war fortifications such as the Carleton Martello Tower, a War of 1812 masonry tower, Fort Menagoueche, a former French fort from Father Le Loutre's War, Fort Howe, a British fort built during the American Revolution, and Fort La Tour. Other sites include the Imperial Theatre, the Loyalist House, the Saint John City Market, Partridge Island, the Prince William Streetscape, the Saint John Firefighters' Museum and the Bank of New Brunswick.\nMusic.\nEarly settlers influenced music in Saint John from the time the area had been a series of forts for the English and French colonists. Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became Symphony New Brunswick. Some musicians from Saint John include Berkley Chadwick, Stompin' Tom Connors, Ken Tobias, Blank Banshee, Stevedore Steve, Jane Coop, Bruce Holder, Frances James, songwriter Michael F. Kelly, Ned Landry, composer and teacher Edward Betts Manning, organist Paul Murray, Catherine McKinnon, Patricia Rideout, Frances C. Robinson, Philip Thomson, and tenor and choir conductor Gordon Wry.\nMusic festivals have long been a part of the city's cultural scene. New Brunswick's Music Festival was held in Saint John every Spring in the early- to mid-20th century. As the city's music changed with the times, so did its festivals. Other popular festivals include the now defunct Festival By The Sea and Salty Jam catering to various genres of pop music.\nThe Area 506 music festival is held every New Brunswick Day long-weekend at the Area 506 Festival grounds located near the Area 506 Container Village on Saint John Harbour along Water street. The festival is set up with shipping containers from the port with vendors from New Brunswick companies to promote local business. A main stage area is also set up for night time shows with local acts as well as major groups. Major bands to have played Area 506 include Interpol, Billy Talent, Alexisonfire, Mother Mother, Arkells, Metric, City and Colour, The Beaches and more. Each year the festival also includes a bevy of bands coming out of the Saint John music scene. Quality Block Party music festival hosts independent New Brunswick musicians in smaller venues throughout uptown Saint John. The festival gets its name from the old quality block on Germain Street.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernment and court.\nSaint John operates under a mayor\u2013council form of municipal government, officially known as the Saint John Common Council. The council consists of the mayor and ten councillors, of which two are elected at-large and eight represent the city's four wards to four-year terms. Saint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers. Federally, it is part of the Saint John\u2014Kennebecasis and Saint John\u2014St. Croix ridings represented in the House of Commons by Liberal MP Wayne Long and Conservative MP John Williamson, respectively.\nSaint John is served by the Provincial Court of New Brunswick, the province's lower trial court. Saint John is also home to the provincial court's mental health court. The Chief Judge for the Provincial Court is Marco Cloutier. The city falls within the Judicial District of Saint John for the Court of King's Bench of New Brunswick.\nPolitics.\nThe office of the mayor has been held by Donna Reardon since 2021, elected during the 2021 New Brunswick municipal electionss. She is the 79th mayor of Saint John. Previous mayors include Robert Duncan Wilmot, one of the Fathers of Confederation and a Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, Legislative Council of New Brunswick and Senate of Canada member John Robertson, Bank of New Brunswick director and Liberal House of Commons of Canada member Jeremiah Smith Boies De Veber, physician and Senate of Canada member John Waterhouse Daniel, and Minister of National Revenue David Laurence MacLaren.\nThe Saint John City Council consists of the Mayor and ten Councillors. Eight councillors represent four wards (two per ward) and must be residents of the wards in which they are nominated. The other two are Councillors-at-Large elected by the entire city.\nPublic safety.\nPolice and law enforcement.\nSaint John's law enforcement agency is the Saint John Police Force. It was established in 1849, though police forces in the city date back to 1809. As of December 31, 2023, the police force had 126 sworn officers and 55 civilian staff members. The Saint John Police Force is governed by the Saint John Board of Police Commissioners.\nThe Saint John Police Force was originally based out of the City Hall building from 1971 until 2012, when a new police headquarters was built at Peel Plaza. In 1977, while still based out of the City Hall building, a fire was started in the ground floor jail, killing 21 inmates. In April 1998, the police force's north end station was bombed, injuring a number of officers. An attempted bombing also took place near the jail in June 1998, but was defused.\nFire department.\nSaint John is served under the firefighters of the Saint John Fire Department, which was established in 1786. As of 2024, the department operates from six fire stations.\nMilitary.\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the Carleton Martello Tower, Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the Canadian Forces.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary.\nSaint John is served by two school boards. One is the Anglophone board, known as the Anglophone South School District, one of the four Anglophone K\u201312 school districts in New Brunswick, and headquartered in Saint John. The other school board is the Francophone board, named the Francophone Sud School District, which is based out of Dieppe and serves Saint John's only Francophone school, \u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain.\nThere are 25 public K\u201312 schools in Saint John, with 24 being anglophone and one being francophone. The city is home to Saint John High School, Canada's oldest publicly funded high school. There is also Harbour View High School, St. Malachy's Memorial High School, and Simonds High School.\nPost-secondary.\nSaint John is home to a number of post-secondary institutions, including the smaller of the two campuses of the University of New Brunswick, the Saint John campus (UNBSJ). Opened in 1969 and located next to the Saint John Regional Hospital near Millidgeville, the campus serves around 2,000 of UNB's total student body. As a result of its proximity to the hospital, the Saint John campus also houses Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick for Dalhousie University as well as the Gerald S Merrithew Allied Health Education Centre for the provincial community college. Saint John also contains one of the campuses for the New Brunswick Community College as well as a campus for Eastern College.\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\nPublic library system.\nFirst opening on May 18, 1883, the Saint John Free Public Library was among Canada's first free libraries. It first operated out of the Saint John City Market with a book inventory of 2,885. It temporarily relocated to the Saint John Masonic Temple before moving to a building funded by Andrew Carnegie and constructed in 1904, where it operated until moving to its present location in Market Square in 1983. The library currently maintains three branches.\nLabour.\nCanada's first trade union.\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.\nThe Saint John Street Railwaymen's strike and riot of 1914.\nThe 1914 Saint John street railway strike (sometimes called the \"Saint John street railwaymen's strike\") was a strike by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22 to 24, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\nOctober 14, 1976: The Saint John General Strike.\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.\nThe Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994\u20131996.\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers' pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving's demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.\nMedia.\nPrint.\nSaint John's daily newspaper is the \"Telegraph-Journal\", which was previously owned by J. D. Irving under their Saint John-based publishing company Brunswick News, until its acquisition by Postmedia Network in 2022. The newspaper was created in 1923, following the merger of \"The Daily Journal\" and \"The Daily Telegraph and The Sun\", which itself was created from the merging of \"The Sun\" and \"Daily Telegraph\". Additionally, the University of New Brunswick Saint John campus (UNBSJ) has a student newspaper \"The Baron\". The city was also home to \"Huddle\", a business news website which published from 2015 to 2023.\nOne of the first Black Canadian magazines, \"Neith\", was published in Saint John in 1903\u20131904 by Abraham Beverley Walker.\nTelevision.\nSaint John's television market is served by two stations, those being CHNB-DT (Global) and CKLT-DT (CTV). CHNB-DT is operated in Brunswick Square.\nRadio.\nSaint John is served by both anglophone and francophone radio stations, with all but one being FM broadcast. Music stations include CHWV-FM, (hot adult contemporary), CIOK-FM (adult contemporary), CJRP-FM (Christian contemporary), CJYC-FM (classic hits), CHNI-FM (classic/active rock), CHSJ-FM and CFBC (both country), and CINB-FM (oldies/classic hits). Francophone stations include CHQC-FM (community radio) as well as two other rebroadcast stations CBAL-FM-4 (classical/jazz music) and CBAF-FM-1 (news/talk). The third rebroadcast station in the city, CBZ-FM, is anglophone.\nSaint John also has one anglophone news/talk station CBD-FM as well as one campus radio station CFMH-FM for the University of New Brunswick Saint John campus (UNBSJ).\nTransportation.\nAir.\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the Saint John Airport, near Loch Lomond east northeast of the central business district or approximately by road northeast of the city centre. Flights are offered by Sunwing Airlines (seasonal) and Air Canada (Air Canada Express and Air Canada Rouge). In 2011, WestJet decided to withdraw from the Saint John Airport. Quebec-based Pascan Aviation announced its expansion into Saint John in late 2012, with direct flights from Saint John to Quebec City, Newfoundland, and other destinations beginning in September 2012. Porter Airlines flies once daily from Saint John, to Ottawa and Toronto Island Airport.\nHighways.\nThe main highway in the city is the Saint John Throughway (Route 1). Route 1 extends west to the United States border, and northeast towards both Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. A second major highway, Route 7, connects Saint John with Fredericton. There are two main road crossings over the Saint John River: the Harbour Bridge and the Reversing Falls Bridge, approximately upstream.\nRail.\nPrior to 1918, rail travel to and from Saint John would be carried out through the Intercolonial Railway.\nThe Reversing Falls Railway Bridge carries rail traffic for the New Brunswick Southern Railway on the route from Saint John to Maine. Saint John was serviced by the \"Atlantic\" Line of Via Rail passenger service. Passenger rail service in Saint John was discontinued in December 1994, although the Canadian National Railway and New Brunswick Southern Railway continue to provide freight service.\nPort and ferries.\nPort Saint John is located where the Saint John River meets the Atlantic Ocean. Thus both the ocean and the river system is navigable from Saint John docks. Bay Ferries operates a ferry service, , across the Bay of Fundy to Digby, Nova Scotia.\nThe Summerville-Millidgeville Ferry, a seasonal toll-free ferry service operated by the New Brunswick Department of Transportation, connects the Millidgeville neighbourhood with Summerville, located across the Kennebecasis River on the Kingston Peninsula. Operating from April until the winter season, the service uses the \"Peninsula Princess\", a ferry which, unlike other toll-free ferries in the region, is self-propelled rather than a cable ferry.\nPublic transit.\nSaint John Transit is the largest transit system in New Brunswick in both area coverage and ridership. Bus service is provided by Saint John Transit (Greater Saint John Area) and Maritime Bus (Inter-city). Acadian Lines used to operate regular inter-city bus services between New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Bangor, as well as Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, Quebec (connecting with Orl\u00e9ans Express). Maritime Bus has since replaced Acadian Lines as the regional bus service.\nSports.\nSaint John has been home to multiple provincial, junior league and professional sports teams, including the Saint John Sea Dogs (Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League), the former Saint John Riptide (National Basketball League of Canada), the Saint John Irish (New Brunswick Rugby Union), the Saint John Trojans (New Brunswick Rugby Union), and the Saint John Alpines (New Brunswick Senior Baseball League). The Port City Power, an upcoming professional basketball team and the first Canadian team that will be in The Basketball League, is also based in Saint John.\nThe following sporting events have been held in Saint John:\nCollegiately, Saint John is home to the ACAA UNB Saint John Seawolves, the athletic team representing UNBSJ. The team has six varsity sports: basketball, soccer and volleyball, for both men and women.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28867", "revid": "41906662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28867", "title": "Sigyn", "text": "Mythical wife of Loki\nSigyn (Old Norse \"(woman) friend of victory\") is a deity from Norse mythology. She is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the \"Poetic Edda\", little information is provided about Sigyn other than her role in assisting her husband Loki during his captivity. In the \"Prose Edda\", her role in helping Loki through his time spent in bondage is reiterated, she appears in various kennings, and her status as a goddess is mentioned twice. Sigyn may appear on the Gosforth Cross and has been the subject of an amount of theory and cultural references.\nAttestations.\nSigyn is attested in the following works:\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn stanza 35 of the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", a v\u00f6lva tells Odin that, amongst many other things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a \"grove of hot springs\". Sigyn is mentioned a second (and final) time in the ending prose section of the poem \"Lokasenna\". In the prose, Loki has been bound by the gods with the guts of his son Nari, his son V\u00e1li is described as having been turned into a wolf, and the goddess Ska\u00f0i fastens a venomous snake over Loki's face, from which venom drips. Sigyn holds a basin under the dripping venom. The basin grows full, and she pulls it away, during which time venom drops on Loki, causing him to writhe so violently that earthquakes occur that shake the entire earth.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nSigyn appears in the books \"Gylfaginning\" and \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" in the \"Prose Edda\". In \"Gylfaginning\", Sigyn is introduced in chapter 31. There, she is introduced as being married to Loki, and that they have a son by the name of \"Nari or Narfi\". Sigyn is mentioned again in \"Gylfaginning\" in chapter 50, where events are described differently than in \"Lokasenna\". Here, the gods have captured Loki and his two sons, who are stated as V\u00e1li, described as a son of Loki only, and \"Nari or Narfi\", earlier described a son of Sigyn and Loki. V\u00e1li is changed into a wolf by the gods, and rips apart his brother \"Nari or Narfi\". The guts of \"Nari or Narfi\" are then used to tie Loki to three stones, after which the guts turn to iron, and Ska\u00f0i places a snake above Loki. Sigyn places herself beside him, where she holds out a bowl to catch the dripping venom. However, when the bowl becomes full she leaves to pour out the venom. As a result, Loki is again described as shaking so violently that the planet shakes, and this process repeats until he breaks free, setting Ragnar\u00f6k into motion.\nSigyn is introduced as a goddess, an \u00e1synja, in the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", where the gods are holding a grand feast for the visiting \u00c6gir, and in kennings for Loki: \"husband of Sigyn\", \"cargo [Loki] of incantation-fetter's [Sigyn's] arms\", and in a passage quoted from the 9th-century \"Haustl\u00f6ng\", \"the burden of Sigyn's arms\". The final mention of Sigyn in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" is in the list of \u00e1synjur in the appended Nafna\u00feulur section, chapter 75.\nArchaeological record.\nThe mid-11th century Gosforth Cross located in Cumbria, England, has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.\nScholastic reception.\nWhile the name \"Sigyn\" is found as a female personal name in Old Norse sources (Old Norse \"sigr\" meaning 'victory' and \"vina\" meaning 'female friend'), and though in surviving sources she is largely restricted to a single role, she appears in the 9th century skaldic poem \"Haustl\u00f6ng\" from pagan times, written by the skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir. Due to this early connection with Loki, Sigyn has been theorized as a god dating back to an older form of Germanic paganism.\nModern influence.\nThe scene of Sigyn &amp; Loki has been depicted on a number of paintings, including \"Loke och Sigyn\" (1850) by Nils Blomm\u00e9r, \"Loke och Sigyn\" (1863) by M\u00e5rten Eskil Winge, \"Loki och Sigyn (1879) by Oscar Wergeland, and the illustration \"Loki und Sigyn; Hel mit dem Hunde Garm\" (1883) by K. Ehrenberg. Various objects and places have been named after Sigyn in modern times, including the Norwegian stiff-straw winter wheat varieties \"Sigyn I\" and \"Sigyn II\", a Marvel Comics character (1978) of the same name, the Swedish vessel MS Sigyn, which transports spent nuclear fuel in an allusion to Sigyn holding a bowl beneath the venom to spare Loki, and the antarctic Sigyn Glacier.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The neutral zone came into existence following the Uqair Protocol of 1922 that defined the border between Mandatory Iraq and the Sultanate of Nejd (Saudi Arabia's predecessor state). An agreement to partition the neutral zone was reached by Iraqi and Saudi representatives on 26 December 1981, and approved by the Iraqi National Assembly on 28 January 1982. The territory was divided on an unknown date between 28 January and 30 July 1982. Notice was given to the United Nations in June 1991. \nSince there was no significant infrastructure or urban development in the zone, the population remained sparse and mainly ethnic Bedouin throughout the neutral zone's existence. The people living there were typically scattered in small groups, with limited interaction with the larger settled populations of Iraq or Saudi Arabia.\nHistory.\nThe Treaty of Muhammarah (Khorramshahr), 5 May 1922, forestalled the imminent conflict between the United Kingdom, which held the mandate for Iraq, and the Kingdom of Nejd, which later became Saudi Arabia after it unified with the Kingdom of Hejaz. It was signed by Prince Ahmed bin Abdullah on behalf of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, King of Najd, who did not ratify the treaty. The treaty specifically avoided defining boundaries. Following further negotiations, the Protocol of Uqair (Uqayr), 2 December 1922, defined most of the borders between them and created the neutral zone. The protocol was ratified by Abdulaziz.\nNo military or permanent buildings were to be built in or near the neutral zone, and nomads of both countries were to have unimpeded access to its pastures and wells.\nAdministrative division of the zone was achieved in 1975, and a border treaty concluded in 1981. For unknown reasons, the treaty was not filed with the United Nations, and nobody outside Iraq and Saudi Arabia was notified of the change nor shown maps with details of the new boundary. As the Gulf War approached in early 1991, Iraq cancelled all international agreements with Saudi Arabia since 1968. Saudi Arabia responded by registering all previous boundary agreements negotiated with Iraq at the United Nations in June 1991. Most official maps no longer show the rhombus-shaped neutral zone, but rather draw the boundary approximately through the centre of the territory. For example, the United States\u2019 Office of the Geographer regarded the area as having only an approximate boundary rather than a precise one.\nThe Saudi Arabian\u2013Iraqi neutral zone formerly had the ISO 3166-1 codes codice_1 and codice_2. These codes were discontinued in 1993. The FIPS 10-4 code for the Saudi Arabian\u2013Iraqi neutral zone was codice_3; this code was deleted in 1992.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28869", "revid": "50962566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28869", "title": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)", "text": "Polish trade union formed in 1980\nSolidarity (, ), full name Independent Self-Governing Trade Union \"Solidarity\" ( , abbreviated \"NSZZ \u201eSolidarno\u015b\u0107\u201d\"), is a Polish trade union founded in August 1980 at the Lenin Shipyard in Gda\u0144sk, Poland. Subsequently, it was the first independent trade union in a Warsaw Pact country to be recognised by the state.\nThe union's membership peaked at 10\u00a0million in September 1981, representing one-third of the country's working-age population. In 1983 Solidarity's leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the union is widely recognized as having played a central role in the end of communist rule in Poland. This led to the appointment of the first noncommunist Prime Minister since the 1940s.\nIn the 1980s, Solidarity was a broad anti-authoritarian social movement, using methods of civil resistance to advance the causes of workers' rights and social change. The Government attempted in the early 1980s to destroy the union through the imposition of martial law in Poland and the use of political repression.\nOperating underground, with substantial financial support from the Vatican and the United States, the union survived and in the late 1980s had entered into negotiations with the government.\nThe 1989 round table talks between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition produced an agreement for the 1989 legislative elections, the country's first pluralistic election since 1947. By the end of August, a Solidarity-led coalition government was formed, and in December 1990 Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected President of Poland.\nFollowing Poland's transition to liberal capitalism in the 1990s and the extensive privatization of state assets, Solidarity's membership declined substantially. By 2010, 30 years after its founding, the union had lost more than 90% of its original membership.\nHistory.\nIn the 1970s Poland's government raised food prices while wages were stagnant. This and other stresses led to protests in 1976 and a subsequent government crackdown on dissent. The KOR, the ROPCIO and other groups began to form underground networks to monitor and oppose the government's behaviour. Labour unions formed an important part of this network. In 1979, the Polish economy shrank for the first time since World War II, by two percent. Foreign debt reached around $18\u00a0billion by 1980.\nAnna Walentynowicz was fired from the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard on 7 August 1980, five months before she was due to retire, for participation in the illegal trade union. This management decision enraged the workers of the shipyard, who staged a strike action on 14 August, defending Walentynowicz and demanding her reinstatement. She and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with strikes on other establishments.\nSolidarity emerged on 31 August 1980 at the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard when the Communist government of Poland signed the agreement allowing for its existence. On 17 September 1980, over twenty Inter-factory Founding Committees of independent trade unions merged at the congress into one national organisation, NSZZ Solidarno\u015b\u0107 (Solidarity). It officially registered on 10 November 1980.\nLech Wa\u0142\u0119sa and others formed a broad anti-Soviet social movement ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to members of the anti-Soviet left. Polish nationalism, together with pro-American liberalism, played an important part in the development of Solidarity in the 1980s. \nSolidarity advocated non-violence in its members' activities. \nIn September 1981, Solidarity's first national congress elected Wa\u0142\u0119sa as a president and adopted a republican program, the \"Self-governing Republic\". \nThe government attempted to destroy the union with the martial law of 1981 and several years of repression, but in the end it had to start negotiating: \nRoundtable Talks (from 6 February to 5 April 1989) between the government and Solidarity-led opposition led to semi-free elections on 4 June 1989. By the end of August a Solidarity-led coalition government was formed and Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected Prime Minister. In December 1990, Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected President of Poland, subsequently resigning his chairmanship of the union. Since 1989, Solidarity has become a more traditional trade union, and had relatively little impact on the political scene of Poland in the early 1990s. \nA political arm founded in 1996 as Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) won the parliamentary election in 1997, but lost the following 2001 election. In following years, \"Solidarity\" had little influence on Polish politics.\nSupport from the United States and the European Bloc.\nIn the year leading up to martial law, Reagan Administration policies supported the Solidarity movement, waging a public relations campaign to deter what the Carter administration had seen as \"an imminent move by large Soviet military forces into Poland.\" Michael Reisman from Yale Law School named operations in Poland as one of the covert regime change actions of the CIA during the Cold War. Colonel Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski, a senior officer on the Polish General Staff, was secretly sending reports to CIA officer David Forden. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) transferred around $2\u00a0million yearly in cash to Solidarity from 1982 onwards, for a total of $10\u00a0million over five years. There were no direct links between the CIA and Solidarno\u015b\u0107, and all money was channeled through third parties. CIA officers were barred from meeting Solidarity leaders, and the CIA's contacts with Solidarno\u015b\u0107 activists were weaker than those of the AFL\u2013CIO, which raised $300,000 from its members, which were used to provide material and cash directly to Solidarity, with no control of Solidarity's use of it. The U.S. Congress authorized the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, and the NED allocated $10\u00a0million to Solidarity.\nThe Polish government enacted martial law in December 1981, however, Solidarity was not alerted. Potential explanations for this vary; some believe that the CIA was caught off guard, while others suggest that American policy-makers viewed an internal crackdown as preferable to an \"inevitable Soviet intervention.\" CIA support for Solidarity included money, equipment and training, which was coordinated by Special Operations. Henry Hyde, U.S. House intelligence committee member, stated that the USA provided \"supplies and technical assistance in terms of clandestine newspapers, broadcasting, propaganda, money, organizational help and advice\".\nRelations with the Catholic Church.\nIn 2017, Solidarity backed a proposal to implement blue laws to prohibit Sunday shopping, a move supported by Polish bishops. A 2018 new Polish law banning almost all trade on Sundays has taken effect, with large supermarkets and most other retailers closed for the first time since liberal shopping laws were introduced in the 1990s. The Law and Justice party passed the legislation with the support of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\nLech Wa\u0142\u0119sa has said that Pope John Paul II, and more specifically, his 1979 visit to Poland, was a significant factor in the creation of Solidarity. As John Paul II was a Poland native, he was a figure that the citizens in Poland could identify with personally, but was beyond the reach of the Communist regime. For his actions regarding Poland and Solidarity during his pontificate, he has been named by many world leaders, including Wa\u0142\u0119sa himself, to be one of the main causes of the downfall of not just the Polish regime, but Communism as a whole in Europe.\nSecular philosophical underpinnings.\nAlthough Leszek Ko\u0142akowski's works were officially banned in Poland, and he lived outside the country from the late 1960s, his philosophical ideas nonetheless exerted an influence on the Solidarity movement. Underground copies of his books and essays shaped the opinions of the Polish intellectual opposition. His 1971 essay \"Theses on Hope and Hopelessness\", which suggested that self-organised social groups could gradually expand the spheres of civil society in a totalitarian state, helped inspire the dissident movements of the 1970s that led to the creation of Solidarity and provided a philosophical underpinning for the movement.\nAccording to Ko\u0142akowski, a proletarian revolution has never occurred anywhere, as the October Revolution in Russia had nothing to do with Marxism in his view because it was achieved under the \"Peace, Land and Bread\" slogan. For Ko\u0142akowski, Solidarity was \"perhaps closest to the working class revolution\" that Karl Marx had predicted in the mid-1800s, involving \"the revolutionary movement of industrial workers (very strongly supported by the intelligentsia) against the exploiters, that is to say, the state. And this solitary example of a working class revolution (if even this may be counted) was directed against a socialist state, and carried out under the sign of the cross, with the blessing of the Pope.\"\nPolitics.\nSolidarity endorsed Karol Nawrocki the Law and Justice (PiS) candidate for the 2025 Polish presidential election, Solidarity also endorsed Andrzej Duda the Law and Justice (PiS) candidate in the 2020 Polish presidential election.\nInfluence abroad.\nThe survival of Solidarity was an unprecedented event not only in Poland, a satellite state of the USSR ruled in practice by a one-party Communist state, but the whole of the Eastern bloc. It meant a break in the hard-line stance of the Communist Polish United Workers' Party, which had bloodily ended a 1970 protest with machine-gun fire (killing over thirty and injuring over 1,000), and the broader Soviet Communist government in the Eastern Bloc, which had quelled both the 1956 Hungarian Uprising and the 1968 Prague Spring with Soviet-led invasions.\nSolidarity's influence led to the intensification and spread of anti-Communist ideals and movements throughout the countries of the Eastern Bloc, weakening their Communist governments. As a result of the Round Table Agreement between the Polish government and the Solidarity-led opposition, elections were held in Poland on 4 June 1989, in which the opposition was allowed to field candidates against the Communist party\u2014the first free elections in any Soviet bloc country. A new upper chamber (the Senate) was created in the Polish parliament and all of its 100 seats were contestable in the election, as well as one-third of the seats in the more important lower chamber (the Sejm). Solidarity won 99 of the 100 Senate seats and all 161 contestable seats in the Sejm\u2014a victory that also triggered a chain reaction across the Soviet Union's satellite states, leading to a mostly bloodless chain of anti-communist events in Central and Eastern Europe known as the Revolutions of 1989 (), which ended in the overthrow of each Moscow-imposed regime, and ultimately to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.\nGiven the union's support from many western governments, relations with trade unions in capitalist countries could be complicated. For example, during the UK miners' strike of 1984\u201385, Wa\u0142\u0119sa said that \"The miners should fight, but with common sense\u2014not with destruction\" and said of Margaret Thatcher \"With such a wise and brave woman, Britain will find a solution to the strike.\" However, David Jastrz\u0119bski, the president of Upper Silesia Solidarity, voiced his support of the striking miners: \"Neither the British government's mounted police charges nor its truncheon blows, any more than the Polish junta's tanks or rifle fire, can break our common will to struggle for a better future for the working class.\" This was despite the fact that Arthur Scargill, president of the British National Union of Mineworkers had been highly critical of Solidarity, condemning it as an \"anti-socialist organization which desires the overthrow of a socialist state\". In 2005, the trade union Solidarity \u2013 The Union for British Workers was created by the far-right British National Party in honour of the original Polish union.\nDuring the late 1980s, Solidarity had attempted to establish connections with the internal resistance to apartheid in South Africa. However, according to Wa\u0142\u0119sa, attempts to develop links between the two forces were hampered by their geographical distance, the dearth of media coverage of events outside Poland's borders and especially in South Africa. As a result, relatively little engagement took place between the two groups.\nIn late 2008, several democratic opposition groups in the Russian Federation formed a Solidarity movement.\nIn the United States, the American Solidarity Party (formerly the Christian Democratic Party USA), a Christian democratic political party, attributes its namesake to Solidarity.\nIn a 2011 essay \"The Jacobin Spirit\" in the American magazine \"Jacobin\", philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek called Solidarno\u015b\u0107' one of the \"free spaces at a distance from state power\" that used \"defensive violence\" to protect itself from state control. The notion of \"defensive violence\" runs in the vein of ideas postulated by Alain Badiou. In a conflict summary commissioned by the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict, Maciej Bartkowski wrote that \"Solidarity always pursued its political objectives with a high degree of nonviolent discipline as well as self-imposed limitations.\"\nOrganization.\nThe union was officially founded on 17 September 1980, the union's supreme powers were vested in a legislative body, the \"Convention of Delegates\" (\"Zjazd Delegat\u00f3w\"). The executive branch was the National Coordinating Commission (\"Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza\"), later renamed the National Commission (\"Komisja Krajowa\"). The Union had a regional structure, comprising 38 regions (\"region\") and two districts (\"okr\u0119g\"). At its highest, the Union had over 10\u00a0million members, which became the largest union membership in the world. During the Communist era, the 38 regional delegates were arrested and jailed when martial law came into effect on 13 December 1981 under General Wojciech Jaruzelski. After a one-year prison term the high-ranking members of the union were offered one way trips to any country accepting them (including Canada, the United States, and nations in the Middle East).\nSolidarity was organized as an industrial union, or more specifically according to the One Big Union principle, along the lines of the Industrial Workers of the World and the Spanish Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (workers in every trade were organized by region, rather than by craft).\nIn 2010, Solidarity had more than 400,000 members. National Commission of Independent Self-Governing Trade Union is located in Gda\u0144sk and is composed of Delegates from Regional General Congresses.\nRegional structure.\nSolidarity is divided into 37 regions, and the territorial structure to a large degree reflects the shape of Polish voivodeships, established in 1975 and annulled in 1998 (see: Administrative division of People's Republic of Poland). The regions are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNetwork of key factories.\nThe network of Solidarity branches of the key factories of Poland was created on 14 April 1981 in Gda\u0144sk. It was made of representatives of seventeen factories; each stood for the most important factory of every voivodeship of the pre-1975 Poland. However, there were two exceptions. There was no representative of the Koszalin Voivodeship, and the Katowice Voivodeship was represented by two factories:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At Surtsey is the southernmost point of Iceland. It was formed in a volcanic eruption which began below sea level, and reached the surface on 14 November 1963. The eruption lasted until 5 June 1967, when the island reached its maximum size of . Since then, wave erosion has caused the island to steadily diminish in size: as of 2012[ [update]], its surface area was . The most recent survey (2007) shows the island's maximum elevation at above sea level.\nThe new island was named after Surtr, a fire \"j\u00f6tunn\" or giant from Norse mythology. It was intensively studied by volcanologists during its eruption, and afterwards by botanists and other biologists as life forms gradually colonised the originally barren island. The undersea vents that produced Surtsey are part of the Vestmannaeyjar submarine volcanic system, part of the fissure of the sea floor called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Vestmannaeyjar also produced the famous eruption of Eldfell on the island of Heimaey in 1973. The eruption that created Surtsey also created a few other small islands along this volcanic chain, such as J\u00f3lnir and other, unnamed peaks. Most of these eroded away fairly quickly. It is estimated that Surtsey will remain above sea level until at least the year 2100.\nGeology.\nFormation.\nThe eruption was unexpected, and almost certainly began some days before it became apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated by the water pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows built up a mound of material that approached sea level, the explosions could no longer be contained, and activity broke the surface.\nThe first noticeable indications of volcanic activity were recorded at the seismic station in Kirkjub\u00e6jarklaustur, Iceland from 6 to 8 November 1963, which detected weak tremors emanating from an epicentre approximately west-south-west at a distance of , the location of Surtsey. Another station in Reykjav\u00edk recorded even weaker tremors for ten hours on 12 November at an undetermined location, when seismic activity ceased until 21 November. That same day, people in the coastal town of V\u00edk away noticed a smell of hydrogen sulphide. On 13 November, a fishing vessel in search of herring, equipped with sensitive thermometers, noted sea temperatures SW of the eruption center were higher than surrounding waters.\nEruption at the surface.\nAt 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, the cook of \"\u00cdsleifur II\", a trawler sailing these same waters, spotted a rising column of dark smoke southwest of the boat. The captain thought it might have been a boat on fire, and ordered his crew to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to breach the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several metres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over in length and had reached a height of .\nAs the eruptions continued, they became concentrated at one vent along the fissure and began to build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about . The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over .\nThe explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions caused by the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6\u00a0mi) away from the island, and sent ash clouds as high as up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during this stage of the eruption.\nThe new island was named after the fire \"j\u00f6tunn\" Surtur from Norse mythology (\"Surts\" is the genitive case of \"Surtur\", plus -ey, \"island\") by the Icelandic Naming Committee. Three French journalists representing the magazine \"Paris Match\" notably landed there on 6 December 1963, staying for about 15\u00a0minutes before violent explosions encouraged them to leave. The journalists jokingly claimed French sovereignty over the island, but Iceland quickly asserted that the new island belonged to it.\nPermanent island.\nBy early 1964, the continuing eruptions had built the island to such a size that sea water could no longer easily reach the vents, and the volcanic activity became much less explosive. Instead, lava fountains and flows became the main form of activity. These resulted in a hard cap of extremely erosion-resistant rock being laid down on top of much of the loose volcanic pile, which prevented the island from being washed away rapidly. Effusive eruptions continued until 1965, by which time the island had a surface area of .\nOn 28 December 1963, submarine activity to the northeast of Surtsey began, causing the formation of a ridge high on the sea floor. This seamount was named Surtla , but never reached sea level. Eruptions at Surtla ended on 6 January 1964, and it has since been eroded from its minimum depth of below sea level.\nSubsequent volcanic activity.\nIn 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur ( Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of . Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.\nDuring December 1965, more submarine activity occurred southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named J\u00f3lnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at J\u00f3lnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.\nEffusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24\u00a0cu\u00a0mi), and the island's highest point was above sea level at that time.\nSince the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size. A large area on the southeast side has been eroded away completely, while a sand spit called \"Nor\u00f0urtangi\" (north point) has grown on the north side of the island. It is estimated that about of material has been lost due to erosion\u2014this represents about a quarter of the original above-sea-level volume of the island. Its maximum elevation has diminished to .\nRecent development.\nFollowing the end of the eruption, scientists established a grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change in the shape of the island. In the 20\u00a0years following the end of the eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about per year but slowed to a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.\nVolcanoes in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago are typically monogenetic, and so the island is unlikely to be enlarged in the future by further eruptions. The heavy seas around the island have been eroding it ever since the island appeared, and since the end of the eruption almost half of its original area has been lost. The island currently loses about of its surface area each year.\nFuture.\nAs a suspected part of the Iceland plume, this island is unlikely to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion-resistant tuff material, in a process known as palagonitization. On Surtsey, this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.\nEstimates of how long Surtsey will survive are based on the rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an assessment assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed in the same way as Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.\nBiology.\nSettlement of life.\nA classic site for the study of biocolonisation from founder populations, Surtsey was declared a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.\nPlant life.\nIn the spring of 1965, the first vascular plant, \"Cakile arctica\", was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey. In 1967, the first 2 moss species, \"Funaria hygrometrica\" and \"Bryum argenteum\", were found, and the first lichens were found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular as they have been of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.\nMosses and lichens now cover much of the island. During the island's first 20\u00a0years, 20\u00a0species of plants were observed at one time or another, but only 10 became established in the nutrient-poor sandy soil. As birds began nesting on the island, soil conditions improved, and more vascular plant species were able to survive. In 1998, the first bush was found on the island, being a species of willow (\"Salix\" ssp.)\u2014a tea-leaved willow (\"Salix phylicifolia\"), which can grow to heights of up to . By 2008, 69\u00a0species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2\u20135\u00a0new species per year.\nBird life.\nThe expansion of bird life on the island has both relied on and helped to advance the spread of plant life. Birds use the plants for nesting material, but also continue to assist in the spreading of seeds, and fertilize the soil with their guano. Birds first began nesting on Surtsey three years after the eruptions ended, with northern fulmar (\"Procellaria glacialis\") and black guillemot (\"Cepphus grylle\") being the first species to set up home. Twelve species are now regularly found on the island.\nA gull colony has been present since 1984, although gulls were seen briefly on the shores of the new island weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins (\"Fratercula arctica\"), which are abundant in the rest of the archipelago.\nAs well as providing a home for some species of birds, Surtsey has also been used as a stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans (\"Cygnus cygnus\"), various species of geese, and common ravens (\"Corvus corax\"). Although Surtsey lies to the west of the main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th breeding bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.\nAccording to a 30 May 2009 report, a golden plover (\"Pluvialis apricaria\") was nesting on the island, with four eggs.\nMarine life.\nSoon after the island's formation, seals were seen around the island. They soon began basking there, particularly on the northern spit, which grew as the waves eroded the island. Seals were found to be breeding on the island in 1983, and a group of up to 70 made the island their breeding spot. Grey seals are more common on the island than harbour seals, but both are now well established. The presence of seals attracts orcas, which are frequently seen in the waters around the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago and now frequent the waters around Surtsey.\nOn the submarine portion of the island, many marine species are found. Starfish are abundant, as are sea urchins and limpets. The rocks are covered in algae, and seaweed covers much of the submarine slopes of the volcano, with its densest cover between below sea level.\nOther life.\nInsects arrived on Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first detected in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, carried to the island by winds and their own power. Some were believed to have been blown across from as far away as mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrate specimens, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.\nThe establishment of insect life provided some food for birds, and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for carnivorous insects, while the fertilisation of the soil and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects.\nThe first earthworm was found in a soil sample in 1993, probably carried over from Heimaey by a bird. However, the next year no earthworms were found. Slugs were found in 1998, and appeared to be similar to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and beetles have also become established.\nHuman impact.\nThe only significant human impact is a small prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. There is also an abandoned lighthouse foundation. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to the island's developing ecosystem. It is believed that some boys who sneaked over from Heimaey by rowboat planted potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly managed human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root, which was also destroyed.\nIn 2009, a weather observation station and a webcam were installed on Surtsey.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The party holds 60 of the 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament, and holds 9 out of the 57 Scottish seats in the United Kingdom House of Commons. It is represented by 414 of the 1,226 local councillors across Scotland. The SNP supports and campaigns for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom and for Scotland's membership in the European Union, with a platform based on progressive social policies and civic nationalism. Founded in 1934 with the amalgamation of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party, the party has had continuous parliamentary representation in Westminster since Winnie Ewing won the 1967 Hamilton by-election. In the February 1974 election it scored 22% of the vote and 30% in the October election of the same year, but only notched 7 seats in the former and 11 in the latter of 72 Scottish seats up for election. \nWith the establishment of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999, the SNP became the second-largest party, serving two terms as the opposition to a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition. The SNP gained power under Alex Salmond at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election with 45% of the vote, forming a minority government, before going on to win the 2011 Parliament election, after which it formed Holyrood's first majority government. After Scotland voted against independence in the 2014 referendum, Salmond resigned and was succeeded by Nicola Sturgeon. In the run up to the 2015 election, the SNP trebled its membership to 110,000 .The SNP achieved a record number of 56 seats in Westminster after the 2015 general election to become the third largest party but in Holyrood it was reduced back to being a minority government at the 2016 election. In the 2021 election, the SNP gained one seat and entered a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. In March 2023 Sturgeon resigned and was replaced by Humza Yousaf. \nIn April 2024, Yousaf collapsed the power-sharing deal with the Greens and resigned the following week due to the resulting fallout of the decision. The incumbent John Swinney was elected leader in May 2024. In the 2024 general election, the SNP lost 38 seats, reducing it to the second-largest party in Scotland and the fourth-largest party in the Westminster Parliament. The party does not have any members of the House of Lords on the principle that it opposes the upper house of Parliament and calls for it to be scrapped. The SNP is a member of the European Free Alliance (EFA).\nHistory.\nFoundation and early breakthroughs (1934\u20131970).\nThe SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party, with the Duke of Montrose and Cunninghame Graham as its first joint presidents. Alexander MacEwen was its first chairman.\nThe party was divided on its approach to the Second World War. Professor Douglas Young, who was SNP leader from 1942 to 1945, campaigned for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Axis powers. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted. The party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all-out independence to Home Rule at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the Scottish Covenant Association, a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the Motherwell by-election in 1945, but Robert McIntyre MP lost the seat at the general election three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates. The 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at Glasgow Bridgeton in 1961, West Lothian in 1962 and Glasgow Pollok in 1967. This foreshadowed Winnie Ewing's surprise victory in a by-election at the previously safe Labour seat of Hamilton. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission.\nBecoming a notable force (1970s).\nDespite this breakthrough, the 1970 general election was to prove a disappointment for the party as, despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the Western Isles, making Donald Stewart the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the 1973 by-election at Glasgow Govan where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by Margo MacDonald.\n1974 was to prove something of an \"annus mirabilis\" for the party, as it deployed its highly effective \"It's Scotland's oil\" campaign. The SNP gained six seats at the February general election before hitting a high point in the October re-run, polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's local elections the party claimed overall control of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth.\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the 1977 district elections the SNP saw victories at councils including East Kilbride and Falkirk and held the balance of power in Glasgow. However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections (Glasgow Garscadden, Hamilton and Berwick and East Lothian) as well as the regional elections.\nIn 1976, James Callaghan's minority government made an agreement with the SNP and Plaid Cymru. In return for their support in the Commons, the government would respond to the Kilbrandon commission and legislate to devolve powers from Westminster to Scotland and Wales. The resulting Scotland Act 1978 would create a Scottish assembly, subject to a referendum. Labour, the Liberals and the SNP campaigned for a \"yes\" vote in the referendum on the Scotland Act and \"yes\" won a majority, but a threshold imposed by anti-devolution Labour MP George Cunningham requiring 40% of the electorate to be in favour was not reached due to low turnout. When the government decided not to implement the Act, the SNP's MPs withdrew their support and voted to support Margaret Thatcher's motion of no confidence in Callaghan's government. In the ensuing general election, the party experienced a large drop in its support. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the 2015 general election.\nFactional divisions and infighting (1980s).\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strife occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of the left-wing 79 Group. Traditionalists within the party, centred around Winnie Ewing, by this time an MEP, responded by establishing the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence without a traditional left-right orientation, even though this would have undone the work of figures such as William Wolfe, who developed a clearly social democratic policy platform throughout the 1970s.\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in Ayr, despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of Jim Sillars' Scottish Labour Party (SLP) although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure Gordon Wilson remained party leader through the electoral disappointments of 1983 and 1987, where he lost his own Dundee East seat won 13 years prior.\nThrough this period, Sillars' influence in the party grew, developing a clear socio-economic platform including \"Independence in Europe,\" reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the then-EEC which had been unsuccessful in a 1975 referendum. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming Glasgow Govan in a by-election in 1988.\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens as well as civil society in the Scottish Constitutional Convention which developed a blueprint for a devolved Scottish Parliament due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.\nFirst Salmond era (1990s).\nAlex Salmond had been elected MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in 1990 after a contest with Margaret Ewing. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary John Swinney. The defection of Labour MP Dick Douglas further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the poll tax. Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in 1992 with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with North East Scotland being gained at the 1994 European elections and the party securing a by-election at Perth and Kinross in 1995 after a near-miss at Monklands East the previous year. 1997 offered the party's most successful general election for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either of the two 1974 elections. That September, the party joined with the members of the Scottish Constitutional Convention in the successful Yes-Yes campaign in the devolution referendum which lead to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament with tax-varying powers.\nBy 1999, the first elections to the parliament were being held, although the party suffered a disappointing result, gaining just 35 MSPs in the face of Salmond's unpopular 'Kosovo Broadcast' which opposed NATO intervention in the country.\nOpposing Labour-Liberal Democrat coalitions (1999\u20132007).\nThis meant that the party began as the official opposition in the parliament to a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Salmond found the move to a more consensual politics difficult and sought a return to Westminster, resigning the leadership in 2000 with John Swinney, like Salmond a gradualist, victorious in the ensuring leadership election. Swinney's leadership proved ineffectual, with a loss of one MP in 2001 and a further reduction to 27 MSPs in 2003 despite the Officegate scandal unseating previous First Minister Henry McLeish. However, the only parties to gain seats in that election were the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) which like the SNP support independence.\nFollowing an unsuccessful leadership challenge in 2003, Swinney stepped down following disappointing results in the European elections of 2004 with Salmond victorious in the subsequent leadership contest despite initially refusing to be candidate. Nicola Sturgeon was elected Depute Leader and became the party's leader in the Scottish Parliament until Salmond was able to return at the next parliamentary election.\nSalmond governments (2007\u20132014).\nIn 2007, the SNP emerged as the largest party in the Scottish Parliament with 47 of 129 seats, narrowly ousting Scottish Labour with 46 seats and Alex Salmond becoming First Minister after ousting the Liberal Democrats in Gordon. The Scottish Greens supported Salmond's election as First Minister, and his subsequent appointments of ministers, in return for early tabling of the climate change bill and the SNP nominating a Green MSP to chair a parliamentary committee. Despite this, Salmond's minority government tended to strike budget deals with the Conservatives to stay in office.\nIn the final few years of the New Labour government, there were four parliamentary by-elections in Scotland. The SNP saw marginal swings towards the party in three of them; 2006 in Dunfermline and West Fife, 2008 in Glenrothes and 2009 in Glasgow North East. None were as notable than the 2008 Glasgow East by-election, in which the SNP's John Mason took the third safest Labour seat in Scotland on a 22.5% swing.\nIn May 2011, the SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament with 69 seats. This was followed by a reverse in the party's previous opposition to NATO membership at the party's annual conference in 2012 despite Salmond's refusal to apologise for the Kosovo broadcast on the occasion of the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.\nThis majority enabled the SNP government to hold a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014. The \"No\" vote prevailed in a close-fought campaign, prompting the resignation of First Minister Alex Salmond. Forty-five percent of Scottish voters cast their ballots for independence, with the \"Yes\" side receiving less support than late polling predicted. Exit polling by Lord Ashcroft suggested that many No voters thought independence too risky, while others voted for the Union because of their emotional attachment to Britain. Older voters, women and middle class voters voted no in margins above the national average.\nFollowing the Yes campaign's defeat, Salmond resigned and Nicola Sturgeon won that year's leadership election unopposed.\nSturgeon years (2014\u20132023).\nThe SNP rebounded from their loss at the independence referendum at the 2015 general election eight months later, led by former Depute Leader Nicola Sturgeon. The party went from holding six seats in the House of Commons to 56, ending 51 years of dominance by the Scottish Labour Party. All but three of the fifty-nine constituencies in the country elected an SNP candidate in the party's most comprehensive electoral victory at any level.\nAt the 2016 Scottish election, the SNP lost a net total of six seats, losing its overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, but returning for a third consecutive term as a minority government despite gaining an additional 1.1% of the constituency vote, for the party's best-ever result, from the 2011 election however 2.3% of the regional list vote. On the constituency vote, the SNP gained a net 10 seats from Labour. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats each gained two constituency seats from the SNP on 2011.\nThis election was followed by the 2016 European Union referendum, after which the SNP joined with the Liberal Democrats and Greens to call for continued UK membership of the EU. Despite a consequential increase in the Conservative Party vote at the 2017 local elections the SNP for the first time became the largest party in each of Scotland's four city councils: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, where a Labour administration was ousted after 37 years.\nAt the 2017 general election, the SNP underperformed compared to polling expectations, losing 21 seats to bring their number of Commons seats down to 35 \u2013 however, this was still the party's second-best result ever at the time. This was largely attributed by many, including former Deputy First Minister John Swinney, to their stance on holding a second Scottish independence referendum and saw a swing to the unionist parties, with seats being picked up by the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats and a reduction in their majorities in the other seats. High-profile losses included SNP Commons leader Angus Robertson and former SNP leader and First Minister Alex Salmond.\nThe SNP went on to achieve its best-ever European Parliament result in the final election before Brexit, the party taking its MEP total to three (or half of Scottish seats) and achieving a record vote share for the party. This was also the best performance of any party in the era of proportional elections to the European Parliament in Scotland. This was suggested as being due to the party's europhile sentiment during what amounted to a single-issue election.\nLater that year, the SNP experienced a surge in support at the 2019 general election, winning a 45.0% share of the vote and 48 seats, its second-best result ever. The party gained seven seats from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour. This victory was generally attributed to Sturgeon's cautious approach regarding holding a second independence referendum and a strong emphasis on retaining EU membership during the election campaign. The following January, the strengthened Conservative government ensured that the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.\nAt the 2021 Scottish election, the SNP won 64 seats, one seat short of a majority, albeit achieving a record high number of votes, vote share and constituency seats, and leading to another minority government led by the SNP. Sturgeon emphasised after her party's victory that it would focus on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic as well as pushing for a second referendum on independence.\nAlthough they won with a majority in 2021, a majority of MSPs elected had come from parties that supported Scottish independence; this prompted negotiations between the SNP and the Scottish Green Party to secure a deal that would see Green ministers appointed to government and the Scottish Greens backing SNP policies, with hopes that this united front on independence would solidify the SNP's mandate for the second independence referendum. The Third Sturgeon government was formed with Green support.\nIn July 2021, the Scottish Police launched an investigation into possibly missing funds raised between 2017 and 2020 specifically for a second referendum. The investigation was given the code name Operation Branchform. In the 2022 Scottish local elections, the SNP remained as the biggest party, winning a record number of councillors and securing majority control of Dundee. On 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her intention to resign as leader and first minister.\nOn 16 March 2023, it was revealed that the SNP's membership had fallen to 72,000, down from over 125,000 at the end of 2019. As a result of this, CEO Peter Murrell resigned on 18 March after criticism was levied at him over the way the figures were published.\nYousaf era (March 2023 \u2013 May 2024).\nHumza Yousaf was announced as the next Leader of the Scottish National Party on 27 March 2023 after winning the leadership election. Yousaf defeated challenger Kate Forbes in the final stage, with 52% of the vote to Forbes' 48%. The leadership election was dominated by the strategy for a second independence referendum and the Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which has divided the party. On 29 March 2023, Yousaf was appointed First Minister of Scotland. On 18 April, his government published its policy prospectus titled \"Equality, opportunity, community: New leadership \u2013 A fresh start\"\nOn 23 August 2023, Murray Foote was appointed as the new Chief Executive of the SNP. On 12 October 2023, MP Lisa Cameron crossed the floor to join the Scottish Conservatives, ahead of counting the votes on her selection contest within the SNP for the 2024 United Kingdom general election. She became the first elected representative from the SNP to defect to a unionist party. Cameron claimed a \"toxic and bullying\" culture in the SNP led to her defection.\nOn 15 October 2023, the SNP National Conference voted in favour of Yousaf's strategy on Scottish independence, including a number of amendments proposed from senior SNP representatives. This committed the SNP to launching a Scotland-wide independence campaign before the end of 2023. Yousaf also made a number of policy announcements, including a freeze on Council Tax rates, additional funding for the NHS to reduce waiting lists as well as the issuing of government bonds to fund infrastructure projects.\nOn 25 April 2024, it was announced that the Bute House Agreement would come to an end before a vote was to be held by the Scottish Greens on whether to continue the agreement. Four days later, Yousaf announced that he would be resigning as Leader of the Scottish National Party and as First Minister of Scotland.\nOperation Branchform.\nIn April 2023, two SNP officials were arrested and released without charge in connection with the investigation into Scottish National Party finances: Peter Murrell was arrested on 5 April and Colin Beattie, the SNP treasurer, on 18 April. Murrell is the husband of former party leader, Nicola Sturgeon. The day Murrell was arrested and interviewed, Police Scotland also searched a number of addresses, including the SNP's headquarters and Murrell's home in Glasgow. Beattie resigned as SNP treasurer and was replaced by Stuart McDonald.\nAlso in April, it was reported that the SNP's auditors, Johnston Carmichael, had resigned from their role around October 2022, and were yet to be replaced, three months before the party's accounts 2022 were due to be submitted to the Electoral Commission. New auditors were appointed in May. Filing the party accounts in June 2023, the new auditors highlighted that they had not been able to find original records for some cash and cheques.\nMurrell was re-arrested on 18 April 2024 and charged with embezzlement. He later resigned his membership of the SNP. A Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service spokesman confirmed that it received a report in relation to Murrell and that an investigation into two other individuals \"a man aged 72 and a 53-year-old woman\" were still ongoing.\n Murrell appeared in court for the first time on 20 March 2025 charged with embezzlement. He was released on bail. At the same time, Police Scotland confirmed that its inquiries into Nicola Sturgeon and Colin Beattie had concluded and they were no longer under investigation.\nSwinney era (May 2024 onwards).\nOn 6 May 2024, John Swinney was confirmed as the new leader of the Scottish National Party in the 2024 Scottish National Party leadership election. He was unopposed in the race as on 2 May his main speculated challenger, Kate Forbes, announced she would not stand in the race and endorsed Swinney and on 5 May, Graeme McCormick claimed that he secured enough member votes for a nomination but then dropped out the same evening following a conversation with Swinney, ultimately endorsing him.\nDuring the campaign for the 2024 general election, the SNP was investigated by Holyrood authorities for allegedly misusing MSPs' expenses to fund their campaigning. An anonymous complaint was sent to Alison Johnstone in which an individual claimed that stamps bought with expenses were given to Westminster election candidates for mailing leaflets. The complaint included a WhatsApp screenshot showing MSP staff discussing the traceability of the stamps. Parliamentary rules state that stationery and postage provided by the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body \"must be used only for parliamentary duties and must not be used for any other purpose, including party political purposes\". It was reported that John Swinney's office manager had told an SNP staff WhatsApp group chat that \"stamp fairy is very useful when it comes to campaigns\". An SNP spokesperson confirmed the investigation and emphasized compliance with the rules, while John Swinney stated that he had been \"assured that no parliamentary stamps that have been provided by Parliament have been used to support election purposes\", adding that he was \"confident\" that there had been no use of any public money to support the SNP general election campaign. This investigation occurred amid SNP's financial struggles, falling membership, and the police investigation into alleged embezzlement. Despite a \u00a3128,000 bequest boosting their campaign, SNP spending was minimal compared to other parties.\nThe SNP ultimately won nine seats in the 2024 election, a loss of 39 seats on its 2019 result, reducing it to the second-largest party in Scotland, behind Scottish Labour, and the fourth-largest party in Westminster. Swinney took full responsibility but said that he would not resign as leader. He said of the results, \"There will have to be a lot of soul searching as a party as a consequence of these results that have come in tonight\", and that the SNP has to be \"better at governing on behalf of the people of Scotland\", admitting the party was not \"winning the argument\" on Scottish independence.\nIn November 2024, the SNP announced a plan to reduce permanent paid staff at its headquarters from twenty-six to sixteen, a reduction of more than a third, in order to \"protect the long-term finances of the party\" before the next Scottish Parliament election. The pressure on the SNP's finances was attributed to a reduction in Short Money they receive following the 2024 general election, along with an increased reliance on membership fees over substantial donations.\nConstitution and structure.\nThe local Branches are the primary level of organisation in the SNP. All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association, which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party. Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:\nThere are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussions of party policy by party members.\nMembership.\nThe SNP experienced a large surge in membership following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. In 2013, the party's membership stood at just 20,000, but that number had swelled to over 100,000 by 2015. Party membership peaked in 2019 at around 125,000. Annual accounts submitted by the party to the Electoral Commission showed the SNP to have over 119,000 members in 2021. By the end of 2021, the party reported that this number was 103,884. Membership then continued to fall: to 85,000 at the end of 2022, and to 72,186 in March 2023. By the end of 2023, this had fallen to 69,325 and then to 64,525 by June 2024.\nEuropean affiliation.\nThe SNP retains close links with Plaid Cymru, its counterpart in Wales. MPs from both parties co-operate closely with each other and work as a single parliamentary group within the House of Commons. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are members of the European Free Alliance (EFA), a European political party comprising regionalist political parties. The EFA co-operates with the larger European Green Party to form The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament. Before its affiliation with The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance, the SNP had previously been allied with the European Progressive Democrats (1979\u20131984), Rainbow Group (1989\u20131994) and European Radical Alliance (1994\u20131999).\nAs the UK is no longer a member of the EU, the SNP has no MEPs.\nPolicies.\nIdeology.\nThe Scottish National Party did not have a clear ideological position until the 1970s, when it sought to explicitly present itself as a social democratic party in terms of party policy and publicity. During the period from its foundation until the 1960s, the SNP was essentially a moderate centrist party. Debate within the party focused more on the SNP being distinct as an all-Scotland national movement, with it being neither of the left nor the right, but constituting a new politics that sought to put Scotland first.\nThe SNP was formed through the merger of the centre-left National Party of Scotland (NPS) and the centre-right Scottish Party. The SNP's founders were united over self-determination in principle, though not its exact nature, or the best strategic means to achieve self-government. From the mid-1940s onwards, SNP policy was radical and redistributionist concerning land and in favour of 'the diffusion of economic power', including the decentralisation of industries such as coal to include the involvement of local authorities and regional planning bodies to control industrial structure and development. Party policies supported the economic and social policy status quo of the post-war welfare state.\nBy the 1960s, the SNP was starting to become defined ideologically, with a social democratic tradition emerging as the party grew in urban, industrial Scotland, and its membership experienced an influx of social democrats from the Labour Party, the trade unions and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The emergence of Billy Wolfe as a leading figure in the SNP also contributed to the leftwards shift. By this period, the Labour Party was also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation. Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP, as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members. In 1961, the SNP conference expressed the party's opposition to the siting of the US Polaris submarine base at the Holy Loch. This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to nuclear weapons: a policy that has remained in place ever since. The 1964 policy document, \"SNP &amp; You\", contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to full employment, government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of cooperatives and credit unions, extensive building of council houses (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a minimum wage and an improved national health service.\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish \"Daily Express\" to run as a co-operative. For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies. There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the \"Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)\". In the UK-wide referendum on Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the 79 Group attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"socialist\" party. Members of the 79 Group \u2013 including future party leader and First Minister Alex Salmond \u2013 were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called SNP gradualists and SNP fundamentalists. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the 79 Group was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.\nEconomy.\nDuring the 1970s the SNP campaigned widely on the political slogan It's Scotland's oil, where it was argued that the discovery of North Sea oil off the coast of Scotland, and the revenue that it created would not benefit Scotland to any significant degree while Scotland remained part of the United Kingdom.\nThe Sturgeon Government in 2017 adjusted income tax rates so that low earners would pay less and those earning more than \u00a333,000 a year would pay more. Previously the party had replaced the flat rate Stamp Duty with the LBTT, which uses a graduated tax rate. Whilst in government, the party was also responsible for the establishment of Revenue Scotland to administer devolved taxation.\nHaving previously defined itself in opposition to the poll tax the SNP has also championed progressive taxation at a local level. Despite pledging to introduce a local income tax the Salmond Government found itself unable to replace the council tax and the party has, particularly since the ending of the council tax freeze under Nicola Sturgeon's leadership, committing to increasing the graduated nature of the tax. Conversely, the party has also supported capping and reducing Business Rates in an attempt to support small businesses.\nIt has been noted that the party contains a broader spectrum of opinion regarding economic policy than most political parties in the UK due to its status as \"the only viable vehicle for Scottish independence\", with the party's parliamentary group at Westminster in 2016 including socialists such as Tommy Sheppard and Mhairi Black, capitalists such as Stewart Hosie and former Conservative, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.\nSocial justice.\nIn 1980, when Robin Cook moved an amendment to legalise homosexual acts to the Bill which became the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, the SNP's two MPs Gordon Wilson and Donald Stewart both voted against the amendment.\nIn June 2000, the SNP supported the repeal of section 28, a series of laws across Britain that prohibited the \"promotion of homosexuality\" by local authorities.\nIn government in July 2012, the SNP announced that they would legislate for civil and religious same-sex marriage in Scotland. The bill was fast-tracked through the Scottish Parliament, and approved with 105 MSPs in favour in February 2014.\nUnder Sturgeon's leadership, Scotland was twice in succession named the best country in Europe for LGBT+ legal equality. The party is considered very supportive of gays, lesbians and bisexuals \u2013 something that historically was not the case, as stated above.\nThe SNP legislated to improve gender self-identification with the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill. The policy was controversial within the SNP, with some of the party's social conservatives claiming the reforms could be open to abuse. In 2020, the Scottish Government paused the legislation in order to find \"maximum consensus\" on the issue and commentators described the issue as having divided the SNP like no other, with many dubbing the debate a \"civil war\". In January 2021, a former trans officer in the SNP's LGBT wing, Teddy Hope, quit the party, describing it was one of the \"core hubs of transphobia in Scotland\". Large numbers of LGBT activists followed suit and Sturgeon released a video message in which she said that transphobia is \"not acceptable\" and that she hoped they would one day rejoin the party. In December 2022, the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill was passed by a majority of 86 to 39, with nine SNP members voting against the bill and 54 for.\nParticularly since Nicola Sturgeon's elevation to First Minister the party has highlighted its commitments to gender equality \u2013 with her first act being to appoint a gender balanced cabinet. The SNP have also taken steps to implement all-women shortlists whilst Sturgeon has introduced a mentoring scheme to encourage women's political engagement.\nThe SNP supports multiculturalism with Scotland receiving thousands of refugees from the Syrian Civil War. To this end it has been claimed that refugees in Scotland are better supported than those in England. More generally, the SNP seeks to increase immigration to combat a declining population and calling for a separate Scottish visa even within the UK. However, data for 2022 shows that Scotland houses proportionally fewer asylum seekers relative to its population than England.\nForeign affairs and defence.\nDespite traditionally supporting military neutrality the SNP's policy has in recent years moved to support both the Atlanticist and Europeanist traditions. This is particularly evident in the conclusion of the NATO debate within the party in favour of those who support membership of the military alliance. This is despite the party's continuing opposition to Scotland hosting nuclear weapons and then-leader Salmond's criticism of both the Kosovo intervention and the Iraq War. The party has placed an emphasis on developing positive relations with the United States in recent years despite a lukewarm reaction to the election of part-Scottish American Donald Trump as President due to long running legal disputes.\nHaving opposed continued membership in the 1975 referendum, the party has supported membership of the European Union since the adoption of the Independence in Europe policy during the 1980s. Consequentially, the SNP supported remaining within the EU during the 2016 referendum where every Scottish council area backed this position. Consequently, the party opposed Brexit and sought a further referendum on the withdrawal agreement, ultimately unsuccessfully. The SNP would like to see an independent Scotland as a member of the European Union and NATO and has left open the prospect of an independent Scotland joining the euro.\nThe SNP has also taken a stance against Russian interference abroad \u2013 the party supporting the enlargement of the EU and NATO to areas such as the Western Balkans and Ukraine to counter this influence. The party called for repercussions for Russia regarding the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and has criticised former leader Alex Salmond for broadcasting a chat show on Kremlin-backed network RT. Consequently, party representatives have expressed support for movements such as Euromaidan that support the independence of countries across Eastern Europe.\nThe party have supported measures including foreign aid which seek to facilitate international development through various charitable organisations. In recognition of Scotland's historic links to the country, these programmes are mostly focused in Malawi in common with previous Scottish governments. With local authorities across the country, including Glasgow City Council being involved in this partnership since before the SNP took office in 2007.\nHealth and education.\nThe SNP have pledged to uphold the public service nature of NHS Scotland and are consequently opposed to any attempts at privatisation of the health service, including any inclusion in a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States. The party has been fond of increasing provision under the NHS with the introduction of universal baby boxes based on the Finnish scheme. This supported child development alongside other commitments including the expansion of free childcare for children younger than school age and the introduction of universal free school meals in the first three years of school.\nPreviously, SNP governments have abolished hospital parking charges as well as prescription charges in efforts to promote enhanced public health outcomes by increasing access to care and treatment. Furthermore, during Sturgeon's premiership, Scotland became the first country in the world to introduce alcohol minimum unit pricing to counter alcohol problems. Recently, the party has also committed to providing universal access to sanitary products and the liberalisation of drugs policy through devolution, in an effort to increase access to treatment and improve public health outcomes. Between 2014 and 2019 the party slashed the budget for drug and alcohol treatments by 6.3% \u2013 a cut that has been linked with Scotland recording the highest number of drug deaths per head in Europe.\nThe party aspires to promote universal access to education, with one of the first acts of the Salmond government being to abolish tuition fees \u2013 although it has also introduced a cap on the number of Scots who can attend university and cut funding for further education colleges. More recently, the party has turned its attention to widening access to higher education with Nicola Sturgeon stating that education is her number one priority. At school level, the SNP had the OECD review the Curriculum for Excellence. When the review found that the \"visionary ideals\" of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) had not fully succeeded, they announced a series of educational reforms and the scrapping of the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Furthermore, it has been claimed that a recent decline in Scotland's educational standards as illustrated by PISA studies is directly related to CfE's implementation in 2012.\nConstitution.\nThe foundations of the SNP are a belief that Scotland would be more prosperous by being governed independently from the United Kingdom, although the party was defeated in the 2014 referendum on this issue. The party has since sought to hold a second referendum at some point in the future, perhaps related to the outcome of Brexit, as the party sees a referendum as the only route to independence. In 2016 the party convened the Sustainable Growth Commission to advise on the economy and currency of an independent Scotland. Although the Sustainable Growth Commission's report, published in 2018, divides opinion it contains the party's official economic recommendations in the event of independence. The party is constitutionalist and as such rejects holding such a referendum unilaterally or any course of actions that could lead to comparisons with cases such as Catalonia with the party seeing independence as a process that should be undertaken through a consensual process alongside the UK Government. As part of this process towards independence, the party supports increased devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government, particularly in areas such as welfare and immigration.\nOfficial SNP policy is supportive of the monarchy. Many party members are republicans including former party leader Humza Yousaf but his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, believes it is a \"model with many merits\", although she has proposed reducing the funds spent on the royal family. Separately, the SNP has always opposed the UK's unelected upper house and would like to see both it and the House of Commons elected by a form of proportional representation. The party also supports the introduction of a codified constitution, either for an independent Scotland or the UK as a whole, going as far as producing a proposed interim constitution for Scotland during the independence referendum campaign.\nFundamentalists and gradualists.\nThere have always been divisions within the party on how to achieve Scottish independence, with one wing described as 'fundamentalists' and the other 'gradualists'. The SNP leadership generally subscribes to the gradualist viewpoint, that being the idea that independence can be won by the accumulation by the Scottish Parliament of powers that the UK Parliament currently has over time. Fundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.\nLeadership.\nDepute Leader of the Scottish National Party.\nThe formal title of the deputy leader of the SNP uses the Scots word \"depute\".\nScottish Parliament.\nMembers of the Scottish Parliament.\nThe SNP has formed the Scottish Government since 2007. As of May 2024[ [update]], the Cabinet of the Scottish Government is as follows:\nParliament of the United Kingdom.\nMembers of Parliament.\nFollowing the 2024 general election, the SNP holds nine seats in the House of Commons. The SNP frontbench team in the House of Commons is as follows.\nLocal government.\nCouncillors.\nThe SNP had 453 councillors in local government elected from the 2022 Scottish local elections.\nElectoral performance.\nLocal councils.\nThe Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 established a two-tier system of regions and districts (except in the islands, which were given unitary, all-purpose councils). It replaced the counties, burghs, and districts established by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947, which were largely based on units of local government dating from the Middle Ages.\nThe two-tier system of local government lasted until 1 April 1996 when the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 came into effect, abolishing the regions and districts and replacing them with 32 unitary authorities. Elections for the new mainland unitary authorities were first contested in 1995. The Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 switched the electoral system for Scottish local elections from first past the post (FPTP) to single transferable vote (STV), beginning in 2007.\nEuropean Parliament (1979\u20132020).\nDuring the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union (1973\u20132020), Scotland participated in European Parliament elections, held every five years from 1979 until 2019. Elections between 1979 and 1994 were contested under the first past the post (FPTP) electoral system. The European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 introduced a closed-list party list system method of proportional representation and a single Scotland-wide electoral region, which came into effect in 1999.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28891", "revid": "40255651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28891", "title": "Snowy Mountains", "text": "Mountain range in Australia\nThe Snowy Mountains, known informally as \"The Snowies\", is an IBRA subregion in southern New South Wales, Australia, and is the tallest mountain range in mainland Australia, being part of the continent's Great Dividing Range, a cordillera system. It makes up the northeastern half of the Australian Alps (the other half being the Victorian Alps) and contains Australia's five tallest peaks, all of which are above , including the tallest Mount Kosciuszko, which reaches to a height of above sea level. The offshore Tasmanian highlands makes up the only other major alpine region present in the whole of Australia.\nThe Snowy Mountains experience large natural snowfalls for several months of the year; with significant accumulation during May, June, July, August, September and October with the snow cover usually melting by November (although it can occasionally persist through high summer and the next autumn). It is considered to be one of the centres of the Australian ski industry during the winter months, with all four snow resorts in New South Wales being located in the region. The range is host to the mountain plum-pine, a low-lying type of conifer. \nThe Alpine Way and Snowy Mountains Highway are the major roads through the Snowy Mountains region.\nHistory.\nThe mountain range is thought to have had Aboriginal occupation for 20,000 years. Large gatherings were held in the High Country during summer for collective feasting on the Bogong moth.\nThe area was first explored by Europeans in 1835, and in 1840, Edmund Strzelecki ascended Mount Kosciuszko and named it after the Polish patriot. High country stockmen followed who used the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months. Banjo Paterson's famous poem The Man From Snowy River recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area. Today these huts are maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or volunteer organisations like the Kosciuszko Huts Association.\nIn the 19th century gold was mined on the high plains near Kiandra. At its height this community had a population of about 4,000 people, and ran 14 hotels. Since the last resident left in 1974, Kiandra has become a ghost town of ruins and abandoned diggings.\nThe Kosciuszko National Park came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906. In 1944 this became the Kosciuszko State Park and the Kosciuszko National Park in 1967.\nRecreational skiing began at Kiandra in the 1860s and experienced a boom in the 20th century following the commencement of the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme between 1949 and 1976 which brought many European workers to the district and opened up access to the ranges.\nSkiing.\nThe discovery of gold at Kiandra (elevation ), in 1859, briefly enticed a population of thousands above the snowline and saw the introduction of recreational skiing to the Snowy Mountains around 1861. The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the township remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing for over a century. Australia's first T-bar lift was installed at Kiandra in 1957, but the ski facilities were finally shifted up the hill to Selwyn Snowfields in 1978. Steeper slopes and more reliable snows lie further to the south and in the 20th century, the focus of recreational skiing in New South Wales shifted southward, to the Mount Kosciuszko region.\nThe Kosciuszko Chalet was built at Charlotte Pass in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain. In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the \"World's Longest Chairlift\", designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility. At , Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter. The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at Smiggin Holes around 1939, where horse-drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to begin the arduous ski to the Kosciuszko Chalet. It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts. The Construction of Guthega Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957.\nSkifields up by Kosciuszko's side were also established during this period, though their existence is now little realised. The Australian Alpine Club was founded in 1950 by Charles Anton. Huts were constructed in the \"Backcountry\" close to Mount Kosciuszko, including Kunama Hut, which opened for the 1953 season. A rope tow was installed on Mount Northcote at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an avalanche, which also killed one person, in 1956.\nAnton also recognised the potential of the Thredbo Valley for construction of a major resort and village, with good vertical terrain. Construction began in 1957. Today, Thredbo has 14 ski-lifts and possesses Australia's longest ski resort run, the 5.9\u00a0km from Karel's T-Bar to Friday Flat; Australia's greatest vertical drop of 672\u00a0m; and the highest lifted point in Australia at 2037\u00a0m.\nThe last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of Mount Blue Cow in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss designed Skitube Alpine Railway opened to deliver skiers from Bullocks Flat, on the Alpine Way, to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987. The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2022, Perisher had 48 lifts covering 1,245 hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley, Blue Cow, Smiggin Holes and Guthega.\nSnowy Mountains Scheme.\nThe Snowy Mountains also feed the Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers from the Tooma River, Whites River and Yarrangobilly River. The range is perhaps best known for the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a project to dam the Snowy River, providing both water for irrigation and hydroelectricity.\nThe project began in 1949 employing 100,000 men, two-thirds of whom came from thirty other countries during the post-World War II years. Socially this project symbolises a period during which Australia became an ethnic \"melting pot\" of the twentieth century but which also changed Australia's character and increased its appreciation for a wide range of cultural diversity.\nThe Scheme built several temporary towns for its construction workers, several of which have become permanent: Cabramurra (the highest town in Australia); and Khancoban. Additionally, the economy of Cooma has been sustained by the Scheme. Townships at Adaminaby, Jindabyne and Talbingo were inundated by the construction of Lakes Eucumbene, Jindabyne and Talbingo. Improved vehicular access to the High Country enabled ski-resort villages to be constructed at Thredbo and Guthega in the 1950s by ex-Snowy Scheme workers, who realised the potential for expansion of the Australian ski industry.\nBy 1974, of tunnels and of aqueducts connected the sixteen dams, seven power stations (two underground), and one pumping station. The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated the Snowy Scheme as \"a world-class civil engineering project\".\nThe principal lakes created by the scheme include: Lake Eucumbene, Blowering Dam, Talbingo Dam, Lake Jindabyne and Tantangara Dam.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nThe higher regions of the park experience an alpine climate which is unusual on mainland Australia. Generally, only areas above are subject to a consistent heavy winter snowpack. Snow normally falls to around most winters, and can occur as low as on the windward west side of the Snowies (on the South West Slopes); and on a few occasions has even fallen in Albury only above sea level. The weather station at Charlotte Pass recorded Australia's lowest temperature of on 28 June 1994.\nGlacial lakes.\nPart of the mountains known as Main Range contains mainland Australia's five glacial lakes. The largest of these lakes is Blue Lake, one of the headwaters of the Snowy River. The other four glacial lakes are Lake Albina, Lake Cootapatamba, Club Lake and Headley Tarn.\nDuring the last ice age, which peaked about 20,000 years ago in the Pleistocene epoch, the highest peaks of the main range near Mount Kosciuszko experienced a climate which favoured the formation of glaciers, evidence of which can still be seen today. Cirques moraines, tarn lakes, roche moutonn\u00e9es and other glacial features can all be seen in the area. Lake Cootapatamba, which was formed by an ice spilling from Mount Kosciuszko's southern flank, is the highest lake on the Australian mainland. Lake Albina, Club Lake, Blue Lake, and Hedley Tarn also have glacial origins.\nThere is some disagreement as to exactly how widespread Pleistocene glaciation was on the main range, and little or no evidence from earlier glacial periods exists. The 'David Moraine', a one kilometre long ridge running across Spencers Creek valley seems to indicate a larger glacier existed in this area at some time, however the glacial origin of this feature is disputed.\nThere is evidence of periglacial activity in the area. Solifluction appears to have created terraces on the north west flank of Mount Northcote. Frost heave is also a significant agent of soil erosion in the Kosciuszko Area.\nEcology.\nThe Snowy Mountains cover a variety of climatic regions which support several distinct ecosystems. The alpine area above the tree line is one of the most fragile and covers the smallest area. This area is a patchwork of alpine heaths, herbfields, feldmarks, bogs and fens. The windswept feldmark ecotope is endemic to the alpine region, and covers a mere .\nFauna.\nMany rare or threatened plant and animal species live within the Snowy Mountains. The Kosciuszko National Park is home to one of Australia's most threatened species (the corroboree frog); the endangered mountain pygmy possum and the more common dusky antechinus are located in the high country of the park.\nBy 2008, wild horse numbers in the National Park had reached 1,700 with that figure growing by up to 300 each year, resulting in park authorities coordinating their culling and relocation.\nFlora.\nThe high country is dominated by alpine woodlands, characterised by the snow gum. Montane and wet sclerophyll forests also occur across the ranges, supporting large stands of alpine ash and mountain gum. In the southern Byadbo wilderness area, dry sclerophyll and wattle forests predominate. Amongst the many different native trees in the park, the large Chinese elm has become naturalised.\nBushfires.\n In summer 2003, the Australian Alps experienced their largest bushfires for over 60 years, with an estimated 1.73 million hectares burning. The bushfires burnt across Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) during a drought that ranks as one of the worst in 103 years of official Australian weather records. Fires are a natural feature of the park's ecosystem.\nIn November 2004, the Snowy Mountains Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was set up by the NSW State Premier's Department to help residents in the region recover from the fires. The Taskforce commissioned Louise Darmody from Sound Memories to produce a documentary involving 26 people from the Snowy Mountains to talk about their experiences. The interviewees included farmers, school children, volunteers and employees from the NSW Rural Fire Service and National Park Snowy Hydro.\nAgain in 2020, there was a large bushfire in the Snowy Mountains.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28892", "revid": "42601261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28892", "title": "Skara Brae", "text": "Neolithic archaeological site in Scotland\nSkara Brae is a stone-built Neolithic settlement, located on the Bay of Skaill in the parish of Sandwick, on the west coast of Mainland, the largest island in the Orkney archipelago of Scotland. It consisted of ten clustered houses, made of flagstones, in earthen dams that provided support for the walls; the houses included stone hearths, beds, and cupboards. A primitive sewer system, with \"toilets\" and drains in each house, included water used to flush waste into a drain and out to the ocean. \nThe site was occupied from roughly 3180 BC to around 2500 BC and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Skara Brae gained UNESCO World Heritage Site status as one of four sites making up \"The Heart of Neolithic Orkney\". Older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids of Giza, it has been called the \"Scottish Pompeii\" because of its excellent preservation. \nCare of the site is the responsibility of Historic Environment Scotland which works with partners in managing the site: Orkney Islands Council, NatureScot (Scottish Natural Heritage), and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Visitors to the site are welcome during much of the year.\nUncovered by a storm in 1850, the coastal site may now be at risk from natural erosion.\nDiscovery and early exploration.\nIn the winter of 1850, a severe storm hit Scotland, causing widespread damage and over 200 deaths. In the Bay of Skaill, the storm stripped earth from a large irregular knoll. (The name Skara Brae is a corruption of Skerrabra or Styerrabrae, which originally referred to the knoll.) When the storm cleared, local villagers found the outline of a village consisting of several small houses without roofs. William Graham Watt of Skaill House, a son of the local laird who was a self-taught geologist, began an amateur excavation of the site, but after four houses were uncovered, work was abandoned in 1868. \nThe site remained undisturbed until 1913, when during a single weekend, the site was plundered by a party with shovels who took away an unknown quantity of artefacts. In 1924, another storm swept away part of one of the houses, and it was determined the site should be secured and properly investigated. The job was given to the University of Edinburgh's Professor Vere Childe, who travelled to Skara Brae for the first time in mid-1927.\nIn 2019, a series of photographs showing Childe and four women at the site of the excavation were re-examined. It had been widely believed that the women were tourists or local women visiting the excavation site, but a note on the back of the photographs identified the women as \"4 of [Childe's] lady students\", and it seems that they were active participants in the excavation. The women have been tentatively identified as Margaret Simpson (who was acknowledged in Childe's monographs about Skara Brae), Margaret Mitchell, Mary Kennedy, and Margaret Cole.\nNeolithic lifestyle.\nThe inhabitants of Skara Brae were makers and users of grooved ware, a distinctive style of pottery that had recently appeared in northern Scotland. The houses used earth sheltering: built sunk in the ground, into mounds of prehistoric domestic waste known as middens. This provided the houses with stability and also acted as insulation against Orkney's harsh winter climate. On average, each house measures and has a large square room with a stone hearth used for heating and cooking. Given the number of homes, it seems likely that no more than fifty people lived in Skara Brae at any given time.\nIt is not clear what material the inhabitants burned in their hearths. Childe was sure that the fuel was peat, but a detailed analysis of vegetation patterns and trends suggests climatic conditions conducive to the development of thick beds of peat did not develop in this part of Orkney until after Skara Brae was abandoned. Other possible fuels include driftwood and animal dung. There is evidence that dried seaweed was widely used. At some sites in Orkney, investigators have found a glassy, slag-like material called \"kelp\" or \"cramp\" which may be residual burnt seaweed.\nThe dwellings contain several stone-built pieces of furniture, including cupboards, dressers, seats, and storage boxes. Each dwelling was entered through a low doorway with a stone slab door which could be shut \"by a bar made of bone that slid in bar-holes cut in the stone door jambs.\" Several dwellings offered a small connected antechamber, offering access to a partially covered stone drain leading away from the village. It is suggested that these chambers served as indoor toilets.\nSeven of the houses have similar furniture, with the beds and dressers in the same places in each house. The dresser stands against the wall opposite the door and is the first thing anyone entering the dwelling sees. Each of these houses had a larger bed on the right side of the doorway and a smaller one on the left. Lloyd Laing noted that this pattern accorded with Hebridean custom up to the early 20th century, suggesting that the husband's bed was the larger and the wife's was the smaller. The discovery of beads and paint pots in some of the smaller beds may support this interpretation. Additional support may come from the recognition that stone boxes are located to the left of most doorways, forcing the person entering the house to turn to the right-hand, \"male\" side of the dwelling. At the front of each bed lie the stumps of stone pillars that may have supported a canopy of fur, another link with recent Hebridean style.\nHouse 8 has no storage boxes or dressers and has been divided into something resembling small cubicles. Fragments of stone, bone, and antler were excavated, suggesting House 8 may have been used to make tools such as bone needles or flint axes. The presence of heat-damaged volcanic rocks, and what appears to be a flue, supports this interpretation. House 8 is distinctive in other ways as well: it is a stand-alone structure not surrounded by midden; instead it is above ground with walls over thick and has a \"porch\" protecting the entrance.\nThe site provided the earliest known record of the human flea (\"Pulex irritans\") in Europe.\nThe Grooved Ware People who built Skara Brae were primarily pastoralists who raised cattle, pigs, and sheep. Childe originally believed that the inhabitants did not farm, but excavations in 1972 unearthed seed grains from a midden, suggesting that barley was cultivated. Fish bones and shells are common in the midden, indicating that dwellers ate seafood. Limpet shells are common and may have been used as fish bait, kept in stone boxes in the homes. The boxes were formed from thin slabs with joints carefully sealed with clay to render them waterproof.\nThis pastoral lifestyle stands in sharp contrast to some of the more exotic interpretations of the Skara Brae people's culture. Euan MacKie suggested that Skara Brae might be the home of a privileged theocratic class of wise men who engaged in astronomical and magical ceremonies at nearby Ring of Brodgar and the Standing Stones of Stenness. Graham and Anna Ritchie cast doubt on this interpretation noting there is no archaeological evidence for this claim, although a Neolithic \"low road\" that goes from Skara Brae passes near both these sites and ends at the chambered tomb of Maeshowe. Low roads connect Neolithic ceremonial sites throughout Britain.\nDating and abandonment.\nOriginally, Childe believed that the settlement dated from around 500 BC. This interpretation was coming under increasing challenge by the time new excavations in 1972\u201373 settled the question. Radiocarbon results obtained from samples collected during these excavations indicate that occupation of Skara Brae began about 3180 BC with occupation continuing for about six hundred years. Around 2500 BC, after the climate changed, becoming much colder and wetter, the settlement may have been abandoned by its inhabitants. There are many theories as to why the people of Skara Brae left; particularly popular interpretations involve a major storm. Evan Hadingham combined evidence from found objects with the storm scenario to imagine a dramatic end to the settlement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As was the case at Pompeii, the inhabitants seem to have been taken by surprise and fled in haste, for many of their prized possessions, such as necklaces made from animal teeth and bone, or pins of walrus ivory, were left behind. The remains of choice meat joints were discovered in some of the beds, presumably forming part of the villagers' last supper. One woman was in such haste that her necklace broke as she squeezed through the narrow doorway of her home, scattering a stream of beads along the passageway outside as she fled the encroaching sand.\nAnna Ritchie strongly disagrees with catastrophic interpretations of the village's abandonment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A popular myth would have the village abandoned during a massive storm that threatened to bury it in sand instantly, but the truth is that its burial was gradual and that it had already been abandoned \u2013 for what reason, no one can tell.\nThe site was farther from the sea than it is today, and it is possible that Skara Brae was built adjacent to a fresh water lagoon protected by dunes. Although the visible buildings give an impression of an organic whole, certainly, an unknown quantity of additional structures had already been lost to sea erosion before the site's rediscovery and subsequent protection by a seawall. Uncovered remains are known to exist immediately adjacent to the ancient monument in areas presently covered by fields, and others, of uncertain date, can be seen eroding out of the cliff edge a little to the south of the enclosed area.\nArtefacts.\nEnigmatic carved stone balls have been found at the site and some are on display in the museum. Similar objects have been found throughout northern Scotland. The spiral ornamentation on some of these \"balls\" has been stylistically linked to objects found in the Boyne Valley in Ireland. Similar symbols have been found carved into stone lintels and bed posts. These symbols, sometimes referred to as \"runic writings\", have been subjected to controversial translations. For example, author Rodney Castleden suggested that \"colons\" found punctuating vertical and diagonal symbols may represent separations between words.\nLumps of red ochre found here and at other Neolithic sites have been interpreted as evidence that body painting may have been practised. \nNodules of haematite with polished surfaces have been found as well; the shiny surfaces suggest that the nodules were used to finish leather.\nPottery jars with a volume of up to 30 litres were discovered in a number of the Skara Brae dwellings. Analysis of a greenish slime at the bottom of one revealed that it held an alcoholic beverage made of oats and barley, and seasoned with additional hallucinogenic elements, which would be lethal in certain quantities, such as hemlock, deadly nightshade and henbane.\nOther artefacts excavated on site made of animal, fish, bird, and whalebone, whale and walrus ivory, and orca teeth included awls, needles, knives, beads, adzes, shovels, small bowls and, remarkably, ivory pins up to long. These pins are similar to examples found in passage graves in the Boyne Valley, another piece of evidence suggesting a linkage between the two cultures. The eponymous \"Skaill knife\" was a commonly used tool in Skara Brae; it consists of a large stone flake, with a sharp edge used for cutting, knocked off a sandstone cobble. This neolithic tool is named after Skara Brae's location in the Bay of Skaill on Orkney. Skaill knives have been found throughout Orkney and Shetland.\nThe 1972 excavations reached layers that had remained waterlogged and had preserved items that otherwise would have been destroyed. These include a twisted skein of heather, one of a very few known examples of Neolithic rope, and a wooden handle.\nIn 2016, a carved whalebone figurine dubbed 'Skara Brae Buddo' was rediscovered in a box at Stromness Museum. Thought to be 5,000 years old, the artefact has four holes, in similar positioning to eyes, a mouth and a navel. The figurine was only known about because of a sketch recorded by antiquarian George Petrie in the 19th century.\nRelated sites in Orkney.\nKnap of Howar, on the Orkney island of Papa Westray, is a well-preserved Neolithic farmstead. Dating from 3500\u00a0BC to 3100\u00a0BC, it is similar in design to Skara Brae, but from an earlier period, and it is thought to be the oldest preserved standing building in northern Europe.\nThe Barnhouse Settlement is by Loch of Harray on the Orkney Mainland, not far from the Standing Stones of Stenness. Excavations were conducted between 1986 and 1991, over time revealing the base courses of at least 15 houses. The houses have similarities to those of the early phase of Skara Brae in that they have central hearths, beds built against the walls and stone dressers, and internal drains, but differ in that the houses seem to have been free-standing. The settlement dates back to circa 3000 BC.\nA comparable, though smaller, site exists at Rinyo on Rousay, Orkney. Unusually, no Maeshowe-type tombs have been found on Rousay and although there are a large number of Orkney\u2013Cromarty chambered cairns, these were built by Unstan ware people.\nThere is also a site currently under excavation at Links of Noltland on Westray that appears to have similarities to Skara Brae.\nWorld Heritage status.\n\"The Heart of Neolithic Orkney\" was inscribed as a World Heritage site in December 1999. In addition to Skara Brae the site includes Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar, the Standing Stones of Stenness and other nearby sites. It is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, whose \"Statement of Significance\" for the site begins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of civilisation.\nSome areas and facilities were closed due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic during parts of 2020 and into 2021.\nRisk from climate change.\nIn 2019, a risk assessment was performed to assess the site's vulnerability to climate change. The report by Historic Environment Scotland, the Orkney Islands Council and others concludes that the entire Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, and in particular Skara Brae, is \"extremely vulnerable\" to climate change due to rising sea levels, increased rainfall and other factors; it also highlights the risk that Skara Brae could be partially destroyed by one unusually severe storm.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is widely studied by Christians and historians, providing a glimpse into the theology of the First Great Awakening of c.\u20091730\u20131755.\nThis was a highly influential sermon of the Great Awakening, emphasizing God's wrath upon unbelievers after death to a very real, horrific, and fiery Hell. The underlying point is that God has given humans a chance to confess their sins. It is the mere will of God, according to Edwards, that keeps wicked men from being overtaken by the devil and his demons and cast into the furnace of Hell \u2013 \"like greedy hungry lions, that see their prey, and expect to have it, but are for the present kept back [by God's hand].\" Mankind's own attempts to avoid falling into the \"bottomless gulf\" due to the overwhelming \"weight and pressure towards hell\" are insufficient and have no more effect than \"a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock\". This act of grace from God has given humans a chance to believe and trust in Christ. Edwards provides much varied and vivid imagery to illustrate this main theme throughout.\nDoctrine.\nMost of the sermon's text consists of ten \"considerations\":\nPurpose.\nOne church in Enfield, Connecticut, had been largely unaffected during the First Great Awakening of New England. Edwards was invited by the pastor of the church to preach to them. Edwards's aim was to teach his listeners about the horrors of Hell, the dangers of sin, and the terrors of being lost. Edwards described the position of those who do not follow Christ's urgent call to receive forgiveness. Edwards scholar John E. Smith notes that despite the apparent pessimism of the notion of an angry God, that pessimism is \"overcome by the comforting hope of salvation through a triumphant, loving savior.\" Whenever Edwards preached terror, it was part of a larger campaign to turn sinners from their disastrous path and to the rightful object of their affections, Jesus.\nApplication.\nIn the final section of \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\" Edwards shows that his theological argument holds throughout scripture and biblical history. He invokes stories and examples throughout the Bible. Edwards ends the sermon with one final appeal: \"Therefore let everyone that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath to come.\" According to Edwards and the Bible, only by returning to Christ can one escape the stark fate he outlines.\nEffect and legacy.\nReverend Stephen Williams was in attendance at the Enfield sermon, and would describe it in his diary as \"a most awakening sermon\". As for the congregation's reaction, he recalled that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[B]efore the sermon was done there was a great moaning and crying out through the whole house \u2014 \"What shall I do to be saved?\" \"Oh, I am going to hell!\" \"Oh what shall I do for a Christ?\" and so forth \u2014 so that the minister was obliged to desist. [The] shrieks and cries were piercing and amazing. After some time of waiting, the congregation were still, so that a prayer was made by Mr. Wheelock, and after that we descended from the pulpit and discoursed with the people, some in one place and some in another. And amazing and astonishing: the power [of] God was seen and several souls were hopefully wrought upon that night, and oh the cheerfulness and pleasantness of their countenances that received comfort. Oh that God would strengthen and confirm [their new faith]! We sang a hymn and prayed, and dispersed the assembly.\nAlthough the sermon has received criticism, Edwards' words have endured and are still read to this day. Edwards' sermon continues to be the leading example of a First Great Awakening sermon and is still used in religious and academic studies.\nSince the 1950s, a number of critical perspectives were used to analyze the sermon. The first comprehensive academic analysis of \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\" was published by Edwin Cady in 1949, who comments on the imagery of the sermon and distinguishes between the \"clich\u00e9\" and \"fresh\" figurative images, stressing how the former related to colonial life. Lee Stuart questions that the message of the sermon was solely negative and attributes its success to the final passages in which the sinners are actually \"comforted\". Rosemary Hearn argues that it is the logical structure of the sermon that constitutes its most important persuasive element. Lemay looks into the changes in the syntactic categories, like grammatical tenses, in the text of the sermon. Lukasik stresses how, in the sermon, Edwards appropriates Newtonian physics, especially the image of the gravitational pull that would relentlessly bring down the sinners. Gallagher focuses on the \"beat\" of the sermon, and on how the consecutive structural elements of the sermon serve different persuasive aims. Choi\u0144ski suggests that the rhetorical success of the sermon consists in the use of the \"deictic shift\" that transported the hearers mentally into the figurative images of hell.\nJonathan Edwards also wrote and spoke a great deal on heaven and angels, writes John Gerstner in \"Jonathan Edwards on Heaven and Hell\", 1991, and those themes are less remembered, namely \"Heaven is a World of Love\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east.\nOriginally home to the Caledonians/Picts, the region came to be the mainland stronghold of the Hebridean Gaels, whose Q-Celtic language succeeded that of their P-Celtic neighbours. The Scottish Gaelic name of \"\" literally means \"the place of the Gaels\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands. Culturally, the Highlands and the Lowlands diverged from the Late Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots language replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands.\nThe area is very sparsely populated, with many mountain ranges dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles, Ben Nevis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries the population of the Highlands rose to around 300,000, but from c. 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.) The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe. At in 2012, the population density in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland's as a whole.\nThe Highland Council is the administrative body for much of the Highlands, with its administrative centre at Inverness. However, the Highlands also includes parts of the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire.\nThe Scottish Highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the taiga biome, as it features concentrated populations of Scots pine forest (see Caledonian Forest). It is the most mountainous part of the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nCulture.\nBetween the 15th century and the mid-20th century, the area differed from most of the Lowlands in terms of language. In Scottish Gaelic, the region is known as the \"\", because it was traditionally the Gaelic-speaking part of Scotland, although the language is now largely confined to The Hebrides. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably but have different meanings in their respective languages. Scottish English (in its Highland form) is the predominant language of the area today, though Highland English has been influenced by Gaelic speech to a significant extent. Historically, the \"Highland line\" distinguished the two Scottish cultures. While the Highland line broadly followed the geography of the Grampians in the south, it continued in the north, cutting off the north-eastern areas, that is Eastern Caithness, Orkney and Shetland, from the more Gaelic Highlands and Hebrides.\nHistorically, the major social unit of the Highlands was the clan. Scottish kings, particularly James VI, saw clans as a challenge to their authority; the Highlands was seen by many as a lawless region. Some Lowlands commentators viewed the Highlanders as backward and more \"Irish\", \"Erse\". Following the Union of the Crowns, James VI had the military strength to back up any attempts to impose some control. The result was, in 1609, the Statutes of Iona which started the process of integrating clan leaders into Scottish society. The gradual changes continued into the 19th century, as clan chiefs thought of themselves less as patriarchal leaders of their people and more as commercial landlords. The first effect on the clansmen who were their tenants was the change to rents being payable in money rather than in kind. Later, rents were increased as Highland landowners sought to increase their income. This was followed, mostly in the period 1760\u20131850, by agricultural improvement that often (particularly in the Western Highlands) involved clearance of the population to make way for large scale sheep farms. Displaced tenants were set up in crofting communities in the process. The crofts were intended not to provide all the needs of their occupiers; they were expected to work in other industries such as kelping and fishing. Crofters came to rely substantially on seasonal migrant work, particularly in the Lowlands. This gave impetus to the learning of English, which was seen by many rural Gaelic speakers to be the essential \"language of work\".\nOlder historiography attributes the collapse of the clan system to the aftermath of the Jacobite risings. This is now thought less influential by historians. Following the Jacobite rising of 1745 the British government enacted a series of laws to try to suppress the clan system, including bans on the bearing of arms and the wearing of tartan, and limitations on the activities of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Most of this legislation was repealed by the end of the 18th century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a rehabilitation of Highland culture. Tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British Army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers in the era of the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783) and Napoleonic Wars (1790\u20131815). Tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region, but in the 1820s, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe. The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the Ossian cycle, and further popularised by the works of Walter Scott. His \"staging\" of the visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish woollen industry. Individual clan tartans were largely designated in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity. This \"Highlandism\", by which all of Scotland was identified with the culture of the Highlands, was cemented by Queen Victoria's interest in the country, her adoption of Balmoral as a major royal retreat, and her interest in \"tartanry\".\nEconomy.\nRecurrent famine affected the Highlands for much of its history, with significant instances as late as 1817 in the Eastern Highlands and the early 1850s in the West. Over the 18th century, the region had developed a trade of black cattle into Lowland markets, and this was balanced by imports of meal into the area. There was a critical reliance on this trade to provide sufficient food, and it is seen as an essential prerequisite for the population growth that started in the 18th century.48\u201349 Most of the Highlands, particularly in the North and West, was short of the arable land that was essential for the mixed, run rig based, communal farming that existed before agricultural improvement was introduced into the region. Between the 1760s and the 1830s there was a substantial trade in unlicensed whisky that had been distilled in the Highlands. Lowland distillers (who were not able to avoid the heavy taxation of this product) complained that Highland whisky made up more than half the market. The development of the cattle trade is taken as evidence that the pre-improvement Highlands was not an immutable system, but did exploit the economic opportunities that came its way.24 The illicit whisky trade demonstrates the entrepreneurial ability of the peasant classes.\nAgricultural improvement reached the Highlands mostly over the period 1760 to 1850. Agricultural advisors, factors, land surveyors and others educated in the thinking of Adam Smith were keen to put into practice the new ideas taught in Scottish universities.141 Highland landowners, many of whom were burdened with chronic debts, were generally receptive to the advice they offered and keen to increase the income from their land. In the East and South the resulting change was similar to that in the Lowlands, with the creation of larger farms with single tenants, enclosure of the old run rig fields, introduction of new crops (such as turnips), land drainage and, as a consequence of all this, eviction, as part of the Highland clearances, of many tenants and cottars. Some of those cleared found employment on the new, larger farms, others moved to the accessible towns of the Lowlands.\nIn the West and North, evicted tenants were usually given tenancies in newly created crofting communities, while their former holdings were converted into large sheep farms. Sheep farmers could pay substantially higher rents than the run rig farmers and were much less prone to falling into arrears. Each croft was limited in size so that the tenants would have to find work elsewhere. The major alternatives were fishing and the kelp industry. Landlords took control of the kelp shores, deducting the wages earned by their tenants from the rent due and retaining the large profits that could be earned at the high prices paid for the processed product during the Napoleonic wars.1\u201312\nWhen the Napoleonic wars finished in 1815, the Highland industries were affected by the return to a peacetime economy. The price of black cattle fell, nearly halving between 1810 and the 1830s. Kelp prices had peaked in 1810, but reduced from \u00a39 a ton in 1823 to \u00a33 13s 4d a ton in 1828. Wool prices were also badly affected. This worsened the financial problems of debt-encumbered landlords. Then, in 1846, potato blight arrived in the Highlands, wiping out the essential subsistence crop for the overcrowded crofting communities. As the famine struck, the government made clear to landlords that it was their responsibility to provide famine relief for their tenants. The result of the economic downturn had been that a large proportion of Highland estates were sold in the first half of the 19th century. T M Devine points out that in the region most affected by the potato famine, by 1846, 70 per cent of the landowners were new purchasers who had not owned Highland property before 1800. More landlords were obliged to sell due to the cost of famine relief. Those who were protected from the worst of the crisis were those with extensive rental income from sheep farms.93\u201395 Government loans were made available for drainage works, road building and other improvements and many crofters became temporary migrants \u2013 taking work in the Lowlands. When the potato famine ceased in 1856, this established a pattern of more extensive working away from the Highlands.146\u201366\nThe unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional and controversial subject, of enormous importance to the Highland economy, and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The poor crofters were politically powerless, and many of them turned to religion. They embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian revival after 1800. Most joined the breakaway \"Free Church\" after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. The religious change energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords; it helped prepare them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the Highland Land League.\nViolence erupted, starting on the Isle of Skye, when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quietened when the government stepped in, passing the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless. This contrasted with the Irish Land War underway at the same time, where the Irish were intensely politicised through roots in Irish nationalism, while political dimensions were limited. In 1885 three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, which listened to their pleas. The results included explicit security for the Scottish smallholders in the \"crofting counties\"; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants; and the creation of a Crofting Commission. The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the Liberal Party gained their votes.\nWhisky production.\nToday, the Highlands are the largest of Scotland's whisky producing regions; the relevant area runs from Orkney to the Isle of Arran in the south and includes the northern isles and much of Inner and Outer Hebrides, Argyll, Stirlingshire, Arran, as well as sections of Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. (Other sources treat The Islands, except Islay, as a separate whisky producing region.) This massive area has over 30 distilleries, or 47 when the Islands sub-region is included in the count. According to one source, the top five are Macallan, Glenfiddich, Aberlour, Glenfarclas, and Balvenie. While Speyside is geographically within the Highlands, that region is specified as distinct in terms of whisky productions. Speyside single malt whiskies are produced by about 50 distilleries.\nAccording to \"Visit Scotland\", Highlands whisky is \"fruity, sweet, spicy, malty\". Another review states that Northern Highlands single malt is \"sweet and full-bodied\", the Eastern Highlands and Southern Highlands whiskies tend to be \"lighter in texture\" while the distilleries in the Western Highlands produce single malts with a \"much peatier influence\".\nReligion.\nThe Scottish Reformation achieved partial success in the Highlands. Roman Catholicism remained strong in some areas, owing to remote locations and the efforts of Franciscan missionaries from Ireland, who regularly came to celebrate Mass. There remain significant Catholic strongholds within the Highlands and Islands such as Moidart and Morar on the mainland and South Uist and Barra in the southern Outer Hebrides.\nThe remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw somewhat greater success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society after the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In the 19th century, the evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.\nFor the most part, however, the Highlands are considered predominantly Protestant, belonging to the Church of Scotland. In contrast to the Catholic southern islands, the northern Outer Hebrides islands (Lewis, Harris and North Uist) have an exceptionally high proportion of their population belonging to the Protestant Free Church of Scotland or the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The Outer Hebrides have been described as the last bastion of Calvinism in Britain and the Sabbath remains widely observed. Inverness and the surrounding area has a majority Protestant population, with most locals belonging to either The Kirk or the Free Church of Scotland. The church maintains a noticeable presence within the area, with church attendance notably higher than in other parts of Scotland. Religion continues to play an important role in Highland culture, with Sabbath observance still widely practised, particularly in the Hebrides.\nHistorical geography.\nIn geography, the Highland-Lowland boundary is sometimes related to the Highland Boundary Fault, which crosses mainland Scotland in a near-straight line from Helensburgh to Stonehaven. However the flat coastal lands that occupy parts of the counties of Nairnshire, Morayshire, Banffshire and Aberdeenshire are often excluded as they do not share the distinctive geographical and cultural features of the rest of the Highlands. The north-east of Caithness, as well as Orkney and Shetland, are also often excluded from the Highlands, although the Hebrides are usually included. The Highland area, as so defined, differed from the Lowlands in language and tradition, having preserved Gaelic speech and customs centuries after the anglicisation of the latter; this led to a growing perception of a divide, with the cultural distinction between Highlander and Lowlander first noted towards the end of the 14th century. In Aberdeenshire, the boundary between the Highlands and the Lowlands is not well defined. There is a stone beside the A93 road near the village of Dinnet on Royal Deeside which states 'You are now in the Highlands', although there are areas of Highland character to the east of this point.\nA much wider definition of the Highlands is that used by the Scotch whisky industry. Highland single malts are produced at distilleries north of an imaginary line between Dundee and Greenock, thus including all of Aberdeenshire and Angus.\nInverness is regarded as the Capital of the Highlands, although less so in the Highland parts of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Perthshire and Stirlingshire which look more to Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, and Stirling as their commercial centres.\nHighland Council area.\nThe Highland Council area, created as one of the local government regions of Scotland, has been a unitary council area since 1996. The council area excludes a large area of the southern and eastern Highlands, and the Western Isles, but includes Caithness. \"Highlands\" is sometimes used, however, as a name for the council area, as in the former \"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service\". \"Northern\" is also used to refer to the area, as in the former \"Northern Constabulary\". These former bodies both covered the Highland council area and the island council areas of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles.\nHighland Council signs in the Pass of Drumochter, between Glen Garry and Dalwhinnie, say \"Welcome to the Highlands\".\nHighlands and Islands.\nMuch of the Highlands area overlaps the Highlands and Islands area. An electoral region called \"Highlands and Islands\" is used in elections to the Scottish Parliament: this area includes Orkney and Shetland, as well as the Highland Council local government area, the Western Isles and most of the Argyll and Bute and Moray local government areas. \"Highlands and Islands\" has, however, different meanings in different contexts. It means Highland (the local government area), Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles in \"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service\". \"Northern\", as in \"Northern Constabulary\", refers to the same area as that covered by the fire and rescue service.\nHistorical crossings.\nThere have been trackways from the Lowlands to the Highlands since prehistoric times. Many traverse the Mounth, a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the North Sea slightly north of Stonehaven. The most well-known and historically important trackways are the Causey Mounth, Elsick Mounth, Cryne Corse Mounth and Cairnamounth.\nCourier delivery.\nAlthough most of the Highlands is geographically on the British mainland, it is somewhat less accessible than the rest of Britain; thus most UK couriers categorise it separately, alongside Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and other offshore islands. They thus charge additional fees for delivery to the Highlands, or exclude the area entirely. While the physical remoteness from the largest population centres inevitably leads to higher transit cost, there is confusion and consternation over the scale of the fees charged and the effectiveness of their communication, and the use of the word Mainland in their justification. Since the charges are often based on postcode areas, many far less remote areas, including some which are traditionally considered part of the lowlands, are also subject to these charges. Royal Mail is the only delivery network bound by a Universal Service Obligation to charge a uniform tariff across the UK. This, however, applies only to mail items and not larger packages which are dealt with by its Parcelforce division.\nGeology.\nThe Highlands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland is largely composed of ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian periods which were uplifted during the later Caledonian Orogeny. Smaller formations of Lewisian gneiss in the northwest are up to 3\u00a0billion years old. The overlying rocks of the Torridon Sandstone form mountains in the Torridon Hills such as Liathach and Beinn Eighe in Wester Ross.\nThese foundations are interspersed with many igneous intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and the Cuillin of Skye. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstone found principally along the Moray Firth coast and partially down the Highland Boundary Fault. The Jurassic beds found in isolated locations on Skye and Applecross reflect the complex underlying geology. They are the original source of much North Sea oil. The Great Glen is formed along a transform fault which divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands.\nThe entire region was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages, save perhaps for a few nunataks. The complex geomorphology includes incised valleys and lochs carved by the action of mountain streams and ice, and a topography of irregularly distributed mountains whose summits have similar heights above sea-level, but whose bases depend upon the amount of denudation to which the plateau has been subjected in various places.\nClimate.\nThe region is much warmer than other areas at similar latitudes (such as Kamchatka in Russia, or Labrador in Canada) because of the Gulf Stream making it cool, damp and temperate. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification is \"Cfb\" at low elevations, then becoming \"Cfc\", \"Dfc\" and \"ET\" at higher elevations.\nPlaces of interest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28896", "revid": "50681934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28896", "title": "Scotch whisky", "text": "Malt or grain whisky distilled in Scotland\nScotch whisky (; or ), often simply called whisky or Scotch, is malt whisky or grain whisky (or a blend of the two) made in Scotland.\nThe first known written mention of Scotch whisky is in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland of 1494. All Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century. As of May 2024, there were 151 whisky distilleries operating in Scotland, making Scotch whisky one of the most renowned geographical indications worldwide.\nAll Scotch whisky must be aged immediately after distillation in oak barrels for at least three years. Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to create that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed-age whisky. A whisky without an age statement is known as a no age statement (NAS) whisky, the only guarantee being that all whisky contained in that bottle is at least three years old. The minimum bottling strength according to existing regulations is 40% alcohol by volume. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky.\nMany Scotch whisky drinkers refer to a unit for drinking as a dram. The word \"whisky\" comes from the Gaelic \"uisge beatha\" or \"usquebaugh \"'water of life' (a calque of Medieval Latin \"aqua vitae\"; compare aquavit).\nHistory.\nThe earliest record of distillation in Scotland is in the \"Exchequer Rolls of Scotland\" for 1494.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Friar John Cor, by order of the King, to make aqua vitae, VIII bolls of malt.\u2014\u200a\nThe Exchequer Rolls' record crown income and expenditure and the quote records eight bolls of malt given to Friar John Cor to make aqua vitae over the previous year. The term is Latin for \"water of life\" and was the general term for distilled spirits. This would be enough for 1,500 bottles, which suggests that distillation was well-established by the late 15th century.\nThe first known reference to a still for making \"aquavite\" in Scotland appears in the Aberdeen council registers, in a case heard in 1505 by the town's bailies concerning the inheritance of goods belonging to a chaplain named Sir Andrew Gray, who died in 1504. Among his goods was recorded (in Middle Scots) \"ane stellatour for aquavite and ros wattir'\".\nAqua vitae (in the form of wine or spirits) was used when making gunpowder to moisten the slurry of saltpetre, charcoal and sulphur. As a drink, Scotch whisky was a favourite of King James IV of Scotland.\nSpirit production was first taxed by the Parliament of Scotland from January 1644, with an excise duty of 2s 8d imposed per Scots pint; instigating the illicit distilling of spirits within the country. Between the 1760s and the 1830s a substantial unlicensed trade originated from the Highlands, forming a significant part of the region's export economy. In 1782, more than 1,000 illegal stills were seized in the Highlands: these can only have been a fraction of those in operation. The Lowland distillers, who had no opportunity to avoid taxation, complained that untaxed Highland whisky made up more than half the market. The heavy taxation during the Napoleonic Wars gave the illicit trade a large advantage, but their product was also considered better quality, commanding a higher price in the Lowlands. This was due to the method of taxation: malt was subject to tax (at a rate that climbed substantially between the 1790s and 1822). The licensed distillers, therefore, used more raw grain in an effort to reduce their tax bill.119-134\nThe Highland magistrates, themselves members of the landowning classes, had a lenient attitude to unlicensed distillers\u2014all of whom would be tenants in the local area. They understood that the trade supported the rents paid. Imprisoned tenants would not be able to pay any rent.119-134\nIn 1823, Parliament eased restrictions on licensed distilleries with the Excise Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 94), while at the same time making it harder for the illegal stills to operate. Magistrates found counsel for the Crown appearing in their courts, so forcing the maximum penalties to be applied, with some cases removed to the Court of Exchequer in Edinburgh for tougher sentences. Highland landowners were now happy to remove tenants who were distillers in clearances on their estates. These changes ushered in the modern era of Scotch production: in 1823 2,232,000 gallons of whisky had duty paid on it; in 1824 this increased to 4,350,000 gallons.\nA farmer, George Smith, working under landlord the Duke of Gordon, was the first person in Scotland to take out a licence for a distillery under the new act, founding the Glenlivet Distillery in 1824, to make single malt Scotch. Some of the distilleries which started legal operations in the next few years included Bowmore, Strathisla, Balblair, and Glenmorangie; all remain in business today.\nTwo events helped to increase whisky's popularity. The first was the introduction in 1831 of the column still. Aeneas Coffey patented a refined version of a design originally created by Robert Stein, based on early innovations by Anthony Perrier, for the new type of still which produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills. The column still allowed for continuous distillation, without the need for cleaning after each batch was made. This process made manufacturing more affordable by performing the equivalent of multiple distillation steps. The new still dramatically increased production and the resultant whisky was less intense and smoother, making it more popular. Secondly, there was a shortage of wine and brandy in France, significant by 1880, due to \"phylloxera\", a parasitic insect, destroying many vineyards, which led to a surge in demand for whisky. By the 1890s, almost forty new distilleries had opened in Scotland. In a speculative boom, the Edinburgh blenders Pattisons Ltd. came to prominence before spectacularly failing. In the downturn, The Distillers Company were able to buy up other firms' assets. The industry was also affected by disputes about whether grain or blended whisky was worthy of the name, with an adverse decision in North London Police Court in 1905. A \"Royal Commission on Whisky and other Potable Spirits\" was appointed in 1906 and reported in 1909 with a victory for the grain distillers and blenders. The industry was further affected by World War I, Prohibition in the United States and later, by the Great Depression; many of the companies closed and never re-opened. Of the 159 distilleries operating in the boom years around 1900, only 15 survived to 1933.\nDuring the 1970s there was a new boom in Scotch whisky production that led to an overproduction in the early 1980s. Starting in 1981 whisky distilleries slashed production by a third and kept it low for a decade. During that time many distilleries closed. Banff, Brora, Coleburn, Convalmore, Dallas Dhu, Glen Albyn, Glenesk, Glen Flagler, Glenlochy, Glen Mhor, Glenugie, Glenury, Millburn, North Port, Port Ellen and St Magdalene were mothballed, shut down or demolished.\nSince the 2010s, Scotch whisky has entered a new phase of growth with new distilleries like Ardnahoe and Borders opening and older distilleries like Brora, Port Ellen and Rosebank reopening.\nRegulations and labelling.\nLegal definition.\nAs of 2009[ [update]], the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR) define and regulate the production, labelling, packaging as well as advertising of Scotch whisky in the United Kingdom. They replace previous regulations that focused solely on production, including the Scotch Whisky Act 1988.\nSince the previous act focused primarily on production standards, it was repealed and superseded by the 2009 Regulations. The SWR includes broader definitions and requirements for the crafting, bottling, labelling, branding, and selling of \"Scotch Whisky\". International trade agreements have the effect of making some provisions of the SWR apply in various other countries as well as in the UK. The SWR defines \"Scotch whisky\" as whisky that:\nThe Scotch Whisky Association acts as the regulatory body that ensures that Scotch Whisky is produced in accordance with traditional practices, as well as ensuring a sustainable future for the Scotch Whisky industry by promoting sustainable production, global trade, and responsible consumption.\nLabelling.\nA Scotch whisky label comprises several elements that indicate aspects of production, age, bottling, and ownership. Some of these elements are regulated by the SWR, and some reflect tradition and marketing. The spelling of the term \"whisky\" is often debated by journalists and consumers. Scottish, English, Welsh, Australian and Canadian whiskies use \"whisky\", Irish whiskies use \"whiskey\", while American and other styles vary in their spelling of the term.\nThe label always features a declaration of the malt or grain whiskies used. A \"single\" malt Scotch whisky is one that is entirely produced from malt in one distillery. One may also encounter the term \"single cask\", signifying the bottling comes entirely from one cask. The term \"blended malt\" signifies that single malt whisky from different distilleries is blended in the bottle. The Cardhu distillery also began using the term \"pure malt\" for the same purpose, causing a controversy in the process over clarity in labelling\u2014the Glenfiddich distillery was using the term to describe some single malt bottlings. As a result, the Scotch Whisky Association declared that a mixture of single malt whiskies must be labelled a \"blended malt\". The use of the former terms \"vatted malt\" and \"pure malt\" is prohibited. The term \"blended malt\" is still debated, as some bottlers maintain that consumers confuse the term with \"blended Scotch whisky\", which contains some proportion of grain whisky.\nThe brand name featured on the label is usually the same as the distillery name (for example, the Talisker distillery labels its whiskies with the Talisker name). Indeed, the SWR prohibits bottlers from using a distillery name when the whisky was not made there. A bottler's name may also be listed, sometimes independent of the distillery. In addition to requiring that Scotch whisky be distilled in Scotland, the SWR requires that it also be bottled and labelled in Scotland. Labels may also indicate the region of the distillery (for example, Islay or Speyside).\nAlcoholic strength is expressed on the label by Alcohol By Volume (ABV) or sometimes simply \"Vol\". Typically, bottled whisky is between 40% and 46% ABV. Whisky is considerably stronger when first emerging from the cask\u2014normally 60\u201363% ABV. Water is then added to create the desired bottling strength. If the whisky is not diluted before bottling, it can be labelled as cask strength.\nA whisky's age may be listed on the bottle providing a guarantee of the youngest whisky used. An age statement on the bottle, in the form of a number, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky. Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old. In the early 21st century, such \"No age statement\" whiskies have become more common, as distilleries respond to the depletion of aged stocks caused by improved sales. A label may carry a distillation date or a bottling date. Whisky does not mature once bottled, so if no age statement is provided, one may calculate the age of the whisky if both the distillation date and bottling date are given.\nLabels may also carry various declarations of filtration techniques or final maturation processes. A Scotch whisky labelled as \"natural\" or \"non-chill-filtered\" has not been through a filtration process during bottling that removes compounds that some consumers see as desirable. Whisky is aged in various types of casks\u2014and often in used port or sherry casks\u2014during distinct portions of the maturation process, and will take on characteristics, flavour, and aromas from such casks. Special casks are sometimes used at the end of the maturation process, and such whiskies may be labelled as \"wood finished\", \"sherry/port finished\", and so on.\nEconomic effects.\nScotland's identity and heritage are deeply intertwined with Scotch Whisky, a cornerstone of the country's economy exported to nearly 180 markets. The Scotch Whisky Association estimated that Scotland's whisky industry supported 40,000 jobs and accounted for \u00a34.37\u00a0billion in exports in 2017. Of that total, single malt Scotch accounted for \u00a31.17\u00a0billion in exports, a 14% increase over 2016. The drink is exported to nearly 180 markets and, in 2022, its exports were valued at over \u00a36 billion for the first time.\nThe industry's contribution to the economy of the UK was estimated as \u00a35.5\u00a0billion in 2018; the industry provided \u00a33.8\u00a0billion in direct GVA (gross value added) to Scotland. Whisky tourism has also become significant and accounts for \u00a368.3\u00a0million per year. One factor negatively affected sales, an extra 3.9% duty on spirits imposed by the UK in 2017. (The effect of the 25% increase in tariffs imposed by the U.S. in October 2019 would not be apparent until 2020.) Nonetheless, by year-end 2017, exports had reached a record-breaking amount.\nIn November 2019, the Association announced that the government of the UK had agreed to consider revising the alcohol taxation system, hopefully producing a new plan that was simplified and \"fairer\".\nExports in 2018 again increased 7.8% by value, and 3.6% in the number of bottles, in spite of the duty imposed in 2017; exports grew to a record level, \u00a34.7\u00a0billion. The US imported Scotch whisky with a value of just over \u00a31\u00a0billion while the European Union was the second-largest importer, taking 30% of global value. This was a boom year with a record high in exports, but the Scotch Whisky Association expressed concern for the future, particularly \"the challenges posed by Brexit and by tensions in the global trading system\".\nScotch whisky tourism has developed around the industry, with distilleries being the third most visited attraction in Scotland; roughly 2 million visits were recorded in 2018. Some 68 distilleries operate visitors' centres in Scotland and another eight accept visits by appointment. Hotels, restaurants, and other facilities are also impacted by the tourism phenomenon. Tourism has had an especially visible impact on the economy in some remote rural areas, according to Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs. \"The Scottish Government is committed to working with partners like the Scotch Whisky Association to increase our tourism offer and encourage more people to visit our distilleries,\" the Secretary said.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, exports of many food and drink products from the UK declined significantly, and that included Scotch whisky. Distillers were required to close for some time and the hospitality industry worldwide experienced a major slump. According to news reports in February 2021, the Scotch whisky sector had experienced \u00a31.1\u00a0billion in lost sales. Exports to the US were also affected by the 25% tariff that had been imposed. Scotch whisky exports to the US during 2020 \"fell by 32%\" from the previous year. Worldwide exports fell in 70% of Scotch whisky's global markets. A BBC News headline on 12 February 2021 summarized the situation: \"Scotch whisky exports slump to 'lowest in a decade'\".\nOwnership of distilleries.\nA 2016 report stated that only 20% of the whisky was made by companies owned in Scotland. Distilleries owned by Diageo, a London-based company, produce 40% of all Scotch whisky, with over 24 brands, such as Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Vat 69. Another 20% of the product is made by distillers owned by Pernod Ricard of France, including brands such as Ballantine's, Chivas Regal and Glenlivet . There are also 12% made by smaller distillers that are owned by foreign companies, such as Cutty Sark and Label 5 owned by La Martiniquaise of France, Dewar's and William Lawson's owned by Bacardi Limited of Bermuda and BenRiach whose parent is the Brown\u2013Forman Corporation based in Kentucky, United States. Nonetheless, Scotch whisky is produced according to the current regulations, as to ageing, production, and so on, ensuring that it remains Scottish.\nIndependents owned by Scots companies make a substantial amount of Scotch whisky, with the largest, William Grant &amp; Sons, producing 8%, or about 7.6\u00a0million cases per year. Its brands include Balvenie, Glenfiddich, and Grant's. Glenfiddich is the best-selling single malt Scotch in the world. Roughly 14 million bottles of Glenfiddich are sold annually.\nIndependent bottlers.\nMost malt distilleries sell a significant amount of whisky by the cask for blending, and sometimes to private buyers as well. Whisky from such casks is sometimes bottled as a single malt by \"independent bottling\" firms such as Duncan Taylor, Master of Malt, Gordon &amp; MacPhail, Cadenhead's, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society, Murray McDavid, Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd, Douglas Laing, Adelphi and others. These are usually labelled with the distillery's name, but not using the distillery's trademarked logos or typefaces. An \"official bottling\" (or \"proprietary bottling\"), by comparison, is from the distillery (or its owner). Many independent bottlings are from single casks, and they may sometimes be very different from an official bottling.\nFor a variety of reasons, some independent bottlers do not identify which distillery produced the whisky in the bottle. Mostly this will be at the request of the whisky distiller as they are unable to regulate the quality of the whisky sold. Some distilleries, to prevent third-party bottlers from naming them on the bottle, add a small amount of whisky from a different distillery, a technique called 'tea-spooning' which then precludes the sale of the whisky as from a specific distillery, or as a single malt; the addition of any whisky from a second distillery is by regulation a blended malt (which will also allow it to be exported in bulk form, unlike single malts which may only be exported bottled ready for sale). Instead the bottler may identify only the general geographical area of the source, or simply market the product using their own brand name without identifying their source. This may, in some cases, give the independent bottling company the flexibility to purchase from multiple distillers without changing their labels.\nTypes.\nThere are two basic types of Scotch whisky, from which all blends are made:\nExcluded from the definition of \"single malt Scotch whisky\" or \"single grain Scotch whisky\" is any spirit that qualifies as a blended Scotch whisky. This exclusion is to ensure that a blended Scotch whisky produced from single malt(s) and single grain(s) distilled at the same distillery does not also qualify as single malt Scotch whisky or single grain Scotch whisky. Nearly 90% of the bottles of Scotch sold per year are blended whiskies. \nThree types of blends are defined for Scotch whisky:\nThe five Scotch whisky definitions are structured in such a way that the categories are mutually exclusive. The 2009 regulations changed the formal definition of blended Scotch whisky to achieve this result, but in a way that reflected traditional and current practice: before the 2009 SWR, any combination of Scotch whiskies qualified as a blended Scotch whisky, including for example a blend of single malt Scotch whiskies.\nAs was the case under the Scotch Whisky Act 1988, regulation 5 of the SWR 2009 stipulates that the only whisky that may be manufactured in Scotland is Scotch whisky. The definition of \"manufacture\" is \"keeping for the purpose of maturation; and keeping, or using, for the purpose of blending, except for domestic blending for domestic consumption\". This provision prevents the existence of two \"grades\" of whisky originating from Scotland, one \"Scotch whisky\" and the other, a \"whisky product of Scotland\" that complies with the generic EU standard for whisky. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, allowing non-Scotch whisky production in Scotland would make it difficult to protect Scotch whisky as a distinctive product. The SWR regulation also states that no additives may be used except for plain (E150A) caramel colouring.\nSingle malt.\nTo qualify for this category the Scotch whisky must be made in one distillery, in a pot still by batch distillation, using only water and malted barley. As with any other Scotch whisky, the Scotch Whisky Regulations of 2009 also require single malt Scotch to be made completely and bottled in Scotland and aged for at least three years. Most are aged longer.\nAnother term is sometimes seen, called \"double wood\" or \"triple wood\", sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"double malt\" or \"triple malt\". These indicate that the whisky was aged in two or three types of casks. Hence, if the whisky otherwise meets the criteria of single malt, it still falls into the single malt category even if more than one type of cask was used for ageing. Examples include The Balvenie 12 Year DoubleWood and Laphroaig Triple Wood.\nAnother nuance is that Lowland Scotch malts use a triple distillation just like Irish whiskey, breaking away from the general rule that all Scotch is double distilled.\nSingle grain.\nSingle grain whisky is made with water and malted barley but the distillery then adds other grains or cereals, wheat, corn, or rye, for example. From that moment on, it can no longer be called single malt. This type of product must be from a single distillery and is often used in making blended Scotch. Single grain whiskies are usually not distilled in pot stills but with column stills.\nBlended malt.\nBlended malt whisky, formerly called \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\" (terms that are now prohibited in the SWR 2009), is one of the least common types of Scotch: a blend of single malts from more than one distillery (possibly with differing ages).\nBlended malts contain only single malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. This type must contain no grain whiskies and is distinguished by the absence of the word \"single\" on the bottle. The age of the vat is that of the youngest of the original ingredients. For example, a blended malt marked \"8 years old\" may include older whiskies, with the youngest constituent being eight years old. Johnnie Walker Green Label and Monkey Shoulder are examples of blended malt whisky. Starting from November 2011, no Scotch whisky could be labelled as a vatted malt or pure malt, the SWR requiring them to be labelled blended malt instead.\nBlended grain.\nThe term blended grain Scotch refers to whisky that contains at least two single grain Scotch whiskies from at least two distilleries, combined to create one batch of the product.\nBlended.\nBlended Scotch whisky constitutes about 90% of the whisky produced in Scotland. Blended Scotch whiskies contain both malt whisky and grain whisky. Producers combine the various malts and grain whiskies to produce a consistent brand style. Notable blended Scotch whisky brands include Ballantine's, Bell's, Chivas Regal, Cutty Sark, Dewar's, Grant's, J&amp;B, Johnnie Walker, Teacher's Highland Cream, The Famous Grouse, Vat 69, Whyte and Mackay and William Lawson's. Most Blended Scotch Whiskies are made from the produce of at least two distilleries as the majority of distilleries produce only malt \"or\" grain whiskies; however a few distilleries such as Loch Lomond produce both malt and grain whisky at the same site.\nRegion.\nScotland was traditionally divided into four whisky regions: Campbeltown, The Highlands, The Isle of Islay and The Lowlands. Due to the large number of distilleries found there, the Speyside area became the fifth, recognised by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) as a distinct region in 2014. The whisky-producing islands other than Islay are not recognised as a distinct region by the SWA, which groups them into the Highlands region.\nAlthough only five regions are specified, any Scottish locale may be used to describe a whisky if it is distilled entirely within that place; for example, a single malt whisky distilled on Orkney could be described as \"Orkney Single Malt Scotch Whisky\" instead of as an Island whisky.\nSensory characteristics.\nFlavour and aroma.\nDozens of compounds contribute to Scotch whisky flavour and aroma characteristics, including volatile alcohol congeners (also called \"higher oils\") formed during fermentation, such as acetaldehyde, methanol, ethyl acetate, n-propanol and isobutanol. Other flavour and aroma compounds include vanillic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, syringaldehyde, furfural, phenyl ethanol and acetic acid. One analysis established 13 distinct flavour characteristics dependent on individual compounds, including sour, sweet, grainy and floral as major flavour perceptions.\nSome distilleries use a peat fire to dry the barley for some of their products before grinding it and making the mash. Peat smoke contributes phenolic compounds, such as guaiacol, that give aromas similar to smoke. The Maillard browning process of the residual sugars in the mashing process, particularly through formation of 2-furanmethanol and pyrazines imparting nutty or cereal characteristics contributes to the baked bread notes in the flavour and aroma profile. Maturation during multi-year casking in oak barrels mostly previously used for bourbon whiskey, Sherry, Wines, Fortified Wine, (including Port and Madeira) Rum and other spirit production, has the largest impact on the flavour of the whisky. Some distilleries use Virgin Oak casks as used casks are becoming increasingly harder to source (particularly authentic sherry casks due to the downturn in sherry consumption plus the laws introduced in 1986 regarding bottling Spanish wines exclusively in Spain)\nScreening for potential adulteration.\nRefilling and fabrication or tampering of branded Scotch whiskies are types of Scotch whisky adulteration that diminishes brand integrity, consumer confidence, and profitability in the Scotch industry. Deviation from normal concentrations of major constituents, such as alcohol congeners, provides a precise, quantitative method for determining authenticity of Scotch whiskies. Over 100 compounds can be detected during counterfeit analysis, including phenolics and terpenes which may vary in concentration by different geographic origins, the barley used in the fermentation mash, or the oak cask used during ageing. Typical high-throughput instruments used in counterfeit detection are liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SDRs are units of account for the IMF, and not a currency \"per se\". SDRs represent a claim to currency held by IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged. When SDRs were created in 1969, they were each worth 0.888671 grams of gold, roughly the equivalent of one US dollar at the time. In 1973, following the termination of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971, the IMF redefined the SDR as equivalent to the value of a specific selection of world currencies. \nSDRs are allocated by the IMF to countries and central banks, and cannot be held or used by private parties. The number of SDRs in existence was around XDR\u00a021.4\u00a0billion in August 2009. During the 2008 financial crisis, an additional XDR\u00a0182.6\u00a0billion was allocated to \"provide liquidity to the global economic system and supplement member countries' official reserves\". By October 2014, the number of SDRs in existence was XDR\u00a0204\u00a0billion. Due to economic stress caused by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several finance ministers of poorer countries called for a new allocation to support member economies as they seek ways to recover, and some economists called for the allocation to be as high as $4T. In March 2021 the G24 and others proposed an allocation of $500B for this purpose. In response, XDR 456.5 billion (about US$650B) was allocated on 23 August 2021.\nThe value of a SDR is based on a basket of key international currencies reviewed by IMF every five years. The weights assigned to the currencies in the XDR basket are adjusted to take into account their current prominence in terms of international trade and national foreign exchange reserves. As of \u00a02023[ [update]], the XDR basket consists of the following five currencies: U.S. dollar\u00a043.38%, euro\u00a029.31%, Chinese yuan\u00a012.28%, Japanese yen\u00a07.59%, British pound sterling\u00a07.44%.\nName.\nWhile the ISO 4217 currency code for special drawing rights is XDR (and the numeric code is \"960\"), they are often referred to by their acronym SDR. The name was chosen as a compromise between parties who wanted an international currency and those who wanted a credit facility. Member countries receiving XDR allocations were required by the reconstitution provision of the XDR articles to hold a prescribed number of XDRs. If a state used any of its allotment, it was expected to rebuild its XDR holdings. As the reconstitution provisions were abrogated in 1981, the XDR now functions less like credit than previously. Countries are still expected to maintain their XDR holdings at a certain level, but penalties for holding fewer than the allocated amount are now less onerous.\nThe name may actually derive from an early proposal for IMF \"reserve drawing rights\". The word \"reserve\" was later replaced with \"special\" because the idea that the IMF was creating a foreign exchange reserve asset was contentious.\nHistory.\nSpecial drawing rights were created by the IMF in 1969 and were intended to be an asset held in foreign exchange reserves under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. After the collapse of that system in the early 1970s, the XDR has taken on a less important role. Acting as the unit of account for the IMF has been its primary purpose since 1972.\nThe IMF itself calls the current role of the XDR \"insignificant\". Developed countries, who hold the greatest number of XDRs, are unlikely to use them for any purpose. The only actual users of XDRs may be those developing countries that see them as \"a rather cheap line of credit\".\nOne reason XDRs may not see much use as foreign exchange reserve assets is that they must be exchanged into a currency before use. This is due in part to the fact private parties do not hold XDRs: they are only used and held by IMF member countries, the IMF itself, and a select few organizations licensed to do so by the IMF. Basic functions of foreign exchange reserves, such as market intervention and liquidity provision, as well as some less prosaic ones, such as maintaining export competitiveness via favorable exchange rates, cannot be accomplished directly using XDRs. This fact has led the IMF to label the XDR as an \"imperfect reserve asset\".\nAnother reason they may see little use is that the number of XDRs in existence is relatively few compared to the total amount of foreign exchange reserves. To function well a foreign exchange reserve asset must have sufficient liquidity, but XDRs, because of their small number, may be perceived to be an illiquid asset. The IMF says, \"expanding the volume of official XDRs is a prerequisite for them to play a more meaningful role as a substitute reserve asset.\"\nAlternative to U.S. dollar.\nThe XDR comes to prominence when the U.S. dollar is weak or otherwise unsuitable to be a foreign exchange reserve asset. This usually manifests itself as an allocation of XDRs to IMF member countries. Distrust of the U.S. dollar is not the only stated reason allocations have been made, however. One of its first roles was to alleviate an expected shortfall of U.S. dollars c.\u20091970. At this time, the United States had a conservative monetary policy and did not want to increase the total amount of U.S. dollars in existence. If the United States had continued down this path, the dollar would have become a less attractive foreign exchange reserve asset: it would not have had the necessary liquidity to serve this function. Soon after XDR allocations began, the United States reversed its former policy and provided sufficient liquidity. In the process a potential role for the XDR was removed. During this first round of allocations, 9.3 billion XDRs were distributed to IMF member countries.\nThe XDR resurfaced in 1978 when many countries were wary of taking on more foreign exchange reserve assets denominated in U.S. dollars. This suspicion of the dollar precipitated an allocation of 12 billion XDRs over a period of four years.\nConcomitant with the 2008 financial crisis, the third round of XDR allocations occurred in the years 2009 and 2011. The IMF recognized the financial crisis as the cause for distributing the large majority of these third-round allotments, but some allocations were couched as distributing XDRs to countries that had never received any and others as a re-balancing of IMF quotas, which determine how many XDRs a country is allotted, to better represent the economic strength of emerging markets.\nDuring this time China, a country with large holdings of U.S. dollar foreign exchange reserves, voiced its displeasure at the current international monetary system, and promoted measures that would allow the XDR to \"fully satisfy the member countries' demand for a reserve currency.\" These comments, made by a chairman of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, drew media attention, and the IMF showed some support for China's stance. It produced a paper exploring ways the substance and function of the XDR could be increased. China has also suggested the creation of a substitution account to allow exchange of U.S. dollars into XDRs. When substitution was proposed before, in 1978, the United States appeared reluctant to allow such a mechanism to become operational.\nUse by developing countries.\nIn 2001, the UN suggested allocating XDRs to developing countries for use by them as cost-free alternatives to building foreign exchange reserves through borrowing or running current account surpluses. In 2009, an XDR allocation was made to countries that had joined the IMF after the 1979\u20131981 round of allocations was complete (and so had never been allocated any). First proposed in 1997, many of the beneficiaries of this 2009 allocation were developing countries.\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 23 August 2021, the IMF allocated $650 billion worth of XDRs to all 190 members of the IMF in proportion to member quotas in response to COVID-19 related balance of payments concerns. This allocation of XDRs represents roughly two-thirds of all XDRs currently in circulation, and was by far the largest ever single allocation of XDRs.\nValue definition.\nCurrency basket.\nTo determine the composition of the XDR, the IMF takes into account several currencies important to the world's trading and financial systems. A currency's importance is currently measured by two factors: the amount of exports sold in that currency, and whether that currency is considered \"freely usable\" (determined by its use as a foreign exchange reserve asset and how widely it is used in international transactions).\nAn XDR basket definition remains valid for five years. Approximately one to two months before the end of this time period, the IMF Executive Board will re-evaluate the XDR basket; the currencies included as well as their weights can then change. Changing the XDR's value definition requires at least 70% of the votes among the IMF members. The changes take effect at the end of the five-year period (one to two months after the board review). One business day before taking effect, the newly defined weights are converted to currency amounts based on an average of the exchange rate over the past three months, such that the value of the XDR in U.S. dollars remains the same before and after the change. The currency amounts then remain fixed throughout the five-year period.\nThe IMF reserves the right to perform a re-evaluation after less than five years if it decides that the current basket no longer reflects \"the relative importance of currencies in the world\u2019s trading and financial systems\"; it also reserves the right to postpone re-evaluations. If either occurs (causing the old definition to be valid for less or more than five years), the new definition will still be valid for a full five years.\nHistorical valuation.\nAt the time of the XDR's creation in 1969, the United States dollar was backed by the gold standard and the XDR was fixed at of gold or exactly 1 US dollar. After the Nixon Shock of 1971 and during the collapse of the Bretton Woods system between 1971 and 1973, the XDR initially remained fixed relative to the nominal international price of gold, even after the value of the United States dollar dropped to $38 per troy ounce in 1972 and to $&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;42+2\u20449 per troy ounce in 1973. On 1 July 1974, the XDR instead became defined by a currency basket of 16 currencies.\nOn 1 January 1981, the five-year schedule was introduced and the XDR basket was reduced to five currencies: the United States dollar, the Deutsche mark, the French franc, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. When the euro was introduced in January 1999, it replaced the German mark and French franc and the basket consisted of four currencies.\nIn November 2010, the IMF determined that China's renminbi met the export requirement but failed to meet the \"freely usable\" requirement and thus was not included in the XDR basket taking effect on 1 January 2011. In November 2015, the IMF announced that the renminbi now met the \"freely usable\" requirement and would be included in the next basket definition, changing its size back to five currencies. The effective date of the re-evaluation was postponed to 1 October 2016, in order to \"allow users sufficient lead time to adjust\". In 2016, the renminbi was added to the basket with a 10.9% weighting.259\nIn March 2021, the IMF announced that the next re-evaluation, normally scheduled for 1 October 2021, would be postponed to 1 August 2022, in order to prevent the basket's definition from changing during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDaily valuation.\nBecause of fluctuating exchange rates, the relative value of each currency varies continuously, as does the value of the XDR. The IMF sets the value of the XDR in terms of United States dollars every day. The latest United States dollar valuation of the XDR is published on the IMF website. For example, on 31 January 2021, the value was USD$1.44080, and on 22 June 2021, the value was USD$1.426480.\nAllocations.\nXDRs are allocated to member countries by the IMF. A country's IMF quota, the maximum amount of financial resources that it is obligated to contribute to the fund, determines its allotment of XDRs. Creating a new allocation requires 85% of the votes in the SDR Department of the IMF. All IMF member countries are represented in the SDR Department, but this is not a one country, one vote system; voting power is determined by a member country's IMF quota. For example, the United States has 16.7% of the vote as of 2 March 2011. This means the United States has a de facto veto on all new XDR allocations, it is currently the only country that does. \nAllocations are not made on a regular basis and have only occurred on rare occasions. The first round took place because of a situation that was soon reversed, the possibility of an insufficient amount of U.S. dollars because of U.S. reluctance to run the deficit necessary to supply future demand. Extraordinary circumstances have, likewise, led to the other XDR allocation events. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, XDR\u00a0182.6\u00a0billion was allocated to \"provide liquidity to the global economic system and supplement member countries\u2019 official reserves\". The 2011 allocations were to low-income member countries.\nAfter being split among the IMF member countries, the 2021 allocation gave Liberia and South Sudan each an amount equal to 9-10% of their GDP.\nExchange.\nAn IMF member country that requires actual foreign currency may sell its XDRs to another member country in exchange for the currency. To sell a part or all its XDRs, the country must find a willing party to buy them. The IMF acts as an intermediary in this voluntary exchange.\nThe IMF also has the authority under the designation mechanism to ask member countries with strong foreign exchange reserves to purchase XDRs from those with weak reserves. The maximum obligation any country has under this mechanism is currently equal to twice the amount of its XDR allocation. As of 2023, XDRs may only be exchanged for euros, Japanese yen, UK pounds, US dollars or Chinese yuan. The IMF says exchanging XDRs can take \"several days\".\nIt is not, however, the IMF that pays out foreign currency in exchange for XDRs: the claim to currency that XDRs represent is not a claim on the IMF.\nThe percentage of foreign exchange reserves in XDRs increases sharply after a new allocation, then declines until the next allocation. In the early 1970s, the percentage of non-gold reserves in XDRs reached a peak of 8.4%. In January 2011, this amount was less than 4%. In April 2020 prior to the large allocation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, this amount was under 3%; by comparison, over half (of non-gold reserves) were in the United States dollar.\nInterest rate.\nThe IMF calculates a weekly interest rate, which is based on \"a weighted average of representative interest rates on short-term debt in the money markets of the XDR basket currencies\". No interest is payable on the XDRs allocated to a country by the IMF. However, interest is payable by an IMF member country that has exchanged (sold) some or all of the XDRs it was allocated, and interest is paid to a member country that holds more XDRs than it was allocated (i.e., the country that bought XDRs from another member). In April 2020, the interest rate was 0.05%.\nOther uses.\nThe XDR is used in international transactions, including export quotas in the IMF members and the number of official reserve assets which were in their own currencies. It is traded on the main foreign exchange market, including foreign exchange trading volume, whether there are forward exchange markets.\nUnit of account.\nSome international organizations use the XDR as a unit of account. The IMF says using the XDR in this way \"help[s] cope with exchange rate volatility.\" As of 2001, organizations that use the XDR as a unit of account, besides the IMF itself, include: Universal Postal Union, African Development Bank, Arab Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank, Bank for International Settlements, Common Fund for Commodities, East African Development Bank, Economic Community of West African States, International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, International Fund for Agricultural Development, and Islamic Development Bank. It is not only international organizations that use the XDR in this way. JETRO uses XDRs to price foreign aid. In addition, charges, liabilities, and fees prescribed by some international treaties are denominated in XDRs. In 2003, the Bank for International Settlements ceased to use the gold franc as their currency, in favour of XDR.\nSome bonds are also denominated in XDR, like the IBRD 2016 XDR denominated bonds.\nUse in international law.\nIn some international treaties and agreements, XDRs are used to value penalties, charges or prices. For example, the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims caps personal liability for damages to ships at XDR 330,000. The Montreal Convention and other treaties also use XDRs in this way, capping damages at XDR 128,821.\nUse as currency.\nAccording to the IMF, \"the SDR may not be any country\u2019s optimal basket\", but a few countries do peg their currencies to the XDR. One possible benefit to nations with XDR pegs is that they may be perceived to be more transparent. As of 2000, the number of countries that did so was four. This is a substantial decrease from 1983, when 14 countries had XDR pegs. Between 1981 and 2002, the Iranian rial was pegged to the XDR. As of 2010, Syria pegs its pound to the XDR.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SOE personnel operated in all territories occupied or attacked by the Axis powers, except where demarcation lines were agreed upon with Britain's principal allies, the United States, and the Soviet Union. SOE made use of neutral territory on occasion or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis. The organisation directly employed or controlled more than 13,000 people, of whom 3,200 were women. Both men and women served as agents in Axis-occupied countries.\nThe organisation was dissolved in 1946. A memorial to those who served in SOE was unveiled in 1996 on the wall of the west cloister of Westminster Abbey by the Queen Mother, and in 2009 on the Albert Embankment in London, depicting Violette Szabo. The Valen\u00e7ay SOE Memorial honours 91 male and 13 female SOE agents who lost their lives while working in France. The Tempsford Memorial was unveiled in 2013 by the then-Prince of Wales in Church End, Tempsford, Bedfordshire, close to the site of the former RAF Tempsford.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nSOE was formed from the amalgamation of three existing secret departments, which had been formed shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. Immediately after Germany annexed Austria (the \"Anschluss\") in March 1938, the Foreign Office reestablished a propaganda organisation from the First World War known as the Department of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. In that earlier war, it had been known more commonly as \"Crewe House,\" eponymously named after the building in which it operated (the present day location of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in London), and was directed by the Viscount Northcliffe, directing as section leaders such figures as H. G. Wells and Hamilton Fyfe.\nThe man that Neville Chamberlain had approached to reestablish the department was the Canadian newspaper magnate Sir Campbell Stuart, formerly a member of Crewe House. However, because Stuart was the chairman of the Eastern Telegraph Company (today known as Cable &amp; Wireless), he operated the department's headquarters out of his company's buildings at the Electra House (two buildings in London connected by underground telegraphy cables). Therefore, the new propaganda unit was known as Electra House. While they were primarily focused on the production of white propaganda, Stuart also employed the staff of both Electra House buildings to monitor the telegraphy cables belonging to all foreign embassy missions in London, because the house on the Victoria Embankment sat directly on top of their cables. Where the earlier Crewe House had been primarily focused on leaflet campaigns and the production of printed materials, Electra House was involved in the full spectrum of media production: film, radio, newspapers, and gossip. However, because Stuart firmly refused to have his department engaged in the production of black propaganda, other departments of the War Office, the Ministry of Information, and the Foreign Office were created to undertake these productions.\nLater that month, the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, also known as MI6) formed a section known as Section D (the \"D\" apparently standing for \"Destruction\") under Major Laurence Grand, to investigate the use of sabotage, propaganda, and other irregular means to weaken an enemy. In the autumn of the same year, the War Office expanded an existing research department known as General Staff (Research) [GS (R)], and appointed Major J.C.F. Holland as its head to conduct research into guerrilla warfare. GS (R) was renamed Military Intelligence (Research) [MI(R)], in early 1939. Contrary to popular misconception, GS(R) had been created in 1936, not 1938.\nThese three departments worked with few resources until the outbreak of war. There was much overlap between their activities. Sections D and EH duplicated much of each other's work. On the other hand, the heads of Section D and MI(R) knew each other and shared information. They agreed to a rough division of their activities; MI(R) researched irregular operations that could be undertaken by regular uniformed troops, while Section D dealt with truly undercover work.\nSeparated by only nine months in age, Majors Jo Holland and Laurance Grand had been childhood friends at Rugby School, and later attended classes together at Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Holland's secretary at the time, Joan Bright Astley, remarked later in her memoirs that the two worked together exceptionally well while developing the foundations of irregular warfare that would become SOE. Astley, herself a co-founder of SOE, would later be revealed to be one of the primary inspirations for the fictional character Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. Holland's interests in guerrilla warfare began after working on an operation with T.E. Lawrence during World War I, roughly a year and a half before being shot in the chest in a pub by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence. It was the IRA in which Holland revered technically, going so far as to state that they had made guerrilla warfare a science in the modern age. He wrote much about the IRA at this time, and encouraged British Military Intelligence leadership to create an organization that had the effectiveness of this group. As a side project, he also created the British Commandos.\nGrand, meanwhile, had been involved in similar guerrilla operations serving in the Far East and India. During an operation on the Indian Frontier, Grand had devised an unorthodox tactic after discovering that Pathan tribesmen were stealing British ammunition: he ordered every tenth round to be filled with high explosive instead of cordite. Though some officers regarded the idea of this as \"ungentlemanly,\" Admiral Hugh Sinclair had considered it precisely the kind of ingenuity and ruthlessness Britain required against future enemies. It is only in Colin Gubbins' official accounting of the story (he wrote the first official history of the SOE) that any animosity existed between the two men, which modern historians have noted to be a revisionist retelling, motivated by Gubbins' dislike of Laurance Grand. Gubbins did not share the same dislike of Holland and thought of him more as a father-figure, having been recruited and placed into command by Holland himself. Gubbins' dislike of Grand began while working at MI(R) around this time, because he did not appreciate that MI(R) was limited specifically to the domain of guerrilla warfare, while Section D was authorized to conduct guerrilla activities outside of a strictly defined warfighting capacity.\nAfter the war, Gubbins was friends with the historians M. R. D. Foot and Nigel West, and used his influence over them to sabotage the legacy of Grand's primary contributions to the war effort, downplaying Section D as merely a \"think tank,\" where in reality, Section D had operatives stationed all over Europe, and had formed relationships with many underground resistance movements. Those operatives were then absorbed into SOE.\nDuring the early months of the war, Section D was based first at St Ermin's Hotel in Westminster and then the Metropole Hotel near Trafalgar Square. The Section attempted unsuccessfully to sabotage deliveries of vital strategic materials to Germany from neutral countries by mining the Iron Gate on the River Danube. By the time Section D was absorbed into the newly created SOE, it employed around 300 paid officers, though its real reach was far greater, in the contract agents that it had developed throughout Europe. Section D was more successful at establishing smuggling routes from Shetland through Norway that were the foundations of what would become the Shetland bus. It also established bureaus in Yugoslavia, Scandinavia, Romania, Greece, and several other locations. Laurence Grand and Section D were also responsible for establishing the D School training house at Brickendonbury, where the first batch of newly trained SOE officers were produced by Kim Philby and Guy Burgess.\nHowever, despite all of Section D's work on the continent, the Germans kept advancing. Some contemporaries laid this failure of the British war machine squarely at the feet of British intelligence, and especially \"C\", however, historians after the war such as Karl-Heinz Frieser and John Keegan note that the German advance might have been impossible to halt, no matter how many intelligence operatives and paramilitary operators were deployed. As a result of the advance, and his operators and foreign contacts being increasingly cut-off from allied supply lines \u2013 Laurence Grand established supply dumps set up by Section D, arranged in regular intervals between Paris and the German border. He also organized what was called the Home Defence Scheme, a form of Stay-behind network within the UK itself in the event the country was overrun and invaded.\nThe label of \"think tank,\" would be much more appropriately designated to MI(R), where Holland desired his department to produce research documents and also invent devices and explosives that would be of great use to warfighters and operators on the ground. MI(R) produced, for example, pamphlets and technical handbooks for guerrilla leaders. Holland was also largely the progenitor of MI9, and the singular mind behind MIR(C), both of which produced major inventions during the war. Despite Holland's desire to remain functionally a research unit, one which Lord Hailsham described as \"a clearing house for bright ideas,\" Colin Gubbins desired a much more active and kinetic function for the small subsection to which he commanded, the Guerrilla Field Services. Even though Gubbins appreciated Holland, at the time they disagreed about MI(R)'s role within the war effort. MI(R), therefore, was more frequently involved in kinetic activities, including the formation of the Independent Companies, autonomous units intended to carry out sabotage and guerrilla operations behind enemy lines in the Norwegian campaign. MI(R) also established the Auxiliary Units, stay-behind commando units based on the Home Guard, which would act in the event of an Axis invasion of Britain, as seemed possible in the early years of the war. (The Auxiliary Units themselves were based on the Home Defence Scheme, which was the creation of Section D).\nSection D and MI(R) were very different units. MI(R) was staffed by uniformed officers who remained in uniform while on operation. Section D was staffed by undercover operatives who were not allowed to acknowledge each other in the street. Because he found the personnel to be overly paranoid, which he considered entertaining and funny, Holland often would walk up behind these Section D officers and shout \"boo.\" However, despite their differences, an original plan in 1939 to merge the two units called \"Scheme D\" arose, and the two offices shared staff, offices, headquarters, and missions for some time. It was the idea of Scheme D that eventually transformed into the SOE.\nFormation.\nOn 13 June 1940, at the instigation of newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Lord Hankey (who held the Cabinet post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster) persuaded Section D and MI(R) that their operations should be coordinated. On 1 July, a Cabinet-level meeting arranged the formation of a single sabotage organisation. On 16 July, Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, was appointed to take political responsibility for the new organisation, which was formally created on 22 July 1940. Dalton recorded in his diary that on that day, the War Cabinet agreed to his new duties and that Churchill had told him, \"And now go and set Europe ablaze.\" Dalton used the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence as a model for the organisation.\nSir Frank Nelson was nominated by SIS to be director of the new organisation, and a senior civil servant, Gladwyn Jebb, transferred from the Foreign Office to it, with the title of Chief Executive Officer. Campbell Stuart left the organisation, and Major Grand was returned to the regular army. At his own request, Major Holland also left to take up a regular appointment in the Royal Engineers. (Both Grand and Holland eventually attained the rank of major-general.) However, Holland's former deputy at MI(R), Brigadier Colin Gubbins, returned from command of the Auxiliary Units to be Director of Operations of SOE.\nOne department of MI(R), MI R(C), which was involved in the development of weapons for irregular warfare, was not formally integrated into SOE but became an independent body codenamed MD1. Directed by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Millis Jefferis, it was located at The Firs in Whitchurch, Buckinghamshire and nicknamed \"Churchill's Toyshop\" from the Prime Minister's close interest in it and his enthusiastic support.\nLeadership.\nThe director of SOE was usually referred to by the initials \"CD\". Nelson, the first director to be appointed, was a former head of a trading firm in India, a back bench Conservative Member of Parliament and Consul in Basel, Switzerland, where he had also been engaged in undercover intelligence work.\nIn February 1942 Dalton was removed as the political head of SOE (possibly because he was using SOE's phone tapping facility to listen to conversations of fellow Labour ministers, or possibly because he was viewed as too \"communistically inclined\" and a threat to SIS). He became President of the Board of Trade and was replaced as Minister of Economic Warfare by Lord Selborne. Selborne, in turn, retired Nelson, who had suffered ill health as a result of his hard work, and appointed Sir Charles Hambro, head of Hambros Bank, to replace him. He also transferred Jebb back to the Foreign Office.\nHambro had been a close friend of Churchill before the war and had won the Military Cross in the First World War. He retained several other interests, for example, remaining chairman of Hambros and a director of the Great Western Railway. Some of his subordinates and associates expressed reservations that these interests distracted him from his duties as director. Selborne and Hambro nevertheless cooperated closely until August 1943, when they fell out over the question of whether SOE should remain a separate body or coordinate its operations with those of the British Army in several theatres of war. Hambro felt that any loss of autonomy would cause a number of problems for SOE in the future. At the same time, Hambro was found to have failed to pass on vital information to Selborne. He was dismissed as director and became head of a raw materials purchasing commission in Washington, D.C., which was involved in the exchange of nuclear information.\nAs part of the subsequent closer ties between the Imperial General Staff and SOE (although SOE had no representation on the Chiefs of Staff Committee), Hambro's replacement as director from September 1943 was Gubbins, who had been promoted to Major-general. Gubbins had wide experience of commando and clandestine operations and had played a major part in MI(R)'s and SOE's early operations. He also put into practice many of the lessons he learned from the IRA during the Irish War of Independence.\nOrganisation.\nHeadquarters.\nThe organisation of SOE continually evolved and changed during the war. Initially, it consisted of three broad departments:\nSO3 was quickly overloaded with paperwork and was merged into SO2. In August 1941, following quarrels between the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Ministry of Information over their relative responsibilities, SO1 was removed from SOE and became an independent organisation, the Political Warfare Executive.\nThereafter, a single, broad \"Operations\" department controlled the Sections operating into enemy and sometimes neutral territory, and the selection and training of agents. Sections, usually referred to by code letters or groups of letters, were assigned to a single country. Some enemy-occupied countries had two or more sections assigned to deal with politically disparate resistance movements. (France had no less than six). For security purposes, each section had its own headquarters and training establishments. This strict compartmentalisation was so effective that in mid-1942, five governments in exile jointly suggested that a single sabotage organisation be created, and were startled to learn that SOE had been in existence for two years.\nFour departments and some smaller groups were controlled by the director of scientific research, Professor Dudley Maurice Newitt, and were concerned with the development or acquisition, and production of special equipment. A few other sections were involved with finance, security, economic research, and administration, although SOE had no central registry or filing system. When Gubbins was appointed director, he formalised some of the administrative practices which had grown in an \"ad hoc\" fashion and appointed an establishment officer to oversee the manpower and other requirements of the various departments.\nThe main controlling body of SOE was its council, consisting of around fifteen heads of departments or sections. About half of the council were from the armed forces (although some were specialists who were only commissioned after the outbreak of war), the rest were various civil servants, lawyers, or business or industrial experts. Most of the members of the council, and the senior officers and functionaries of SOE generally, were recruited by word of mouth among public school alumni and Oxbridge graduates, although this did not notably affect SOE's political complexion.\nSubsidiary branches.\nSeveral subsidiary SOE stations were set up to manage operations that were too distant for London to control directly. SOE's operations in the Middle East and Balkans were controlled from a headquarters in Cairo, which became notorious for poor security, infighting and conflicts with other agencies. It was eventually named, in April 1944, \"Special Operations (Mediterranean),\" or SO(M). Shortly after the Allied landings in North Africa, a station code named \"Massingham\" was established near Algiers in late 1942, which operated into Southern France. Following the Allied invasion of Italy, personnel from Massingham established forward stations in Brindisi and near Naples. A subsidiary headquarters, initially known as \"Force 133,\" was later set up in Bari in Southern Italy, under the Cairo headquarters, to control operations in the Balkans, including Greece, and Northern Italy.\nAn SOE station, first called the \"India Mission,\" and subsequently known as \"GS I(k),\" was set up in India late in 1940. It subsequently moved to Ceylon so as to be closer to the headquarters of the Allied South East Asia Command and became known as \"Force 136.\" A \"Singapore Mission\" was set up at the same time as the India Mission, but was unable to overcome official opposition to its attempts to form resistance movements in Malaya before the Japanese overran Singapore. Force 136 took over its surviving staff and operations. New York City also had a branch office, formally titled \"British Security Coordination,\" and headed by Canadian businessman Sir William Stephenson. Their office, located at Room 3603, 630 Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, coordinated the work of SOE, SIS, and MI5 with the American FBI and the Office of Strategic Services.\nAims.\nAs with its leadership and organisation, the aims and objectives of SOE changed throughout the war, although they revolved around sabotaging and subverting the Axis war machines through indirect methods. SOE occasionally carried out operations with direct military objectives, such as Operation Harling, originally designed to cut one of the Axis supply lines to their troops fighting in North Africa. They also carried out some high-profile operations aimed mainly at the morale both of the Axis and occupied nations, such as Operation Anthropoid, the assassination in Prague of Reinhard Heydrich. In general, SOEs' objectives were to foment mutual hatred between the population of Axis-occupied countries and the occupiers, and to force the Axis to expend manpower and resources on maintaining their control of subjugated populations.\nDalton's initial statement about the outline of methods to be used by SOEs was \"industrial and military sabotage, labor agitation and strikes, continuous propaganda, terrorist attacks against traitors and German leaders, boycotts and riots.\" Dalton's early enthusiasm for fomenting widespread strikes, civil disobedience, and sabotage in Axis-occupied areas had to be curbed. Thereafter, there were two main aims, often mutually incompatible: sabotage of the Axis war effort, and the creation of secret armies which would rise to assist the liberation of their countries when Allied troops arrived or were about to do so. It was recognised that acts of sabotage would bring about reprisals and increased Axis security measures, which would hamper the creation of underground armies. As the tide of war turned in the Allies' favour, these underground armies became more important.\nRelationships.\nAt the government level, SOEs' relationships with the Foreign Office were often difficult. On several occasions, various governments in exile protested at operations taking place without their knowledge or approval, provoking Axis reprisals against civilian populations, or complained about SOE's support for movements opposed to the exiled governments. SOE's activities also threatened relationships with neutral countries. SOE nevertheless generally adhered to the rule, \"No bangs without Foreign Office approval.\"\nEarly attempts at bureaucratic control of Jefferis's MIR(c) by the Ministry of Supply were eventually foiled by Churchill's intervention. Thereafter, the Ministry co-operated, though at arm's length, with Dudley Newitt's various supply and development departments. The Treasury were accommodating from the start and were often prepared to turn a blind eye to some of SOE's questionable activities.\nWith other military headquarters and commands, SOE cooperated fairly well with Combined Operations Headquarters during the middle years of the war, usually on technical matters as SOE's equipment was readily adopted by commandos and other raiders. This support was lost when Vice Admiral Louis Mountbatten left Combined Operations, though by this time SOE had its own transport and did not need to rely on Combined Operations for resources. On the other hand, the Admiralty objected to SOE developing its own underwater vessels and the duplication of effort this involved. The Royal Air Force, and in particular RAF Bomber Command under \"Bomber\" Harris, were usually reluctant to allocate aircraft to SOE.\nTowards the end of the war, as Allied forces began to liberate territories occupied by the Axis and in which SOE had established resistance forces, SOE also liaised with and to some extent came under the control of the Allied theatre commands. Relationships with Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in north-west Europe (whose commander was General Dwight D. Eisenhower) and South East Asia Command (whose commander was Admiral Louis Mountbatten, already well known to SOE) were generally excellent. However, there were difficulties with the Commanders in Chief in the Mediterranean, partly because of the complaints over impropriety at SOE's Cairo headquarters during 1941 and partly because both the supreme command in the Mediterranean and SOE's establishments were split in 1942 and 1943, leading to divisions of responsibility and authority.\nThere was tension between SOE and SIS, which the Foreign Office controlled. Stewart Menzies, the chief of SIS, was aggrieved to lose control of Section D. Where SIS preferred placid conditions in which it could gather intelligence and work through influential persons or authorities, SOE was intended to create unrest and turbulence, and often backed anti-establishment organisations, such as the Communists, in several countries. At one stage, SIS actively hindered SOE's attempts to infiltrate agents into enemy-occupied France.\nEven before the United States joined the war, the head of the newly formed Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI), William J. Donovan, had received technical information from SOE and had arranged for some members of his organisation to undergo training at a camp run by SOE in Oshawa in Canada. In early 1942, Donovan's organisation became the Office of Strategic Services. SOE and OSS worked out respective areas of operation: OSS's exclusive sphere included China (including Manchuria), Korea, and Australia, the Atlantic islands, and Finland. SOE retained India, the Middle East and East Africa, and the Balkans. While the two services both worked in Western Europe, it was expected that SOE would be the leading partner.\nIn the middle of the war, the relations between SOE and OSS were not always smooth. They established a joint headquarters in Algiers, but the officers of the two organisations working there refused to share information. In the Balkans, and Yugoslavia especially, SOE and OSS several times worked at cross-purposes, reflecting their governments' differing (and changing) attitudes to the Partisans and Chetniks. However, in 1944, SOE and OSS successfully pooled their personnel and resources to mount Operation Jedburgh, providing large-scale support to the French Resistance following the Normandy landings. SOE had some nominal contact with the Soviet NKVD, but this was limited to a single liaison officer at each other's headquarters.\nLocations.\nBaker Street.\nAfter working from temporary offices in Central London, the headquarters of SOE were moved on 31 October 1940 into 64 Baker Street (hence the nickname \"the Baker Street Irregulars\"). Ultimately, SOE occupied much of the western side of Baker Street. \"Baker Street\" became the euphemistic synecdoche of referring to SOE. The precise nature of the buildings remained concealed; it had no entry in the telephone directories, and correspondence to external bodies bore service addresses: MO1 (SP) (a War Office branch), NID(Q) (Admiralty), AI10 (Air Ministry), or other fictitious bodies or civilian companies. SOE maintained a large number of training, research and development, or administrative centres. It was a joke that \"SOE\" stood for \"Stately 'omes of England\", after the large number of country houses and estates it requisitioned and used.\nProduction and trials.\nThe establishments connected with experimentation and production of equipment were mainly concentrated in and around Hertfordshire and were designated by roman numbers. The main weapons and devices research establishments were The Firs, the home of MD1, formerly MIR(C), near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire (although this was not formally part of SOE), and Station IX at The Frythe, a country house (and former private hotel) outside Welwyn Garden City where, under the cover name of ISRB (Inter Services Research Bureau), SOE developed radios, weapons, explosive devices and booby traps.\nSection D originally had a research station at Bletchley Park, which also held the Government Code and Cipher School, until in November 1940 it was decided that it was unwise to conduct codebreaking and explosives experiments on the same site. The establishment moved to Aston House near Stevenage in Hertfordshire and was renamed Station XII. It originally conducted research and development, but from 1941 it became a production, storage, and distribution centre for devices already developed.\nStation XV, at the Thatched Barn near Borehamwood, was devoted to camouflage, which usually meant equipping agents with authentic local clothing and personal effects. Various sub-stations in London were also involved in this task. Station XV and other camouflage sections also devised methods of hiding weapons, explosives, or radios in innocuous-seeming items.\nAgents also needed identity papers, ration cards, currency, and so on. Station XIV, at Briggens House near Roydon in Essex, was originally the home of STS38, a training facility for Polish saboteurs, who set up their own forgery section. As the work expanded, it became the central forgery department for SOE, and the Poles eventually moved out on 1 April 1942. The technicians at Station XIV included several ex-convicts.\nTraining and operations.\nThe first British training school for guerrilla warfare, originally called the School for Destruction and established by Section D, was later absorbed by SOE. It was officially called Station XVII, or Station 17, and headquartered out of the manor house at Brickendonbury, and occupied the estate's extensive grounds, which were over 1,000 acres at the time. Station 17 was the brainchild of Guy Burgess, an operative for Section D serving under Laurence Grand, who desired to see students produced from an official military doctrine of irregular warfare. When the War Office purchased Brickendonbury in 1939, they placed Burgess as second-in-command of the training facility under Frederick Peters. The man that Burgess hired to create the curriculum for the school was Kim Philby.\nBurgess initially desired that the school should be called the \"Guy Fawkes School,\" but that name didn't stick. After the merger into SOE, D School came to be known as STS 17, where Burgess and Philby produced the first batch of SOE officers trained entirely in-house. Burgess was later arrested for drunk driving and removed from command. In other words, the two men who produced the first batch of SOE officers and wrote its training curriculum \u2013 Philby and Burgess \u2013 were both double agents working for the Soviet Union. However, at this early stage in the war, the Cold War had not yet begun, and the USSR also had a desire to see the destruction of Nazi Germany.\nThe training establishments and properties used by country sections were designated by Arabic numbers and were widely distributed. The initial training centres of SOE were at country houses such as Wanborough Manor, Guildford. Agents destined to serve in the field underwent commando training at Arisaig in Scotland, where they were taught armed and unarmed combat skills by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, former Inspectors in the Shanghai Municipal Police. Those who passed this course received parachute training by STS 51 and 51a situated near Altrincham, Cheshire with the assistance of No.1 Parachute Training School RAF, at RAF Ringway (which later became Manchester Airport). They then attended courses in security and Tradecraft at Group B schools around Beaulieu in Hampshire. Finally, depending on their intended role, they received specialist training in skills such as demolition techniques or Morse code telegraphy at various country houses in England. SOE's Cairo branch established a commando and parachute training school numbered STS 102 at Ramat David near Haifa. This school trained agents who joined SOE from among the armed forces stationed in the Middle East, and also members of the Special Air Service and Greek Sacred Squadron. A commando training centre similar to Arisaig and run by Fairbairn was later set up at Oshawa, for Canadian members of SOE and members of the newly created American organisation, the Office of Strategic Services.\nAgents.\nA variety of people from all classes and pre-war occupations served SOE in the field. The backgrounds of agents in F Section, for example, ranged from aristocrats such as Polish-born Countess Krystyna Skarbek, and Noor Inayat Khan, the daughter of an Indian Sufi leader, to working-class people such as Violette Szabo and Michael Trotobas, with some even reputedly from the criminal underworld. Some of them were recruited by word of mouth among the acquaintances of SOE's officers; others responded to routine trawls of the armed forces for people with unusual languages or other specialised skills.\nIn most cases, the primary quality required of an agent was a deep knowledge of the country in which he or she was to operate, and especially its language, if the agent was to pass as a native of the country. Dual nationality was often a prized attribute. This was particularly so of France. In other cases, especially in the Balkans, a lesser degree of fluency was required as the resistance groups concerned were already in open rebellion, and a clandestine existence was unnecessary. A flair for diplomacy combined with a taste for rough soldiering was more necessary. Some regular army officers proved adept as envoys, and others (such as the former diplomat Fitzroy Maclean or the classicist Christopher Woodhouse) were commissioned only during wartime. Several of SOE's agents were from the Jewish Parachutists of Mandate Palestine, some of whom were \u00e9migr\u00e9s from countries in Europe. Thirty-two of them served as agents in the field, seven of whom were captured and executed.\nExiled or escaped members of the armed forces of some occupied countries were obvious sources of agents. This was particularly true of Norway and the Netherlands. In other cases (such as Frenchmen owing loyalty to Charles de Gaulle and especially the Poles), the agents' first loyalty was to their leaders or governments in exile, and they treated SOE only as a means to an end. This could occasionally lead to mistrust and strained relations in Britain. The organisation was prepared to ignore almost any contemporary social convention in its fight against the Axis. It employed known homosexuals, people with criminal records (some of whom taught skills such as picking locks), those with bad conduct records in the armed forces, Communists, and anti-British nationalists. Some of them might have been considered a security risk, but no known case exists of an SOE agent wholeheartedly going over to the enemy. The Frenchman, Henri D\u00e9ricourt, is widely regarded as a traitor, but he was exonerated by a war crimes court, and some have claimed he was acting under secret orders from SOE or MI6.\nSOE was also far ahead of contemporary attitudes in its use of women in armed combat. Although women were first considered only as couriers in the field, or as wireless operators or administrative staff in Britain, those sent into the field were trained in the use of weapons and in unarmed combat. Most were commissioned into either the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) or the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Women often assumed leadership roles in the field. Pearl Witherington became the organiser (leader) of a highly successful resistance network in France. Early in the war, American Virginia Hall functioned as the unofficial nerve center of several SOE networks in Vichy France. Many women agents such as Odette Hallowes or Violette Szabo were decorated for bravery, posthumously in Szabo's case. Of SOE's 41 (or 39 in some estimates) female agents serving in Section F (France), sixteen did not survive, with twelve killed or executed in Nazi concentration camps.\nCommunications.\nRadio.\nMost of the resistance networks that SOE formed or liaised with were controlled by radio directly from Britain or one of SOE's subsidiary headquarters. All resistance circuits contained at least one wireless operator, and all drops or landings were arranged by radio, except for some early exploratory missions sent \"blind\" into enemy-occupied territory. SOE wireless operators were also known as \"The Pianists\". At first, SOE's radio traffic went through the SIS-controlled radio station at Bletchley Park. From 1 June 1942, SOE used its own transmitting and receiving stations at Grendon Underwood in Buckinghamshire and Poundon nearby, as the location and topography were suitable. Teleprinters linked the radio stations with SOE's HQ in Baker Street. Operators in the Balkans worked to radio stations in Cairo. SOE was highly dependent upon the security of radio transmissions, involving three factors: the physical qualities and capabilities of the radio sets, the security of the transmission procedures, and the provision of proper ciphers.\nSOE's first radios were supplied by SIS. They were large and clumsy and required large amounts of power. SOE acquired a few, much more suitable, sets from the Poles in exile, but eventually designed and manufactured their own, such as the Paraset, under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel F. W. Nicholls of the Royal Corps of Signals, who had served with Gubbins between the wars. The A Mk III, with its batteries and accessories, weighed only , and could fit into a small attache case, although the B Mk II, otherwise known as the B2, which weighed , was required to work over ranges greater than about . Operating procedures were insecure at first. Operators were forced to transmit verbose messages on fixed frequencies and at fixed times and intervals. This allowed German direction finding teams time to triangulate their positions. After several operators were captured or killed, procedures were made more flexible and secure. As with their first radio sets, SOE's first ciphers were inherited from SIS. Leo Marks, SOE's chief cryptographer, was responsible for the development of better codes to replace the insecure poem codes. Eventually, SOE settled on single-use ciphers, printed on silk. Unlike paper, which would be given away by rustling, silk would not be detected by a casual search if it was concealed in the lining of clothing.\nBBC.\nThe BBC also played its part in communications with agents or groups in the field. During the war, it broadcast to almost all Axis-occupied countries and was avidly listened to, even at risk of arrest. The BBC included various \"personal messages\" in its broadcasts, which could include lines of poetry or apparently nonsensical items. They could be used to announce the safe arrival of an agent or message in London for example, or could be instructions to carry out operations on a given date. They were used, for example, to mobilise the resistance groups in the hours before Operation Overlord.\nOther methods.\nIn the field, agents could sometimes make use of the postal services, though these were slow, not always reliable, and letters were almost certain to be opened and read by the Axis security services. In training, agents were taught to use a variety of easily available substances to make invisible ink, though most of these could be detected by a cursory examination, or to hide coded messages in apparently innocent letters. The telephone services were even more certain to be intercepted and listened to by the enemy, and could be used only with great care. The most secure method of communication in the field was by courier. In the earlier part of the war, most women sent as agents in the field were employed as couriers, on the assumption that they would be less likely to be suspected of illicit activities.\nEquipment.\nWeapons.\nAlthough SOE used some suppressed weapons such as the De Lisle carbine and the Welrod (specifically developed for SOE at Station IX), it took the view that weapons issued to resisters should not require extensive training in their use, or need careful maintenance. The crude and cheap Sten was a favourite. For issues to large forces such as the Yugoslav Partisans, SOE used captured German or Italian weapons. These were available in large quantities after the Tunisian and Sicilian campaigns and the surrender of Italy, and the partisans could acquire ammunition for these weapons (and the Sten) from enemy sources. SOE also adhered to the principle that resistance fighters would be handicapped rather than helped by heavy equipment such as mortars or anti-tank guns. These were awkward to transport, almost impossible to conceal, and required skilled and highly trained operators. Later in the war however, when resistance groups staged open rebellions against enemy occupation, some heavy weapons were dispatched, for example to the Maquis du Vercors. Weapons such as the British Army's standard Bren light machine gun were also supplied in such cases.\nMost SOE agents received training on captured enemy weapons before being sent into enemy-occupied territory. Ordinary SOE agents were also armed with handguns acquired abroad, such as, from 1941, a variety of US pistols, and a large quantity of the Spanish Llama .38 ACP in 1944. Such was SOE's demand for weapons, a consignment of 8,000 Ballester\u2013Molina .45 calibre weapons was purchased from Argentina, apparently with the mediation of the US. Lacking British proof markings, these guns could be supplied deniably to resistance groups.\nSOE agents were issued with the Fairbairn\u2013Sykes fighting knife, also issued to Commandos. For specialised operations or use in extreme circumstances, SOE issued small fighting knives which could be concealed in the heel of a hard leather shoe or behind a coat lapel. Concealed \"Coin slasher\" knives were used for slashing car tyres. Given the likely fate of agents captured by the Gestapo, SOE also disguised suicide pills as coat buttons.\nSabotage.\nSOE developed a wide range of explosive devices for sabotage, such as limpet mines, shaped charges, and time fuses, which were also widely used by commando units. Most of these devices were designed and produced at The Firs. The Time Pencil, invented by Commander A.J.G. Langley, the first commandant of Station XII at Aston was used to give a saboteur time to escape after setting a charge and was far simpler to carry and use than lighted fuses or electrical detonators. It relied on crushing an internal vial of acid, which then corroded a retaining wire, which sometimes made it inaccurate in cold or hot conditions. Later, the L-Delay, which instead allowed a lead retaining wire to \"creep\" until it broke and was less affected by the temperature, was introduced.\nSOE pioneered the use of plastic explosive. (The term \"plastique\" comes from plastic explosive packaged by SOE and originally destined for France but taken to the United States instead.) Plastic explosive could be shaped and cut to perform almost any demolition task. It was also inert and required a powerful detonator to cause it to explode, and was therefore safe to transport and store. It was used in everything from car bombs to exploding rats designed to destroy coal-fired boilers. Other, more subtle sabotage methods included lubricants laced with grinding materials, intended for introduction into vehicle oil systems, railway wagon axle boxes, etc., incendiaries disguised as innocuous objects, explosive material concealed in coal piles to destroy locomotives, and land mines disguised as cow or elephant dung. On the other hand, some sabotage methods were extremely simple but effective, such as using sledgehammers to crack cast-iron mountings for machinery.\nOther.\nSOE also revived some medieval devices, such as the caltrop, which could be used to burst the tyres of vehicles or injure foot soldiers and crossbows powered by multiple rubber bands to shoot incendiary bolts. There were two types, known as \"Big Joe\" and \"\"Li'l Joe\"\" respectively. They had tubular alloy skeleton stocks and were designed to be collapsible for ease of concealment. SOE agents were issued a \"striptease suit\", a camouflage overall, and a matching cloth helmet for parachute insertion behind enemy lines. This item was not intended to be used in the sense of a uniform and only for concealment and to be discarded after landing in the dropzone. Another rare item in the same camouflage was the \"Smock Covert SOE\", an overhead smock similar to the SAS windproof but lined with wool, used a large front split pocket and came with a crotch flap. These items and the SOE brushstroke camouflage pattern were Paramilitary as they were never issued to the main armed forces but only the Special Operations Executive.\nAn important section of SOE was Operational Research, which worked mostly from Station IX but also called on the facilities of Station XII and HQ. It operated through the User Trials Section and later the Air Supply Research Section and was formally established in August 1943. The section had the responsibility for both issuing formal requirements and specifications to the relevant development and production sections and for testing prototypes of the devices under field conditions. It ensured that operational requirements were properly assessed, trials conducted, and quality monitored. Over the period from 1 November 1943 to 1 November 1944, the section tested 78 devices. Some of these were weapons such as the Sleeve gun or fuses or adhesion devices to be used in sabotage, others were utility objects such as waterproof containers for stores to be dropped by parachute, or night glasses (lightweight binoculars with plastic lenses). Of the devices tested, 47% were accepted for use with little or no modification, 31% were accepted only after considerable modification, and the remaining 22% were rejected. Before SOE's research and development procedures were formalised in 1943, a variety of more or less useful devices were developed. Some of the more imaginative devices invented by SOE included exploding pens with enough explosive power to blast a hole in the bearer's body, or guns concealed in tobacco pipes, though there is no record of any of these being used in action. Station IX developed a miniature folding motorbike (the \"Welbike\") for use by parachutists, though this was noisy and conspicuous, used scarce petrol, and was of little use on rough ground.\nTransportation.\nThe continent of Europe was largely closed to normal travel. Although it was possible in some cases to cross frontiers from neutral countries such as Spain or Sweden, it was slow, and there were problems over violating these countries' neutrality. SOE had to rely largely on its own air or sea transport for the movement of people, arms, and equipment.\nAir.\nSOE had mostly to rely on the RAF for its planes. It was engaged in disputes with the RAF from its early days. In January 1941, an intended ambush (Operation Savanna) against the aircrew of a German \"pathfinder\" air group near Vannes in Brittany was thwarted when Air Vice Marshal Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff, objected on moral grounds to parachuting what he regarded as assassins, although Portal's objections were later overcome and \"Savanna\" was mounted, unsuccessfully. From 1942, when Air Marshal Arthur Harris (\"Bomber Harris\") became the Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command, he consistently resisted the diversion of the most capable types of bombers to SOE purposes.\nSOE's first aircraft were two Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys belonging to 419 Flight RAF, which was formed in September 1940. In 1941, the flight was expanded to become No. 138 Squadron RAF. In February 1942, they were joined by No. 161 Squadron RAF. 161 Squadron flew agent insertions and pick-ups, while 138 Squadron delivered arms and stores by parachute. \"C\" flight from No. 138 Squadron later became No. 1368 Flight of the Polish Air Force, which joined No. 624 Squadron flying Halifaxes in the Mediterranean. By the later stages of the war several United States Army Air Forces squadrons were operating Douglas C-47 Skytrains in the Mediterranean, although by this time their operations had passed from SOE proper to the \"Balkan Air Terminal Service\". Three Special Duties squadrons operated in the Far East using a variety of aircraft, including the very long-range Consolidated B-24 Liberator.\nRAF Tempsford.\nNos. 161 and 138 Squadrons were based at RAF Tempsford in Bedfordshire, though No. 161 Squadron often moved forward to RAF Tangmere, close to the coast in West Sussex, to shorten their flights. The airfield at Tempsford became the RAF's most secret base. (Tempsford had been rejected for Bomber Command's purposes by Harris in March 1942, as it frequently became waterlogged.) RAF Tempsford was designed to look like an ordinary working farm. SOE used Tangmere Cottage, opposite the main entrance to the base. SOE agents were lodged in a local hotel before being ferried to farm buildings, the \"Gibraltar Farm\" within the airfield's perimeter track. After final briefings and checks at the farm, the agents were issued firearms in the barn and then boarded a waiting aircraft.\nThe squadrons' first task was to take agents to France who could select suitable fields for their aircraft. Most of these agents were French expatriates, some of whom had been pilots in the French Arm\u00e9e de l'Air. Once the agent was in place and had selected several potential fields, 161 Squadron delivered SOE agents, wireless equipment, and operators, and weapons, and flew French political leaders, resistance leaders, or their family members, and downed allied airmen to Britain. Between them, the two squadrons transported 101 agents to, and recovered 128 agents, diplomats and airmen from occupied France.\n161 Squadron operations.\nThe principal aircraft of 161 Squadron was the Westland Lysander. It handled very well at low speed and could land from touch down to turn around in only . It had a range of and could carry one to three passengers in the rear cockpit and stores in a pannier underneath the fuselage. It was flown by a single pilot, who also had to navigate, so missions had to be flown on clear nights with a full or near full moon. Bad weather often thwarted missions, German night fighters were also a hazard, and pilots could never know when landing whether they would be greeted by the resistance or the Gestapo.\nThe procedure once a Lysander reached its destination in France was described by Squadron Leader Hugh Verity. Once the aircraft reached the airfield, the agent on the ground would signal the aircraft by flashing a prearranged code letter in Morse. The aircraft would respond by blinking back the appropriate code response letter. The agent and his men would then mark the field by lighting the three landing lights, which were flashlights attached to poles. The \"A\" lamp was at the base of the landing ground. 150 metres beyond it and into the wind was the \"B\" light, and 50 metres to the right of \"B\" was the \"C\" light. The three lights formed an inverted \"L\", with the \"B\" and \"C\" lights upwind from \"A\". With the code passed, the pilot would land the aircraft. He then would taxi back to the \"A\" lamp, where the passengers would clamber down the fixed ladder to the ground, often while the pilot was making a slow U-turn. Before leaving, the last passenger would hand off the luggage and then take on board the outgoing luggage before climbing down the ladder as well. Then the outgoing passengers would climb aboard and the aircraft would take off. The whole exchange might take as little as 3 minutes.\nThe Lockheed Hudson had a range or greater, and could carry more passengers (ten or more), but required landing strips more than double the length of those needed for the Lysander - vs. ). It carried a navigator, to ease the load on the pilot, and could also be fitted with navigational equipment, such as the \"Rebecca\" homing transceiver of the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar system. The Hudson's use with 161 Squadron was developed by Charles Pickard and Hugh Verity. Pickard determined that the Hudson's stall speed was actually some slower than its manual stated. Before it was first used on 13 January 1943, 161 Squadron had to send two Lysander aircraft, in what they termed \"a double\", if larger parties needed to be picked up.\n138 Squadron and other Special Duties units operations.\nNo. 138 Squadron's primary mission was the delivery of equipment, and occasionally agents, by parachute. It flew a variety of bomber-type aircraft, often modified with extra fuel tanks and flame-suppressing exhaust shrouds: the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley until November 1942, the Handley Page Halifax and later the Short Stirling. The Stirling could carry a very large load (18 containers), but the aircraft with the longest range was the Halifax, which, when based in Italy, could reach drop zones as far away as eastern Poland.\nStores were usually parachuted in cylindrical containers. The \"C\" type was long, and when fully loaded could weigh up to . The \"H\" type was the same size overall but could be broken down into five smaller sections. This made it easier to carry and conceal, but it could not be loaded with longer loads such as rifles. Some inert stores such as boots and blankets were \"free-dropped,\" i.e., simply thrown out of the aircraft bundled together without a parachute, often to the hazard of any receiving committee on the ground.\nLocating and homing equipment.\nSome devices used by SOE were designed specifically to guide aircraft to landing strips and dropping zones. Such sites could be marked by an agent on the ground with bonfires or bicycle lamps, but this required good visibility, as the pilot or navigator of a plane had not only to spot the ground signals, but also to navigate by visible landmarks to correct dead reckoning. Many landings or drops were thwarted by bad weather. To overcome these problems, SOE and Allied airborne forces used the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar, which enabled a Hudson or larger aircraft to home in on a point on the ground even in thick weather.\nIt was, however, difficult for agents or resistance fighters to carry or conceal the ground-based \"Eureka\" transponder equipment. SOE also developed the S-Phone, which allowed a pilot or radio operator aboard an aircraft to communicate by voice with the \"reception committee\". Sound quality was good enough for voices to be recognisable, so that a mission could be aborted in case of any doubts about an agent's identity.\nBoats and Submarines.\nSOE also experienced difficulties with the Royal Navy, who were usually unwilling to allow SOE to use its motor torpedo boats or submarines to deliver agents or equipment. Submarines were regarded as too valuable to risk within range of enemy coastal defences. They could also carry only small numbers of agents, in great discomfort, and could disembark stores only in small dinghies or canoes, which made it difficult to land large quantities of equipment. SOE nevertheless used them in the Indian Ocean where the distances made it impracticable to use any smaller craft.\nThe vessels used by SOE during the early part of the war were clandestine craft such as fishing boats or caiques. They could pass muster as innocent local craft and carry large quantities of stores. They also had the advantage of being largely outside Admiralty control. However, SOE's first small craft organisation, which was set up in the Helford estuary in Cornwall, suffered from obstruction from SIS, which had a similar private navy nearby. Eventually, in spring 1943, the Admiralty created a Deputy Director of Operations (Irregular) to superintend all such private navies. This officer turned out to be the former commander of SIS's craft in the Helford estuary, but his successor in charge of SIS's Helford base cooperated much better with SOE's flotilla. While SIS, SOE and, MI9 landed, and embarked several dozen agents, refugees and Allied aircrew, it was impossible to transport large quantities of arms and equipment inland from beaches in heavily patrolled coastal areas, until France was almost liberated. SOE also had use of HMS \"Fidelity\", a disguised armed merchant ship operated by an independent group of displaced Frenchmen, led by Lt. Commander Jack Langlais. Together with Belgian agent Albert Gu\u00e9risse, founder of the Pat O'Leary escape route, \"Fidelity\" undertook several clandestine missions in the western Mediterranean in 1941.\nStation IX developed several miniature submersible craft. The Welman submarine and \"Sleeping Beauty\" were offensive weapons, intended to place explosive charges on or adjacent to enemy vessels at anchor. The Welman was used once or twice in action, but without success. The Welfreighter was intended to deliver stores to beaches or inlets, but it too was unsuccessful. A sea trials unit was set up in West Wales at Goodwick, by Fishguard (station IXa), where these craft were tested. In late 1944, craft were dispatched to Australia to the Allied Intelligence Bureau (SRD), for tropical testing. After the German occupation of Norway, many Norwegian merchant seamen and fishermen made their way to Britain. SOE recruited several to maintain communications to Norway, using fishing boats from a base in the Shetland Islands. The service became so reliable that it became known as the Shetland Bus. One of its boats and crews launched a daring but unsuccessful attack (\"Operation Title\") against the German battleship Tirpitz. A similar organisation ran missions to occupied Denmark (and neutral Sweden) from the east coast of Britain. The \"Shetland Bus\" was unable to operate only during the very long hours of daylight in the Arctic summer, because of the risk that the slow fishing boats would be attacked by patrolling German aircraft. Late in the war, the unit acquired three fast Submarine chasers for such missions. About the same time, SOE also acquired Motor Gun Boats and MTBs for the Helford flotilla. SOE also used feluccas to maintain communications between Algiers, and southern France and Corsica, and some ca\u00efques in the Aegean.\nOperations.\nFrance.\n In France, most agents were directed by two London-based country sections. F Section was under SOE control, while RF Section was linked to Charles de Gaulle's Free French Government in exile. Most native French agents served in RF. Two smaller sections also existed: the EU/P Section, which dealt with the Polish community in France, and the DF Section, which was responsible for establishing escape routes. During the latter part of 1942, another section known as AMF was established in Algiers, to operate into Southern France.\nOn 5 May 1941, Georges B\u00e9gu\u00e9 (1911\u20131993), a radio operator, became the first SOE agent parachuted into German-occupied France. The American, Virginia Hall, who arrived by boat in August 1941, was the first woman to serve for a lengthy period in France. Andr\u00e9e Borrel (1919\u20131944) and Lise de Baissac (1905\u20132004) became the first women parachuted into France on 24 September 1942. A typical team of a network consisted of an organiser (leader), a radio operator, and a courier. Agents performed a variety of functions, including arms and sabotage instructors, couriers, liaison officers, and radio operators. Between B\u00e9gu\u00e9's first drop in May 1941 and August 1944, more than 400 F Section agents were sent into occupied France. One hundred and four F section agents lost their lives, mostly by being captured and executed by the Germans. RF sent about the same number of agents; AMF sent 600 (although not all of these belonged to SOE). EU/P and DF sent a few dozen agents each.\nSome networks were compromised, with the loss of many agents. In particular, agents continued to be sent to the \"Prosper\" network headed by Francis Suttill for months after it was controlled by the Germans and most of its agents had been captured. The head of F Section, Maurice Buckmaster was blamed by many as he failed to see signs that the network was compromised. To support the Allied invasion of France on D Day in June 1944, SOE and OSS supplemented their agents by air-dropping three-man parties of uniformed military personnel into France as part of Operation Jedburgh. They were to work with the French Resistance to coordinate widespread overt (as opposed to clandestine) acts of resistance. 100 men were eventually dropped, with 6,000 tons of military stores (4,000 tons had been dropped during the years before D-Day). At the same time, all the various sections operating in France (except EU/P) were nominally placed under a London-based HQ titled \u00c9tat-major des Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur (EMFFI).\nIt took many weeks for a full assessment of the contributions of SOE and the Jedburgh teams to the Allied landings in Normandy, but when it came, it vindicated Gubbins' belief that carefully planned sabotage could hinder a modern army. General Eisenhower's staff at the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force said that the Jedburghs had \"succeeded in imposing more or less serious delays on all the divisions moved to Normandy\". This had prevented Hitler from striking back in the crucial opening hours of Operation Overlord. The most \"outstanding example was the delay to the 2nd SS Panzer Division\", Eisenhower's staff said, and added a very personal endorsement, agreeing that the work carried out under Gubbins' leadership played a \"very considerable part in our complete and final victory\".\nMany agents were captured, killed in action, executed, or died in German concentration camps. More than one-third of the 41 female agents of Section F did not survive the war; the death toll for more than 400 male agents was one-fourth, and the toll of thousands of French people helping SOE agents and networks was about one-fifth. Of 119 SOE agents captured by the Germans and deported to concentration camps in Germany, only 23 men and three women survived.\nPoland.\nSOE did not need to instigate Polish resistance, because unlike the Vichy French, the Poles overwhelmingly refused to collaborate with the Nazis. Early in the war, the Poles established the Home Army, led by a clandestine resistance government known as the Polish Secret State. Nevertheless, many members of SOE were Polish, and the Polish resistance cooperated with them extensively. SOE assisted the Polish government in exile with training facilities and logistical support for its 605 special forces operatives known as the Cichociemni, or \"The Dark and Silent\". Members of the unit, which was based in Audley End House, Essex, were rigorously trained before being parachuted into occupied Poland. Because of the distance involved in air travel to Poland, customised aircraft with extra fuel capacity were used in Polish operations such as Operation Wildhorn III. Sue Ryder, a war-time member of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, who worked with the Poles in Britain, later chose the title Baroness Ryder of Warsaw in honour of these operations.\nSecret Intelligence Service member Krystyna Skarbek (\"nom de guerre\" Christine Granville) ran several operations in Poland and Hungary (with Andrzej Kowerski), from 1939-1941, in Egypt 1941-1944, and in France with SOE F (for French) Section in 1944. Having served in the Polish resistance Home Army since 1939, El\u017cbieta Zawacka reached Britain in May 1943, and became the only female member of the Polish elite Special Forces, the Cichociemni or 'Silent Unseen', therefore also the only woman in SOE P (for Polish) Section. Zawacka, like Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, reached Britain through Gibraltar on an established courier route out of occupied Europe. Maciej Kalenkiewicz was parachuted into occupied Poland, only to be killed by the Soviets. A Polish agent was integral to SOE's Operation Foxley, the plan to assassinate Hitler. Thanks to co-operation between SOE and the Home Army, the Poles were able to deliver the first Allied intelligence on the Holocaust to London in June 1942. Witold Pilecki of the Polish Home Army designed a joint operation with SOE to liberate Auschwitz, but the British rejected it as infeasible. Joint Anglo-Polish operations provided London with vital intelligence on the V-2 rocket, German troops' movements on the Eastern Front, and the Soviet repressions of Polish citizens. RAF 'Special Duties Flights' were sent to Poland to assist the Warsaw uprising against the Nazis. The rebellion was defeated with a loss of 200,000 casualties (mostly German executions of Polish civilians) after the nearby Red Army refused military assistance to the Polish Home Army. RAF Special Duties Flights were refused landing rights at Soviet-held airfields near Warsaw, even when requiring emergency landings after battle damage. These flights were also attacked by Soviet fighters, despite the USSR's officially Allied status.\nGermany.\nDue to the dangers and lack of a friendly population, few operations were conducted in Germany itself. The German and Austrian section of SOE was run by Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Thornley for most of the war, and was mainly involved with black propaganda and administrative sabotage in collaboration with the German section of the Political Warfare Executive. After D-Day, the section was reorganised and enlarged with Major General Gerald Templer heading the Directorate, with Thornley as his deputy.\nSeveral major operations were planned, including Operation Foxley, a plan to assassinate Hitler, and Operation Periwig, an ingenious plan to simulate the existence of a large-scale anti-Nazi resistance movement within Germany. \"Foxley\" was never carried out but \"Periwig\" went ahead despite restrictions placed on it by SIS and SHAEF. Several German prisoners of war were trained as agents, briefed to make contact with the anti-Nazi resistance and to conduct sabotage. They were then parachuted into Germany in the hope that they would either hand themselves in to the \"Gestapo\" or be captured by them, and reveal their supposed mission. Fake coded wireless transmissions were broadcast to Germany, and various pieces of agent paraphernalia, such as code books and wireless receivers, were allowed to fall into the hands of the German authorities. In Austria, a resistance group formed around Kaplan Heinrich Maier. The Maier group was informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through its contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz. SOE was in contact with this resistance group through its colleague G. E. R. Gedye in 1943, but was not convinced of the reliability of the contact and did not cooperate due to security concerns.\nThe Netherlands.\nSection N of SOE ran operations in the Netherlands. They committed some of SOE's worst blunders in security, which allowed the Germans to capture many agents and much sabotage material, in what the Germans called the 'Englandspiel'. SOE ignored the absence of security checks in radio transmissions and other warnings that the Germans were running the supposed resistance networks. A total of 50 agents were caught by the Germans and brought to Camp Haaren in the South of the Netherlands. Five captured men managed to escape from the camp. Two of them, Pieter Dourlein and Ben Ubbink, escaped on 29 August 1943 and found their way to Switzerland. There, the Netherlands Embassy sent messages over their controlled sets to England that SOE Netherlands was compromised. SOE set up new elaborate networks, which continued to operate until the Netherlands was liberated at the end of the war. In September 1944, as Allied military forces were advancing into the Netherlands, the remaining captured SOE agents were taken by the Germans from Camp Haaren to Mauthausen concentration camp and executed.\nFrom September 1944 to April 1945, eight Jedburgh teams were also active in the Netherlands. The first team, code-named \"Dudley,\" was parachuted into the east of the Netherlands one week before Operation Market Garden. The next four teams were attached to the Airborne forces that carried out Market Garden. After the failure of Market Garden, one Jedburgh team trained (former) resistance men in the liberated South of the Netherlands. In April 1945, the last two Dutch Jedburgh teams became operational. One team code-named \"Gambling\" was a combined Jedburgh/Special Air Service (SAS) group that was dropped into the centre of the Netherlands to assist the Allied advance. The last team was parachuted into the Northern Netherlands as part of SAS operation \"Amherst\". Even though operating in the flat and densely populated Netherlands was very difficult for the Jedburghs, the teams were quite successful.\nBelgium.\nSection T established some effective networks in Belgium, in part orchestrated by fashion designer Hardy Amies, who rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Amies adapted names of fashion accessories for use as code words while managing some of the most murderous and ruthless agents in the field. The rapid liberation of the country by Allied forces in September 1944 provided the resistance with little time to stage an uprising. They did assist the Allies to bypass German rearguards and enabled the Allies to capture the vital Port of Antwerp intact.\nAfter Brussels was liberated, Amies outraged his superiors by setting up a \"Vogue\" photo shoot in Belgium. In 1946, he was knighted in Belgium for his service with SOE, being named an officer of the Order of the Crown.\nItaly.\nAs both an enemy country and supposedly a monolithic fascist state with no organised opposition which SOE could use, SOE made little effort in Italy before mid-1943, when Mussolini's government collapsed and Allied forces already occupied Sicily.\nTwo years earlier, in April 1941, in a mission codenamed \"Yak\", Peter Fleming had attempted to recruit agents from among the many thousands of Italian prisoners of war captured in the Western Desert Campaign. He recruited none. Attempts to search among Italian immigrants in the United States, Britain, and Canada for agents to be sent to Italy had similarly poor results. During the first three years of war, the most important \"episode\" of the collaboration between SOE and Italian anti-fascism was a project of an anti-fascist uprising in Sardinia, which SOE supported at some stage but did not receive approval from the Foreign Office.\nIn the aftermath of the Italian collapse, SOE (in Italy renamed No. 1 Special Force) helped build a large resistance organisation in the cities of Northern Italy, and in the Alps. Italian partisans harassed German forces in Italy throughout the autumn and winter of 1944, and in the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy they captured Genoa and other cities unaided by Allied forces. SOE helped the Italian Resistance send British missions to the partisan formations and supply war material to the bands of patriots, a supply made without political prejudices, and which also helped the Communist formations (Brigate Garibaldi). Late in 1943, SOE established a base at Bari in Southern Italy, from which they operated their networks and agents in the Balkans. This organisation had the codename \"Force 133\". This later became \"Force 266\", reserving 133 for operations run from Cairo rather than the heel of Italy. Flights from Brindisi were run to the Balkans and Poland, particularly once control had been wrested from SOE's Cairo headquarters and was exercised directly by Gubbins. SOE established a new packing station for the parachute containers close to Brindisi Air base, along the lines of those created at Saffron Walden. This was ME 54, a factory employing hundreds, the American (OSS) side of which was known as \"Paradise Camp\".\nYugoslavia.\n1941, SOE helped considerably in anti-Axis propaganda and in preparing the Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat which overthrew the pro-Axis regent, Prince Paul. After the pro-British coup succeeded, the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia ensued. In the aftermath of the German invasion and the Yugoslav capitulation, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia fragmented. Croatia had a substantial pro-Axis movement, the Usta\u0161e. In Serbia and the remainder of Yugoslavia, two resistance movements formed: the royalist Chetniks under Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107, and the Communist Partisans under Josip Broz Tito.\nMihailovi\u0107 was the first to attempt to contact the Allies, and SOE dispatched a party on 20 September 1941 under Major \"Marko\" Hudson. Hudson also encountered Tito's forces. Notable members of this party included actor Christopher Lee. Through the royalist government in exile, SOE at first supported the Chetniks. Eventually, however, due to reports that the Chetniks were less effective and even collaborating with German and Italian forces on occasion, British support was redirected to the Partisans, even before the Tehran Conference in 1943. Although relations were often touchy throughout the war, it can be argued that SOE's unstinting support was a factor in Yugoslavia's maintaining a neutral stance during the Cold War. However, accounts vary dramatically between all historical works on the \"Chetnik controversy\".\nHungary.\nSOE was unable to establish links or contacts in Hungary before the regime of Mikl\u00f3s Horthy aligned itself with the Axis powers. Distance and lack of such contacts prevented any effort being made by SOE until the Hungarians themselves dispatched a diplomat (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veress) in a clandestine attempt to contact the Western Allies. SOE facilitated his return with some radio sets. Before the Allied governments could agree on terms, Hungary was placed under German military occupation, and Veress was forced to flee the country.\nTwo missions subsequently dropped \"blind,\" i.e., without prior arrangement for a reception party, failed. So too did an attempt by Basil Davidson to incite a partisan movement in Hungary, after he made his way there from northeastern Yugoslavia.\nGreece.\nGreece was eventually overrun by the Axis after a decisive win over the Italians and a significant defence lasting several months, which also caused a major diversion of German forces, subsequently delaying the invasion of the Soviet Union. This was the first serious setback suffered by the Axis forces and resulted in Churchill saying that \"from now on we will say heroes fight like Greeks!\". In the aftermath, SIS and another intelligence organisation, SIME, discouraged attempts at sabotage or resistance as this might imperil relations with Turkey, although SOE maintained contacts with resistance groups in Crete. In late 1942, at the army's instigation, SOE mounted its first operation, codenamed Operation Harling, into Greece in an attempt to disrupt the railway which was being used to move materials to the German Panzer Army Africa. A party under Colonel (later Brigadier) Eddie Myers, assisted by Christopher Woodhouse, was parachuted into Greece and discovered two guerrilla groups operating in the mountains: the pro-Communist ELAS and the republican EDES. On 25 November 1942, Myers's party blew up one of the spans of the railway viaduct at Gorgopotamos, supported by 150 Greek partisans from these two organisations who engaged Italians guarding the viaduct. This cut the railway linking Thessaloniki with Athens and Piraeus.\nRelations between the resistance groups and the British soured. When the British needed once again to disrupt the railway across Greece as part of the deception operations preceding Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, the resistance groups refused to take part, rightly fearing German reprisals against civilians. Instead, a six-man commando party from the British and New Zealand armies, led by New Zealander Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Edward Barnes, a civil engineer, carried out the destruction of the Asopos viaduct on 21 June 1943. Two attempts by Mike Cumberlege to make the Corinth Canal unnavigable ended in failure.\nEDES received most aid from SOE, but ELAS secured many weapons when Italy collapsed and Italian military forces in Greece dissolved. ELAS and EDES fought a vicious civil war in 1943 until SOE brokered an uneasy armistice (the Plaka agreement). A lesser-known, but important function of SOE in Greece was to inform the Cairo headquarters of the movement of the German military aircraft that were serviced and repaired at the two former Greek military aircraft facilities in and around Athens. Eventually, the British Army occupied Athens and Piraeus in the aftermath of the German withdrawal, and fought a street-by-street battle to drive ELAS from these cities and impose an interim government under Archbishop Damaskinos. SOE's last act was to evacuate several hundred disarmed EDES fighters to Corfu, preventing their massacre by ELAS. Several resistance groups and Allied stay-behind parties operated in Crete after the Germans occupied the island in the Battle of Crete. SOE's operations involved figures such as Patrick Leigh Fermor, John Lewis, Harry Rudolph Fox Burr, Tom Dunbabin, Sandy Rendel, John Houseman, Xan Fielding, and Bill Stanley Moss. Some of the most famous moments included the abduction of General Heinrich Kreipe led by Leigh Fermor and Moss \u2013 subsequently portrayed in the film \"Ill Met by Moonlight\", and the sabotage of Damasta led by Moss.\nAlbania.\nAlbania had been under Italian influence since 1923, and was occupied by the Italian Army in 1939. In 1943, a small liaison party entered Albania from northwestern Greece. SOE agents who entered Albania then or later included Julian Amery, Anthony Quayle, David Smiley, and Neil \"Billy\" McLean. They discovered another internecine war between the Communist partisans under Enver Hoxha, and the republican Balli Komb\u00ebtar. As the latter had collaborated with the Italian occupiers, Hoxha gained Allied support. SOE's envoy to Albania, Brigadier Edmund \"Trotsky\" Davies, was captured by the Germans early in 1944. Some SOE officers warned that Hoxha's aim was primacy after the war, rather than fighting the Germans. They were ignored, but Albania was never a major factor in the effort against the Germans.\nCzechoslovakia.\nSOE sent many missions into the Czech areas of the so-called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and later into Slovakia. The most famous mission was Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich in Prague. From 1942 to 1943, the Czechoslovaks had their own Special Training School (STS) at Chicheley Hall in Buckinghamshire. In 1944, SOE sent men to support the Slovak National uprising.\nNorway.\nIn March 1941, a group performing commando raids in Norway, Norwegian Independent Company 1 (NOR.I.C.1) was organised under the leadership of Captain Martin Linge. Their initial raid in 1941 was Operation Archery; the best-known raid was probably the Norwegian heavy water sabotage. Communication lines with London were gradually improved so that by 1945, 64 radio operators were spread throughout Norway.\nDenmark.\nThe Danish resistance assisted SOE in its activities in neutral Sweden. For example, SOE was able to obtain several shiploads of vital ball-bearings which had been interned in Swedish ports. The Danes also pioneered several secure communications methods; for example, a burst transmitter/receiver which transcribed Morse code onto or from a paper tape faster than a human operator could handle.\nRomania.\nShortly after the establishment of the SOE, the \"Romania section of SOE\" was formed with the mission of sabotaging oil shipments from Romania to Germany and attempting to form a resistance movement mainly by keeping close contact with the pro-British political actors. An SOE network in Romania was set up by engineer Valeriu \"Ric\u0103\" Georgescu (code-named \"Jockey\") in February 1941. The role of this network was to gather military and economic intelligence and to maintain contact between Iuliu Maniu and the British Government. Until its discovery and fall in August 1941, the network proved an invaluable asset by supplying the British with information gathered from the German High Command in Bucharest, such as the German plans to invade the USSR.\nAlthough arrested by the Romanian authorities, Georgescu maintained his contacts with the SOE. To better establish connections with Maniu and the opposition, a first SOE mission, code-named \"Ranji\", was sent to Romania in June 1943. The mission, led by Captain Thomas Russell, was dropped into Yugoslavia and made its way to Romania, where it continued to operate until Russell was killed in September of the same year. The mission did succeed in delivering a radio set and a radioman to Maniu's supporters. In December 1943, another SOE delegation under the code name Operation Autonomous was parachuted into Romania. The delegation, including Colonel Gardyne de Chastelain, Captain Silviu Me\u021bianu, and Ivor Porter, was captured by the Romanian Gendarmerie and held until the night of King Michael's Coup on 23 August 1944. The task of Autonomous was to attempt again to establish direct contact with Maniu and establish the details of an eventual coup against Antonescu, and in case of capture to inform Antonescu of the British government's attitude towards Romania and to advise him in sending emissaries to discuss the Allied armistice terms.\nAbyssinia.\nAbyssinia was the scene of some of SOE's earliest and most successful efforts. SOE organised a force of Ethiopian irregulars under Orde Charles Wingate in support of the exiled Emperor Haile Selassie. This force (named Gideon Force by Wingate) caused heavy casualties to the Italian occupation forces and contributed to the successful British campaign there. Wingate was to use his experience to create the Chindits in Burma.\nWest Africa.\nThe neutral Spanish island of Fernando Po was the scene of Operation Postmaster, one of SOE's most successful exploits. The large Italian merchant vessel \"Duchessa d'Aosta\" and the German tug \"Likomba\" had taken refuge in the harbour of Santa Isabel. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party ashore thrown by an SOE agent, commandos and SOE personnel led by Gus March-Phillipps boarded the two vessels, cut the anchor cables and towed them out to sea, where they later rendezvoused with Royal Navy ships. Several neutral authorities and observers were impressed by the British display of ruthlessness.\nSoutheast Asia.\nAs early as 1940, SOE was preparing plans for operations in Southeast Asia. As in Europe, after initial Allied military disasters, SOE built up indigenous resistance organisations and guerrilla armies in enemy (Japanese) occupied territory. SOE also launched \"Operation Remorse\" (1944\u201345), which was ultimately aimed at protecting the economic and political status of Hong Kong. Force 136 engaged in covert trading of goods and currencies in China. Its agents proved remarkably successful, raising \u00a377m through their activities, which were used to assist Allied prisoners of war and, more controversially, to buy influence locally to facilitate a smooth return to pre-war conditions.\nDissolution.\nIn late 1944, as it became clear that the war would soon be over, Lord Selborne advocated keeping SOE or a similar body in being, and that it would report to the Ministry of Defence. Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, insisted that his ministry, already responsible for the SIS, should control SOE or its successors. The Joint Intelligence Committee, which had a broad co-ordinating role over Britain's intelligence services and operations, took the view that SOE was a more effective organisation than the SIS but that it was unwise to split the responsibility for espionage and more direct action between separate ministries, or to perform special operations outside the ultimate control of the Chiefs of Staff. The debate continued for several months until, on 22 May 1945, Selborne wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In view of the Russian menace, the situation in Italy, Central Europe, and the Balkans, and the smouldering volcanoes in the Middle East, I think it would be madness to allow SOE to be stifled at this juncture. In handing it over to the Foreign Office, I cannot help feeling that to ask Sir Orme Sergent [\"sic\"] [shortly to become Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs] to supervise SOE is like inviting an abbess to supervise a brothel! But SOE is no base instrument, it is a highly specialized weapon which will be required by HMG whenever we are threatened and whenever it is necessary to contact the common people of foreign lands.\nChurchill took no immediate decision, and after he lost the general election on 5 July 1945, the matter was dealt with by the Labour Prime Minister, Clement Attlee. Selborne informed Attlee that SOE still maintained a worldwide network of clandestine radio stations and sympathizers. Attlee replied that he had no wish to own a British Comintern, and closed Selborne's network down at 48 hours' notice. SOE was dissolved officially on 15 January 1946. Some of its senior staff moved easily into financial services in the City of London. However, some of them had not lost their undercover mentality and did little for the City's name. Most of SOE's other personnel reverted to their peacetime occupations or regular service in the armed forces, but 280 of them were taken into the \"Special Operations Branch\" of MI6. Some of these had served as agents in the field, but MI6 was most interested in SOE's training and research staff. Sir Stewart Menzies, the head of MI6 (who was generally known simply as \"C\") soon decided that a separate Special Operations branch was unsound, and merged it into the general body of MI6. Gubbins, the last director, was not given further employment by the Army, but he later founded the Special Forces Club for former members of SOE and similar organisations.\nWartime commentaries on SOE.\nAlthough the wartime British government considered the activities of SOE to be lawful, the German invaders, as in World War I and the War of 1870, argued that those engaging in resistance (local resistance fighters and the agents of foreign governments who supported them) were \"bandits\" and \"terrorists\", maintaining that all \"Francs-tireurs\" (and said agents) were engaging in an illegal form of warfare, and, as such, had no legal rights. A view expressed by Fritz Sauckel, the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment, making him the man in charge of bringing workers to the factories in Germany for forced labour, who demanded the flight of young French men to the countryside be stopped and called the \"maquis\" \"terrorists\", \"bandits\" and \"criminals\" for their opposition to lawful authority.\nLater analysis and commentaries.\nThe mode of warfare encouraged and promoted by SOE is considered by several modern commentators to have established the modern model that many alleged terrorist organisations emulate. Two opposed views were quoted by Tony Geraghty in \"The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence\". M. R. D. Foot, who wrote several official histories of SOE, wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Irish [thanks to the example set by Collins and followed by SOE] can thus claim that their resistance provides the originating impulse for resistance to tyrannies worse than any they had to endure themselves. And the Irish resistance, as Collins led it, showed the rest of the world a way to fight wars, the only sane way they can be fought in the age of the Nuclear bomb. The British military historian John Keegan wrote &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We must recognise that our response to the scourge of terrorism is compromised by what we did through SOE. The justification\u00a0... That we had no other means of striking back at the enemy\u00a0... is exactly the argument used by the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the PFLP, the IRA and every other half-articulate terrorist organisation on Earth. Futile to argue that we were a democracy and Hitler a tyrant. Means besmirch ends. SOE besmirched Britain. Keegan also questioned the effectiveness of SOE. He wrote &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother, later view, on the moral contribution of SOE, was expressed by the writer Max Hastings &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yet the moral contribution of secret war, which would have been impossible without the sponsorship of SOE and OSS, was beyond price. It made possible the resurrection of self-respect in occupied societies which would otherwise have been forced to look back on the successive chapters of their experience of the conflict through a dark prism: military humiliation, followed by enforced collaboration with the enemy, followed by belated deliverance at the hands of foreign armies. As it was, and entirely thanks to Resistance, all European nations could cherish their cadres of heroes and martyrs, enabling the mass of their citizens who did nothing, or who served the enemy, to be painted over in the grand canvas cherished in the perception of their descendants.\nIn popular culture.\nSince the end of the war, SOE has appeared in many films, comics, books, and television. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Peggy Carter was recommended to SOE by her brother Michael, where she starts her career as a field agent. SOE is portrayed in the movie Allied. British science-fiction author Charles Stross' book series \"The Laundry Files\" takes place within the Q-division of SOE (known as the eponymous Laundry), which has remained in operation since WWII, due to their mission to save the world from occult threats. Portraying a heavily fictionalized version of Operation Postmaster, a Guy Ritchie-directed film called \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\" starring Henry Cavill as Gus March-Phillipps and Alan Ritchson as Anders Lassen, was released on 19 April 2024.\nSOE appears first in ' after the protagonist is shot down over the Netherlands, joining SOE after blowing up a train. SOE appears again in ' when the protagonist teams up with the British to destroy a Nazi train, then again to liberate Paris. In the 1968 WWII novel The Military Philosophers, the major but off-stage character of Syzmanski (known only by his last name) is intended to be a Special Operations Executive. While working on the novel, author Anthony Powell stated in correspondence with publisher Roland Gant his plan for the character: \"I am already committed to this name [Syzmanski] for a rather sinister character, who does not appear but has a SOE role.\" Syzmanski is a former Free France fighter sprung from military detention to serve in a shadowy capacity as a maverick agent for the Allies, although his official position is never named. Powell himself served in Military Intelligence during the war.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nOfficial publications / academic histories\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFirst-hand accounts by those who served with SOE\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBiographies / popular books by outsiders\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"In association with a three-part BBC TV series, Ray Mears followed the route taken in 1943 along with some present-day members of the Royal Marines and the Norwegian Army.\"\n \"Tells the story of Violette Szabo (a film of the same name was based on the book).\"\nCommentaries\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Introduced by IBM with the PC/AT, it was intended to be available as a special key to directly invoke low-level operating system functions with no possibility of conflicting with any existing software. A special BIOS routine \u2013 software interrupt 0x15, subfunction 0x85 \u2013 was added to signal the OS when SysRq was pushed or released. Unlike most keys, when it is pressed nothing is stored in the keyboard buffer.\nHistory.\nThe specific low level function intended for the SysRq key was to switch between operating systems. When the original IBM-PC was created in 1980, there were three leading competing operating systems: PC DOS, CP/M-86, and UCSD p-System, while Xenix was added in 1983\u20131984. The SysRq key was added so that multiple operating systems could be run on the same computer, using the capabilities of the 286 chip in the PC/AT.\nA special key was needed because most software of the day operated at a low level, often bypassing the OS entirely, and typically made use of many hotkey combinations. The use of terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs further complicated matters. To implement a task switching or multitasking environment, it was thought that a special, separate key was needed. This is similar to the way \"Control-Alt-Delete\" is used under Windows NT.\nOn 84-key keyboards (except the 84-key IBM Model M space saver keyboard), SysRq was a key of its own. On the later 101-key keyboard, it shares a physical key with the Print screen key function. The Alt key must be held down while pressing this dual-function key to invoke SysRq. This continues through modern PC keyboards.\nThe default BIOS keyboard routines simply ignore SysRq and return without taking action. So did the MS-DOS input routines. The keyboard routines in libraries supplied with many high-level languages followed suit. Although it is still included on most PC keyboards manufactured, and though it is used by some debugging software, the key is of no use for the vast majority of users.\nOn the Hyundai/Hynix Super-16 computer, pressing will hard boot the system (it will reboot when is unresponsive, and it will invoke startup memory tests that are bypassed on soft-boot).\nModern uses.\nIn Linux, the kernel can be configured to provide functions for system debugging and crash recovery. This use is known as the \"magic SysRq key\".\nMicrosoft has also used SysRq for various OS- and application-level debuggers. In the CodeView debugger, it was sometimes used to break into the debugging during program execution. For the Windows NT remote kernel debugger, it can be used to force the system into the debugger.\nOn modern Windows and some Linux desktop environments \"Alt + Print screen\" (which is the shortcut for SysRq on most modern keyboards) copies an image of the current active window, instead of the entire screen as Print Screen alone would.\nSimilar keys.\nIBM 3270-type console keyboards of the IBM System/370 mainframe computer, created in 1970, had an operator interrupt key that was used to cause the operating system such as VM/370 or MVS to allow the console to give input to the operating system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28900", "revid": "36068529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28900", "title": "Split infinitive", "text": "English grammatical construction\nA split infinitive is a grammatical construction specific to English in which an adverb or adverbial phrase separates the \"to\" and \"infinitive\" constituents of what was traditionally called the \"full infinitive\", but is more commonly known in modern linguistics as the to-infinitive (e.g., \"to go\").\nIn the history of English language aesthetics, the split infinitive was often deprecated, despite its prevalence in colloquial speech. The opening sequence of the \"Star Trek\" television series contains a well-known example, \"to \"boldly\" go where no man has gone before\", wherein the adverb \"boldly\" was said to split the full infinitive, \"to go\". \nMultiple words may split a to-infinitive, such as: \"The population is expected to \"more than\" double in the next ten years.\"\nIn the 19th century, some linguistic prescriptivists sought to disallow the split infinitive forever, and the resulting conflict had considerable cultural importance. The construction still renders disagreement, but modern English usage guides have largely dropped the objection to it.\nThe \"split infinitive\" terminology is not widely used in modern linguistics. Some linguists question whether a to-infinitive phrase can meaningfully be called a \"full infinitive\" and, consequently, whether an infinitive can be \"split\" at all.\nHistory of the construction.\nOld and Middle English.\nIn Old English, infinitives were single words ending in \"-n\" or \"-an\" (comparable to modern Dutch and German \"-n\", \"-en\"). Gerunds were formed using \"to\" followed by a verbal noun in the dative case, which ended in \"-anne\" or \"-enne\" (e.g., \"t\u014d cumenne\" = \"coming, to come\"). In Middle English, the bare infinitive and the gerund coalesced into the same form ending in \"-(e)n\" (e.g., \"comen\" \"come\"; \"to comen\" \"to come\"). The \"to\" infinitive was not split in Old or Early Middle English.\nThe first known example of a split infinitive in English, in which a pronoun rather than an adverb splits the infinitive, is in Layamon's \"Brut\" (early 13th century):\n\"and he cleopede him to; alle his wise cnihtes.\"\nfor to him reade;\nAnd he called to him all his wise knights\nto him advise;\nThis may be a poetic inversion for the sake of meter, and therefore says little about whether Layamon would have felt the construction to be syntactically natural. However, no such reservation applies to the following prose example from John Wycliffe (14th century), who often split infinitives:\n\"For this was gret unkyndenesse, to this manere treten there brother.\"\nFor this was great unkindness, to in this manner treat their brother.\nModern English.\nAfter its rise in Middle English, the construction became rare in the 15th and 16th centuries. William Shakespeare used it at least once. The uncontroversial example appears to be a syntactical inversion for the sake of meter:\n\"Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows\"\n\"Thy pity may deserve to pitied be\" (Sonnet 142).\nEdmund Spenser, John Dryden, Alexander Pope, and the King James Version of the Bible used none, and they are very rare in the writing of Samuel Johnson. John Donne used them several times, though, and Samuel Pepys also used at least one. No reason for the near disappearance of the split infinitive is known; in particular, no prohibition is recorded.\nSplit infinitives reappeared in the 18th century and became more common in the 19th.\nDaniel Defoe, Benjamin Franklin, William Wordsworth, Abraham Lincoln, George Eliot, Henry James, and Willa Cather are among the writers who used them. Examples in the poems of Robert Burns attest its presence also in 18th-century Scots:\n\"Who dared to nobly stem tyrannic pride.\" (\"The Cottar's Saturday Night\")\nIn colloquial speech, the construction came to enjoy widespread use. Today, according to the \"American Heritage Book of English Usage\", \"people split infinitives all the time without giving it a thought.\" In corpora of contemporary spoken English, some adverbs such as \"always\" and \"completely\" appear more often in the split position than the unsplit.\nTheories of origins.\nAlthough it is difficult to say why the construction developed in Middle English, or why it revived so powerfully in Modern English, a number of theories have been postulated.\nAnalogy.\nTraditional grammarians have suggested that the construction appeared because people frequently place adverbs before finite verbs. George Curme writes: \"If the adverb should immediately precede the finite verb, we feel that it should immediately precede also the infinitive\u2026\" Thus, if one says:\n\"She gradually got rid of her stutter.\" and\n\"She will gradually get rid of her stutter.\"\none may, by analogy, wish to say:\n\"She\" wants \"to gradually get rid of her stutter.\"\nThis is supported by the fact that split infinitives are often used as echoes, as in the following exchange, in which the riposte parodies the slightly odd collocation in the original sentence:\nChild: \"I accidentally forgot to feed the hamster.\"\nParent: \"Well, you'll have to try harder not\" to \"accidentally forget\", \"won't you?\"\nThis is an example of an adverb being transferred into split infinitive position from a parallel position in a different construction.\nTransformational grammar.\nTransformational grammarians have attributed the construction to a re-analysis of the role of \"to\".\nTypes.\nIn the modern language, splitting usually involves a single adverb coming between the verb and its marker. Very frequently, this is an emphatic adverb, for example:\n\"I need you all to really pull your weight.\"\n\"I'm gonna (going to) totally pulverise him.\"\nSometimes it is a negation, as in the self-referential joke:\n\"Writers should learn to not split infinitives\".\nHowever, in modern colloquial English, almost any adverb may be found in this syntactic position, especially when the adverb and the verb form a close syntactic unit (really-pull, not-split).\nCompound split infinitives, i.e., infinitives split by more than one word, usually involve a pair of adverbs or a multi-word adverbial:\n\"We are determined to completely and utterly eradicate the disease\".\n\"He is thought to almost never have made such a gesture before\".\n\"This is a great opportunity to once again communicate our basic message\".\nExamples of non-adverbial elements participating in the split-infinitive construction seem rarer in Modern English than in Middle English. The pronoun \"all\" commonly appears in this position:\n\"It was their nature to all hurt one another\".\nand may even be combined with an adverb:\n\"I need you to all really pull your weight.\"\nHowever an object pronoun, as in the Layamon example above, would be unusual in modern English, perhaps because this might cause a listener to misunderstand the \"to\" as a preposition:\n *\"And he called to him all his wise knights to him advise\".\nWhile, structurally, acceptable as poetic formulation, this would result in a garden path sentence, particularly evident if the indirect object is omitted:\nOther parts of speech would be very unusual in this position. However, in verse, poetic inversion for the sake of meter or of bringing a rhyme word to the end of a line often results in abnormal syntax, as with Shakespeare's split infinitive (\"to pitied be\", cited above), in fact an inverted passive construction in which the infinitive is split by a past participle. Presumably, this would not have occurred in a prose text by the same author.\nWhen multiple infinitives are linked by a conjunction, the particle \"to\" tends to be used only once at the beginning of the sequence: \"to eat, drink, and be merry\". In this case, the conjunction and any other words that fall between the \"to\" and the final infinitive have seldom been deemed to create a split infinitive, and almost always have been considered uncontroversial. Examples include \"We pray you to proceed\u00a0/ And justly and religiously unfold...\" (Shakespeare, \"Henry V\", Act II, scene 9) and \"...she is determined to be independent, and not live with aunt Pullet\" (George Eliot, \"The Mill on the Floss\", volume VI, chapter I).\nHistory of the term.\nIt was not until the very end of the 19th century that terminology emerged to describe the construction. The earliest use of the term \"split infinitive\" on record dates from 1890. The now rare \"cleft infinitive\" is almost as old, attested from 1893; in the 1890s it was briefly the more common term but almost disappeared after 1905. \"Splitting the infinitive\" is slightly older, going back to 1887. According to the main etymological dictionaries, \"infinitive-splitting\" and \"infinitive-splitter\" followed in 1926 and 1927, respectively. The term \"compound split infinitive\", referring to a split infinitive with more than one word between the particle and the infinitive, is not found in these dictionaries and appears to be very recent.\nThis terminology implies analysing the full infinitive as a two-word infinitive, which not all grammarians accept. As one who used \"infinitive\" to mean the single-word verb, Otto Jespersen challenged the epithet: \"'To' is no more an essential part of an infinitive than the definite article is an essential part of a nominative, and no one would think of calling 'the good man' a split nominative.\" However, no alternative terminology has been proposed.\nHistory of the controversy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; No other grammatical issue has so divided English speakers since the split infinitive was declared to be a solecism in the 19th century: raise the subject of English usage in any conversation today and it is sure to be mentioned.\nAlthough it is sometimes reported that a prohibition on split infinitives goes back to Renaissance times, and frequently the 18th century scholar Robert Lowth is cited as the originator of the prescriptive rule, such a rule is not to be found in Lowth's writing, and is not known to appear in any text before the 19th century.\nPossibly the earliest comment against split infinitives was by the American John Comly in 1803.\nAn adverb should not be placed between the verb of the infinitive mood and the preposition \"to\", which governs it; as \"Patiently\" to wait\u2014not To \"patiently\" wait.\nAnother early prohibition came from an anonymous American in 1834:\nThe practice of separating the prefix of the infinitive mode from the verb, by the intervention of an adverb, is not unfrequent among uneducated persons\u00a0\u2026 I am not conscious, that any rule has been heretofore given in relation to this point\u00a0\u2026 The practice, however, of not separating the particle from its verb, is so general and uniform among good authors, and the exceptions are so rare, that the rule which I am about to propose will, I believe, prove to be as accurate as most rules, and may be found beneficial to inexperienced writers. It is this :\u2014\"The particle, \"TO\", which comes before the verb in the infinitive mode, must not be separated from it by the intervention of an adverb or any other word or phrase; but the adverb should immediately precede the particle, or immediately follow the verb.\"\nIn 1840, Richard Taylor also condemned split infinitives as a \"disagreeable affectation\", and in 1859, Solomon Barrett Jr., called them \"a common fault.\" However, the issue seems not to have attracted wider public attention until Henry Alford addressed it in his \"Plea for the Queen's English\" in 1864:\nA correspondent states as his own usage, and defends, the insertion of an adverb between the sign of the infinitive mood and the verb. He gives as an instance, \"to scientifically illustrate.\" But surely this is a practice entirely unknown to English speakers and writers. It seems to me, that we ever regard the \"to\" of the infinitive as inseparable from its verb. And, when we have already a choice between two forms of expression, \"scientifically to illustrate\" and \"to illustrate scientifically,\" there seems no good reason for flying in the face of common usage.\nOthers followed, among them Bache, 1869 (\"The \"to\" of the infinitive mood is inseparable from the verb\"); William B. Hodgson, 1889; and Raub, 1897 (\"The sign \"to\" must not be separated from the remaining part of the infinitive by an intervening word\").\nEven as these authorities were condemning the split infinitive, others were endorsing it: Brown, 1851 (saying some grammarians had criticized it and it was less elegant than other adverb placements but sometimes clearer); Hall, 1882; Onions, 1904; Jespersen, 1905; and Fowler and Fowler, 1906. Despite the defence by some grammarians, by the beginning of the 20th century the prohibition was firmly established in the press. In the 1907 edition of \"The King's English\", the Fowler brothers wrote:\nThe 'split' infinitive has taken such hold upon the consciences of journalists that, instead of warning the novice against splitting his infinitives, we must warn him against the curious superstition that the splitting or not splitting makes the difference between a good and a bad writer.\nIn large parts of the school system, the construction was opposed with ruthless vigour. A correspondent to the BBC on a programme about English grammar in 1983 remarked:\nOne reason why the older generation feel so strongly about English grammar is that we were severely punished if we didn't obey the rules! One split infinitive, one whack; two split infinitives, two whacks; and so on.\nAs a result, the debate took on a degree of passion that the bare facts of the matter never warranted. There was frequent skirmishing between the splitters and anti-splitters until the 1960s. George Bernard Shaw wrote letters to newspapers supporting writers who used the split infinitive and Raymond Chandler complained to the editor of \"The Atlantic\" about a proofreader who interfered with Chandler's split infinitives:\nBy the way, would you convey my compliments to the purist who reads your proofs and tell him or her that I write in a sort of broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.\nFollett, in \"Modern American Usage\" (1966) writes: \"The split infinitive has its place in good composition. It should be used when it is expressive and well led up to.\" Fowler (Gowers' revised second edition, 1965) offers the following example of the consequences of refusal to split infinitives: \"The greatest difficulty about assessing the economic achievements of the Soviet Union is that its spokesmen try \"absurdly to exaggerate\" them; in consequence the visitor may tend \"badly to underrate\" them\" (italics added). This question results: \"Has dread of the split infinitive led the writer to attach the adverbs ['absurdly' and 'badly'] to the wrong verbs, and would he not have done better \"to boldly split\" both infinitives, since he cannot put the adverbs after them without spoiling his rhythm\" (italics added)? Bernstein (1985) argues that, although infinitives should not always be split, they should be split where doing so improves the sentence: \"The natural position for a modifier is before the word it modifies. Thus the natural position for an adverb modifying an infinitive should be just\u00a0\u2026 \"after\" the to\" (italics added). Bernstein continues: \"Curme's contention that the split infinitive is often an improvement\u00a0\u2026 cannot be disputed.\" Heffernan and Lincoln, in their modern English composition textbook, agree with the above authors. Some sentences, they write, \"are weakened by\u00a0\u2026 cumbersome splitting,\" but in other sentences \"an infinitive may be split by a one-word modifier that would be awkward in any other position.\"\nPrincipal objections to the split infinitive.\nObjections to the split infinitive fall into three categories, of which only the first is accorded any credence by linguists.\nThe descriptivist objection.\nOne of the earliest arguments against the split infinitive, expressed by an anonymous contributor to the \"New-England Magazine\" in 1834, was based on the impression that it was not an observable feature of English as used by \"good authors.\"\nHenry Alford, in his \"Plea for the Queen's English\" in 1864 went further, stating that use of the \"split infinitive\" was \"a practice entirely unknown to English speakers and writers.\"\nIn principle there is a consensus that language teachers should advise on usage on the basis of what is observed to be current practice in the language. If the early critics of the construction did not observe it to be usual in (the prestige variety of) English as they knew it, their advice was legitimate. However it would be difficult to argue that way today, as the split infinitive has become very common.\nThe argument from the full infinitive.\nA second argument is summed up by Alford's statement \"It seems to me that we ever regard the \"to\" of the infinitive as inseparable from its verb.\"\nThe \"to\" in the infinitive construction, which is found throughout the Germanic languages, is originally a preposition before the dative of a verbal noun, but in the modern languages it is widely regarded as a particle that serves as a marker of the infinitive. In German and Dutch, this marker (\"zu\" and \"te\" respectively) sometimes precedes the infinitive, but is not regarded as part of it. In English, on the other hand, it is traditional to speak of the \"bare infinitive\" without \"to\" and the \"full infinitive\" with it, and to conceive of \"to\" as part of the full infinitive. (In the sentence \"I had my daughter clean her room,\" \"clean\" is a bare infinitive; in \"I told my daughter to clean her room,\" \"to clean\" is a full infinitive.) Possibly this is because the absence of an \"inflected\" infinitive form made it useful to include the particle in the citation form of the verb, and in some nominal constructions in which other Germanic languages would omit it (e.g., \"to know her is to love her\"). The concept of a two-word infinitive can reinforce an intuitive sense that the two words belong together. For instance, the rhetorician John Duncan Quackenbos said, \"\"To have\" is as much one thing, and as inseparable by modifiers, as the original form \"habban\", or the Latin \"habere\".\" The usage writer John Opdycke based a similar argument on the closest French, German, and Latin translations.\nHowever, the two-part infinitive is disputed, and some linguists argue that the infinitive in English is a single-word verb form, which may or may not be preceded by the particle \"to\". Some modern generative analysts classify \"to\" as a \"peculiar\" auxiliary verb; other analysts, as the infinitival subordinator.\nBesides, even if the concept of the full infinitive is accepted, it does not necessarily follow that any two words that belong together grammatically need be adjacent to each other. They usually are, but counter-examples are easily found, such as an adverb splitting a two-word finite verb (\"will not do\", \"has not done\").\nThe argument from classical languages.\nA frequent argument of those who tolerate split infinitives is that the split-infinitive prohibition is based solely on a misguided comparison with Latin. However, the argument from the classical languages may be a straw man argument, as the most important critics of the split infinitive never used it. Although many writers who support the split infinitive suggest that this argument motivated the early opponents of the construction, there is little primary source evidence for this; indeed, Richard Bailey has noted that, despite the lack of evidence, this theory has simply become \"part of the folklore of linguistics\".\nAn infinitive in Latin or Greek is never used with a marker equivalent to English \"to\", and a Latin infinitive cannot be split. The argument would be that the construction should be avoided because it is not found in the classics. The claim that those who dislike split infinitives are applying rules of Latin grammar to English is asserted by many authorities who accept the split infinitive. One example is in the \"American Heritage Book of English Usage\": \"The only rationale for condemning the construction is based on a false analogy with Latin.\" The assertion is also made in the \"Oxford Guide to Plain English\", \"Compact Oxford English Dictionary\", and Steven Pinker's \"The Language Instinct\", among others.\nThe argument implies an adherence to the humanist idea of the greater purity of the classics, which, particularly in Renaissance times, led people to regard as inferior aspects of English that differed from Latin. Today no linguist would accept an argument that judges the usage of one language by the grammar of another. Besides, if Latin has no equivalent of the marker \"to\", it provides no model for the question of where to put it, and therefore supports neither splitting nor not-splitting. As Richard Lederer puts it: \"there is no precedent in these languages for condemning the split infinitive because in Greek and Latin (and all the other Romance languages) the infinitive is a single word that is impossible to sever.\"\nCurrent views.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"When I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will stay split.\"\n Raymond Chandler, \"1947\".\nPresent style and usage manuals deem simple split infinitives unobjectionable. For example, Curme's \"Grammar of the English Language\" (1931) says that not only is the split infinitive correct, but it \"should be furthered rather than censured, for it makes for clearer expression.\" \"The Columbia Guide to Standard American English\" notes that the split infinitive \"eliminates all possibility of ambiguity,\" in contrast to the \"potential for confusion\" in an unsplit construction. \"Merriam\u2013Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\" says: \"the objection to the split infinitive has never had a rational basis.\" According to Mignon Fogarty, \"today almost everyone agrees that it is OK to split infinitives.\"\nNevertheless, many teachers of English still admonish students against using split infinitives in writing. Because the prohibition has become so widely known, the \"Columbia Guide\" recommends that writers \"follow the conservative path [of avoiding split infinitives when they are not necessary], especially when you're uncertain of your readers' expectations and sensitivities in this matter.\" Likewise, the Oxford dictionaries do not regard the split infinitive as ungrammatical, but on balance consider it likely to produce a weak style and advise against its use for formal correspondence. R. W. Burchfield's revision of Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\" goes farther (quoting Burchfield's own 1981 book \"The Spoken Word\"): \"Avoid splitting infinitives whenever possible, but do not suffer undue remorse if a split infinitive is unavoidable for the completion of a sentence already begun.\" Still more strongly, older editions of \"The Economist\" Style Guide said, \"Happy the man who has never been told that it is wrong to split an infinitive: the ban is pointless. Unfortunately, to see it broken is so annoying to so many people that you should observe it\" (but added \"To never split an infinitive is quite easy.\"). This recommendation, however, is weakened in the 12th edition. After stating that the ban is pointless, \"The Economist Style Guide\" now says \"To see a split infinitive nevertheless annoys some readers, so try to avoid placing a modifier between \"to\" and the verb in an infinitive. But if moving the modifier would ruin the rhythm, change the meaning or even just put the emphasis in the wrong place, splitting the infinitive is the best option.\"\nAs well as varying according to register, tolerance of split infinitives varies according to type. While most authorities accept split infinitives in general, it is not hard to construct an example that any native speaker would reject. Wycliff's Middle English compound split would, if transferred to modern English, be regarded by most people as un-English:\n\"It was most unkind to in this manner treat their brother.\"\nAttempts to define the boundaries of normality are controversial. In 1996, the usage panel of \"The American Heritage Book\" was evenly divided for and against such sentences as,\n\"I expect him to completely and utterly fail\"\nbut more than three-quarters of the panel rejected\n\"We are seeking a plan to gradually, systematically, and economically relieve the burden.\"\nHere the problem appears to be the breaking up of the verbal phrase \"to be seeking a plan to relieve\": a segment of the head verbal phrase is so far removed from the remainder that the listener or reader must expend greater effort to understand the sentence. By contrast, 87 percent of the panel deemed acceptable the multi-word adverbial in\n\"We expect our output to more than double in a year\"\nnot surprisingly perhaps, because here there is no other place to put the words \"more than\" without substantially recasting the sentence.\nA special case is the splitting of an infinitive by the negation in sentences like\n\"I soon learned to not provoke her.\"\n\"I want to not see you any more.\"\nHere traditional idiom, placing the negation before the marker (\"I soon learned not to provoke her\") or with verbs of desire, negating the finite verb (\"I don't want to see you anymore\") remains easy and natural, and is still overwhelmingly the more common construction. Some argue that the two forms have different meanings, while others see a grammatical difference, but most speakers do not make such a distinction.\nAvoiding split infinitives.\nWriters who avoid splitting infinitives either place the splitting element elsewhere in the sentence or reformulate the sentence, perhaps rephrasing it without an infinitive and thus avoiding the issue. However, a sentence such as \"to more than double\" must be completely rewritten to avoid the split infinitive; it is ungrammatical to put the words \"more than\" anywhere else in the sentence. While split infinitives can be avoided, a writer must be careful not to produce an awkward or ambiguous sentence. Fowler (1926) stressed that, if a sentence is to be rewritten to remove a split infinitive, this must be done without compromising the language:\nIt is of no avail merely to fling oneself desperately out of temptation; one must so do it that no traces of the struggle remain; that is, sentences must be thoroughly remodeled instead of having a word lifted from its original place &amp; dumped elsewhere\u00a0\u2026\nIn some cases, moving the adverbial creates an ungrammatical sentence or changes the meaning. R.\u00a0L. Trask uses this example:\n*\"She decided to gradually get rid of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\n\"Gradually\" splits the infinitive \"to get.\" However, if the adverb were moved, where could it go?\n*\"She decided gradually to get rid of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\nThis might imply that the decision was gradual.\n*\"She decided to get rid of the teddy bears she had collected gradually.\"\nThis implies that the collecting process was gradual.\n*\"She decided to get gradually rid of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\nThis sounds awkward, as it splits the phrase \"get rid of.\"\n*\"She decided to get rid gradually of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\nTrask considers this almost as unwieldy as its immediate predecessor.\n*\"Gradually, she decided to get rid of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\nThis might imply that her decision or the fact that she will get rid of her teddy bears is gradual.\nThe sentence can be rewritten to maintain its meaning, however, by using a noun or a different grammatical aspect of the verb, or by avoiding the informal \"get rid\":\n*\"She decided to get rid of her teddy bear collection gradually.\"\n*\"She decided she would gradually get rid of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\n*\"She decided to rid herself gradually of the teddy bears she had collected.\"\nFowler notes that the option of rewriting is always available but questions whether it is always worth the trouble.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In particular, the finite symmetric group formula_1 defined over a finite set of formula_2 symbols consists of the permutations that can be performed on the formula_2 symbols. Since there are formula_4 (formula_2 factorial) such permutation operations, the order (number of elements) of the symmetric group formula_1 is formula_4.\nAlthough symmetric groups can be defined on infinite sets, this article focuses on the finite symmetric groups: their applications, their elements, their conjugacy classes, a finite presentation, their subgroups, their automorphism groups, and their representation theory. For the remainder of this article, \"symmetric group\" will mean a symmetric group on a finite set.\nThe symmetric group is important to diverse areas of mathematics such as Galois theory, invariant theory, the representation theory of Lie groups, and combinatorics. Cayley's theorem states that every group formula_8 is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on (the underlying set of) formula_8.\nDefinition and first properties.\nThe symmetric group on a finite set formula_10 is the group whose elements are all bijective functions from formula_10 to formula_10 and whose group operation is that of function composition. For finite sets, \"permutations\" and \"bijective functions\" refer to the same operation, namely rearrangement. The symmetric group of degree formula_2 is the symmetric group on the set formula_14.\nThe symmetric group on a set formula_10 is denoted in various ways, including formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, and formula_20. If formula_10 is the set formula_22 then the name may be abbreviated to formula_1, formula_24, formula_25, or formula_26.\nSymmetric groups on infinite sets behave quite differently from symmetric groups on finite sets, and are discussed in , , and .\nThe symmetric group on a set of formula_2 elements has order formula_4 (the factorial of formula_2). It is abelian if and only if formula_2 is less than or equal to 2. For formula_31 and formula_32 (the empty set and the singleton set), the symmetric groups are trivial (they have order formula_33). The group S\"n\" is solvable if and only if formula_34. This is an essential part of the proof of the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem that shows that for every formula_35 there are polynomials of degree formula_2 which are not solvable by radicals, that is, the solutions cannot be expressed by performing a finite number of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and root extraction on the polynomial's coefficients.\nApplications.\nThe symmetric group on a set of size \"n\" is the Galois group of the general polynomial of degree \"n\" and plays an important role in Galois theory. In invariant theory, the symmetric group acts on the variables of a multi-variate function, and the functions left invariant are the so-called symmetric functions. In the representation theory of Lie groups, the representation theory of the symmetric group plays a fundamental role through the ideas of Schur functors.\nIn the theory of Coxeter groups, the symmetric group is the Coxeter group of type A\"n\" and occurs as the Weyl group of the general linear group. In combinatorics, the symmetric groups, their elements (permutations), and their representations provide a rich source of problems involving Young tableaux, plactic monoids, and the Bruhat order. Subgroups of symmetric groups are called permutation groups and are widely studied because of their importance in understanding group actions, homogeneous spaces, and automorphism groups of graphs, such as the Higman\u2013Sims group and the Higman\u2013Sims graph.\nGroup properties and special elements.\nThe elements of the symmetric group on a set \"X\" are the permutations of \"X\".\nMultiplication.\nThe group operation in a symmetric group is function composition, denoted by the symbol \u2218 or by simple juxtaposition. The composition \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" of permutations f and g, pronounced \"f of g\", maps any element x of X to \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")). Concretely, let (see permutation for an explanation of notation):\nformula_37\nformula_38\nApplying f after g maps 1 first to 2 and then 2 to itself; 2 to 5 and then to 4; 3 to 4 and then to 5, and so on. So, composing f and g gives\nformula_39\nA cycle of length \"L\" \n \"k\" \u00b7 \"m\", taken to the kth power, will decompose into k cycles of length m: For example, (\"k\" \n 2, \"m\" \n 3),\nformula_40\nVerification of group axioms.\nTo check that the symmetric group on a set \"X\" is indeed a group, it is necessary to verify the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\nTranspositions, sign, and the alternating group.\nA transposition is a permutation which exchanges two elements and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions; for instance, the permutation \"g\" from above can be written as \"g\" = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since \"g\" can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an odd permutation, whereas \"f\" is an even permutation.\nThe representation of a permutation as a product of transpositions is not unique; however, the number of transpositions needed to represent a given permutation is either always even or always odd. There are several short proofs of the invariance of this parity of a permutation.\nThe product of two even permutations is even, the product of two odd permutations is even, and the product of one of each is odd. Thus we can define the sign of a permutation:\nformula_41\nWith this definition,\nformula_42\nis a group homomorphism ({+1, \u22121} is a group under multiplication, where +1 is e, the neutral element). The kernel of this homomorphism, that is, the set of all even permutations, is called the alternating group A\"n\". It is a normal subgroup of S\"n\", and for \"n\" \u2265 2 it has \"n\"!/2 elements. The group S\"n\" is the semidirect product of A\"n\" and any subgroup generated by a single transposition.\nFurthermore, every permutation can be written as a product of \"adjacent transpositions\", that is, transpositions of the form (\"a\" \"a\"+1). For instance, the permutation \"g\" from above can also be written as \"g\" = (4 5)(3 4)(4 5)(1 2)(2 3)(3 4)(4 5). The sorting algorithm bubble sort is an application of this fact. The representation of a permutation as a product of adjacent transpositions is also not unique.\nCycles.\nA cycle of \"length\" \"k\" is a permutation \"f\" for which there exists an element \"x\" in {1, ..., \"n\"} such that \"x\", \"f\"(\"x\"), \"f\"2(\"x\"), ..., \"f\"\"k\"(\"x\") = \"x\" are the only elements moved by \"f\"; it conventionally is required that \"k\" \u2265 2 since with \"k\" = 1 the element \"x\" itself would not be moved either. The permutation \"h\" defined by\n formula_43\nis a cycle of length three, since \"h\"(1) = 4, \"h\"(4) = 3 and \"h\"(3) = 1, leaving 2 and 5 untouched. We denote such a cycle by (1 4 3), but it could equally well be written (4 3 1) or (3 1 4) by starting at a different point. The order of a cycle is equal to its length. Cycles of length two are transpositions. Two cycles are \"disjoint\" if they have disjoint subsets of elements. Disjoint cycles commute: for example, in S6 there is the equality (4 1 3)(2 5 6) = (2 5 6)(4 1 3). Every element of S\"n\" can be written as a product of disjoint cycles; this representation is unique up to the order of the factors, and the freedom present in representing each individual cycle by choosing its starting point.\nCycles admit the following conjugation property with any permutation formula_44, this property is often used to obtain its generators and relations.\nformula_45\nSpecial elements.\nCertain elements of the symmetric group of {1, 2, ..., \"n\"} are of particular interest (these can be generalized to the symmetric group of any finite totally ordered set, but not to that of an unordered set).\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;order reversing permutation is the one given by:\nformula_46\nThis is the unique maximal element with respect to the Bruhat order and the\nlongest element in the symmetric group with respect to generating set consisting of the adjacent transpositions (\"i\" \"i\"+1), 1 \u2264 \"i\" \u2264 \"n\" \u2212 1.\nThis is an involution, and consists of formula_47 (non-adjacent) transpositions\nformula_48\n formula_49\nso it thus has sign:\nformula_50\nwhich is 4-periodic in \"n\".\nIn S2\"n\", the \"perfect shuffle\" is the permutation that splits the set into 2 piles and interleaves them. Its sign is also formula_51\nNote that the reverse on \"n\" elements and perfect shuffle on 2\"n\" elements have the same sign; these are important to the classification of Clifford algebras, which are 8-periodic.\nConjugacy classes.\nThe conjugacy classes of S\"n\" correspond to the cycle types of permutations; that is, two elements of S\"n\" are conjugate in S\"n\" if and only if they consist of the same number of disjoint cycles of the same lengths. For instance, in S5, (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) are conjugate; (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 2)(4 5) are not. A conjugating element of S\"n\" can be constructed in \"two line notation\" by placing the \"cycle notations\" of the two conjugate permutations on top of one another. Continuing the previous example,\nformula_52\nwhich can be written as the product of cycles as (2 4).\nThis permutation then relates (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) via conjugation, that is,\nformula_53\nIt is clear that such a permutation is not unique.\nConjugacy classes of S\"n\" correspond to integer partitions of \"n\": to the partition \"\u03bc\" = (\"\u03bc\"1, \"\u03bc\"2, ..., \"\u03bc\"\"k\") with formula_54 and \"\u03bc\"1 \u2265 \"\u03bc\"2 \u2265 ... \u2265 \"\u03bc\"\"k\", is associated the set \"C\"\"\u03bc\" of permutations with cycles of lengths \"\u03bc\"1, \"\u03bc\"2, ..., \"\u03bc\"\"k\". Then \"C\"\"\u03bc\" is a conjugacy class of S\"n\", whose elements are said to be of cycle-type formula_55.\nLow degree groups.\nThe low-degree symmetric groups have simpler and exceptional structure, and often must be treated separately.\nNote that while A6 and A7 have an exceptional Schur multiplier (a triple cover) and that these extend to triple covers of S6 and S7, these do not correspond to exceptional Schur multipliers of the symmetric group.\nMaps between symmetric groups.\nOther than the trivial map S\"n\" \u2192 C1 \u2245 S0 \u2245 S1 and the sign map S\"n\" \u2192 S2, the most notable homomorphisms between symmetric groups, in order of relative dimension, are:\nThere are also a host of other homomorphisms S\"m\" \u2192 S\"n\" where \"m\" &lt; \"n\".\nRelation with alternating group.\nFor \"n\" \u2265 5, the alternating group A\"n\" is simple, and the induced quotient is the sign map: A\"n\" \u2192 S\"n\" \u2192 S2 which is split by taking a transposition of two elements. Thus S\"n\" is the semidirect product A\"n\" \u22ca S2, and has no other proper normal subgroups, as they would intersect A\"n\" in either the identity (and thus themselves be the identity or a 2-element group, which is not normal), or in A\"n\" (and thus themselves be A\"n\" or S\"n\").\nS\"n\" acts on its subgroup A\"n\" by conjugation, and for \"n\" \u2260 6, S\"n\" is the full automorphism group of A\"n\": Aut(A\"n\") \u2245 S\"n\". Conjugation by even elements are inner automorphisms of A\"n\" while the outer automorphism of A\"n\" of order 2 corresponds to conjugation by an odd element. For \"n\" = 6, there is an exceptional outer automorphism of A\"n\" so S\"n\" is not the full automorphism group of A\"n\".\nConversely, for \"n\" \u2260 6, S\"n\" has no outer automorphisms, and for \"n\" \u2260 2 it has no center, so for \"n\" \u2260 2, 6 it is a complete group, as discussed in automorphism group, below.\nFor \"n\" \u2265 5, S\"n\" is an almost simple group, as it lies between the simple group A\"n\" and its group of automorphisms.\nS\"n\" can be embedded into A\"n\"+2 by appending the transposition (\"n\" + 1, \"n\" + 2) to all odd permutations, while embedding into A\"n\"+1 is impossible for \"n\" &gt; 1.\nGenerators and relations.\nThe symmetric group on n letters is generated by the adjacent transpositions formula_56 that swap i and \"i\" + 1. The collection formula_57 generates S\"n\" subject to the following relations:\nwhere 1 represents the identity permutation. This representation endows the symmetric group with the structure of a Coxeter group (and so also a reflection group).\nOther possible generating sets include the set of transpositions that swap 1 and i for 2 \u2264 \"i\" \u2264 \"n\", or more generally any set of transpositions that forms a connected graph, and a set containing any n-cycle and a 2-cycle of adjacent elements in the n-cycle.\nSubgroup structure.\nA subgroup of a symmetric group is called a permutation group.\nNormal subgroups.\nThe normal subgroups of the finite symmetric groups are well understood. If \"n\" \u2264 2, S\"n\" has at most 2 elements, and so has no nontrivial proper subgroups. The alternating group of degree \"n\" is always a normal subgroup, a proper one for \"n\" \u2265 2 and nontrivial for \"n\" \u2265 3; for \"n\" \u2265 3 it is in fact the only nontrivial proper normal subgroup of S\"n\", except when \"n\" = 4 where there is one additional such normal subgroup, which is isomorphic to the Klein four group.\nThe symmetric group on an infinite set does not have a subgroup of index 2, as Vitali (1915) proved that each permutation can be written as a product of three squares. (Any squared element must belong to the hypothesized subgroup of index 2, hence so must the product of any number of squares.) However it contains the normal subgroup \"S\" of permutations that fix all but finitely many elements, which is generated by transpositions. Those elements of \"S\" that are products of an even number of transpositions form a subgroup of index 2 in \"S\", called the alternating subgroup \"A\". Since \"A\" is even a characteristic subgroup of \"S\", it is also a normal subgroup of the full symmetric group of the infinite set. The groups \"A\" and \"S\" are the only nontrivial proper normal subgroups of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set. This was first proved by Onofri (1929) and independently Schreier\u2013Ulam (1934). For more details see . That result, often called the Schreier-Ulam theorem, is superseded by a stronger one which says that the nontrivial normal subgroups of the symmetric group on a set formula_10 are 1) the even permutations with finite support and 2) for every cardinality formula_63 the group of permutations with support less than formula_64 .\nMaximal subgroups.\nThe maximal subgroups of S\"n\" fall into three classes: the intransitive, the imprimitive, and the primitive. The intransitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form S\"k\" \u00d7 S\"n\"\u2013\"k\" for 1 \u2264 \"k\" &lt; \"n\"/2. The imprimitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form S\"k\" wr S\"n\"/\"k\", where 2 \u2264 \"k\" \u2264 \"n\"/2 is a proper divisor of \"n\" and \"wr\" denotes the wreath product. The primitive maximal subgroups are more difficult to identify, but with the assistance of the O'Nan\u2013Scott theorem and the classification of finite simple groups, gave a fairly satisfactory description of the maximal subgroups of this type, according to .\nSylow subgroups.\nThe Sylow subgroups of the symmetric groups are important examples of \"p\"-groups. They are more easily described in special cases first:\nThe Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"p\" are just the cyclic subgroups generated by \"p\"-cycles. There are (\"p\" \u2212 1)!/(\"p\" \u2212 1) = (\"p\" \u2212 2)! such subgroups simply by counting generators. The normalizer therefore has order \"p\"\u22c5(\"p\" \u2212 1) and is known as a Frobenius group \"F\"\"p\"(\"p\"\u22121) (especially for \"p\" = 5), and is the affine general linear group, AGL(1, \"p\").\nThe Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"p\"2 are the wreath product of two cyclic groups of order \"p\". For instance, when \"p\" = 3, a Sylow 3-subgroup of Sym(9) is generated by \"a\" = (1 4 7)(2 5 8)(3 6 9) and the elements \"x\" = (1 2 3), \"y\" = (4 5 6), \"z\" = (7 8 9), and every element of the Sylow 3-subgroup has the form \"a\"\"i\"\"x\"\"j\"\"y\"\"k\"\"z\"\"l\" for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"p\"\"n\" are sometimes denoted W\"p\"(\"n\"), and using this notation one has that W\"p\"(\"n\" + 1) is the wreath product of W\"p\"(\"n\") and W\"p\"(1).\nIn general, the Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"n\" are a direct product of \"a\"\"i\" copies of W\"p\"(\"i\"), where 0 \u2264 \"ai\" \u2264 \"p\" \u2212 1 and \"n\" = \"a\"0\u00a0+\u00a0\"p\"\u22c5\"a\"1\u00a0+\u00a0...\u00a0+\u00a0\"p\"\"k\"\u22c5\"a\"\"k\" (the base \"p\" expansion of \"n\").\nFor instance, W2(1) =\u00a0C2 and W2(2) =\u00a0D8, the dihedral group of order 8, and so a Sylow 2-subgroup of the symmetric group of degree 7 is generated by { (1,3)(2,4), (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) } and is isomorphic to D8 \u00d7 C2.\nThese calculations are attributed to and described in more detail in . Note however that attributes the result to an 1844 work of Cauchy, and mentions that it is even covered in textbook form in .\nTransitive subgroups.\nA transitive subgroup of S\"n\" is a subgroup whose action on {1,\u00a02,\u00a0...,\u00a0\"n\"} is transitive. For example, the Galois group of a (finite) Galois extension is a transitive subgroup of S\"n\", for some \"n\".\nYoung subgroups.\nA subgroup of S\"n\" that is generated by transpositions is called a \"Young subgroup\". They are all of the form formula_65 where formula_66 is an integer partition of n. These groups may also be characterized as the parabolic subgroups of S\"n\" when it is viewed as a reflection group.\nCayley's theorem.\nCayley's theorem states that every group \"G\" is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group. In particular, one may take a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of \"G\", since every group acts on itself faithfully by (left or right) multiplication.\nCyclic subgroups.\nCyclic groups are those that are generated by a single permutation. When a permutation is represented in cycle notation, the order of the cyclic subgroup that it generates is the least common multiple of the lengths of its cycles. For example, in S5, one cyclic subgroup of order 5 is generated by (13254), whereas the largest cyclic subgroups of S5 are generated by elements like (123)(45) that have one cycle of length 3 and another cycle of length 2. This rules out many groups as possible subgroups of symmetric groups of a given size. For example, S5 has no subgroup of order 15 (a divisor of the order of S5), because the only group of order 15 is the cyclic group. The largest possible order of a cyclic subgroup (equivalently, the largest possible order of an element in S\"n\") is given by Landau's function.\nAutomorphism group.\nFor \"n\" \u2260 2, 6, S\"n\" is a complete group: its center and outer automorphism group are both trivial.\nFor \"n\" = 2, the automorphism group is trivial, but S2 is not trivial: it is isomorphic to C2, which is abelian, and hence the center is the whole group.\nFor \"n\" = 6, it has an outer automorphism of order 2: Out(S6) = C2, and the automorphism group is a semidirect product Aut(S6) = S6 \u22ca C2.\nIn fact, for any set \"X\" of cardinality other than 6, every automorphism of the symmetric group on \"X\" is inner, a result first due to according to .\nHomology.\nThe group homology of S\"n\" is quite regular and stabilizes: the first homology (concretely, the abelianization) is:\nformula_67\nThe first homology group is the abelianization, and corresponds to the sign map S\"n\" \u2192 S2 which is the abelianization for \"n\" \u2265 2; for \"n\" &lt; 2 the symmetric group is trivial. This homology is easily computed as follows: S\"n\" is generated by involutions (2-cycles, which have order 2), so the only non-trivial maps S\"n\" \u2192 C\"p\" are to S2 and all involutions are conjugate, hence map to the same element in the abelianization (since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups). Thus the only possible maps S\"n\" \u2192 S2 \u2245 {\u00b11} send an involution to 1 (the trivial map) or to \u22121 (the sign map). One must also show that the sign map is well-defined, but assuming that, this gives the first homology of S\"n\".\nThe second homology (concretely, the Schur multiplier) is:\nformula_68\nThis was computed in , and corresponds to the double cover of the symmetric group, 2 \u00b7 S\"n\".\nNote that the exceptional low-dimensional homology of the alternating group (formula_69 corresponding to non-trivial abelianization, and formula_70 due to the exceptional 3-fold cover) does not change the homology of the symmetric group; the alternating group phenomena do yield symmetric group phenomena \u2013 the map formula_71 extends to formula_72 and the triple covers of A6 and A7 extend to triple covers of S6 and S7 \u2013 but these are not \"homological\" \u2013 the map formula_73 does not change the abelianization of S4, and the triple covers do not correspond to homology either.\nThe homology \"stabilizes\" in the sense of stable homotopy theory: there is an inclusion map S\"n\" \u2192 S\"n\"+1, and for fixed \"k\", the induced map on homology \"H\"\"k\"(S\"n\") \u2192 \"H\"\"k\"(S\"n\"+1) is an isomorphism for sufficiently high \"n\". This is analogous to the homology of families Lie groups stabilizing.\nThe homology of the infinite symmetric group is computed in , with the cohomology algebra forming a Hopf algebra.\nRepresentation theory.\nThe representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to problems of quantum mechanics for a number of identical particles.\nThe symmetric group S\"n\" has order \"n\"!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of\u00a0\"n\". Therefore, according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of\u00a0\"n\". Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representation by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of \"n\" or equivalently Young diagrams of size\u00a0\"n\".\nEach such irreducible representation can be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram.\nOver other fields the situation can become much more complicated. If the field \"K\" has characteristic equal to zero or greater than \"n\" then by Maschke's theorem the group algebra \"K\"S\"n\" is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).\nHowever, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called \"Specht modules\", and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.\nThe determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SMPP is able to carry short messages including EMS, voicemail notifications, Cell Broadcasts, WAP messages including WAP Push messages (used to deliver MMS notifications), USSD messages and others. Because of its versatility and support for non-GSM SMS protocols, like UMTS, IS-95 (CDMA), CDMA2000, ANSI-136 (TDMA) and iDEN, SMPP is the most commonly used protocol for short message exchange outside SS7 networks.\nHistory.\nSMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) was originally designed by Aldiscon, a small Irish company that was later acquired by Logica (since 2016, after a number of changes Mavenir). The protocol was originally created by a developer, Ian J Chambers, to test the functionality of the SMSC without using SS7 test equipment to submit messages.\nIn 1995 the ETSI included the SMPP protocol into the technical report TR 03.39.\nIn 1999 Logica formally handed over SMPP to the SMPP Developers Forum, later renamed as The SMS Forum.\nThe SMS Forum disbanded in 2007, with this announcement: \"The SMS Forum, a non-profit organization with a mission to develop, foster and promote SMS (short message service) to the benefit of the global wireless industry will disband by July 27, 2007.\" As part of the original handover terms, SMPP ownership returned to Mavenir.\nOperation.\nSMPP uses the client\u2013server model of operation, despite \"peer-to-peer\" in the name. The Short Message Service Center (SMSC) usually acts as a server, awaiting connections from ESMEs. When SMPP is used for SMS peering, the sending MC usually acts as a client.\nThe protocol is based on pairs of request/response PDUs (protocol data units, or packets) exchanged over OSI layer 4 (TCP session or X.25 SVC3) connections. The well-known port assigned by the IANA for SMPP when operating over TCP is 2775, but multiple arbitrary port numbers are often used in messaging environments.\nBefore exchanging any messages, a bind command must be sent and acknowledged. The bind command determines in which direction will be possible to send messages; bind_transmitter only allows client to submit messages to the server, bind_receiver means that the client will only receive the messages, and bind_transceiver (introduced in SMPP 3.4) allows message transfer in both directions. In the bind command the ESME identifies itself using system_id, system_type and password; the address_range field designed to contain ESME address is usually left empty. The bind command contains interface_version parameter to specify which version of SMPP protocol will be used.\nMessage exchange may be synchronous, where each peer waits for a response for each PDU being sent, or asynchronous, where multiple requests can be issued without waiting and acknowledged in a skew order by the other peer; the number of unacknowledged requests is called a \"window\"; for the best performance both communicating sides must be configured with the same window size.\nVersions.\nThe SMPP standard has evolved during the time. The most commonly used versions of SMPP are:\nThe applicable version is passed in the interface_version parameter of a bind command.\nPDU format (after version 3.4).\nThe SMPP PDUs are binary encoded for efficiency. They start with a header which may be followed by a body:\nPDU header.\nEach PDU starts with a header. The header consists of 4 fields, each of length of 4 octets:\nAll numeric fields in SMPP use the big endian order, which means that the first octet is the Most Significant Byte (MSB).\nExample.\nThis is an example of the binary encoding of a 60-octet \"submit_sm\" PDU. The data is shown in Hex octet values as a single dump and followed by a header and body break-down of that PDU.\nThis is best compared with the definition of the submit_sm PDU from the SMPP specification in order to understand how the encoding matches the field by field definition.\nThe value break-downs are shown with decimal in parentheses and Hex values after that. Where you see one or several hex octets appended, this is because the given field size uses 1 or more octets encoding.\nAgain, reading the definition of the submit_sm PDU from the spec will make all this clearer.\nPDU header.\n 'command_length', (60) ... 00 00 00 3C\n 'command_id', (4) ... 00 00 00 04\n 'command_status', (0) ... 00 00 00 00\n 'sequence_number', (5) ... 00 00 00 05\nPDU body.\n 'service_type', () ... 00\n 'source_addr_ton', (2) ... 02\n 'source_addr_npi', (8) ... 08\n 'source_addr', (555) ... 35 35 35 00\n 'dest_addr_ton', (1) ... 01\n 'dest_addr_npi', (1) ... 01\n 'dest_addr', (555555555) ... 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 00\n 'esm_class', (0) ... 00\n 'protocol_id', (0) ... 00\n 'priority_flag', (0) ... 00\n 'schedule_delivery_time', (0) ... 00\n 'validity_period', (0) ... 00\n 'registered_delivery', (0) ... 00\n 'replace_if_present_flag', (0) ... 00\n 'data_coding', (3) ... 03\n 'sm_default_msg_id', (0) ... 00\n 'sm_length', (15) ... 0F\n 'short_message', (Hello Wikipedia) ... 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 69 6B 69 70 65 64 69 61\nNote that the text in the short_message field must match the data_coding. When the data_coding is 8 (UCS2), the text must be in UCS-2BE (or its extension, UTF-16BE). When the data_coding indicates a 7-bit encoding, each septet is stored in a separate octet in the short_message field (with the most significant bit set to 0). SMPP 3.3 data_coding exactly copied TP-DCS values of GSM 03.38, which make it suitable only for GSM 7-bit default alphabet, UCS2 or binary messages; SMPP 3.4 introduced a new list of data_coding values:\nThe meaning of the codice_5 or codice_6 is the same as in SMPP 3.3. Other values in the range 1-15 are reserved in SMPP 3.3. Unfortunately, unlike SMPP 3.3, where data_coding=0 was unambiguously GSM 7-bit default alphabet, for SMPP 3.4 and higher the GSM 7-bit default alphabet is missing in this list, and codice_7 may differ for various Short message service centers\u2014it may be ISO-8859-1, ASCII, GSM 7-bit default alphabet, UTF-8 or even configurable per ESME. When using codice_7, both sides (ESME and SMSC) must be sure they consider it the same encoding. Otherwise it is better not to use codice_7. It may be tricky to use the GSM 7-bit default alphabet, some Short message service centers requires codice_7, others e.g. codice_11.\nQuirks.\nDespite its wide acceptance, the SMPP has a number of problematic features:\nNo standardized data_coding value for GSM default alphabet.\nAlthough codice_12 value in SMPP 3.3 are based on the GSM 03.38, since SMPP 3.4 there is not a standardized codice_12 value for the GSM default alphabet (GSM 03.38). It is further ambiguous whether the 7-bit characters are packed, as in GSM, allowing sending 160 characters in 140 octets, or whether each 7-bit character is encoded as an entire octet (with the high bit set to zero, as with ASCII).\nNo standardized meaning of data_coding=0.\nAccording to SMPP 3.4 and 5.0 the value codice_7 means \u2033SMSC Default Alphabet\u2033. Which encoding it really is, depends on the type of the SMSC and its configuration.\nUnclear support for Shift-JIS encoding.\nOne of the encodings in CDMA standard C.R1001 is Shift-JIS used for Japanese. SMPP 3.4 and 5.0 specifies three encodings for Japanese (JIS, ISO-2022-JP and Extended Kanji JIS), but none of them is identical with CDMA MSG_ENCODING 00101. It seems that the Pictogram encoding (data_coding=9) is used to carry the messages in Shift-JIS in SMPP.\nIncompatibility of submit_sm_resp between SMPP versions.\nWhen a submit_sm fails, the SMSC returns a codice_14 with non-zero value of command_status and \u2033empty\u2033 message_id.\nFor the best compatibility, any SMPP implementation should accept both variants of negative codice_14 regardless of the version of SMPP standard used for the communication.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The original intention of error scenarios was that no body would be returned in the PDU response. This was the standard behavior exhibited on all Aldiscon/Logica SMSC and also in most of the other vendors. When SMPP 3.4 was being taken on by the WAP forum, several clarifications were requested on whether a body should be included with NACKed response and measures were taken to clarify this in several places in the specification including the codice_26 section and also in the codice_27 section. What should have been done was to add the clarification that we eventually added in V5.0.. that bodies are not supposed to be included in error responses. Some vendors have been very silly in their implementations including bodies on rejected codice_28 responses but not on codice_27 responses etc. The recommendation I would make to vendors.. as suggested above.. accept both variants. But its also wise to allow yourself issue NACKed codice_14 and codice_31 PDUs with and without an empty body. In the case of these two PDUs, that empty body will look like a single NULL octet at the end of the stream. The reason you may need this ability to include what I call dummy bodies with NACKed requests is that the other side of the equation may be unable or unwilling to change their implementation to tolerate the missing body. (I worked on three versions of SMPP specification in Aldiscon/Logica and designed the ESME solution for Openmind Networks)\u2014\u200a\nMessage ID in SMPP 3.3 SMSC Delivery Receipts.\nThe only way to pass delivery receipts in SMPP 3.3 is to put information in a text form to the codice_32 field; however, the format of the text is described in Appendix B of SMPP 3.4, although SMPP 3.4 may (and should) use codice_33 and codice_34 TLVs for the purpose. While SMPP 3.3 states that Message ID is a C-Octet String (Hex) of up to 8 characters (plus terminating '\\0'), the SMPP 3.4 specification states that the id field in the Delivery Receipt Format is a C-Octet String (Decimal) of up to 10 characters. This splits SMPP implementations to 2 groups:\nThe SMPP 3.4 specification does however state that the delivery receipt format is SMSC vendor specific, and therefore the format included in the specification is merely one possibility. As noted above, when using SMPP 3.4 codice_33 and codice_34 TLVs should be used to convey the outcome of a message.\nExtensibility, compatibility and interoperability.\nSince introduction of TLV parameters in version 3.4, the SMPP may be regarded an extensible protocol. In order to achieve the highest possible degree of compatibility and interoperability any implementation should apply the Internet robustness principle: \u2033Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept\u2033. It should use a minimal set of features which are necessary to accomplish a task. And if the goal is communication and not quibbling, each implementation should overcome minor nonconformities with standard:\nInformation applicable to one version of SMPP can often be found in another version of SMPP, for example with the case of SMPP 3.4 describing the only mechanism of delivery receipts in SMPP 3.3 described above.\nSecurity.\nThe SMPP protocol is designed on a clear-text binary protocol which needs to be considered if using for potentially sensitive information such as one-time passwords via SMS. There are, however, implementations of SMPP over SSL/TLS if required.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are often where most of a metropolitan area's jobs are located, although some suburbs are predominantly residential. They can either be denser or less densely populated than a large city, and they can have a higher or lower rate of detached single family homes than the city as well. Suburbs can have their own political or legal jurisdictions, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom, where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities. In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central city or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \"suburb\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \"neighborhood\" in the U.S. Due in part to historical trends such as white flight, some suburbs in the United States have a higher population and higher incomes than their nearby inner cities.\nIn some countries, including India, China, Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl. In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough. In the United States, regions beyond the suburbs are known as \"exurban areas\" or exurbs; exurbs have less population density than suburbs, but still more than rural areas. Suburbs and exurbs are sometimes linked to the nearby city economically, particularly by commuters.\nSuburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting. Most suburbs are less dense than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area, and residents routinely commute to other suburbs and city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transit; including industrial suburbs, planned communities, and satellite cities. Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.\nEtymology and usage.\nThe English word is derived from the Old French , which is in turn derived from the Latin , formed from (meaning \"under\" or \"below\") and (\"city\"). The first recorded use of the term in English according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" appears in Middle English c.\u20091350 in the manuscript of the Midlands Prose Psalter, in which the form is used.\nAustralia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\nIn Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, suburban areas (in the wider sense noted in the lead paragraph) have become formalized as geographic subdivisions of a city and are used by postal services in addressing. In rural areas in both countries, their equivalents are called localities (see suburbs and localities). The terms \"inner suburb\" and \"outer suburb\" are used to differentiate between the higher-density areas in proximity to the city center (which would not be referred to as 'suburbs' in most other countries), and the lower-density suburbs on the outskirts of the urban area. The term 'middle suburbs' is also used. Inner suburbs, such as Te Aro in Wellington, Eden Terrace in Auckland, Prahran in Melbourne and Ultimo in Sydney, are usually characterized by higher density apartment housing and greater integration between commercial and residential areas.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States and Canada, \"suburb\" can refer either to an outlying residential area of a city or town or to a separate municipality or unincorporated area outside a town or city.\nAlthough a majority of Americans regard themselves as residents of suburban communities, the federal government of the United States has no formal definition for what constitutes a \"suburb\" in the United States, leaving its precise meaning disputed.\nIn Canada, the term may also be used in the British sense, especially as cities annex formerly outlying areas.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the term \"suburb\" simply refers to a residential area outside the city centre, regardless of administrative boundaries. Suburbs, in this sense, can range from areas that seem more like residential areas of a city proper to areas separated by open countryside from the city centre. In large cities such as London and Leeds, many suburbs are formerly separate towns and villages that have been absorbed during a city's expansion, such as Ealing, Bromley, and Guiseley. In Ireland, this can be seen in the Dublin suburban areas of Swords, Blanchardstown, and Tallaght.\nHistory.\nThe history of suburbia is part of the study of urban history, which focuses on the origins, growth, diverse typologies, culture, and politics of suburbs, as well as on the gendered and family-oriented nature of suburban space. Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Some suburbs are based on a society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom want to own their own house. Meanwhile, other suburbs instituted \"explicitly racist\" policies to deter people deemed as \"other\", a practice most common in the United States in contrast to other countries around the world. Mary Corbin Sies argues that it is necessary to examine how \"suburb\" is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest appearance of suburbs coincided with the spread of the first urban settlements. Large walled towns tended to be the focus around which smaller villages grew up in a symbiotic relationship with the market town. The word \"suburbani\" was first employed by the Roman statesman Cicero in reference to the large villas and estates built by the wealthy patricians of Rome on the city's outskirts.\nTowards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, until 190 AD, when Dong Zhuo razed the city, the capital Luoyang was mainly occupied by the emperor and important officials; the city's people mostly lived in small cities right outside Luoyang, which were suburbs in all but name.\nAs populations grew during the Early Modern Period in Europe, towns swelled with a steady influx of people from the countryside. In some places, nearby settlements were swallowed up as the main city expanded. The peripheral areas on the outskirts of the city were generally inhabited by the very poorest.\nOrigins of the modern suburb.\nDue to the rapid migration of the rural poor to the industrializing cities of England in the late 18th century, a trend in the opposite direction began to develop, whereby newly rich members of the middle classes began to purchase estates and villas on the outskirts of London. This trend accelerated through the 19th century, especially in cities like London and Birmingham that were growing rapidly, and the first suburban districts sprung up around downtowns to accommodate those who wanted to escape the squalid conditions of the industrial towns. Initially, such growth came along rail lines in the form of ribbon developments, as suburban residents could commute via train to downtown for work. In Australia, where Melbourne would soon become the second-largest city in the British Empire,\nthe distinctively Australasian suburb, with its loosely aggregated quarter-acre sections, developed in the 1850s and eventually became a component of the Australian Dream.\nToward the end of the century, with the development of public transit systems such as the underground railways, trams and buses, it became possible for the majority of a city's population to reside outside the city and to commute into the center for work.\nBy the mid-19th century, the first major suburban areas were springing up around London as the city (then the largest in the world) became more overcrowded and unsanitary. A major catalyst for suburban growth was the opening of the Metropolitan Railway in the 1860s. The line later joined the capital's financial heart in the City to what were to become the suburbs of Middlesex. The line reached Harrow in 1880.\nUnlike other railway companies, which were required to dispose of surplus land, London's Met was allowed to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use. Initially, the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee, and, from the 1880s, the land was developed and sold to domestic buyers in places like Willesden Park Estate, Cecil Park, near Pinner and at Wembley Park.\nIn 1912 it was suggested that a specially formed company should take over from the Surplus Lands Committee and develop suburban estates near the railway. However, World War I (1914\u20131918) delayed these plans until 1919, when, with the expectation of a postwar housing-boom, Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) formed. MRCE went on to develop estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth and to found places such as Harrow Garden Village.\nThe Met's marketing department coined the term Metro-land in 1915 when the \"Guide to the Extension Line\" became the \"Metro-land\" guide, priced at 1d. This promoted the land served by the Met for the walker, visitor and later the house-hunter. Published annually until 1932 (the last full year of independence for the Met), the guide extolled the benefits of \"The good air of the Chilterns\", using language such as \"Each lover of Metroland may well have his own favorite wood beech and coppice\u00a0\u2014 all tremulous green loveliness in Spring and russet and gold in October\". The dream as promoted involved a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway-service to central London. By 1915 people from across London had flocked to live the new suburban dream in large newly built areas across north-west London.\nInterwar suburban expansion in England.\nSuburbanization in the interwar period was heavily influenced by the garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard and the creation of the first garden suburbs at the turn of the 20th century. The first garden suburb was developed through the efforts of social reformer Henrietta Barnett and her husband; inspired by Ebenezer Howard and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by Letchworth garden city), as well as the desire to protect part of Hampstead Heath from development, they established trusts in 1904 which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green and created the Hampstead Garden Suburb. The suburb attracted the talents of architects including Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens, and it ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres.\nDuring World War I, the Tudor Walters Committee was commissioned to make recommendations for the post war reconstruction and housebuilding. In part, this was a response to the shocking lack of fitness amongst many recruits during World War One, attributed to poor living conditions; a belief summed up in a housing poster of the period \"you cannot expect to get an A1 population out of C3 homes\" \u2013 referring to military fitness classifications of the period.\nThe committee's report of 1917 was taken up by the government, which passed the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919, also known as the Addison Act after Christopher Addison, the then Minister for Housing. The Act allowed for the building of large new housing estates in the suburbs after the First World War, and marked the start of a long 20th century tradition of state-owned housing, which would later evolve into council estates.\nThe Report also legislated on the required, minimum standards necessary for further suburban construction; this included regulation on the maximum housing density and their arrangement, and it even made recommendations on the ideal number of bedrooms and other rooms per house. Although the semi-detached house was first designed by the Shaws (a father and son architectural partnership) in the 19th century, it was during the suburban housing boom of the interwar period that the design first proliferated as a suburban icon, being preferred by middle-class home owners to the smaller terraced houses. The design of many of these houses, highly characteristic of the era, was heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement, taking influence from Tudor Revival, chalet style, and even ship design.\nWithin just a decade suburbs dramatically increased in size. Harrow Weald went from just 1,500 to over 10,000 while Pinner jumped from 3,000 to over 20,000. During the 1930s, over 4 million new suburban houses were built, the 'suburban revolution' had made England the most heavily suburbanized country in the world, by a considerable margin.\nNorth America.\nNew York City and Boston spawned the first major suburbs. The streetcar lines in Boston and the rail lines in Manhattan made daily commutes possible. No metropolitan area in the world was as well served by railroad commuter lines at the turn of the twentieth century as New York, and it was the rail lines to Westchester from the Grand Central Terminal commuter hub that enabled its development. Westchester's true importance in the history of American suburbanization derives from the upper-middle class development of villages including Scarsdale, New Rochelle and Rye serving thousands of businessmen and executives from Manhattan.\nPostwar suburban expansion.\nThe suburban population in North America exploded during the post-World War II economic expansion. Returning veterans wishing to start a settled life moved in masses to the suburbs. Levittown developed as a major prototype of mass-produced housing. Due to the influx of people in these suburban areas, the amount of shopping centers began to increase as suburban America took shape. These malls helped supply goods and services to the growing urban population. Shopping for different goods and services in one central location without having to travel to multiple locations, helped to keep shopping centers a component of these newly designed suburbs which were booming in population. The television helped contribute to the rise of shopping centers by allowing for additional advertisement through the medium in addition to creating a desire among consumers to buy products that are shown being used in suburban life on various television programs. Another factor that led to the rise of these shopping centers was the building of many highways. The Highway Act of 1956 helped to fund the building of 64,000 kilometers across the nation by having 26 billion dollars on hand, which helped to link many more to these shopping centers with ease. These newly built shopping centers, which were often large buildings full of multiple stores, and services, were being used for more than shopping, but as a place of leisure and a meeting point for those who lived within suburban America at this time. These centers thrived offering goods and services to the growing populations in suburban America. In 1957, 940 shopping centers were built and this number more than doubled by 1960 to keep up with the demand of these densely populated areas.\nHousing.\nVery little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War II, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new non-farm housing units were constructed from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 constructed annually from 1946 through 1955. The G.I. Bill guaranteed low-cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. \nWith 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization\u2014for example, standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and stoves allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, while local public officials raced to build schools. The most famous development was Levittown, in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, a fireplace, a gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.\nAt the same time, African Americans were rapidly moving north and west for better jobs and educational opportunities than were available to them in the segregated South. Their arrival in Northern and Western cities en masse, in addition to being followed by race riots in several large cities such as Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., further stimulated white suburban migration. The growth of the suburbs was facilitated by the development of zoning laws, redlining and numerous innovations in transport. Redlining and other discriminatory measures built into federal housing policy furthered the racial segregation of postwar America\u2013for example, by refusing to insure mortgages in and near African-American neighborhoods. The government's efforts were primarily designed to provide housing to White middle-class and lower-middle-class families. African Americans and other people of color largely remained concentrated within decaying cores of urban poverty creating a phenomenon known as white flight.\nAfter World War II, the availability of FHA loans stimulated a housing boom in American suburbs. In the older cities of the northeast U.S., streetcar suburbs originally developed along train or trolley lines that could shuttle workers into and out of city centers where the jobs were located. This practice gave rise to the term \"bedroom community\", meaning that most daytime business activity took place in the city, with the working population leaving the city at night for the purpose of going home to sleep.\nEconomic growth in the United States encouraged the suburbanization of American cities that required massive investments for the new infrastructure and homes. Consumer patterns were also shifting at this time, as purchasing power was becoming stronger and more accessible to a wider range of families. Suburban houses also brought about needs for products that were not needed in urban neighborhoods, such as lawnmowers and automobiles. During this time commercial shopping malls were being developed near suburbs to satisfy consumers' needs and their car\u2013dependent lifestyle.\nZoning laws also contributed to the location of residential areas outside of the city center by creating wide areas or \"zones\" where only residential buildings were permitted. These suburban residences are built on larger lots of land than in the central city. For example, the lot size for a residence in Chicago is usually deep, while the width can vary from wide for a row house to wide for a large stand\u2013alone house. In the suburbs, where stand\u2013alone houses are the rule, lots may be wide by deep, as in the Chicago suburb of Naperville. Manufacturing and commercial buildings were segregated in other areas of the city.\nAlongside suburbanization, many companies began locating their offices and other facilities in the outer areas of the cities, which resulted in the increased density of older suburbs and the growth of lower density suburbs even further from city centers. An alternative strategy is the deliberate design of \"new towns\" and the protection of green belts around cities. Some social reformers attempted to combine the best of both concepts in the garden city movement.\nIn the U.S., 1950 was the first year that more people lived in suburbs than elsewhere. In the U.S., the development of the skyscraper and the sharp inflation of downtown real estate prices also led to downtowns being more fully dedicated to businesses, thus pushing residents outside the city center.\nWorldwide.\nWhile suburbs are often associated with the middle classes, in many parts of the developed world, suburbs can be economically distressed areas, inhabited by higher proportions of recent immigrants, with higher delinquency rates and social problems, reminiscent of the inner cities of the U.S. Examples include the \"banlieues\" of France, or the concrete suburbs of Sweden, even if the suburbs of these countries also include middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods that often consist of single-family houses.\nAfrica.\nFollowing the growth of the middle class due to African industrialization, the development of middle class suburbs has boomed since the beginning of the 1990s, particularly in cities such as Cairo, Nairobi, Johannesburg, and Lagos.\nIn an illustrative case of South Africa, RDP housing has been built. In much of Soweto, many houses are American in appearance, but are smaller, and often consist of a kitchen and living room, two or three bedrooms, and a bathroom. However, there are more affluent neighborhoods, more comparable to American suburbs, particularly east of the FNB (\"Soccer City\") Stadium and south of the city in areas like Eikenhof, where the \"Eye of Africa\" planned community exists. This master-planned community is nearly indistinguishable from the most amenity-rich resort-style American suburbs in Florida, Arizona, and California, complete with a golf course, resort pool, equestrian facility, 24-hour staffed gates, gym, and BMX track, as well as several tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts.\nIn Cape Town, there is a distinct European style originating from European influence during the mid-1600s when the Dutch settled the Cape. Houses like these are called Cape Dutch Houses and can be found in the affluent suburbs of Constantia and Bishopscourt.\nAustralia.\nLarge cities like Sydney and Melbourne had streetcar suburbs in the tram era. With the automobile, the Australian usage came about as outer areas were quickly surrounded in fast-growing cities, but retained the appellation \"suburb\"; the term was eventually applied to neighborhoods in the original core as well. In Australia, Sydney's urban sprawl has occurred predominantly in the Western Suburbs. The locality of Olympic Park was designated an official suburb in 2009.\nBangladesh.\nBangladesh has multiple suburbs, Uttara &amp; Ashulia to name a few. However, most suburbs in Dhaka are different from the ones in Europe &amp; Americas. Most suburbs in Bangladesh are filled with high-rise buildings, paddy fields, and farms, and are designed more like rural villages.\nCanada.\nCanada is an urbanized nation where over 80% of the population lives in urban areas (loosely defined), and roughly two-thirds live in one of Canada's 41 census metropolitan areas (CMAs) with a population of over 100,000. However, of this metropolitan population, in 2001 nearly half lived in low-density neighborhoods, with only one in five living in a typical \"urban\" neighborhood. The percentage living in low-density neighborhoods varied from a high of nearly two-thirds of Calgary CMA residents (67%), to a low of about one-third of Montr\u00e9al CMA residents (34%).\nLarge cities in Canada acquired streetcar suburbs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Modern Canadian suburbs tend to be less automobile-centric than those in the United States, and public transit use is encouraged but can be notably unused. Throughout Canada, there are comprehensive plans in place to curb sprawl.\nPopulation and income growth in Canadian suburbs had tended to outpace growth in core urban or rural areas, but in many areas, this trend has now reversed. The suburban population increased by 87% between 1981 and 2001, well ahead of urban growth. The majority of recent population growth in Canada's three largest metropolitan areas (Greater Toronto, Greater Montr\u00e9al, and Greater Vancouver) has occurred in non-core municipalities. This trend is also beginning to take effect in Vancouver, and to a lesser extent, Montr\u00e9al. In certain cities, particularly Edmonton and Calgary, suburban growth takes place within the city boundaries as opposed to in bedroom communities. This is due to annexation and a large geographic footprint within the city borders.\nCalgary is unusual among Canadian cities because it has developed as a unicity \u2013 it has annexed most of its surrounding towns and large amounts of undeveloped land around the city. As a result, most of the communities that Calgarians refer to as \"suburbs\" are actually inside the city limits. In the 2016 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,239,220, whereas the Calgary Metropolitan Area had a population of 1,392,609, indicating the vast majority of people in the Calgary CMA lived within the city limits. The perceived low population density of Calgary largely results from its many internal suburbs and the large amount of undeveloped land within the city. The city actually has a policy of densifying its new developments.\nChina.\nIn China, the term suburb is new, although suburbs are already being constructed rapidly. Chinese suburbs mostly consist of rows upon rows of apartment blocks and condos that end abruptly into the countryside. Also new town developments are extremely common. Single family suburban homes tend to be similar to their Western equivalents; although primarily outside Beijing and Shanghai, also mimic Spanish and Italian architecture.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, however, suburbs are mostly government-planned new towns containing numerous public housing estates. However, other new towns also contain private housing estates and low density developments for the upper classes.\nItaly.\nIn the illustrative case of Rome, Italy, in the 1920s and 1930s, suburbs were intentionally created \"ex novo\" to give lower classes a destination, in consideration of the actual and foreseen massive arrival of poor people from other areas of the country. Many critics have seen in this development pattern (which was circularly distributed in every direction) also a quick solution to a problem of public order (keeping the unwelcome poorest classes together with the criminals, in this way better controlled, comfortably remote from the elegant \"official\" town). On the other hand, the expected huge expansion of the town soon effectively covered the distance from the central town, and now those suburbs are completely engulfed by the main territory of the town. Other newer suburbs (called exurbs) were created at a further distance from them.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, the construction of suburbs has boomed since the end of World War II and many cities are experiencing the urban sprawl effect.\nLatin America.\nIn Mexico, suburbs are generally similar to their United States counterparts. Houses are made in many different architectural styles which may be of European, American and International architecture and which vary in size. Suburbs can be found in Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, and most major cities. Lomas de Chapultepec is an example of an affluent suburb, although it is located inside the city and by no means is today a suburb in the strict sense of the word. In other countries, the situation is similar to that of Mexico, with many suburbs being built, most notably in Peru and Chile, which have experienced a boom in the construction of suburbs since the late 1970s and early 1980s. As the growth of middle-class and upper-class suburbs increased, low-class squatter areas have increased, most notably \"lost cities\" in Mexico, campamentos in Chile, barriadas in Peru, villa miserias in Argentina, asentamientos in Guatemala and favelas of Brazil.\nBrazilian affluent suburbs are generally denser, more vertical and mixed in use inner suburbs. They concentrate infrastructure, investment and attention from the municipal seat and the best offer of mass transit. True sprawling towards neighboring municipalities is typically empoverished \u2013 (\"the periphery\", in the sense of it dealing with spatial marginalization) \u2013, with a very noticeable example being the rail suburbs of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 the North Zone, the Baixada Fluminense, the part of the West Zone associated with SuperVia's Ramal de Santa Cruz. These, in comparison with the inner suburbs, often prove to be remote, violent food deserts with inadequate sewer structure coverage, saturated mass transit, more precarious running water, electricity and communication services, and lack of urban planning and landscaping, while also not necessarily qualifying as actual or slums. They often are former agricultural land or wild areas settled through squatting; suburbs grew and expanded due to the mass rural exodus during the years of the military dictatorship. This is particularly true of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bras\u00edlia, which grew with migration from more distant and impoverished parts of the country and deal with overpopulation as a result.\nMalaysia.\nIn Malaysia, suburbs are common especially in Klang Valley, the largest conurbation in the country. These suburbs also serve as major housing areas and commuter towns. Terraced houses, semi-detached houses and shophouses are common concepts in suburban planning. In certain places such as Klang, Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya, suburbs form the core. The latter one has been turned into a satellite city of Kuala Lumpur. Suburbs are also evident in other major conurbations in the country such as Penang Island (Butterworth, Bukit Mertajam), Johor Bahru (Skudai, Pasir Gudang), Ipoh (Simpang Pulai), Kota Melaka (Ayer Keroh), Kuching (Petra Jaya) and Alor Setar (Anak Bukit).\nRussia.\nIn Russia, until recently, the term suburb refers to high-rise residential apartments which usually consist of two bedrooms, one bathroom, a kitchen and a living room. However, since the beginning of the 21st century in Russia there has been a \"cottage boom\", as a result of which a huge number of cottage villages appeared in almost every city of the country (including Moscow), no different from the suburbs in western countries.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom suburbs are located between the exurbs and inner cities of a metropolitan area. The growth in the use of trains, and later cars and highways, increased the ease with which workers could have a job in the city while commuting in from the suburbs. In the United Kingdom, as mentioned above, railways stimulated the first mass exodus to the suburbs. The Metropolitan Railway, for example, was active in building and promoting its own housing estates in the north-west of London, consisting mostly of detached houses on large plots, which it then marketed as \"Metro-land\". In the UK, the government is seeking to impose minimum densities on newly approved housing schemes in parts of South East England. The goal is to \"build sustainable communities\" rather than housing estates. However, commercial concerns tend to delay the opening of services until a large number of residents have occupied the new neighborhood.\nUnited States.\nMany white people moved to the suburbs during the white flight.\nIn the 19th century, horse-drawn and later electric trolleys enabled the creation of streetcar suburbs, which expanded the area in which city commuters could live. These are typically medium-density neighborhoods contiguous with the core urban area, built for pedestrian access to the streetcar lines.\nWith widespread adoption of the automobile progressing from the 1920s to the 1950s, and especially with the introduction of the Interstate Highway System, new suburbs were designed around car transport instead of pedestrians. Over time, many suburban areas, especially those not within the political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city as an asset. In some cases, suburbanites saw self-government as a means to keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions. In some cities such as Miami, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with a small portion of the metro area's population and land area.\nMesa, Arizona, and Virginia Beach, Virginia, the two most populous suburbs in the U.S., are actually more populous than many core cities, including Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Cleveland, Tampa, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and others. Virginia Beach is now the most populous city in Virginia, having long since exceeded the population of its neighboring primary city, Norfolk. While Virginia Beach has slowly been taking on the characteristics of an urban city, it will not likely achieve the population density and urban characteristics of Norfolk. A second suburban city in Virginia, Chesapeake, has also exceeded the population of adjacent Norfolk. With only a few large commercial areas and no definitive downtown area, Chesapeake is primarily residential in nature with vast rural areas remaining within the city limits.\nCleveland, Ohio, is typical of many American central cities; its municipal borders have changed little since 1922, even though the Cleveland urbanized area has grown many times over. Several layers of suburban municipalities now surround cities like Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York City, San Francisco, Sacramento, Atlanta, Miami, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Norfolk, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C..\nSuburbs in the United States have a prevalence of usually detached single-family homes.\nThey are characterized by:\nBy 2010, suburbs increasingly gained people in racial minority groups, as many members of minority groups gained better access to education and sought more favorable living conditions compared to inner city areas.\nConversely, many white Americans also moved back to city centers. Nearly all major city downtowns (such as Downtown Miami, Downtown Detroit, Downtown Philadelphia, Downtown Roanoke, or Downtown Los Angeles) are experiencing a renewal, with large population growth, residential apartment construction, and increased social, cultural, and infrastructural investments, as have suburban neighborhoods close to city centers. Better public transit, proximity to work and cultural attractions, and frustration with suburban life and gridlock have attracted young Americans to the city centers.\nThe Hispanic and Asian population is increasing in the suburbs.\nTraffic flows.\nSuburbs typically have longer travel times to work than traditional neighborhoods. Only the traffic \"within\" the short streets themselves is less. This is due to three factors: almost-mandatory automobile ownership due to poor suburban bus systems and nearly-nonexistent rail systems, longer travel distances and the hierarchy system, which is less efficient at distributing traffic than the traditional grid of streets.\nIn the suburban system, most trips from one component to another component requires that cars enter a collector road, no matter how short or long the distance is. This is compounded by the hierarchy of streets, where entire neighborhoods and subdivisions are dependent on one or two collector roads. Because all traffic is forced onto these roads, they are often heavy with traffic all day. If a traffic crash occurs on a collector road, or if road construction inhibits the flow, then the entire road system may be rendered useless until the blockage is cleared. The traditional \"grown\" grid, in turn, allows for a larger number of choices and alternate routes.\nSuburban systems of the sprawl type are also quite inefficient for cyclists or pedestrians, as the direct route is usually not available for them either. This encourages car trips even for distances as low as several hundreds of yards or meters (which may have become up to several miles or kilometers due to the road network). Improved sprawl systems, though retaining the car detours, possess cycle paths and footpaths connecting across the arms of the sprawl system, allowing a more direct route while still keeping the cars out of the residential and side streets.\nMore commonly, central cities seek ways to tax nonresidents working downtown \u2013 known as commuter taxes \u2013 as property tax bases dwindle. Taken together, these two groups of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities may begin to target more aggressively, particularly if they're struggling. According to struggling cities, this will help bring in a substantial revenue for the city which is a great way to tax the people who make the most use of the highways and repairs.\nToday more companies settle down in suburbs because of low property costs.\nCriticism.\nCriticism of suburbia dates back to the boom of suburban development in the 1950s and critiques a culture of aspirational homeownership. In the English-speaking world, this discourse is prominent in the United States and Australia being prevalent both in popular culture and academia.\nIn popular culture.\nSuburbs and suburban living have been the subject for a wide variety of films, books, television shows and songs.\nFrench songs like \"La Zone\" by Fr\u00e9hel (1933), \"Aux quatre coins de la banlieue\" by Damia (1936), \"Ma banlieue\" by Reda Caire (1937), or \"Banlieue\" by Robert Lamoureux (1953), evoke the suburbs of Paris explicitly since the 1930s. Those singers give a sunny festive, almost bucolic, image of the suburbs, yet still few urbanized. During the fifties and the sixties, French singer-songwriter L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9 evokes in his songs popular and proletarian suburbs of Paris, to oppose them to the city, considered by comparison as a bourgeois and conservative place.\nFrench cinema was although soon interested in urban changes in the suburbs, with such movies as \"Mon oncle\" by Jacques Tati (1958), \"L'Amour existe\" by Maurice Pialat (1961) or \"Two or Three Things I Know About Her\" by Jean-Luc Godard (1967).\nIn his one-act opera \"Trouble in Tahiti\" (1952), Leonard Bernstein skewers American suburbia, which produces misery instead of happiness.\nThe American photojournalist Bill Owens documented the culture of suburbia in the 1970s, most notably in his book \"Suburbia\". The 1962 song \"Little Boxes\" by Malvina Reynolds lampoons the development of suburbia and its perceived bourgeois and conformist values, while the 1982 song \"Subdivisions\" by the Canadian band Rush also discusses suburbia, as does Rockin' the Suburbs by Ben Folds. The 2010 album \"The Suburbs\" by the Canadian-based alternative band Arcade Fire dealt with aspects of growing up in suburbia, suggesting aimlessness, apathy and endless rushing are ingrained into the suburban culture and mentality. \"Suburb The Musical,\" was written by Robert S. Cohen and David Javerbaum. \"Over the Hedge\" is a syndicated comic strip written and drawn by Michael Fry and T. Lewis. It tells the story of a raccoon, turtle, a squirrel, and their friends who come to terms with their woodlands being taken over by suburbia, trying to survive the increasing flow of humanity and technology while becoming enticed by it at the same time. A film adaptation of \"Over the Hedge\" was produced in 2006.\nBritish television series such as \"The Good Life\", \"Butterflies\" and \"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\" have depicted suburbia as well-manicured but relentlessly boring, and its residents as either overly conforming or prone to going stir crazy. In contrast, U.S. shows such as \"Knots Landing\", \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Weeds\" portray the suburbs as concealing darker secrets behind a fa\u00e7ade of manicured lawns, friendly people, and beautifully kept houses. Films such as \"The 'Burbs\" and \"Disturbia\" have brought this theme to the cinema.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The category originated from Japanese children's magazines at the turn of the 20th century and gained significant popularity by the 1920s. \nThe editorial focus of manga is primarily on action, adventure, and the fighting of monsters or other clearly defined forces of evil. Though action narratives dominate the said category, there is deep editorial diversity and a significant number of genres and sub-genres within manga, especially compared to other comic cultures outside of Japan, including comedy, crime, romance, slice of life, and sports.\nTerminology and etymology.\nThe Japanese word , meaning \"young boy\", historically referred to juveniles in a general sense and was used by the Japanese publishing industry until the end of the 19th century to designate publications aimed at children and young people. The word shifted to its current usage of referring specifically to media aimed at adolescent boys, beginning with the practice of segmenting periodicals, especially manga magazines, by sex and age-specific target groups, which was established at the beginning of the 20th century and accelerated starting in the 1960s. This segmentation system is now openly used as a categorization system by manga publishers and extends into works that are adapted from manga, such as anime.\nmanga.\n manga refers to manga aimed at an audience of adolescent boys, with the primary target audience alternately defined as 10 to 19 years old and as 12 to 21 years old. It is the most popular category in the Japanese market of the four primary demographic categories of manga (, , , and ).\nThe actual readership of manga, as is the case for all demographic categories of manga, extends significantly beyond this adolescent male target group to include all ages and genders. For example, a 2006 survey of female manga readers found that \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" was the most popular manga magazine among this demographic, placing ahead of magazines that specifically target a female readership. The target group orientation of manga is particularly evident in the non-manga content of manga magazines, which include advertising and articles on topics tailored to the interests of young males, such as video games. Non-manga content often corresponds to a major manga series in a given magazine, for example, advertisements for a video game adaptation of the series or articles about an animated film adaptation of the series.\nHistory.\nPre-war and wartime era.\nChildren's magazines with sex-segregated readerships have existed in Japan since the early 1900s. While early youth magazines were ostensibly unisex \u2013 \"Sh\u014dnen Sekai\" was the first youth magazine in Japan in 1895, targeting a readership of both boys and girls \u2013 in practice, the editorial content of these publications largely concerned topics that were thought to be of interest to boys. This provoked the emergence of first exclusively (girls) magazines in 1902, and magazines subsequently began to exclusively target a male audience. \nInitially, these magazines did not publish manga. The first magazine to do so was \"Sh\u014dnen Pakku\", first published in 1907. This was followed by \"Sh\u014dnen Club\" in 1914 and later \"Y\u014dnen Club\". Among the most successful and influential manga series in these early magazines were \"Norakuro\" by Suih\u014d Tagawa, which follows the life of an anthropomorphic dog soldier, and \"Tank Tankuro\" by Gajo Sakamoto, about a robot-like character who can change his appearance.\n magazines enjoyed significant popularity during the 1920s and 1930s, with \"Y\u014dnen Club\" selling over 950,000 copies. During the Second Sino-Japanese War and Second World War, magazine sales declined and publications were used increasingly for wartime propaganda purposes. The manga content in these publications was reduced, and the series that remained typically focused on patriotic and militaristic themes, such as stories about samurai. In other stories, robots were depicted as fighting in the war against the Allied forces, as analogous to western superhero comics that depicted superheroes fighting the Axis powers during this same period.\nPost-war era.\nDuring the post-war occupation of Japan, the Japanese publishing industry was rebuilt under initially strict guidelines. Stories focused on war, combat, and most competitive sports were banned with the aim of discouraging belligerence and hindering the use of manga for pro-Imperial propaganda. Manga developed during this period under the influence of artist Osamu Tezuka, with series such as \"Astro Boy\" and \"Kimba the White Lion\". Tezuka was inspired by American cartoons, and pioneered the so-called \"story manga\": long-running manga series with a cinematic style and continuity across multiple chapters, contrasting what had previously been a medium defined by one-off comic strips. Science fiction stories about robots, space travel, and heroic space-faring adventures enjoyed popularity during this period; many sci-fi stories took themes and concepts from war comics and re-imagined them with pacifist ideals, such as \"Tetsujin 28-go\" by Mitsuteru Yokoyama.\nOne of the first new manga magazines of the post-war period was \"Manga Sh\u014dnen\", which launched in 1947 and published works by Tezuka, Leiji Matsumoto, and Sh\u014dtar\u014d Ishinomori. As post-war censorship codes were repealed and Japan entered a period of significant economic development in the 1950s, sales of manga and the number of manga magazines increased significantly, and and manga came to further establish themselves as distinct categories. The first works of sports manga also emerged from manga during this time; notable early works include \"Igaguri-kun\" by Eiichi Fukui as the first manga series in the genre, and \"Ashita no Joe\" by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba, which became one of the most commercially successful works in the genre. \n1959 saw the launch of \"Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" and \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine\", the first weekly manga magazines. Other weeklies, such as \"Sh\u014dnen Champion\", \"Sh\u014dnen King\", and \"Sh\u014dnen Ace\", emerged in the 1960s. \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" was first published in 1968, and would establish itself as the best-selling manga magazine across demographic categories, a position it holds to this day. Many of the most popular and commercially successful series originated in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\", including \"Dragon Ball\" by Akira Toriyama, \"Naruto\" by Masashi Kishimoto, \"Bleach\" by Tite Kubo, \"One Piece\" by Eiichiro Oda, and \"Slam Dunk\" by Takehiko Inoue.\nModern era.\nmanga became formalized as a category of manga aimed at an older male audience in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and many artists associated with the realist movement migrated to manga. The demise of the (rental manga) market led many artists to move into magazine publishing, including manga, bringing their distinct themes and style with them. As a result, manga came to deal with more serious and political themes, and saw an increase in depictions of violent and explicit subjects, as well as an increase in profanity. Significant artists of this era include Shigeru Mizuki, creator of the horror series \"GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d\"; and George Akiyama, whose manga series \"Ashura\" depicts cannibalism, child abuse, and mass murder. Although this provoked a public backlash, it did not lead to the decline for the industry: series with anarchic, offensive humor became popular in and manga alike, with \"Crayon Shin-Chan\" by Yoshito Usui becoming an internationally famous example of this phenomenon. Manga artist Go Nagai originated the sexually charged genre with \"Harenchi Gakuen\", which was serialized in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\".\nThe stylistic and thematic differences between and began to narrow considerably beginning in the 1980s, with widespread exchange of stylistic devices and themes. For example, the characteristic large eyes of manga became common in manga to convey the emotions of characters, and female characters have enjoyed greater prominence as both supporting and primary characters in manga. Other graphic storytelling techniques that originated in manga, such as montages of multiple panels, were imported into manga and have become common stylistic devices. \nIn the 1980s, combat-focused \"battle manga\" stories became popular, with \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Fist of the North Star\" emerging as representative works of this development. Manga critic Jason Thompson credits the success of \"Dragon Ball\", first published in 1984, as originating a trend that has persisted to contemporary manga of favoring cartoonish art styles over the more mature art styles of titles such as \"City Hunter\" and \"Fist of the North Star\".\nFemale manga artists also began to enjoy increasing critical and commercial success as manga creators. As a result of the combined influence of and the rise of female artists, romance emerged as a subgenre of manga, especially romantic comedy. When manga began to emerge in the Western world in the early 1990s, the category was so dominant in these new markets that it came to shape the image of manga as a whole. While made gains in popularity by the 2000s, remains the most popular category of manga, both in Japan and internationally.\nCharacteristics.\nThemes and genres.\nThis thematic orientation of manga is readily inferred from the formal values or slogans that manga magazines assign themselves: for example, \"friendship, perseverance, and victory\" for \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\", and \"courage, friendship and fighting spirit\" for \"CoroCoro Comic\". The editorial focus of manga is primarily on action, adventure, and the fighting of monsters or other forces of evil. Action stories are so dominant in manga that some manga and non-manga works are occasionally designated as not because of their ostensible target group, but because of their content focus on action and adventure. Though action narratives dominate the category, there is deep editorial diversity and a significant number of genres and subgenres within manga, especially when compared to other comic cultures outside of Japan. This includes but is not limited to comedy, crime, romance, slice of life, and stories about activities such as sports and the lives of different types of working professionals.\nThe action genre is itself is expressed through a variety of subgenres, from historical and contemporary drama to science fiction and fantasy. war fiction has been alternately jingoistic or critical of militarism and violence, with \"Barefoot Gen\" by Keiji Nakazawa as a notable example of the latter. Samurai appeared frequently as idealized role models for boy readers in early , analogous to representations of cowboys in western comics; samurai stories shifted to comedy and sportsmanship in the post-war period, before returning to themes of idealized themes of good versus evil. Though manga typically attempts to convey a message of peace, the category has been criticized by individuals such as director Hayao Miyazaki for promoting overly simple good/evil dichotomies.\nNarrative conventions.\nA protagonist is often characterized by contradictory qualities: short-tempered and cool, mischievous and rebellious, serious and cynical, clumsy and infallible, or who appears as a good-for-nothing but possesses hidden abilities. In some cases, the contradiction takes on a literal form in the form of , where the hero is able to switch between two personas with different appearances and personalities; examples of this device include \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" by Kazuki Takahashi and \"Samurai Deeper Kyo\" by Akimine Kamijyo. Transformation abilities are often linked with bonds to a spirit, monster or robot. A major narrative device in manga is rivalry between the protagonist and his opponent, with a fight or a quest often appearing as a central element; \"Dragon Ball\" is among the most popular and commercially successful examples of this archetypal story.\nTypically, a protagonist is an outsider, or in some way disadvantaged compared to others, but who through training, perseverance, and willpower eventually succeeds against all odds. Plots typically follow the basic structure of the hero's journey, with much of the story focused on the protagonist's training and transformation into a hero, and on characters who earn their status as heroes through effort and tenacity rather than by virtue of birth or assignment. For long-running series, the hero's journey repeats itself; as a new story arc begins, the enemy becomes more powerful and the danger to be overcome becomes greater. In addition to these external conflicts, a protagonist often also faces internal conflicts, typically focused around maturity and growing older. In contrast to manga, which often focuses on the thoughts and interior monologue of the hero, typically advances plot through dialogue and action. Happy endings are common in manga, but are not obligatory,\nVisual style.\nComics theorist Neil Cohn regards the art style of as generally \"edgier\" than that of manga, and notes how most regular manga readers are able to easily distinguish between and based on visual appearance alone. Visually, a protagonist often possesses what manga critic Jason Thompson describes as \"insanely spiky hair\" that distinguishes the protagonist's silhouette from that of other characters. The eyes of characters in the post-war period are significantly smaller than those of characters in manga; large eyes are used in manga to better convey the emotions of the characters, an aspect which has historically been given less focus in manga. A common visual device in action scenes is to depict the contours of figures with rough, coarse motion lines to give the appearance of movement.\nRole of women.\nHistorically, the protagonists of manga were almost exclusively men and boys; women and girls appeared primarily in supporting roles as sisters, mothers, or girlfriends, if at all. This was especially true of stories that developed out of manga beginning in the 1970s, with \"The Abashiri Family\" by Go Nagai as one of the earliest representative works of this development, as well as an early example of a manga with a female protagonist. \nSince the 1980s, women and girls have played a more active role in manga, fighting alongside male characters and not merely as passive support. \"Dr. Slump\" by Akira Toriyama was an early representative work of this development, with its mischievous child protagonist Arale Norimaki being among the first manga to depict this type of archetypal character as a girl rather than a boy. The 1980s also saw female manga artists rise to greater prominence: notably horror manga artist Kei Kusunoki, and Rumiko Takahashi with her romantic comedies \"Urusei Yatsura\" and \"Ranma \u00bd\".\nEspecially in series that are aimed at an older audience, female characters are often presented in a manner that is attractive to the male target audience as (literally \"beautiful young girls\"). They exist as objects of romantic or sexual desire not merely for the male characters, but also for the ostensibly heterosexual male reader as a form of fan service. While these objectifying tropes have persisted in manga, women have also developed more active roles in these fan service-oriented stories. A common romantic comedy trope in manga since the 1980s has been to pair a weak male protagonist with a strong female love interest who is not only the target of his romantic and sexual desire, but also his good friend and confidante. \nIn the harem genre, which originated from manga, a male protagonist is surrounded by several female characters who desire him, and who are often more confident and assertive than he is; examples include \"Negima! Magister Negi Magi\" by Ken Akamatsu and \"Hanaukyo Maid Team\" by Morishige. In other cases, the male protagonist is unsuccessful in his attempts to woo the female character, or the story is focused around the originally na\u00efve and infantile male protagonist maturing and learning how to develop healthy relationships with women.\nFor certain series, a female readership who read in or interpret subtextual homoerotic relationships between canonically heterosexual male characters constitute a significant proportion of the series' audience; this is especially true of series featuring male characters who are (literally \"beautiful boys\"), or who are perceived as such by readers. This reading of manga is expressed in the form of fan works such as (self-published amateur manga) and the boys' love (BL) genre of manga and anime, which includes both original and derivative works. Manga scholar Yukari Fujimoto notes in her analysis of the female readership of the titles \"One Piece\", \"Naruto\", and \"The Prince of Tennis\" that homoerotic interpretations of manga tend to be most common among titles that do not include prominent female characters that a female readership is able to identify with.\nMagazines.\n manga is traditionally published in dedicated manga magazines that specifically target an audience of . At the industry's peak in the mid-1990s, there were 23 total magazines, which collectively sold 662 million copies in 1995. The total manga magazine market that year included 265 magazines, with a total of 1.595 billion copies sold.\nA manga magazine is typically several hundred pages long, and contains over a dozen series or one-shots. The largest Japanese magazines in terms of circulation are \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" by Shueisha, \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine\" by Kodansha, and \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" by Shogakukan; these publishers are also the largest publishers of manga generally. The fourth largest magazine, albeit by a significant margin, is \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion\" by Akita Shoten, which was among the most popular manga magazines in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe magazines \"CoroCoro Comic\" and the now-defunct \"Comic BomBom\" technically belong to the (children's manga) demographic, but are often counted as magazines as they target an audience of school-aged boys. A list of the top magazines by circulation as of 2015 are listed below:\nReferences.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a small mountain town, with its main industry being salt mining and a nearby spa.\nDuring the Bosnian War in 1995, Srebrenica was the site of genocidal killing of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, which was subsequently designated as an act of genocide by the ICTY and the International Court of Justice. Perpetrated by units of the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska under Ratko Mladi\u0107, though the Serb paramilitary unit Scorpions also participated.\nAs of 2013, the town has a population of 2,607 inhabitants, while the municipality has 13,409 inhabitants. Before the war, the municipality's Bosniak population was 27,542 (75.12%) and the Serb population was 8,315 (22.68%). As of 2013, the equivalent figures were 7,248 Bosniaks (54.05%) and 6,028 Serbs (44.95%).\nEtymology.\nThe town's name (Srebrenica) () means \"silver mine\", the same meaning of its old Latin name Argentaria. In other languages it is known as: \"Srebrenitza\" in German, \"Srebrenic\u00eb/a\" in Albanian, \"Srebrenitsa\" in Turkish, \"Szrebrenica\" in Hungarian and \"Srebreni\u021ba\" in Romanian.\nHistory.\nRoman era.\nIllyrians inhabited Srebrenica and mined the silver in a nearby mine. Silver was also the main reason behind the Roman invasion of the area.\nDuring the Roman times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in Salona in the southwest and Sirmium in the northeast using the Via Argentaria. The current settlement of Srebrenica was also known by the Romans as Argentaria.\nA Roman tombstone was excavated near Sase Monastery.\nMiddle Ages.\nAn early Christian church dated to the 6th century was discovered in Srebrenica.\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the Banate of Bosnia, and, subsequently, the Bosnian Kingdom. The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region. (Compare modern srebro \"silver\".) By that time, a large number of merchants of the Republic of Ragusa were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). During the 14th century, many German miners moved into the area. There were often armed conflicts about Srebrenica because of its mines. According to Czech historian Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek, from 1411 to 1463, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Hungarian one time, Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian Podrinje and Usora were part of the Serbian Despotate prior to the Ottoman conquest.\nOttoman period.\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The Franciscan church of St. Nicholas was converted into the White Mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.\nThe area of Osat was liberated for a short time during the First Serbian Uprising (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from Crvica. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participating in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked Kara\u0111or\u0111e for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\nAustro-Hungarian period.\nThe town came under Austro-Hungarian rule in 1878, when the Congress of Berlin approved the occupation of the Bosnia Vilayet, which later in 1908 became a condominium under the joint control of Austria and Hungary. The natural mineral water springs Crni Guber (\"Black Guber\") developed into an important part of the local economy. The Bohemian company Mattoni established a distribution infrastructure to tap and export the water named \"Guber-Quelle\" (\"Guber Spring\") throughout the monarchy and abroad. The construction of a spa was recommended. Modern infrastructure such as administration, electricity, roads, schools, telephone, healthcare, a postal service and other things were introduced.\nAlthough the Austrian rulers tried to stop the spread of nationalism and favoured a multi-religious and multi-cultural makeup with religious tolerance under their hegemony, Serbian nationalism was viewed with suspicion and hostility, since it demanded a unification of Bosnia with Serbia. As modern education raised the levels of general literacy, ideas spread through the advent of newspapers and publications. The region became increasingly restless as nationalism spread to all groups.\nDuring the First World War, one of the region's main battle areas was in Eastern Bosnia and the Drina, from where the units of Austria-Hungary advanced towards the Kingdom of Serbia. In late summer 1914 Srebrenica was taken over by Serbian volunteers under Kosta Todorovi\u0107 but later retaken by Austro-Hungarian units. Following World War I, Bosnia was incorporated into the South Slav kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later was renamed Yugoslavia.\nSecond World War.\nDuring the Second World War there were many atrocities committed by the Chetniks and Ustashas. Partisans fought Chetniks and Ustashe during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\nYugoslav period.\nTourism gained importance during the communist Yugoslav period and wellness spa and taking to the waters became an important part of the local economy. The \"Banja Guber\" was constructed for that purpose. Up to the 1990s over 90,000 overnight stays were recorded and an annual income of about three million dollars generated.\nBosnian War.\nThe town of Srebrenica came to global prominence as a result of events during the Bosnian War (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River Drina separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska. The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and besieged by Serb forces. On 16 April 1993, the United Nations declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak enclave a UN safe area, to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which did not get permission to use force from the UN, which they needed to defend the local population.\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of \u017depa and Gora\u017ede were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the Army of Republika Srpska led by general Ratko Mladi\u0107. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town, boys below 12 years of age, and men above 65 were transferred by bus to Tuzla. The Srebrenica massacre was the deadliest massacre in Europe since World War II, being the only incident in Europe to have been recognized as a genocide since the Holocaust.\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to have been a crime of genocide (confirmed on appeal in 2004). This finding was upheld in 2007 by the International Court of Justice. The decision of the ICTY was followed by an admission to and an apology for the massacre by the Republika Srpska government.\nUnder the 1995 Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian War, Srebrenica was included in the territory assigned to Bosnian Serb control as the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although guaranteed under the provisions of the Dayton Agreement, the return of survivors was repeatedly obstructed. In 2007, verbal and physical attacks on returning refugees continued to be reported in the region around Srebrenica.\nFate of Bosnian Muslim villages.\nIn 1992, Bosniak villages around Srebrenica were under constant attacks by Serb forces. The Bosnian Institute in the United Kingdom has published a list of 296 villages destroyed by Serb forces around Srebrenica three years before the genocide and in the first three months of war (April\u2013June 1992):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;More than three years before the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, Bosnian Serb nationalists \u2013 with the logistical, moral and financial support of Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) \u2013 destroyed 296 predominantly Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) villages in the region around Srebrenica, forcibly uprooting some 70,000 Bosniaks from their homes and systematically massacring at least 3,166 Bosniaks (documented deaths) including many women, children and the elderly.\nAccording to the Naser Ori\u0107 trial judgement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Between April 1992 and March 1993, Srebrenica town and the villages in the area held by Bosnian Muslims were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.\"\nPost-war period.\nThe town has a religious makeup of roughly half Muslim and half Orthodox. Most of the town's 23 mosques that were destroyed were reconstructed with donations and aid, also from abroad.\nUnemployment rates are high since the economy was destroyed and reconstruction progresses slowly, as in many parts of the country. There are plans to revive the mineral water and spa business again. The reconstruction of the \"Banja Guber\" was scheduled for 2019 but experienced delays.\nPolitics.\nIn 2007, Srebrenica's municipal assembly adopted a resolution demanding independence from the Republika Srpska entity (although not from Bosnia's sovereignty); the Serb members of the assembly did not vote on the resolution. In the 2016 elections Mladen Gruji\u010di\u0107, a Bosnian Serb and native of the town of Srebrenica, was elected as mayor.\nThe municipality emblem was developed during the Yugoslav period and depicts a red and white stylised \"S\" with a depiction of the mineral water spring in the lower middle and a tree in the upper middle. The spring underscores the historical importance to the town's economy and the tree the nature and forests of the region.\nLocal communities.\nThe municipality (\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 or \"op\u0161tina\") is further subdivided into the following local communities (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 or \"mjesne zajednice\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nBefore 1992, there was a metal factory in the town, and lead, zinc, and gold mines nearby. The town's name (Srebrenica) means \"silver mine\", the same meaning of its old Latin name \"Argentaria\".\nBefore the war, Srebrenica also had a big spa and the town prospered from wellness tourism from the Crni Guber (\"Black Guber\") ferruginous spring water and other springs. Nowadays, Srebrenica has some tourism but a lot less developed than before the war. Currently, a pension, motel and a hostel are operating in the town.\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the 1980s he worked in local government in Ballarat and then as executive director of the Ballarat Education Centre. While in these positions he twice (1985 and 1988) contested the seat of Ballarat North in the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the Labor Party.\nIn 1989 Bracks was appointed statewide manager of Victorian state government employment programs, under the Labor government of John Cain Jr. He then became an adviser to both Cain and Cain's successor as Premier, Joan Kirner. Here he witnessed from the inside the collapse of the Labor government following the economic and budgetary crisis which began in 1988. This experience gave Bracks a very conservative and cautious view of economic management in government.\nFollowing the defeat of the Kirner government by the Liberal leader Jeff Kennett in late 1992, Bracks became executive director of the Victorian Printing Industry Training Board. Kirner resigned from parliament in 1994, and Bracks was elected to Kirner's seat of Williamstown in the western suburbs of Melbourne. Bracks and his wife Terry lived in Williamstown. They have three children, one of whom is model Nick Bracks.\nState politics.\nEarly days.\nBracks was immediately elected to Labor's front bench, as Shadow Minister for Employment, Industrial Relations and Tourism. In 1996, after Labor under John Brumby was again defeated, he became Shadow Treasurer. In March 1999, when it became apparent that Labor was headed for another defeat under Brumby's leadership, Brumby resigned and Bracks was elected Opposition Leader.\nFirst term as Premier.\nPolitical observers were almost unanimous that Bracks had no chance of defeating Liberal premier Jeff Kennett at the September 1999 election: polls gave Kennett a 60% popularity rating. Bracks and his senior colleagues (particularly Brumby, who comes from Bendigo) campaigned heavily in regional areas, accusing Kennett of ignoring regional communities. In response, voters in regional areas deserted the Kennett government. On election night, much to its own surprise, Labor increased its seat count from 29 to 41, with the Liberals and their National Party allies retaining 43, and three falling to rural independents. With the Coalition one seat short of government, the election was to be decided in Frankston East, when the death of incumbent Peter McLellan forced a supplementary election. That supplementary election was won by Labor on a large swing, resulting in a hung parliament. The independents then threw their support to Labor, allowing Bracks to form government by one seat.\nThe Coalition briefly considered forcing Bracks to demonstrate that he had support on the floor of the Assembly. However, two of the independents, Russell Savage and Susan Davies, felt Kennett had given them short shrift in the previous legislature, and would not have even considered supporting him. In any event, this gambit was brought undone when Kennett announced his retirement from politics on 20 October. Bracks then advised the Governor, Sir James Gobbo, that he could form a government, which was duly sworn in later that day. Bracks became the first Catholic Labor Premier of Victoria since 1932.\nFormer leader Brumby, appointed Treasurer, was regarded as a major part of the government's success. He and the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, John Thwaites, and the Attorney-General, Rob Hulls, were regarded as the key ministers in the Bracks government.\nFollowing a pre-1999 election commitment to consider the feasibility of introducing fast rail services to regional centres, in 2000 the government approved funding for the Regional Fast Rail project, upgrading rail lines between Melbourne and Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Traralgon. However, in 2006 the Victorian Auditor General noted that in spite of $750\u00a0million spent, \"We found that the delivery of more frequent fast rail services in the Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo corridors by the agreed dates was not achieved. In total, the journey time outcomes will be more modest than we would have expected with only a minority of travellers likely to benefit from significant journey time improvements. These outcomes occur because giving some passengers full express services means bypassing often large numbers of passengers at intermediate stations along the corridors.\"\nOn 14 December 2000, Steve Bracks released a document outlining his government's intent to introduce the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001.\nThe major criticism of Bracks's first government was that their insistence on consultation stood in the way of effective, proactive government. Bracks, according to critics, achieved little, and lost the excitement of constant change that was characteristic of the Kennett years. The talents of some of the more junior ministers in the government were also questioned. Nevertheless, Bracks got through his first term without major mishaps, and his popularity undiminished.\nSecond term as Premier.\nLabor won the 2002 election in a landslide, taking 62 seats out of 88 in the Legislative Assembly\u2014only the third time in Victoria's history that a Labor government had been reelected. In another first, Labor won a slim but clear majority in the Legislative Council as well. While this was the greatest victory Labor had ever had in a Victorian state election, it brought with it considerable risks. With majorities in both houses Bracks could no longer cite his weak parliamentary position as an excuse for inaction.\nOn 28 August 2002, Bracks, in conjunction with his then New South Wales counterpart, Bob Carr, opened the Mowamba aqueduct between Jindabyne and Dalgety, to divert 38 gigalitres of water a year from Lake Eucumbene to the Snowy and Murray rivers. The ten-year plan cost A$300\u00a0million with Victoria and NSW splitting the costs. Melbourne Water has stated that within 50 years there will be 20 per cent less water going into Victorian reservoirs.\nIn May 2003 Bracks broke an election promise and announced that the proposed Scoresby Freeway in Melbourne's eastern suburbs would be a tollway rather than a freeway, as promised at the 2002 elections. As well as risking a loss of support in marginal seats in eastern Melbourne, this decision brought about a strong response from the Howard Federal government, which cut off federal funding for the project on the grounds that the Bracks government had reneged on the terms of the federal-state funding agreement. The decision seems to have been on the recommendation of Brumby, who was concerned with the state's budgetary position. Also opposing the decision was the Federal Labor Opposition, which feared anti-Labor reaction at the 2004 Federal election. The then Opposition Leader Mark Latham described a meeting with Bracks and federal shadow ministers, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Bracks has broken his promise, hoping the odium will wear off before the next State election. But we're copping the fall-out electorally... Bracks, however, was unmoved, even when Faulkner put it right on him... Sat there like a statue, that silly grin on his face.\"\u2014\u200a\nThis backflip, while seen by many as an opportunity for the Liberals to make ground, saw the then leader of the Liberals, Robert Doyle, adopt a much-criticised policy of half tolls, which was later overturned by his successor, Ted Baillieu.\nIn 2005, following extensive independent studies it was found that cattle had created extensive damage to the high country National Park and their continued presence in the Park was incompatible with the values of National Parks. Bracks backed the environment and his environment minister, John Thwaites and announced that Victoria would follow the NSW example and cattlemen would be banned from using the \"High Plains\" in Victoria's National Parks to graze cattle. Stockmen had been fearing this decision since 1984, when a Labor government excised land to create the Alpine National Park. Some estimated three hundred cattlemen rode horses down Bourke street in protest while police said it was closer to 100. Colourful Victorian National Party leader Peter Ryan was quoted as saying that Bracks had killed \"The Man from Snowy River\" (although the poem was about mustering horses, not cattle \u2013 a practice which was stopped in the high country just after World War 2.)\nBracks' second government achieved one of Victorian Labor's longest-held goals with a complete reform of the state's system for electing its upper house. It saw the introduction of proportional representation, with eight five-member regions replacing the current single-member constituencies. This system increases the opportunity for minor parties such as the Greens and DLP to win seats in the Legislative Council, giving them a greater chance of holding the balance of power. Illustrating the historic importance Labor assigns to the changes, in a speech to a conference celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade, Bracks said it was \"another victory for the aspirations of Eureka\", and has described the changes as \"his proudest achievement\".\nThe staging of the 2006 Commonwealth Games, generally viewed as a success (albeit an expensive one), was viewed as a plus for Bracks and the government. With times reasonably good, a perception arguably reinforced by an extensive government advertising campaign selling the virtues of Victoria to Victorians, polls indicated little interest in change, although towards the end of the election campaign polling indicated that the Liberals under Baillieu were closing the gap.\nThird term as Premier.\nThe election campaign was a relatively low-key affair, with the Government and Bracks largely running on their record, as well as their plans to tackle infrastructure issues in their third term. Bracks' image loomed large in Labor's election advertising. Liberal attacks concentrated on the slow process of infrastructure development under Bracks (notably on water supply issues relating to the severe drought affecting Victoria in the election leadup), and new Liberal leader Ted Baillieu promised to start construction on a range of new infrastructure initiatives, including a new dam on the Maribyrnong River and a desalination plant. Labor's broken election promise on Eastlink was also expected to be a factor in some seats in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.\nOn 25 November 2006, Steve Bracks won his third election, comfortably defeating Baillieu to secure a third term, with a slightly reduced majority in the Lower House. This marked only the second time that the Victorian Labor Party had won a third term in office. His third term Cabinet was sworn in on 1 December 2006 with Bracks also holding the portfolio of Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Multicultural Affairs.\nResignation.\nBracks announced his resignation as Premier on 27 July 2007, saying this was to spend more time with his family. He stepped down on 30 July 2007. According to the ABC, Bracks had been under political and personal pressure in the weeks before his resignation. Alone among State Premiers, he had refused to agree to the Federal Government's $10\u00a0billion Murray\u2013Darling basin water conservation plan, and his son had been involved in an accident involving a charge of drink driving. Bracks told a media conference he could no longer give a 100 per cent commitment to politics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Once you reach a point where you can no longer make that commitment, the choice is clear \u2013 I have made that choice.\"\u2014\u200a\nBracks' deputy John Thwaites announced his resignation on the same day. News of the resignations caused surprise to the general community as well as to politicians. It was revealed that then Federal Labor Leader Kevin Rudd was informed only minutes before the announcement, and tried to talk Bracks out of his decision. Bracks' Treasurer John Brumby was elected unopposed by the Victorian Labor Caucus as Premier, while Attorney-General Rob Hulls was elected Deputy Premier.\nOne consequence of Bracks leaving politics may have been the introduction of abortion law reform in Victoria. It has been suggested that the resignation of Premier Bracks sowed the seeds for abortion law reform by legislation that parliamentarians previously had refused to support, fearing a backlash from anti-abortion groups led by veteran campaigner Margaret Tighe. Bracks, as a Catholic of Lebanese descent, almost certainly would not have allowed abortion legislation into the parliament, but his successor John Brumby did not share this view, and the Abortion Law Reform Bill introduced by upper house member Candy Broad was passed by the Parliament in 2008.\nAfter politics.\nIn August 2007, following his resignation as Premier, Bracks announced he would provide a short-term pro bono advising role in East Timor working alongside the newly elected Prime Minister Xanana Gusm\u00e3o. Bracks was to spend a year travelling between Melbourne and Dili helping with the establishment of Gusm\u00e3o's administration, the key departments that would need to be involved, and advising on how they would be accountable and reportable to the legislature.\nDuring 2008 Bracks indicated his support for Victorian abortion law reform in Victoria.\nIn addition to his role advising Gusm\u00e3o, Bracks also joined several company advisory boards: KPMG, insurance firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group, the AIMS Financial Group and the NAB. The KPMG appointment was controversial, as the Victorian government had awarded the firm over 100 contracts during Bracks' time as Premier. On 14 February 2008, the Federal Labor Government appointed Bracks to head an inquiry into the ongoing viability of the Australian car industry.\nIn 2010, Bracks was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for services to the community and the Parliament of Victoria. In recognition of his distinguished services to the Victorian community, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) \u2013 LL.D \"(h.c.)\" by Deakin University on 27 April 2010. He was also appointed to the Honorary Chair of the Deakin University Foundation.\nIn February 2013 after the announcement that Nicola Roxon would retire from federal politics, Bracks was cited as a possible candidate for her safe Labor seat of Gellibrand, but he ruled out running for the seat.\nBracks was appointed to the role of Australian consul-general in New York in May 2013, by the Federal ALP Government of Julia Gillard. At the time, the shadow Foreign Minister, the Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop, described the appointment as \"inappropriate\" because of the proximity to the upcoming election and \"arrogant\" because of a lack of consultation with the then-opposition. Following the defeat of the ALP at the 7 September election, incoming foreign minister Julie Bishop reversed the appointment in a decision described as 'petty and vindictive' by acting ALP foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek.\nIn March 2019, it was announced that Bracks will serve as the 6th Chancellor of Victoria University from 2021.\nIn June 2020, Bracks and former federal Labor deputy leader Jenny Macklin were appointed as administrators of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party by the party's National Executive until early 2021, after allegations of branch-stacking by Victorian minister Adem Somyurek were revealed. The pair reviewed the state party's operations and provided detailed recommendations to tackle the issue of branch-stacking within the party.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They lie south of Skye and north of Mull and Ardnamurchan; the most westerly point of mainland Scotland.\nUntil 1891, Canna, R\u00f9m and Muck belonged to the county of Argyll, while Eigg belonged to Inverness-shire. In that year, the entire archipelago was transferred to Inverness-shire. They now belong to the Highland council area.\nName.\n\"Small Isles\" is the name of the coterminous civil parish and former Church of Scotland parish, originally created in 1726 from part of Sleat parish, the balance of which lies on the much larger island of Skye. The original name of the new parish was Eigg or Short Isles. \"In process of time the name was by an easy transition changed from 'Short' to 'Small' Isles.\" The islands are not especially small, with R\u00f9m being the 15th largest in Scotland. The Gaelic name of \"\" translates as \"cross isles\", referring to the islands' position between Morar and Uist.\nGeography.\nThe four main islands are: Canna, R\u00f9m, Eigg and Muck. The largest is R\u00f9m, with an area of .\nSmaller islands surrounding the main four include:\nThere are also a number of skerries:\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the total population of the Small Isles was 153. Five of the islands are inhabited: Eigg (83), Muck (27), R\u00f9m (22), Canna (12) and Sanday (9).\nThe inhabited islands are in contrasting forms of ownership: Canna (along with the tidally linked Sanday) is owned by a national conservation charity, the National Trust for Scotland; Eigg has been owned by a local community trust since 1997; Muck remains in private ownership; and R\u00f9m is largely in the hands of the state (via NatureScot), although some land in and around the only village (Kinloch) is owned by a community trust.\nTransport.\nA Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, , links the Small Isles to each other and to the mainland port of Mallaig. The ferry runs a daily service, calling at different islands depending on the day of the week; there are two calls at certain islands on each day to allow for day visits to and from each island. The Lochnevis has a landing craft style stern ramp allowing vehicles to be driven onto and off the vessel at a new slipway constructed in 2001, however visitors are not normally permitted to bring vehicles to the Small Isles. During the summer months the islands are also served by Arisaig Marine's passenger ferry \"MV Sheerwater\" from Arisaig, south of Mallaig. Timetables are also arranged to allow time onshore on different islands depending on the day of the week.\nNature and conservation.\nThe Small Isles are all important for their wildlife, with R\u00f9m being designated as both a national nature reserve and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). R\u00f9m is home to one of the world's largest colonies of Manx shearwater, and was the location for the first stage of the reintroduction of white-tailed sea-eagles into Scotland, with 82 birds being released between 1975 and 1985. R\u00f9m, and Canna and Sanday (jointly), are designated as Special Protection Areas (SPA) due their birdlife, with all three islands hosting important breeding populations of guillemots and kittiwakes. The Canna and Sanday SPA is also designated due to its importance to breeding Atlantic puffins and shags, whilst the R\u00f9m SPA designation notes the presence of golden eagles, Manx shearwaters, and red-throated divers.\nAround of the waters around R\u00f9m, Canna and the low-lying rocky islet of Oigh-sgeir have been designated as the Small Isles Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA). Of particular note is that this area holds the UK's only known colony of fan mussels. The seas surrounding all of the Small Isles have also been designated as a SAC due to their importance for harbour porpoises.\nThe islands and surrounding sea area together form the Small Isles national scenic area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers in total, of which is on land and the remaining is marine (i.e. below low tide level).\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
