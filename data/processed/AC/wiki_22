Set in Venice and Cyprus, the play depicts the Moorish military commander Othello as he is manipulated by his ensign, Iago, into suspecting his wife Desdemona of infidelity. \"Othello\" is widely considered one of Shakespeare's greatest works and is usually classified among his major tragedies alongside \"Macbeth\", \"King Lear\", and \"Hamlet\". Unpublished in the author's life, the play survives in one quarto edition from 1622 and in the First Folio.\n\"Othello\" has been one of Shakespeare's most popular plays, both among playgoers and literary critics, since its first performance, spawning numerous stage, screen, and operatic adaptations. Among actors, the roles of Othello, Iago, Desdemona, and Emilia (Iago's wife) are regarded as highly demanding and desirable. Critical attention has focused on the nature of the play's tragedy, its unusual mechanics, its treatment of race, and on the motivations of Iago and his relationship to Othello. Originally performed by white actors in dark makeup, the role of Othello began to be played by black actors in the 19th century.\nShakespeare's major source for the play was a novella by Cinthio, the plot of which Shakespeare borrowed and reworked substantially. Though not among Shakespeare's longest plays, it contains two of his four longest roles in Othello and Iago.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlot.\nAct I.\nRoderigo, a wealthy and dissolute gentleman, complains to his friend Iago, an ensign, that Iago has not told him about the recent secret marriage between Desdemona, the daughter of Brabantio, a senator, and Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army. Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, for her hand in marriage, which Brabantio denied him.\nIago thirsts for revenge on Othello for promoting an aristocrat named Cassio as lieutenant over him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself. Iago tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage and convinces Roderigo to wake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter's elopement. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello and warns him that Brabantio is coming for him.\nBrabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and seeks to confront Othello, but he finds Othello accompanied by the Duke of Venice's guards, who prevent violence. News has arrived in Venice that the Turks are going to attack Cyprus, and Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompany Othello to the Duke's residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona by witchcraft.\nOthello defends himself before the Duke of Venice, Brabantio's kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, and various senators. Othello explains that, while he was invited to Brabantio's home, Desdemona became enamoured of him for the sad and compelling stories he told of his life before Venice, not because of any witchcraft. The senate is satisfied once Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello, but Brabantio leaves, saying that Desdemona will betray Othello: \"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father, and may thee\" (Act I, Sc 3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio's remark. By order of the Duke, Othello leaves Venice to command the Venetian armies against invading Turks on the island of Cyprus, accompanied by his new wife, his lieutenant Cassio, his ensign Iago, and Iago's wife, Emilia, as Desdemona's attendant.\nAct II.\nThe party arrives in Cyprus to find that a storm has destroyed the Turkish fleet. Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marriage with Desdemona. In his absence, Iago gets Cassio drunk and then persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries to calm down an angry and drunk Cassio. This leads to their fighting one another and Montano's being injured. Othello arrives and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio for the disturbance and strips him of his rank. Cassio, distraught, is then persuaded by Iago to ask Desdemona to persuade her husband to reinstate him.\nAct III.\nIago persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona's relationship. When Desdemona drops a handkerchief (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it and gives it to Iago at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello appears and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife's unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant.\nAct IV.\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.\nEnraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.\nAct V.\nRoderigo unsuccessfully attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's lodgings, as Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to death to stop him from revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.\nOthello confronts a sleeping Desdemona. She denies being unfaithful, but he smothers her. Emilia arrives, and Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what Iago has done, and she exposes him. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona's innocence, stabs Iago (but not fatally), saying that Iago is a devil, but not before the latter stabs Emilia to death in the scuffle.\nIago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.\nDate and sources.\nShakespeare's sources.\nShakespeare's primary source for the plot was the story of a Moorish Captain (third decade, story seven) in \"Gli Hecatommithi\" by Cinthio (Giovanni Battista Giraldi), a collection of one hundred novellas about love, grouped into ten \"decades\" by theme. The third decade deals with marital infidelity. Of Cinthio's characters, only Disdemona (the equivalent of Shakespeare's Desdemona \u2013 her name means \"ill-omened\" in Italian) is named \u2013 the others are simply called the Moor (the equivalent of Othello), the Ensign (Iago), the Corporal (Cassio) and similar descriptions. In its story the Ensign falls in love with the Moor's wife Disdemona, but her indifference turns his love to hate and in revenge he persuades the Moor that Disdemona has been unfaithful. The Moor and the Ensign murder Disdemona with socks filled with sand, and bring down the ceiling of her bedchamber to make it appear an accident. The story continues until the Ensign is tortured to death for unrelated reasons and the Moor is killed by Disdemona's family.\nShakespeare's direct sources for the story do not include any threat of warfare: it seems to have been Shakespeare's innovation to set the story at the time of a threatened Turkish invasion of Cyprus\u2014apparently fixing it in the events of 1570. Those historical events would however have been well known to Shakespeare's original audience, who would therefore have been aware that\u2014contrary to the action of the play\u2014the Turks took Cyprus, and still held it.\nScholars have identified many other influences on \"Othello\". Works which are not themselves sources but whose impact on Shakespeare can be identified in the play include Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", both \"The Merchant's Tale\" and \"The Miller's Tale\" from Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", Geoffrey Fenton's \"Certaine Tragicall Discourses\", Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\", George Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\", the anonymous \"Arden of Faversham\", Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\", and Heywood's \"A Woman Killed with Kindness\". Influences also include Shakespeare's own earlier plays \"Much Ado About Nothing\", in which a similar plot was used in a comedy, \"The Merchant of Venice\" with its high-born, Moorish, Prince of Morocco, and \"Titus Andronicus\", in which a Moor, Aaron, was a prominent villain, and as such was a forerunner of both Othello and Iago.\nOne such influence is not a literary work at all. In 1600, London was visited for \"half a year\" by the Moorish ambassador of the King of Barbary, whose entourage caused a stir in the city. Shakespeare's company is known to have played at court during the time of the visit, and so would have encountered the foreign visitors at first hand.\nAmong Shakespeare's non-fiction, or partly-fictionalised, sources were Gasparo Contarini's \"Commonwealth and Government of Venice\" and Leo Africanus's \"A Geographical Historie of Africa\". Himself a Moor from Barbary, Leo said of his own people \"they are so credulous they will beleeue matters impossible, which are told them\" and \"no nation in the world is so subject vnto iealousie; for they will rather [lose] their liues than put vp any disgrace in the behalfe of their women\"\u2014both traits seen in Shakespeare's Othello. And from Leo's own life story Shakespeare took a well-born, educated African finding a place at the height of a white European power. From Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny's \"Natural History\" Shakespeare took the references to the Pontic Sea, to Arabian trees with their medicinable gum, and to the \"Anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders\", elements which also featured in the fantastic \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\".\nDate.\nThe \"terminus ad quem\" for \"Othello\" (that is, the latest year in which the play could have been written) is 1604, since a performance of the play in that year is mentioned in the accounts book of Sir Edmund Tilney, then Master of the Revels.\nA \"terminus a quo\" (i.e. the earliest year in which it could have been written) is given by the fact that one of its sources, Holland's translation of Pliny's \"Natural History\", was published in 1601.\nWithin this range, scholars have tended to date the play 1603\u20131604, within the reign of James I, since the play appears to have elements designed to appeal to the new king, who had written a poem about the defeat of the Turkish navy at Lepanto, and to the new queen, Anne of Denmark, in whose circle there was an interest in the blackface exoticism also reflected in Ben Jonson's \"The Masque of Blackness\", in which the queen and her ladies appeared as \"daughters of Niger\". That dating is supported by similarities to \"Measure for Measure\", another of Shakespeare's plays often dated around 1604, and which, like \"Othello\", draws its plot from Cinthio's \"Gli Hecatommithi\". This date is also supported by the possibility that Shakespeare may have consulted Richard Knolles' 1603 \"The Generall Historie of the Turkes\".\nHowever, evidence of an earlier date, 1601\u20131602, is provided by the so-called bad quarto of Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", published in 1603. The theory is that the bad quarto is a memorial reconstruction of \"Hamlet\", made by some of its actors: so where there are unintentional echoes of \"Othello\" in the bad quarto (for example \"to my vnfolding / Lend thy listning eare\" in the bad quarto and \"To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear\" in \"Othello\"\u2014and a number of others) it suggests that the actors must have been performing \"Othello\", at the latest, in the season preceding the bad quarto's publication.\nEarly editions.\n\"Othello\" was not published in Shakespeare's lifetime. The first published version of the play was a quarto in 1622 (usually abbreviated to \"Q\"), which was followed a year later by the play's appearance in the \"First Folio\" (usually abbreviated to \"F\").\nThere are significant differences between the two early editions, the most prominent of which are:\nThere is no scholarly consensus to account for the differences between Q and F:\nAs \"The Oxford Shakespeare\" editor Michael Neill summarises things: \"The textual mystery of \"Othello\" is unlikely ever to be resolved to general satisfaction.\"\nThemes and critical approaches.\nJealousy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"O beware, my lord, of jealousy! It is the green eyed monster, which doth mock the meat it feeds on.\"\nIago\nThe influential early twentieth-century Shakespeare critic A. C. Bradley defined Othello's tragic flaw as a sexual jealousy so intense that it \"converts human nature into chaos, and liberates the beast in man ... the animal in man forcing itself into his consciousness in naked grossness, and he writhing before it but powerless to deny it entrance, grasping inarticulate images of pollution, and finding relief only in a bestial thirst for blood.\"\nThis jealousy is symbolized in the play through animal imagery. In the early acts of the play it is Iago who mentions ass, daws, flies, ram, jennet, guinea-hen, baboon, wild-cat, snipe, monkeys, monster and wolves. But from the third act onwards Othello catches this line of imagery from Iago as his irrational jealousy takes hold. The same occurs with \"diabolical\" imagery (i.e. images of hell and devils) of which Iago uses 14 of his 16 diabolical images in the first two acts, yet Othello uses 25 of his 26 in the last three acts.\nNot only Othello, but also Iago is consumed by jealousy: his is a kind of envy, which contemporary scholar Francis Bacon called \"the vilest affection, and the most depraved; for which cause, it is the proper attribute of the Devil... As it always cometh to pass, that envy worketh subtilly, and in the dark; and to the prejudice of good things.\"\nSometimes critics have struggled to define the kind of jealousy Othello suffers, or to deny it as a motive (for example, those who claim that in Russia between 1945 and 1957 only one actor portrayed Othello as obsessed by jealousy). In fact jealousy is a wide-ranging emotion and encompasses the spectrum from lust to spiritual disillusionment within which Othello's obsession must fall. And he displays many accepted aspects of jealousy: an eagerness to snatch at proofs, indulging degrading images of the jealousy's object, snatching at ambiguities to ease the mind, dread of vulgar ridicule, and a spirit of vindictiveness.\nRace.\nAs Ben Okri has said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If \"Othello\" did not begin as a play about race, then its history has made it one.\nOr, as the Oxford editor Professor Michael Neill summarises it: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Anxieties about the treatment of race in \"Othello\" are a recurrent feature of both its critical and performance histories: where they once focused on the supposed scandal of miscegenation, they are nowadays more likely to address the play's complicity in racial stereotyping.\nIn plot terms, Othello's race serves to mark him as \"other\". As both a Christian and a black African, Othello is (as scholar Tom McAlindon puts it) both of, and not of, Venice. And actor Paul Robeson considered Othello's colour as essentially secondary, as a way of emphasizing his cultural difference and consequent vulnerability in a society he does not fully understand.\nIn the world of the play itself, Jyotsna Singh argues that Brabantio's\u2014and others'\u2014objection to Othello, a decorated and respected general, as a suitable husband for Desdemona, a senator's daughter, only makes sense in racist terms: reinforced by the bestial imagery used by Iago in delivering the news. The racist slurs used by Iago, Roderigo and Brabantio in the play suggest that Shakespeare conceived of Othello as a black African: \"thicklips\"; \"an old black ram is tupping your white ewe\"; \"you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse\"; \"the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou\"\u2014as do things Othello says of himself: \"haply for I am black\"; or \"begrimed and black as mine own face\".\nThere is critical divide over Othello's ethnic origin. A \"Moor\" broadly refers to someone from northwest Africa, especially if Muslim, but in Shakespeare's England \"Moor\" was used with broader connotations: sometimes referring to Africans of all regions, sometimes to Arabic or Islamic peoples beyond Africa, such as those of Turkey and the Middle East, and sometimes to Muslims of any race or location.\nRacism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I think this play is racist, and I think it is not.\"\nScholar Virginia Vaughan\nIn Shakespeare's main source, Cinthio's \"Gli Hecatommithi\", the character Disdemona (the equivalent of Shakespeare's Desdemona) says \"I know not what to say of the Moor; he used to be all love towards me; but within these few days he has become another man; and much I fear that I shall prove a warning to young girls not to marry against the wishes of their parents, and that the Italian ladies may learn from me not to wed a man whose nature and habitude of life estrange from us\".\nSimilar wording was used in one of the earliest, and most negative, critiques of the play: Thomas Rymer writing in his 1693 \"A Short View of Tragedy\" suggested that one of the play's morals was \"a caution to all Maidens of Quality how, without their Parents consent, they run away with Blackamoors.\" Rymer, however, dryly observed that another such moral might be \"a warning to all good Wives, that they look well to their Linnen\" \u2013 as such his comments should be read within the context of his overarching criticism of the play, as unrealistic and lacking in obvious moral conclusions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"For this noble lady, who regarded the mind more than the features of men, with a singularity rather to be admired than imitated, had chosen for the object of her affections a Moor, a black.\"\n \"Othello\" in \"Tales from Shakespeare\" (1807) by Charles and Mary Lamb\nIn the nineteenth century, such well-known writers as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb questioned whether the play could even be called a \"true tragedy\" when it dramatized the inviolable taboo of a white woman in a relationship with a black man. Coleridge, writing in 1818, argued that Othello could not have been conceived as black:\n\"Can we imagine [Shakespeare] so utterly ignorant as to make a barbarous negro plead royal birth\u2014at a time, too, when negroes were not known except as slaves? ... and most surely as an English audience was disposed at the beginning of the seventeenth century, it would be something monstrous to conceive this beautiful Venetian girl falling in love with a veritable negro. It would argue a disproportionateness, a want of balance, in Desdemona, which Shakespeare does not appear to have in the least contemplated.\"\nThese sentiments were instrumental in ushering in the so-called \"bronze age of Othello\" (discussed further under \"19th century\" below).\nMartin Orkin's 1987 essay \"Othello and the \"Plain Face\" of Racism\" acknowledges the racist sentiments in the play; but vindicates Shakespeare who confines these views to discredited characters such as Iago, Roderigo and Brabantio. He concludes that \"in its fine scrutiny of the mechanisms underlying Iago's use of racism, and in its rejection of human pigmentation as a means of identifying human worth, the play, as it always has done, continues to oppose racism.\"\nThe critical approach to racial issues in the play changed direction with the publication in 1996 by Howard University Press of \"Othello: New Essays by Black Writers\" edited by Mythili Kaul, which made clear that black readers and audience members may be experiencing a different play from white ones. Questions about whether \"Othello\" is among Shakespeare's greatest plays are rendered irrelevant in the context of discussions about how the play illuminates the racial thinking of Shakespeare's time, and of the present day.\nThe Nigerian poet Ben Okri in his 1997 \"A Way of Being Free\" included several \"meditations\" on \"Othello\", arguing that because \"it is possible that Othello actually is a blackened white man\" he is not a fully formed character with a psychology but a \"white myth or stereotype of black masculinity\". Even with that knowledge, Okri writes, \"The black person's response to \"Othello\" is more secret, and much more anguished, than can be imagined. It makes you unbearably lonely to know that you can empathise with [white people], but they will rarely empathise with you. It hurts to watch \"Othello\".\"\nFrom the 1980s, Othello became a role that only black actors performed. However, in 1998 black actor Hugh Quarshie questioned whether the central role in \"Othello\" should be played by a black actor, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"If a black actor plays a role written for a white actor does he not risk making racial stereotypes seem legitimate and even true ... does he not encourage the white way, or rather the wrong way, of looking at black men, namely that [they] are over-emotional, excitable and unstable.\"\nScholar Virginia Vaughan made a related point in 2005:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The danger of a black actor in the title role is that with the loss of the reminders that this is \"not\" real but an impersonation, the enactment of Othello's jealous rage and murder of his wife can strike audiences as the embodiment of their own stereotypes of black pathology rather than an actorly performance\"\nPatriarchy.\nAt Brabantio's first appearance towards the end of the first scene, he asks whether sinister \"charms\" may have abused \"the property of youth and maidenhood\" of Desdemona. For him, Desdemona denying her father's right to choose her husband, and choosing a black man for herself, can only be explained by black magic.\nThe notion of women as property pervades the play. Even after her death, Othello says of Desdemona: \"Had she been true, / If heaven would make me such another world / Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, / I'd not have sold her for it.\" Also pervasive is the male fear of female sexuality.\nThe word \"whore\" appears 14 times in \"Othello\", more often than in any other work by Shakespeare, often used (in Kay Stanton's words) as a \"male-initiated inscription onto the female as scapegoat.\" And it is one of only two of the plays (alongside \"Timon of Athens\") in which the word \"whore\" is used with specific reference to every named female character. In the world of the play, \"whorishness\" is understood as the true and essential nature of women\u2014yet this is constantly shown to be a projection of male imaginations, completely unrelated to the women's perceptions of themselves or to their behavior.\nTowards the end of the play, Desdemona's goodness increasingly becomes represented by long-suffering martyrdom, perceived as a longstanding sign of acceptable femininity. In place of the headstrong heroine of the opening acts, Desdemona, increasingly stripped of agency, endures her husband's anger and humiliations\u2014even his striking her in public\u2014and eventually, while dying, tries to exonerate him for his murder of her. Others perceive Desdemona's reaction as one of strength and dignity, not passivity.\nIn contrast, Emilia (\"the only real grown-up in the play\", in the words of stage director Michael Attenborough) revolts against misogyny, defying her husband Iago's demands three times in the final scene.\nThe handkerchief.\nThe over-reliance of the plot of \"Othello\" upon a trivial prop, the handkerchief, was noted in the play's earliest criticism. The same Thomas Rymer quoted above, in his 1693 \"A Short View of Tragedy\", suggested that the play should better have been called \"The Tragedy of the Handkerchief\", arguing \"the handkerchief is so remote a trifle, no booby on this side Mauritania could make any consequence from it.\"\nIn spite of Othello's protestations in the first act that no magic was used in his wooing of Desdemona, he later claims magical properties for the handkerchief, his first gift to her. A question which has interested critics is whether he himself believes these stories or is using them to pressure or test Desdemona. There is certainly a contradiction between Othello's assertion\u2014linked to its supposed magical properties\u2014that his mother received the handkerchief from an Egyptian charmer in Act 3 Scene 4, and his later assertion that his father gave it to his mother, made in Act 4 Scene 2. Are we, the audience, intended to believe in the handkerchief's magical properties?\nThe handkerchief provides many examples of how chance operates in support of Iago's plots: Desdemona loses it just when Iago is in need of evidence of the invented affair; Cassio fails to recognise that it is hers; Cassio gives it to Bianca to copy, who throws it back at him at the very moment when Othello is eavesdropping.\nSymbolically the handkerchief represents the bond between Othello and Desdemona, and its loss the breaking of that bond: Othello blames Desdemona for its loss when in fact he casts it aside while she is trying to use it to help him. The whiteness of the handkerchief is often taken to represent Desdemona's purity; and the red strawberries blood from her hymen symbolising her virgin marriage. In contrast, professor Ian Smith argues that a handkerchief \"dyed in mummy\" would not be white but black, and therefore symbolic of Othello. Under this interpretation the black handkerchief would highlight how Othello\u2019s body has been passed around and treated as an object of exchange.\nIn a 1997 production at the Royal National Theatre, the handkerchief fell to the ground immediately before the interval and remained onstage throughout it, as if\u2014as the reviewer Richard Butler put it\u2014\"challenging one of us to pick it up and prevent a tragedy.\"\nOthello and Iago.\nOthello and Iago are two of the five longest parts in the Shakespeare canon. At 1097 lines, Iago's is the larger of the two: only Hamlet (in \"Hamlet\") and Richard (in \"Richard III\") are longer.\nGenre.\n\"Othello\"\u2014although a tragedy\u2014takes elements from other genres, including comedy. For example, there are similarities between Egeus' complaint about his daughter Hermia's lover Lysander, in the first Act of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\":\nWith cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heartTurned her obedience which is due to meTo stubborn harshness.\nAnd Brabantio's complaint to the Duke in Act 1 of \"Othello\" in which he asks Desdemona:\nDo you perceive, in all this noble company,Where most you owe obedience?\nIago's motivation.\nThe word \"honest\" is used more than 40 times in the play, sometimes with reference to Desdemona's chastity, but in almost all other cases with reference to Iago, where it has a double meaning\u2014as a condescending term for a social inferior, and as a reference to his supposed truthfulness.\nIago's role is (in Robert Watson's words) \"overdetermined in renaissance dramatic convention\": he is partly the scheming Machiavel of Renaissance tragedy, partly the vengeful malcontent of revenge tragedy, partly the instigator of jealousy in domestic tragedy and partly the devil incarnate of morality plays.\nThe character's own motives are never made clear, because Iago himself expresses too many motives:\nThese led Samuel Taylor Coleridge to refer to Iago's \"motive-hunting of motive-less Malignity\".\nSome critics have suggested other motives: psychologist Ernest Jones's suggestion that Iago may be motivated by a repressed homosexual desire for Othello has been influential in subsequent performances of the role.\nAs Robert Watson summarises it: \"The seemingly endless critical debate about Iago's motivation reflects a truth, rather than a confusion, about the play. ... If it is disturbing to suspect that a devil may be lurking around us in human form, perhaps within our most trusted friend, it is even more disturbing to realize that this devil may be ... a reflection of our own destructive tendencies.\"\nUltimately Iago provides no answer\u2014refusing, at the end of the play, to reveal his motive: \"Demand me nothing. What you know, you know. From this time forth I never will speak word.\"\nDouble time scheme.\n\"Othello\" has a double time scheme\u2014meaning that the timeframe of the play does not contain enough time for its action. Its action is continuous from Othello and Desdemona's wedding night, except for the voyage from Venice to Cyprus (during which Cassio and Desdemona are not together) and the time in Cyprus covers an estimated 33 hours. Yet this short timeframe does not allow any time for the supposed affair between Desdemona and Cassio to have happened. In support of the short time scheme is the continuous nature of the action: the fleet arrives in Cyprus in the afternoon and the plot against Cassio proceeds that evening into the early morning; Cassio resolves to seek Desdemona's help the following morning, and does so, commencing the long \"temptation scene\" by the end of which Othello has resolved to kill Desdemona and has ordered Iago to attempt to kill Cassio, all of which happens that same night. And this urgency is underlined by the text: in particular's Iago's concern that if Othello compares notes with anyone else it will become clear that Iago is playing one character against another.\nBut there is also a long time scheme. Iago persuades Othello that Desdemona and Cassio have \"the act of shame a thousand times committed\"; Emilia says Iago \"hath a hundred times\" asked her to steal the handkerchief; Bianca complains Cassio has been away from her \"a week\"; news of the Turkish defeat needs time to reach Venice then Lodovico needs time to reach Cyprus; and by Act 4 Roderigo (who sold all his land at the end of Act 1) has already squandered all his money.\nShakespeare's source story in Cinthio takes place entirely in the long time scheme: Shakespeare appears to have introduced the shorter time scheme to increase dramatic tension, while also introducing moments where Iago's plot could fall apart\u2014for example if Emilia had given an honest answer to Desdemona's \"Where should I lose that handkerchief?\" or if Roderigo had chosen to denounce Iago.\nThe discovery of a double time scheme has been ascribed to articles written by John Wilson in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1849 and 1850, although references to the problem predate that. The whole question is sometimes rejected as \"academic nit-picking\". (Director Michael Attenborough, asked about it in an interview, replied \"I strongly suspect Shakespeare didn't think about it very much.\") And as Michael Neill points out, many of the problems disappear if one supposes that Othello believed Cassio and Desdemona's affair had commenced prior to Othello and Desdemona's elopement. Neill summarises the issue as \"no more than a particularly striking side-effect of the general indifference to naturalistic handling of time and space that Shakespeare shared with other dramatists of the period.\"\nPerformance history.\nShakespeare's day to the Interregnum.\n\"Othello\" was written for and performed by the King's Men, the playing company to which Shakespeare belonged, and the 1622 Quarto notes on its title page that the play was \"Diuerse times acted at the Globe, and at Black-Friers, by his Maiesties seruants\". These two theatres had very different features\u2014the former a large outdoor theatre accommodating an audience of 3,000; the latter a private indoor theatre that sat around 700, paying higher prices\u2014and the style of playing would have adapted to these different conditions. The play was performed at Court by the King's Men on 1 November 1604, and again in 1612-13 as part of the celebrations for the Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate.\nThe title role was originally played by Richard Burbage, whose eulogies reveal that he was admired in the role. Moorish characters were conventionally played in turbans, with long white gowns and red trousers, with the actor's face darkened with lampblack or coal. The original Iago was likely John Lowin.\nRestoration and 18th century.\nAll theatres were closed down by the Puritan government on 6 September 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King's Company and the Duke's Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them: \"Othello\" being allocated to the King's Company's repertoire. These patents stated that \"all the women's parts to be acted in either of the said two companies for the time to come may be performed by women\". The first professional acting appearance by a woman on the English stage was that of Desdemona in \"Othello\" on 8 December 1660, although history does not record who took the role. Margaret Hughes is the first woman known to have played Desdemona.\nIn Restoration theatres, it was common for Shakespeare's plays to be adapted or rewritten. \"Othello\" was not adapted in this way, although it has often been cut to conform to current ideas of decorum or refinement. These cuts were not limited to removing violent, religious or sexual content, but extended on different occasions to removing references to eavesdropping, to Othello's fit, to Othello's tears, to the first 200 lines of the fourth act, or to the entire role of Bianca.\nAmong seventeenth- and eighteenth-century actors praised for expressing the nobility of the Moor\u2014and fully exploring the degrading passions which lead to the brutal murder he commits\u2014were Thomas Betterton and Spranger Barry. A review of the latter by John Bernard expressed how Barry's Othello \"looked a few seconds in Desdemona's face, as if to read her feelings and disprove his suspicions; then, turning away, as the adverse conviction gathered in his heart, he spoke falteringly, and gushed into tears.\"\nThe first professional performances of the play in North America are likely to have been those of the Hallam Company: Robert Upton (William Hallam's advance man) performed \"Othello\" at a makeshift theatre in New York on 26 December 1751; and religious objections to theatre led the Hallam Company to perform \"Othello\" as a series of \"moral dialogues\" at Rhode Island in 1761.\nAlthough not performed in Portugal until the nineteenth century, the play holds the distinction of being the first of Shakespeare's works to have reached a Portuguese-speaking country, possibly at the request of a Portuguese reader, in 1765.\n19th century.\nPaul Robeson's iconic performance (see 20th Century, below) was not the first professional performance of the title role by a black actor: the first known is James Hewlett at the African Grove Theatre, New York, in 1822. And Hewlett's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ira Aldridge (billed as \"The African Roscius\") played many Shakespearean roles across Europe for forty years, including Othello at the Royalty Theatre, London, in 1825.\nThere are stories of extravagant audience reactions to the play. One of the most extreme is related by French novelist Stendhal who reports that at the Baltimore Theatre in 1822 a soldier interrupted the performance just before Desdemona's murder, shouting \"It will never be said that in my presence a confounded Negro has killed a white woman!\" The soldier fired his gun, breaking the arm of the actor playing Othello.\nThroughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Othello was regarded as the most demanding of Shakespeare's roles: it is considered a part of theatre legend that Edmund Kean collapsed while playing the role, and died two months after. Leigh Hunt saw Kean's Othello in 1819, describing his performance in \"The Examiner\" as \"the masterpiece of the living stage\". Before Kean, the leading exponent of the role had been John Philip Kemble who played a \"neoclassical hero\". In contrast, Kean presented Othello as a man of romantic temperament, and uncontrollable passion. It was also Kean who initiated the so-called \"Bronze Age of Othello\" by insisting that \"it was a gross error to make Othello either a negro or a black\" and thereby commencing a stage tradition of using lighter makeup rather than blackface. An advantage of this change was that the actor's facial expressions could be more clearly seen.\nCritics have naturally focused on the two central male roles. But Emilia becomes a powerful role in the final act. Indeed Charlotte Cushman's Emilia was said to upstage Edwin Forrest's Othello in 1845. And when Fanny Kemble played Desdemona in 1848 she changed the performance tradition. Previously, Desdemonas had (in her words) \"always appeared to me to acquiesce with wonderful equanimity in their assassination\" but Kemble, a passionate feminist and abolitionist, decided \"I shall make a desperate fight for it, for I feel horribly at the idea of being murdered in my bed.\"\nIn 1848, \"Othello\" was produced by Barry Lewis at the Sans Souci Theatre in Calcutta. The casting of the white \"Mrs. Anderson\" opposite the dark-skinned Indian Baishnav Charan Auddy led to controversy, to polarized reviews, and to a fiasco on the opening night when half of the cast, military men, were prohibited from leaving barracks by order of the Brigadier of Dum Dum.\nFor Tommaso Salvini and Edwin Booth the role of Othello was a career-length project. Salvini always played the role in Italian, even when acting alongside a company performing in English. His conception of the role was of a barbarian with savage and passionate instincts concealed by a thick veneer of civilisation. Konstantin Stanislavski admired, and was greatly influenced by, Salvini's Othello, which he saw in 1882. In \"My Life in Art\", Stanislavski recalls Salvini's scene before the Senate, saying that the actor \"grasped all of us in his palm, and held us there as if we were ants or flies\". Booth, in complete contrast, played Othello as a restrained gentleman. When Ellen Terry played Desdemona she commented on how much Booth's style helped her: \"It is difficult to preserve the simple, heroic blindness of Desdemona to the fact that her lord mistrusts her, if her lord is raving and stamping under her nose. Booth was gentle with Desdemona.\"\nBooth was also an acclaimed Iago, and his advice to actors of the role was: \"to portray Iago properly you must seem to be what all the characters think and say you are, not what the spectators know you to be; try to win even \"them\" by your sincerity. Don't \"act\" the villain.\"\nStanislavski himself first played Othello in 1896. He was dissatisfied with his own performance, later recalling \"I was able to reach nothing more than insane strain, spiritual and physical impotence, and the squeezing of tragic emotion out of myself.\"\n20th century.\n\"Othello\" was performed in the Shimpa style in Japan in 1903 by Otojiro Kawakami, resetting the location of Cyprus to Taiwan, which was then a Japanese colony.\nIn 1930 Stanislavski directed a production of Othello for the Moscow Art Theatre, which was influential in the development of his system. The performance was directed remotely, by letter, while Stanislavski recovered from illness in France.\nThe most significant theatre production in wartime America featured Paul Robeson as Othello. Robeson had previously played the role in London in 1930 with a cast including Peggy Ashcroft, Sybil Thorndike and Ralph Richardson, and would later take the role for the RSC in 1959 at Stratford-Upon-Avon. Margaret Webster's 1943 Broadway production was considered a theatrical landmark, with Robeson (in the words of Howard Barnes) \"making the Moor the great and terrible figure of tragedy which he has so rarely been on the stage.\" Jos\u00e9 Ferrer played Iago and Uta Hagen Desdemona. Taking the Broadway run with its subsequent tour, the show was seen by over half a million people. Earle Hyman saw the production numerous times when he was 17 and later recalled \"this tremendous excitement - the first African-American onstage to be playing this role ... to all the blacks, he \"represented\" us. It was a moment of great pride.\"\nIn 1947, Kenneth Tynan saw Frederick Valk and Donald Wolfit play Othello and Iago respectively, and described the experience as equivalent to witnessing the Chicago Fire, the Quetta Earthquake or the Hiroshima Bomb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Black all over my body, Max Factor 2880, then a lighter brown, then Negro Number 2, a stronger brown. Brown on black to give a rich mahogany. Then the great trick: that glorious half yard of chiffon with which I polished myself all over until I shone... The lips blueberry, the tight curled wig, the white of the eyes, whiter than ever, and the black, black sheen that covered my flesh and bones, glistening in the dressing-room lights.\"\n Laurence Olivier's makeup routine for \"Othello\"\nWhen Laurence Olivier performed Othello at the National in 1964, his sense of \"being black\", in his words, required him \"to be beautiful\" with a voice \"dark violet - velvet stuff\" and a walk \"like a soft black leopard\". (The filmed version of this production is discussed under \"Screen\" below.)\nThe play was extremely popular in Ethiopia, running for three years in the mid-1980s at the City Hall Theatre, Addis Ababa, in Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin's translation \u2013 performed in a static and declamatory style. When Janet Suzman directed the play in South Africa during Apartheid in 1988, the performance was passionately politicised, with the racism of several characters\u2014and especially Iago (modelled on Eug\u00e8ne Terre'Blanche)\u2014foregrounded. The play was highly controversial, the physical contact between the black John Kani and the white Joanna Weinburg provoking walk-outs and a pile-up of hate mail.\nWhite actors continued to dominate the role until the 1980s. Willard White in 1989 was the first black actor to play Othello at Stratford since Paul Robeson thirty years earlier.\nA \"singular and idiosyncratic\" performance of a white actor in the central role was Jude Kelly's \"photonegative\" production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. in 1997, in which Patrick Stewart played Othello as white, while almost all other speaking parts were played by actors of African descent. The script remained unchanged as regards the character's race, so the white Othello was, throughout, referred to as black.\n21st century.\nAt the turn of the century, performances at the RSC were dominated by their Iagos. Richard McCabe followed Simon Russell Beale in portraying misogynistic, embittered NCOs, older than their respective Othellos:\nSingaporean director Ong Keng Sen produced an intercultural version of the play in 2000: his \"Desdemona\" featured actors, musicians, designers and artists from India, Korea, Myanmar, Indonesia and Singapore, performing in a range of different traditional Asian styles.\nCathy Downes' 2001 production at the Court Theatre in Christchurch, New Zealand made effective use of a trope (which had had racist overtones when used by earlier European directors) of Othello reverting to his native culture: setting the action in the Waikato Land Wars, Othello was a British-adopted general leading forces against his own people, until finally bursting into a \"terrifying wero\" (a warrior's challenge) before exacting his revenge on Desdemona.\nA radically different approach was taken in Jette Steckel's 2009 German language production for the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Although the translation consistently used the word \"Schwarze\" for \"Moor\" in the original, Othello was played by the white German actress Susanne Wolff in a range of different costumes and disguises, including a gorilla suit for part of Act 4\u2014creating a performance in which everything is (in Ayanna Thompson's words) \"conveyed through representational metaphors which render Othello's race less of a stable physical marker and more of a fractured and performative one.\"\nA common theme of modern productions of the play is an emphasis on military life. When Adrian Lester played the role in Nicholas Hytner's 2013 National Theatre production, a retired army veteran was employed to teach the cast about ranks, comportment and off-duty behaviours. Another 21st century trend exemplified by that performance is to reduce the focus of the play on Othello's race by having other parts played by actors of colour also. And a third is an increasing focus on Desdemona's youth and innocence, at the expense of her strength of character.\nIn 21st century productions, more emphasis has been given to the theme of domestic violence.\nOthello's \"difference\" has been tested in ways other than race. A rare example is Stein Winge's 2015 casting of a white American actor, Bill Pullman, as an American Navy man adrift in Norway.\nThe play has provided opportunities for breakout roles for rising black stars, such as Chiwetel Ejiofor who played Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2008, and for a change of direction for other established stars: Willard White (see \"20th century\", above) was better known as an opera singer and Lenny Henry (see \"True Identity\" under \"Screen\" below), who played Othello for Northern Broadsides in 2009, was better known as a stand-up comedian.\nWhen Antony Sher played Iago for the RSC, the final moment of the play, before a snap blackout, was for him to look up and stare at the audience. Director Greg Doran intended this to be strange, enigmatic, open to interpretation. But Sher later wrote that he was always clear about it: in his head the question which always rang out was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You saw what was happening - why didn't you stop it?\"\nScreen.\n\"Othello\" has influenced many film makers, and often the results are adaptations, rather than performances of Shakespeare's text. The UK's \"National Film and Television Archive\" holds over 25 20th-Century films containing performances, adaptations or extracts from \"Othello\" including Anson Dyer's 1920 animated \"Othello\", 1921's \"Carnival\" and its 1932 remake, the 1922 German film \"Othello\", the 1936 \"Men Are Not Gods\", 1941's \"East of Piccadilly\", George Cukor's 1947 \"A Double Life\", Orson Welles' \"Othello\", Sergei Yutkevich's Russian language \"Othello\" discussed below, two productions for BBC Television (including Jonathan Miller's for the BBC Television Shakespeare series, discussed below), Basil Dearden's \"All Night Long\", a 1988 South African TV screening of Janet Suzman's \"Othello\", a film of Trevor Nunn's RSC production with Willard White and Ian McKellen in the central roles, and \"True Identity\"\u2014a crime caper in which Lenny Henry's character Miles lands the role of understudy to James Earl Jones (playing himself) in a production of \"Othello\". \"Carnival\", \"Men Are Not Gods\" and \"A Double Life\" all feature the plot of an actor playing the title role in Shakespeare's \"Othello\" developing murderous jealousy for their Desdemonas. This plot is also shared by the very first \"Othello\"-influenced film: the 18-minute Danish 1911 \"Desdemona\". \"All Night Long\" reframes the story in a jazz milieu. Richard Eyre's \"Stage Beauty\" depicts a restoration performance of the play.\nThe filming of Orson Welles' \"Othello\" was plagued by chaos. A pattern emerged where Welles would collect his cast and crew for filming, then after four or five weeks his money would run out and filming would cease: Welles would then appear in another movie, and using his acting fee would reconvene filming. Scenes in the final movie were sometimes spliced together from one actor filmed in Italy in one year, and another actor filmed in Morocco the next. Welles uses shadows, extreme camera angles and discordant piano music to force the audience to feel Othello's disorientated view of Desdemona. Cages, grilles and bars are frequent images. And the text is heavily cut: Othello's first words are his speech to the Senators from Act 1 Scene 3. The film was critically panned on its 1955 release (headlines included \"Mr Welles Murders Shakespeare in the Dark\" and \"The Boor of Venice\") but was acclaimed as a classic upon its re-release in a restored version in 1992.\nSergei Yutkevich's Russian film, with a screenplay by Boris Pasternak, was an attempt to make Shakespeare accessible to \"the working man\". Yutkevitch had begun his career as a painter and then as a set designer, and his film was widely praised for its pictorial beauty. The director saw his film as an opposite of Welles': where Welles began his film with a sequence from the end of the story, highlighting fate, Yutkevitch began with his Othello's back-story, thereby highlighting his characters' free will.\nLaurence Olivier said that the role of Othello demanded \"enormously big\" acting, and he incorporated what \"The Spectator\" described as his \"outsize, elaborate, overwhelming\" performance into the film of his National Theatre production. The effect to modern audiences is (in the words of Daniel Rosenthal) \"laughably over-the-top\"\u2014in keeping with its nature as a filmed stage performance, rather than a performance designed for the screen. The film was a financial success, and earned Oscar nominations for each of Olivier as Othello, Maggie Smith as Desdemona, Frank Finlay as Iago and Joyce Redman as Emilia. Subsequent critics have been less sympathetic to Olivier's performance than his contemporary audience had been, tending to read it as racist. As Barbara Hodgdon expresses it: \"Oliver's Othello confirms an absolute fidelity to white stereotypes of blackness.\"\nThe last of the screen versions to portray Othello in blackface was Jonathan Miller's for the BBC Television Shakespeare series, with Anthony Hopkins in the title role. Miller is said to have commented that \"the play is about jealousy, not race.\" The TV film of Willard White's performance as \"Othello\" (discussed under 20th Century performances above) has been described by Carol Chillington Rutter as \"The one [screen] \"Othello\" where the women's stories get fully told\", particularly praising the dynamic between Imogen Stubbs' Desdemona and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker's Emilia.\nOliver Parker's 1995 \"Othello\" was trailed as an \"erotic thriller\", including a ritualized love scene between Othello and Desdemona, and, most memorably, Othello's jealous fantasies of encounters between Desdemona and Cassio. Swiss actress Ir\u00e8ne Jacob as Desdemona struggled with the verse, as did Laurence Fishburne as Othello. Iago was Kenneth Branagh in his first outing as a screen villain. The overall effect was to create, in Douglas Brode's words \"the tragedy of Iago\"\u2014a performance in which Iago's dominance is such that Othello is a foil to him, not the other way around. The film was described as a \"fair stab at turning the Bard into a decent night at the multiplex\" but failed to achieve success at the box office.\nOther adaptations of Shakespeare's story to be filmed include Franco Zeffirelli's 1986 film of Verdi's \"Otello\" and the 1956 \"Jubal\" which resets the story as a Western, centered on the Cassio character. The play was abridged to 30 minutes by Leon Garfield, and produced with cel animation for the TV series \"\". Tim Blake Nelson's basketball-themed teen drama \"O\" reset the story at an elite boarding school. The similarity of the film's ending to the Columbine massacre, which happened while the film was being edited, delayed its release for over two years, until August 2001. A British TV adaptation by Andrew Davies, screened in 2001, re-set the story among senior officers of the Metropolitan Police. And the first decade of the 21st-Century saw two non-English language film adaptations: Alexander Abela's French \"Souli\" set the story in a modern-day Madagascan fishing village, and Vishal Bhardwaj's Hindi \"Omkara\" amidst political violence in modern Uttar Pradesh. The 1997 Malayalam film \"Kaliyattam\" is an adaptation set against the backdrop of Theyyam artform of Kerala.The 2023 Malayalam film \"Iru\" is an adaptation set against a campus political love story in Kerala. The 2024 Bengali film \"Athhoi\" is an adaptation set against a fictional town of Vinsura in West Bengal. \nOther media.\nStage adaptations.\nAdaptations of\u2014or borrowings from\u2014Shakespeare's \"Othello\" began shortly after it first appeared, including Middleton &amp; Rowley's 1622 \"The Changeling\", John Ford's 1632 \"Love's Sacrifice\", Thomas Porter's 1662 \"The Villain\" and Henry Nevil Payne's 1673 \"The Fatal Jealousy\". Edward Young's 1721 play \"The Revenge\" reversed the racial roles, featuring the \"swagger part\" of a black villain called Zanga whose victim was a white man.\nVoltaire's 1732 French play \"Za\u00efre\" was a \"neoclassical refurbishment\" of Shakespeare's \"barbarous\" work. And across continental Europe through most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the play was better known than Shakespeare's in Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ducis' adaptation and its subsequent translations, in which a heroine renamed H\u00e9delmone is stabbed to death by Othello.\nPart of the explosion of the Romantic movement in France was a fashion for re-writing English plays as melodrama, including Alfred de Vigny's 1829 \"Othello\" adaptation \"Le More de Venise\".\nAfter the Restoration, London Theatres other than the patent companies got around the illegality of performing Shakespeare by allusion and parody, such as Charles Westmacott's \"Othello The Moor of Fleet Street\" at the Adelphi in 1833.\nIn the 19th-Century United States, \"Othello\" was often used in parody, sometimes allied with minstrel shows: with the contrast between Shakespearean verse and African-American dialect a source of racist humour. Indeed, racist parodies were common in the aftermath of the abolition of the slave trade in the UK and, later, in the US: for example Maurice Dowling's 1834 \"Othello Travestie\", George W H Griffin's 1870 \"Othello (Ethiopian Burlesque)\", the anonymous \"Desdemonum An Ethiopian Burlesque\" of 1874 and the anonymous \"Dar's de Money (Othello Burlesque)\" of 1880.\nThe Black Arts Movement appropriated \"Othello\" in an entirely different vein. Amiri Baraka's twinned 1964 plays \"Dutchman\" and \"Slave\" are said to \"represent the ultimate African American revision of \"Othello\", especially in \"Dutchman's\" murder of Clay, a black man, by Lulu, a white woman.\nThe \"Othello\" story became the rock opera \"Catch My Soul\" in 1968, depicting Othello as a charismatic religious cult leader, Desdemona as a naive convert, and Iago as a malcontent cult member who thinks himself to be Satan. In Murray Carlin's 1969 \"Not Now Sweet Desdemona\" the protagonist says of Shakespeare's play that it was \"the first play of the Age of Imperialism ... \"Othello\" is about colour and nothing but colour.\" Charles Marowitz's 1974 \"An Othello\" reworked the play in the context of the Black Power movement. C. Bernard Jackson's 1979 \"Iago\" made Iago himself a Moor and a victim of racism. And Caleen Sinnette Jennings' 1999 \"Casting Othello\" is a metadrama about a performance of Shakespeare's play, and the racial tensions it evokes.\nRoysten Abel's \"Othello - A Play in Black and White\" is set among a group of Indian actors rehearsing a Kathakali version of \"Othello\" whose own story begins to mirror the play's plot: with Iago's seduction of Othello played as a guru-disciple relationship.\nAmong feminist appropriations of the \"Othello\" story, Paula Vogel's 1994 \"Desdemona, A Play about a Handkerchief\" sets the story in a kitchen in Cyprus, where only Desdemona, Emilia and Bianca appear. In Djanet Sears' 1998 \"Harlem Duet\", Othello's lover challenges his subservient passion: \"...why you trying to please her? ... I'm so tired of pleasing White folks.\" And Toni Morrison and Rokia Traor\u00e9's 2012 \"Desdemona\" sets its story in a timeless afterlife of the characters, in which Othello and Desdemona have leisure to talk through all facets of their relationship, and in which Desdemona is reunited with her former maid Barbary, whose actual name is Sa'ran.\n\"Othello\" is parodied in the form of a rap song in the stage show \"The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)\". In 2012, the Q Brothers debuted \"Othello: The Remix\", a 90-minute hip-hop version of \"Othello\" that was part of the Globe to Globe Festival and World Shakespeare Festival. It was one of the few sold-out shows during the festival and went on to have several successful international tours.\nAudio.\nOne of the first full-length plays to be released on vinyl was the Broadway production starring Paul Robeson, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and Uta Hagen, issued in 1944. \"Othello\" has been performed on at least twelve separate occasions on BBC Radio.\nMusic.\n\"The Willow Song\", sung by Desdemona in Act 4 Scene 3, is not an original creation of Shakespeare's, but was already a well-known ballad. As such it has surviving arrangements from both before and after Shakespeare's time. The version of it thought to be most authentic, because it closely matches the lyric given by Shakespeare, is known as \"The Poore Soule Sate Sighing\" and is one of the most performed pieces of early modern English music.\nThe two other songs sung in the play are the drinking songs in Act 2 Scene 3. The first of these, \"And Let Me The Cannikin Clink\", has no surviving arrangement, although it fits to several extant popular tunes. The other, \"King Stephen Was a Worthy Peer\", is the seventh of the eight stanzas of the existing ballad \"Take Thy Old Cloak About Thee\".\nThe play has been a popular source for opera. Rossini's 1816 \"Otello, ossia il Moro di Venezia\" made Desdemona its focus, and was followed by numerous translations and adaptations, including one with a happy ending. But the most notable version, considered a masterpiece with a power equivalent to that of the play, is Verdi's 1887 \"Otello\", for which Arrigo Boito's libretto marked a return to faithfulness to the original plot, including the reappearance of the pillow as the murder weapon, rather than Ducis' dagger.\n\"Othello\" was, with \"Antony and Cleopatra\", one of the two plays which most influenced Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's jazz suite \"Such Sweet Thunder\". Its opening track (itself titled \"Such Sweet Thunder\", a quotation from Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\") came to stand for Othello telling his tales of travel and adventure to Desdemona, as reported in the play's first act.\nSometimes the order of the play influencing a composer is reversed, as in the appropriations of classical music by filmmakers retelling Othello's story: for example in the film \"O\", in which excerpts from Verdi's \"Otello\" are used as a theme for Odin (the Othello character) while modern rap and hip-hop are more associated with the white college students around him.\nBob Dylan's song Po' Boy features lyrics in which Desdemona turns the tables on Othello, borrowing the idea of using poisoned wine from the final act of \"Hamlet\".\nLiterature.\nAphra Behn's 1688 novel \"Oroonoko\", and its subsequent dramatisation by Thomas Southerne, reset Othello's enslavement in the context of the then-current Atlantic triangle.\nIn addition to his theatrical performances noted above, the play was also central to Konstantin Stanislavski's writings, and to the development of his \"system\". In particular, the part of Othello is a main subject of his book Creating a Role. In it, the characters of Tortzov, the director, and Kostya, the young actor \u2013 both partly autobiographical \u2013 rehearse the role of Othello in the opening act.\nA plot-line in Farrukh Dhondy's novel \"Black Swan\" involves the central character Lazarus, a freed slave, travelling to London in the time of Shakespeare and authoring many of the plays attributed to Shakespeare, including \"Othello\", in a production of which Lazarus plays the title character, and kills himself. The narrative voice of Caryl Phillips 1997 novel \"The Nature of Blood\" harangues Othello as a sexual and political sell-out. And in Sudanese novelist Tayeb Salih's retelling of the \"Othello\" story, \"Season of Migration to the North\", the central character Mustafa Sa'eed, on trial for the murder of his white mistress, refuses to be judged by the standards of the play, declaring:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Othello was a lie.\"\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22461", "revid": "37442177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22461", "title": "Osteoporosis", "text": "Skeletal disorder\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nOsteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to more porous bone, and consequent increase in fracture risk.\nIt is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, the wrist, and the hip.\nUntil a broken bone occurs, there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. After the broken bone heals, some people may have chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities.\nOsteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Bone loss increases after menopause in women due to lower levels of estrogen, and after andropause in older men due to lower levels of testosterone. Osteoporosis may also occur due to several diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia or underweight, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and after oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries). Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, glucocorticosteroids, and overzealous levothyroxine suppression therapy. Smoking and sedentary lifestyle are also recognized as major risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA).\nPrevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood, hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they have been shown to be less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death.\nOsteoporosis becomes more common with age. About 15% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. It is more common in women than men. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear. About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 and 2 million men had osteoporosis. White and Asian people are at greater risk for low bone mineral density due to their lower serum vitamin D levels and less vitamin D synthesis at certain latitudes. The word \"osteoporosis\" is from the Greek terms for \"porous bones\".\nSigns and symptoms.\nOsteoporosis has no symptoms, and the person usually does not know that they have osteoporosis until a bone is broken. Osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist. Examples of situations where people would not normally break a bone include a fall from standing height, normal day-to-day activities such as lifting, bending, or coughing.\nFractures.\nFractures are a common complication of osteoporosis and can result in disability. Acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from osteoporosis and can lead to further disability and early mortality. These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder, and hip. The symptoms of a vertebral collapse (\"compression fracture\") are sudden back pain, often with radicular pain (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.\nFractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery. Hip fracture, in particular, usually requires prompt surgery, as serious risks are associated with it, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. There is also an increased risk of mortality associated with osteoporosis-related hip fracture, with the mean average mortality rate within one year for Europe being 23.3%, for Asia 17.9%, United States 21% and Australia 24.9%.\nFracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria, including bone mineral density, age, smoking, alcohol usage, weight, and gender. Recognized calculators include FRAX, the Garvan FRC calculator and QFracture as well as the open-access FREM tool. The FRAX tool can also be applied in a modification adapted to routinely collected health data.\nThe term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome.\nRisk of falls.\nThere is an increased risk of falls associated with aging. These falls can lead to skeletal damage at the wrist, spine, hip, knee, foot, and ankle. Part of the fall risk is because of impaired eyesight (e.g. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle), and collapse (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness). Causes of syncope are manifold, but may include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and seizures. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls. Those with previous falls, as well as those with gait or balance disorders, are most at risk.\nComplications.\nAs well as susceptibility to breaks and fractures, osteoporosis can lead to other complications. Bone fractures from osteoporosis can lead to disability and an increased risk of death after the injury in elderly people. Osteoporosis can decrease the quality of life, increase disabilities, and increase the financial costs to health care systems.\nRisk factors.\nThe risk of having osteoporosis includes age and sex. Risk factors include both non-modifiable (for example, age and some medications that may be necessary to treat a different condition) and modifiable (for example, alcohol use, smoking, and vitamin deficiency). In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable.\nCaffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. White people have a higher risk for the disease.\nMedical disorders.\nMany diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown.\nMedication.\nCertain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging concerning other drugs.\nPregnancy-associated osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis due to pregnancy and lactation is a rare condition of unknown cause.\nEvolutionary.\nAge-related bone loss is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species. Because of the more porous bones of humans, frequency of severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures is higher. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost, but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism, inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. It has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts, who have four surfaces to disperse the force. In addition, the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans, which may lead to a higher likelihood of showing signs of osteoporosis.\nFracture risk assessment.\nIn the absence of risk factors other than sex and age, a BMD measurement using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is recommended for women at age 65. For women with risk factors, a clinical FRAX is advised at age 50.\nMechanics.\nOsteoporosis occurs when a reduction in bone mass surpasses a critical threshold, with greater susceptibility to fracturing. Fractures occur when the force acting on a bone is greater than the strength of the bone. To understand the pathology of osteoporosis and skeletal degradation, studying the mechanical properties and behavior of bone is crucial, due to the under-diagnosing of osteoporosis. Mechanical properties of a material depend on the geometry and inherent structure of the materials. Bone as a material is very complex because of its hierarchical structure in which characteristics vary across length scales. At the basic scale, bone is composed of an organic matrix of collagen type-I. Collagen type-I molecules form a composite material with hydroxyapatite to make up collagen fibrils. The hierarchal structure continuous with the fibrils being arranged into different patterns such as lamellae. The microstructure of bone then forms vascular channels, called osteons, which are surrounded by lamellae. At the subsequent scale of bones, there are different types of bone based on morphology: cortical (solid), cancellous (sponge), or trabecular (thin plates).\nA basic understanding of the hierarchical structure of bones is essential because the structure will translate to the mechanical behavior of bones. Previous work suggests that osteoporotic bones undergo specific structural changes that contribute to altered mechanical behavior. For instance, a study demonstrated that osteoporotic bone exhibits reduced bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, and connectivity. In another study, osteoporosis in human cancellous bone led to 3-27% variability in the stiffness and strength compared to health bone. Additionally, bone mineral density (BMD) is a parameter used to evaluate fracture risk in bones and is used as a predictor of osteoporosis. A lower BMD value correlates to decreased bone and a higher bone fragility. Furthermore, bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, are known to alter the composition of collagen and other proteins that make up the bone matrix. These alterations in composition contribute to how bone can handle mechanical loading. Thus, osteoporosis-induced changes at the macroscopic and microscopic levels significantly impact the mechanical properties of bone, predisposing individuals to fractures even under relatively low mechanical loads. Understanding these structural alterations is vital for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis.\nPathogenesis.\nThe underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. In normal bone, matrix remodeling of bone is constant; up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost &amp; Thomas in 1963. Osteoclasts are assisted by transcription factor PU.1 to degrade the bone matrix, while osteoblasts rebuild the bone matrix. Low bone mass density can then occur when osteoclasts are degrading the bone matrix faster than the osteoblasts are rebuilding the bone.\nThe three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to mesenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g., as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreases the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The \u03b1-form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.\nThe activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) is one of the best-studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g., lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK, and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors. The role of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis. Osteoclast maturation and activity is also regulated by activation of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Menopause-associated increase production of TNF-\u03b1 stimulates stromal cells to produce colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) which activates CSF1R and stimulates osteoclasts to reabsorb bone.\nTrabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break (\"microcracks\") and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip, and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30\u201335, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.\nDiagnosis.\nOsteoporosis often has no clear symptoms in the early stages, making it difficult to detect without screening. However, you may experience signs such as unexplained back pain, loss of height, or a stooped posture as the condition progresses.https:// Osteoporosis can be diagnosed using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD). The most popular method of measuring BMD is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\nIn addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease, and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.\nConventional radiography.\nConventional radiography is useful, both by itself and in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to the detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.\nThe main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures, for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can be objectively made using plain-film X-rays by using several methods, such as height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.\nDual-energy X-ray.\nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30\u201340-year-old:58), healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age.:58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:\nThe International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made based on densitometric criteria alone. It also states that, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather than T-scores should be used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone.\nBiomarkers.\nChemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen, an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis.\nOther measuring tools.\nQuantitative computed tomography (QCT) differs from DXA in that it gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm3 rather than BMD's relative Z-score. Among QCT's advantages: it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient's subpopulation in order to create a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.\nQuantitative ultrasound has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing radiation is involved, measurements can be made quickly and easily, and the cost of the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Some ultrasound devices can be used on the tibia.\nScreening.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all women 65\u00a0years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. Additionally, they recommend screening younger women with risk factors. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening.\nIn men, the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70\u2011year\u2011old. A number of tools exist to help determine who is reasonable to test.\nPrevention.\nLifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is, in many aspects, the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it.\nIn people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. The diet must ensure optimal calcium intake (of at least one gram daily), and measuring vitamin D levels is recommended, and taking specific supplements if necessary.\nOsteoporosis can affect nearly 1 in 3 women, and the bone loss is the most rapid within the first 2\u20133 years after menopause. This can be prevented by menopause hormone therapy, or MHT, which is meant to prevent bone loss and the degradation of the bone microarchitecture and is noted to reduce the risk of fractures in bones by 20-30%. However, MHT has been linked to safety concerns, so it is not generally recommended. As far as management goes with this potentially limiting disease, some practices can and should be implemented within the daily lifestyle. For example, it would be beneficial if the individual with osteoporosis refrained from consuming excess alcohol and avoided smoking. These individuals should also be intentional about intaking an adequate amount of protein, calcium, and vitamin D. If the woman has an even higher risk of fracture, managing this may require therapy. Generally, the recommended treatment to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density is physical activity. Exercise is sometimes the best medicine. Resistance training is the most recommended method of physical activity, but that can come in multiple forms. High intensity and high impact training is shown to be extremely beneficial in improving bone health and the most effective in improving, maintaining bone density in the lower spine and femur. Although these types of exercises are safe for postmenopausal women, there may still be a need for supervision and precautionary measures.\nNutrition.\nStudies of the benefits of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1\u00a0g of calcium and 400\u00a0IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures. While some meta-analyses have found a benefit of vitamin D supplements combined with calcium for prevention of fractures, they did not find a benefit of vitamin D supplements (800 IU/day or less) alone. Regarding adverse effects, supplementation does not appear to affect overall risk of death, although calcium supplementation could potentially be associated with some increased risk of myocardial infarctions, stroke, kidney stones, and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is no evidence that supplementation before menopause can enhance bone mineral density.\nVitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. The gene gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is dependent on vitamin K. Functional polymorphisms in the gene could attribute to variation in bone metabolism and BMD. Vitamin K2 is also used as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphisms of GGCX could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin K.\nDietary sources of calcium include dairy products, leafy greens, legumes, and beans. There has been conflicting evidence about whether or not dairy is an adequate source of calcium to prevent fractures. The National Academy of Sciences recommends 1,000\u00a0mg of calcium for those aged 19\u201350, and 1,200\u00a0mg for those aged 50 and above. A review of the evidence shows no adverse effect of higher protein intake on bone health.\nPhysical exercise.\nEvidence suggests that exercise can help promote bone health in older people. In particular, physical exercise can be beneficial for bone density in postmenopausal women, and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). Weight bearing exercise has been found to cause an adaptive response in the skeleton, promoting osteoblast activity and protecting bone density. A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Limitations in the available evidence hinder the production of detailed evidence-based exercise recommendations. Some expert consensus guidance does exist. International guidelines recommend multicomponent exercise tailored to individual needs that includes \"balance and mobility training, paired with weight bearing exercise, progressive resistance training, and posture exercises\" (generally accompanied by optimal nutrition). Cycling and swimming are not considered weight-bearing exercise, and neither helps slow age-related bone loss (professional bicycle racing has a negative effect on bone density). Risk of adverse events from the types of exercise usually considered appropriate for people with osteoporosis is generally low (though repeated forceful forward spinal bends are discouraged).\nFor people who have had vertebral fractures, there is moderate-quality evidence that exercise is likely to improve physical performance, as well as some low-quality evidence suggesting that exercise may reduce pain and improve quality of life.\nPhysical exercise prescription.\nOsteoporosis is a very prevalent disease in the elderly population, but not much is known about the optimal prescription and dosage of physical exercise to help prevent bone mineral loss. A lot of the focus around osteoporosis is prevention-oriented, rather than maintenance-focused, which should be the frontrunner when considering what approach to take. When prescribing exercise, an aspect to take into consideration is the individual's needs. This can be attained by conducting a pre-exercise evaluation or screening. Exercise should also be tailored to the individual and what works for them. Important things often overlooked when treating osteoporosis are muscle strength and maintenance of BMD, which should be incorporated into the program to optimize the benefits of exercise. This entails including exercises that focus on and improve muscle strength and exercises that focus on and improve skeletal strength or BMD, as these go hand in hand for reducing fall and fracture risk. It's also important to reference the ACSM general training principle to better design a program for the individual. Which mode of exercise and dosage has been a recurring question for treating osteoporosis. Many studies have found that multimodal exercise programs improve factors related to osteoporosis. Factors include lower limb strength, balance, flexibility, and risk of falls. Other modes of exercise have also proven to improve individuals with osteoporosis, some of these modes include weight-bearing, resistance specifically progressive resistance, and aerobic exercise. The recommendations for these types of exercises are as follows: weight-bearing exercise should be done 4\u20137 days a week, moderate to high intensity, activities should be multidirectional, and load should be more than the typical everyday load on bones. Some examples of exercises are jumping, skipping, hopping, depth jumps, etc.\u00a0 Recommended dosage for progressive resistance training is 2 or more days a week, intensity (load) should start low and increase gradually. Resistance training should focus on major muscle groups used for functional movements as well as muscles that have direct stress on bones susceptible to fracture. Considerations for resistance training are to teach proper lifting techniques and be careful with lifting weights above the head. Lastly, aerobic exercise has minimal effect on preventing BMD loss unless done at a higher intensity or with a load like a weighted vest. Considerations with this mode are that this may cause a higher risk of falls or fractures. Improvements can also be observed in other ways, such as decreased Timed-Up-and-Go, increased Sit-To-Stand, and increased One-Leg-Stance-Test. A study with a 12-week exercise intervention on postmenopausal osteoporotic women observed a 2.27 decrease in TUG times in their experimental group. The overall thing to note when prescribing exercise for individuals with osteoporosis is to evaluate the individual's needs and then individualize their program with multiple exercise modalities that work for them, emphasizing increasing muscle strength as well as maintaining bone mass.\nPhysical therapy.\nPeople with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. Postural control is important to maintaining functional movements such as walking and standing. Physical therapy may be an effective way to address postural weakness that may result from vertebral fractures, which are common in people with osteoporosis. Physical therapy treatment plans for people with vertebral fractures include balance training, postural correction, trunk and lower extremity muscle strengthening exercises, and moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. Physical therapy interventions were also designed to slow the rate of bone loss through home exercise programs.\nWhole body vibration therapy has also been suggested as a physical therapy intervention. Moderate to low-quality evidence indicates that whole body vibration therapy may reduce the risk of falls. There are conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density.\nPhysical therapy can aid in the overall prevention in the development of osteoporosis through therapeutic exercise. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, therefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on drugs. Specific exercise interacts with the body's hormones and signaling pathways, which encourages the maintenance of a healthy skeleton.\nHormone therapy.\nReduced estrogen levels increase the risk of osteoporosis, so hormone replacement therapy when women reach the menopause may reduce the incidence of osteoporosis. A more natural way of restoring hormone levels in postmenopausal women includes participating in specific forms of exercise. Weight-bearing exercises and resistance training exercises such as squats with weights, step-ups, lunges, stair climbing, and even jogging can elicit hormone responses that are advantageous for post-menopausal women living with osteoporosis. These exercises result in the release of growth hormone and Insulin-like growth factor-1 or IGF-1 which participate in bone remodeling. Stress is applied to the bones, thus activating osteoblast, which are cells that form new bones and grow and heal existing bones while restoring hormones that increase bone density. Resistance training exercises, like weightlifting, can lead to a brief increase in anabolic hormones, like testosterone, which aid in muscle and bone strength.\nThe increase in mechanical tension during resistance exercise will likely help stimulate the production of Insulin-like growth factors in the bone, but at a greater extent. Post-menopausal women experience a reduction of estrogen, which is essential for bone density, so these exercise-induced hormonal enhancements can counteract the loss of bone mineral density in the most critical areas, like the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Research suggests that regular resistance training accompanied with weight-bearing activities help reduce the progression of osteoporosis and risk of fracture.\nManagement.\nLifestyle Changes.\nWeight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Daily intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended for postmenopausal women. Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically among those who are in care homes.\nPharmacologic therapy.\nThe US National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends pharmacologic treatment for patients with hip or spine fracture thought to be related to osteoporosis, those with BMD 2.5 SD or more below the young normal mean (T-score -2.5 or below), and those with BMD between 1 and 2.5 SD below normal mean whose 10-year risk, using FRAX, for hip fracture is equal or more than 3%.\nBisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis. This benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. Different bisphosphonates have not been directly compared; therefore, it is unknown if one is better than another. Fracture risk reduction is between 25 and 70%, depending on the bone involved. There are concerns of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw with long-term use, but these risks are low. With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. One medical organization recommends that after five years of medications by mouth or three years of intravenous medication among those at low risk, bisphosphonate treatment can be stopped. In those at higher risk, they recommend up to ten years of medication by mouth or six years of intravenous treatment.\nThe goal of osteoporosis management is to prevent osteoporotic fractures, but for those who have sustained one already it is more urgent to prevent a secondary fracture. That is because patients with a fracture are more likely to experience a recurrent fracture, with a marked increase in morbidity and mortality compared. Among the five bisphosphonates, no significant differences were found for a secondary fracture for all fracture endpoints combined. That being said, alendronate was identified as the most efficacious for secondary prevention of vertebral and hip fractures, while zoledronate showed better performance for nonvertebral non-hip fracture prevention. There is concern that many people do not receive appropriate pharmacological therapy after a low-impact fracture.\nFor those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture, evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. Alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but does not have any effect on other types of fractures. Half stop their medications within a year. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. There is tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis.\nFluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures.\nTeriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) is effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, there is not clear evidence of benefit in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone has been shown to improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin, while once recommended, is no longer recommended due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk. Alendronic acid/colecalciferol can be taken to treat this condition in post-menopausal women.\nRomosozumab (sold under the brand name Evenity) is a monoclonal antibody against sclerostin. Romosozumab is usually reserved for patients with very high fracture risk and is the only available drug therapy for osteoporosis that leads to simultaneous inhibition of bone resorption together with an anabolic effect.\nCertain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Tentative evidence suggests that Chinese herbal medicines may have potential benefits on bone mineral density.\nPrognosis.\nAlthough people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal.\nHip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications (such as deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia). The six-month mortality rate for those aged 50 and above following hip fracture was found to be around 13.5%, with a substantial proportion (almost 13%) needing total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture.\nVertebral fractures, while having a smaller impact on mortality, can lead to severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunchback (kyphosis), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.\nApart from the risk of death and other complications, osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health-related quality of life.\nThe condition is responsible for millions of fractures annually, mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae, hip, and wrist. Fragility fractures of ribs are also common in men.\nFractures.\nHip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. In the United States, more than 250,000 hip fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis. A 50-year-old white woman is estimated to have a 17.5% lifetime risk of fracture of the proximal femur. The incidence of hip fractures increases each decade from the sixth through the ninth for both women and men across all populations. The highest incidence is found among men and women aged 80 or older.\nBetween 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebral fracture. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already sustained a vertebral fracture at entry into the study, and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture.\nIn the United States, 250,000 wrist fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis. Wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture.\nFragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and develop the fracture in the course of physical activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing.\nEpidemiology.\nOsteoporosis becomes more common with age, especially after 50 years (its prevalence rises from about 2% at 50 years to almost 50% by the age of 80). It affects women more than men due to the sharp fall in estrogen production that follows menopause. Globally, it is estimated that 21.2% of women and 6.3% of men over the age of 50 have osteoporosis, corresponding to a total of around 500 million people worldwide. About 15% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear.\nFrom the age of 50 onwards, fractures (including hip fractures) are roughly twice as common in women than in men. A 60-year-old woman has a 44% chance of experiencing a fracture in her lifetime, whereas the lifetime risk for a 60-year-old man is only 25%. Such differences can be attributed to the increased risk of osteoporosis due to decreased estrogen levels following menopause.\nIn 2019, up to 37 million fragility fractures linked to osteoporosis were thought to occur in people over the age of 55 worldwide. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. White and Asian people are at greater risk. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture.\nIt has been shown that latitude affects the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Areas of higher latitude such as Northern Europe receive less Vitamin D through sunlight compared to regions closer to the equator, and consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison to lower latitudes. For example, Swedish men and women have a 13% and 28.5% risk of hip fracture by age 50, respectively, whereas this risk is only 1.9% and 2.4% in Chinese men and women. Diet may also be a factor that is responsible for this difference, as vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and folate are all linked to bone mineral density.\nThere is also an association between Celiac Disease and increased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. Celiac Disease can decrease absorption of nutrients in the small intestine such as calcium, and a gluten-free diet can help people with Celiac Disease to revert to normal absorption in the gut.\nAbout 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year on healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually on related healthcare costs.\nHistory.\nResearch on age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. French pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term \"osteoporosis\". The American endocrinologist Fuller Albright linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state.\nAnthropologists have studied skeletal remains that showed loss of bone density and associated structural changes that were linked to a chronic malnutrition in the agricultural area in which these individuals lived. \"It follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition\", causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22467", "revid": "51041878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22467", "title": "Oklahoma City bombing", "text": "1995 domestic terrorist attack in the US\nThe Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, United States, on April 19, 1995. The bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. Perpetrated by anti-government extremists Timothy McVeigh and his accomplice Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 167 people, injured 684, and destroyed more than a third of the building, which had to be demolished. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings and caused an estimated $652 million worth of damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers. A rescue worker was killed by being struck on the head by falling debris after the bombing, bringing the total death toll to 168.\nWithin 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a sympathizer with the U.S. militia movement, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives he parked in front of the building. Nichols had assisted with the bomb's preparation and plan. McVeigh and Nichols were motivated by their anger at the U.S. federal government and its handling of the law enforcement sieges at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and Waco in 1993, as well as the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban. McVeigh had timed the retaliatory attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the end of the siege in Waco and the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first engagements of the American Revolution.\nThe official FBI investigation, known as \"OKBOMB\", involved 28,000 interviews, 3,200 kg\u00a0(7,100 lbs) of evidence, and nearly one billion pieces of information. When the FBI raided McVeigh's home, they found a telephone number that led them to a farm where McVeigh had purchased supplies for the bombing. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the U.S. federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. In response to the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which limited access to \"habeas corpus\" in the United States, among other provisions. It also passed legislation to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks.\nEvents.\nPlanning.\nMotive.\nThe chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. McVeigh met Michael Fortier as his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. McVeigh and Nichols were radicalized by white supremacist and antigovernment propaganda. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, as well as the Waco siege, a 51-day standoff in 1993 between the FBI and Branch Davidian members that began with a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) attempt to execute a search and arrest warrant. There was a shootout and ultimately a siege of the compound, resulting in the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 81 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and again after the siege ended. He later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids and to protest what he believed to be U.S. government efforts to restrict the rights of private citizens, particularly those under the Second Amendment. McVeigh had stated that federal agents were acting like soldiers, thus making an attack on a federal building, an attack on their \"command centers\".\nTarget selection.\nMcVeigh later said that, instead of bombing a building, he had contemplated a \"campaign of individual assassination\". Potential targets in this campaign included United States Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Hostage Rescue Team sniper Lon Horiuchi. He initially intended to destroy only a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be more powerful if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for attack sites was that the target should house at least two of these three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.\nA resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He said in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out Simmons Tower, a 40-story building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because a florist's shop occupied space on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect what would become the target of their campaign: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.\nThe nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed 14 federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.\nMcVeigh chose the Murrah building because he expected its glass front to shatter under the impact of the blast. He also believed that its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. McVeigh also believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. He planned the attack for April 19, 1995, to coincide with the second anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord during the American Revolution. Rumors have alleged that the bombing was also connected to the planned execution of Richard Snell, an Arkansas white supremacist who was a member of the Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) and who was due to be executed the day the bombing took place. Prior to his execution, Snell predicted that a bombing would take place that day. Though his execution was not confirmed to be a motive for the bombing, Fort Smith\u2013based federal prosecutor Steven Snyder told the FBI in May 1995 that Snell wanted to blow up the Oklahoma City building as revenge for the IRS raiding his home.\nGathering materials.\nMcVeigh and Nichols bought or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb and stored them in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine binary-explosive Kinestiks from gun collector Roger E. Moore in Arkansas, and with Nichols ignited the devices outside Nichols's home in Herington, Kansas. On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer from Mid-Kansas Coop in McPherson, Kansas, enough to fertilize of farmland at a rate of of nitrogen per acre (.4 ha), an amount commonly used for corn. Nichols bought an additional bag on October 18, 1994. McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project, but he refused.\nMcVeigh and Nichols then robbed Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim's van. McVeigh wrote Moore a letter in which he claimed that government agents had committed the robbery. Items stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols's home and in a storage shed he had rented.\nIn October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael and his wife Lori Fortier a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than of ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with about of liquid nitromethane and of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved too expensive. McVeigh and his accomplices then attempted to purchase drums of nitromethane at various NHRA Drag Racing Series events during the season. His first attempt was at the Sears Craftsman Nationals, held at Heartland Motorsports Park in Pauline, Kansas. World Wide Racing Fuels representative Steve Lesueur, one of three dealers of nitromethane, was at his unit when he noted a \"young man in fatigues\" wanted to purchase nitromethane and hydrazine. Another fuel salesman, Glynn Tipton, of VP Racing Fuels, testified on May 1, 1997, about McVeigh's attempts to buy nitromethane and hydrazine. After the event, Tipton informed Wade Gray of Texas Allied Chemical, a chemical agent for VP Racing Fuels, who informed Tipton of the explosiveness of a nitromethane and hydrazine mixture. McVeigh, using an assumed name, then called Tipton's office. Suspicious of his behavior, Tipton refused to sell McVeigh the fuel.\nThe next round of the NHRA championship tour was the Chief Auto Parts Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis, Texas, where McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer and attempted to purchase nitromethane on the pretext that he and some fellow bikers needed it for racing. However, there were no nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and he did not have an NHRA competition license. Lesueur again refused to sell McVeigh the fuel because he was suspicious of McVeigh's actions and attitudes, but VP Racing Fuels representative Tim Chambers sold McVeigh three barrels. Chambers questioned the purchase of three barrels, when typically no more than five gallons would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, and the class was not even raced that weekend.\nMcVeigh rented a storage space in which he stockpiled seven crates of Tovex \"sausages\", 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry near Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it was powerful enough (he did obtain 17 bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb that was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Think about the people as if they were storm troopers in \"Star Wars\". They may be individually innocent, but they are guilty because they work for the Evil Empire.\u2014\u200a\nLater, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, \"You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it.\" He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.\nOn April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The next day, he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because it reminded him of the Klingon warriors of \"Star Trek\". On April 16, he and Nichols drove to Oklahoma City, where he parked a getaway car, a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis, several blocks from the Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the car's license plate, he left a note covering the vehicle identification number (VIN) plate that read, \"Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery &amp; cable).\" Both men then returned to Kansas.\nBuilding the bomb.\nOn April 17\u201318, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed the bomb supplies from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded them into the Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly . McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay so he could ignite at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by tamping (placing material against explosives opposite the target of the explosion) the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards \"J\"; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM (ammonium nitrate\u2013nitromethane mixture) contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion.\nMcVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two more holes were drilled in the body of the truck. One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around of the high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the of Tovex Blastrite Gel sausages, which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13 filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the two men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh traveled with the truck to Junction City. The bomb cost about $ to make.\nBombing.\nMcVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11\u00a0a.m., but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9\u00a0a.m. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from \"The Turner Diaries\"\u2014a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with \"Sic semper tyrannis\" (\"Thus always to tyrants\")\u2014what according to legend Brutus said during the assassination of Julius Caesar and is also claimed to have been shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln\u2014and \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the slogan, falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson, \"When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\" Underneath, McVeigh had written, \"Maybe now, there will be liberty!\" with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.\nMcVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50\u00a0a.m. At 8:57\u00a0a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited, and locked the truck. As he headed to his getaway vehicle, he dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away.\nAt 9:02\u00a0a.m. (14:02 UTC), the Ryder truck, containing over of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. In total, 168 people were killed and hundreds more injured. One-third of the building was destroyed by the explosion, which created a , crater on NW 5th Street next to the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a four-block radius, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings. The broken glass alone accounted for five percent of the death total and 69 percent of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86 cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down several offices in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage.\nThe effects of the blast were equivalent to over of TNT, and could be heard and felt up to away. Seismometers at the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma City, away, and in Norman, Oklahoma, away, recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3.0 on the Richter magnitude scale.\nThe collapse of the northern half of the building took roughly seven seconds. As the truck exploded, it first destroyed the column next to it, designated as G20, and shattered the entire glass facade of the building. The shockwave of the explosion forced the lower floors upwards, before the fourth and fifth floors collapsed onto the third floor, which housed a transfer beam that ran the length of the building and was being supported by four pillars below, as well as supporting the pillars that hold the upper floors. The added weight meant that the third floor gave way along with the transfer beam, which in turn caused the collapse of the building.\nArrests.\nInitially, the FBI had three hypotheses about responsibility for the bombing: international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing; a drug cartel, carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents in the building's DEA office; and anti-government radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.\nMcVeigh was arrested within 90\u00a0minutes of the explosion, as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County, Oklahoma. Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate, and arrested him for having a concealed weapon. For his home address, McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols's brother James's house in Michigan. After booking McVeigh into jail, Trooper Hanger searched his patrol car and found a business card which had been concealed by McVeigh after being handcuffed. Written on the back of the card, which was from a military surplus store in Antigo, Wisconsin, were the words \"TNT at $5 a stick. Need more.\" The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh's trial.\nWhile investigating the VIN on an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. McGown noted, \"People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [McVeigh] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him.\"\nAfter an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, but authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.\nFederal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of \"Hunter\" (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32\u00a0days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing ammunition to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.\nA Jordanian-American man traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was detained and questioned by the FBI at the airport. Several Arab-American groups criticized the FBI for racial profiling, and the subsequent media coverage for publicizing the man's name. Attorney General Reno denied claims that the federal government relied on racial profiling, while FBI director Louis J. Freeh told a press conference that the man was never a suspect, and was instead treated as a \"witness\" to the Oklahoma City bombing, who assisted the government's investigation.\nCasualties.\nAn estimated 650 people were inside the building when the bomb exploded. By the end of the day, 14 adults and six children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 167 confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 168th victim. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, and a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building. A rescue worker, Rebecca Anderson, was indirectly killed after the bombing, she was struck on the head by falling debris during rescue efforts, and is not counted in the direct death toll of the bombing.\nThe victims ranged in age from three months to 73 years and included three pregnant women. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation/Federal Highway Administration (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the federal government victims were federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents, four were members of the U.S. Secret Service; two were members of the U.S. Customs Service; one was a member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two were members of the U.S. Army; two were members of the U.S. Air Force, and two were members of the U.S. Marine Corps. The victims also included 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168\u00a0victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were abrasions, severe burns, and bone fractures.\nMcVeigh later acknowledged the casualties, saying, \"I didn't define the rules of engagement in this conflict. The rules, if not written down, are defined by the aggressor. It was brutal, no holds barred. Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge. You put back in [the government's] faces exactly what they're giving out.\" He later stated, \"I wanted the government to hurt like the people of Waco and Ruby Ridge had.\"\nResponse and relief.\nRescue efforts.\nAt 9:03\u00a0a.m., the first of over 1,800 911 calls related to the bombing were received by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23 minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465\u00a0members of the Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived within the hour to provide security, and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management. Terrance Yeakey and Jim Ramsey, from the Oklahoma City Police Department, were among the first officers to arrive at the site.\nThe EMS command post was set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large number of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple of hours following the bombing.\nWithin the first hour, 50\u00a0people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building. The injured were sent to every hospital in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce shock) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.\nAt 10:28\u00a0a.m., rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb. Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the evacuation of a four-block area around the site. The device was determined to be a three-foot (.9-m) long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb-sniffing dogs; although inert, it had been marked \"live\" in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting. On examination the missile was determined to be inert, and relief efforts resumed 45\u00a0minutes later. The last survivor, a 15-year-old girl found under the base of the collapsed building, was rescued at around 7\u00a0p.m.\nIn the days following the blast, over 12,000\u00a0people participated in relief and rescue operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, bringing in 665\u00a0rescue workers. One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris, and 26\u00a0other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries. Twenty-four K-9 units and out-of-state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris. In an effort to recover additional bodies, of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to 29.\nRescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12:05\u00a0a.m. on May 5, by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered. For safety reasons, the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward. McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial. At 7:02\u00a0a.m. on May 23, more than a month after the bombing, the Murrah Federal building was demolished. The EMS Command Center remained active and was staffed 24 hours a day until the demolition. The final three bodies to be recovered were those of two credit union employees and a customer. For several days after the building's demolition, trucks hauled away of debris a day from the site. Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators' trials, incorporated into memorials, donated to local schools, or sold to raise funds for relief efforts.\nHumanitarian aid.\nThe national humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000 meals over ten days.\nThe Salvation Army served over 100,000 meals and provided over 100,000 ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to rescue workers. Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000 units of blood donated, 131 were used; the rest were stored in blood banks.\nFederal and state government aid.\nAt 9:45\u00a0a.m., Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety. President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9:30\u00a0a.m. while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu \u00c7iller at the White House. Before addressing the nation, President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air, but decided against it. At 4\u00a0p.m., President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack on innocent children and defenseless citizens. It was an act of cowardice and it was evil. The United States will not tolerate it, and I will not allow the people of this country to be intimidated by evil cowards.\nHe ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at half-staff for 30 days in remembrance of the victims. Four days later, on April 23, 1995, Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City.\nNo major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40\u00a0million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18\u00a0million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided temporary financial assistance of food and shelter to the survivors.\nInternational reaction.\nInternational reactions to the bombing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and P. V. Narasimha Rao of India. Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the United Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations.\nSeveral countries offered to assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. France offered to send a special rescue unit, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in the investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.\nChildren affected.\nIn the wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100 day-care centers in the United States in 7,900 federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known \"... it might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage.\" The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing. This was corroborated by Nichols, who said that he and McVeigh did know about the daycare center in the building, and that they did not care. In April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutor at McVeigh's trial, questioned how McVeigh could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of a florist shop but at the Murrah building, not \"... notice that there's a child day-care center there, that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office?\"\nSchools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. Porter IV, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.\nAren Almon Kok, mother of Baylee Almon, said of the photo, \"It was very hard to go to stores because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. It was devastating. Everybody had seen my daughter dead. And that's all she became to them. She was a symbol. She was the girl in the fireman's arms. But she was a real person that got left behind.\"\nThe images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who, as demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to the bombing and many bomb-related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted seven weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students who had no connection or relationship to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, as contrasted to those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who had post-traumatic stress disorder.\nChildren were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or both parents in the blast, with seven children losing their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One orphan who was interviewed (of the at least ten orphaned children) reported sleepless nights and an obsession with death.\nPresident Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage, he was \"beyond angry\" and wanted to \"put [his] fist through the television\". Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with children about the bombing. Clinton said to the nation three days after the bombing, \"I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing ... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this\". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40 federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.\nMedia coverage.\nHundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident.\nMany initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Muslim terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some media reported that investigators wanted to question men of Middle Eastern appearance. Hamzi Moghrabi, chairman of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, blamed the media for harassment of Muslims and Arabs that took place after the bombing.\nAs the rescue effort wound down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named \"John Doe Number Two.\" Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, who did not resemble Nichols, with McVeigh.\nThose who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of Gore Vidal's essay \"The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh\".\nTrials and sentencing of the conspirators.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led the official investigation, known as OKBOMB, with Weldon L. Kennedy acting as special agent in charge. Kennedy oversaw 900 federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel, including 300 FBI agents, 200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 125 members of the Oklahoma National Guard, and 55 officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America's history, with FBI agents conducting 28,000 interviews, amassing of evidence, and collecting nearly one billion pieces of information. Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver, Colorado, ruling that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma. The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh, Nichols and Fortier.\nTimothy McVeigh.\nOpening statements in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading \"The Turner Diaries\". His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137 witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael Fortier revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori Fortier testified that she had created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.\nMcVeigh was represented by a team of six principal attorneys, led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a \"necessity defense\"\u2014which would argue that he was in \"imminent danger\" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that \"imminent\" does not mean \"immediate\": \"If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat.\" Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as \"the designated patsy\", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25 witnesses, including Frederic Whitehurst, over a one-week period. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.\nA key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to belong to Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine its owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe No. 2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.\nNumerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.\nThe jury deliberated for 23 hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000 documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. McVeigh invited conductor David Woodard to perform pre-requiem Mass music on the eve of his execution; while reproachful of McVeigh's capital wrongdoing, Woodard consented. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the president must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11, 2001. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38 years.\nTerry Nichols.\nNichols stood trial twice. He was first tried by the federal government in 1997, and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998, to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161 counts of first-degree murder (160 non-federal-agent victims and one fetus). On May 26, 2004, the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161\u00a0consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip from Gregory Scarpa Jr., searched a buried crawl space in Nichols's former house, and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.\nMichael and Lori Fortier.\nMichael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael's assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate the fake driver's license that was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Michael agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998, to 12 years in prison, and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, Michael was released from prison, transferred into the Witness Protection Program, and given a new identity.\nOthers.\nNo \"John Doe #2\" was ever identified, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols's trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: \"You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?\" On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written \"For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!\"\nAftermath.\nWithin 48 hours of the attack, and with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city. According to Mark Potok, director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, his organization tracked another 60 domestic smaller-scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858 domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004. Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500 agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks. A 2005 Federal Bureau of Investigation report said the bombing \"brought the threat of right-wing terrorism to the forefront of American law enforcement attention.\"\nLegislation.\nIn the wake of the bombing, the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997, by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. Clinton stated that \"when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.\"\nIn the years since the bombing, scientists, security experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.\nOklahoma school curriculum.\nIn the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school, but the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing. On April 6, 2010, House Bill 2750 was signed by Governor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.\nOn the signing, Governor Henry said, Although the events of April 19, 1995, may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995, and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation.\nBuilding security and construction.\nIn the weeks following the bombing, the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jersey barriers to prevent similar attacks. As part of a longer-term plan for United States federal building security, most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and more aesthetically considerate security barriers, which are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness. All new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck-resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs. FBI buildings, for instance, must be set back from traffic. The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $600\u00a0million.\nThe Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued \"Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities\", also known as \"The Marshals Report\", the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300 federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.\nThe attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series \"Seconds From Disaster\" suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.\nDrag racing.\nThe National Hot Rod Association has tightened its regulations for nitromethane. Section 21 of the current NHRA rule book states nitromethane is limited to , or in a barrel, instead of the normal . The NHRA requires competitors to submit a Top Screen Questionnaire to the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, competitors are not allowed to own nitromethane at official events. Instead, it must be stored at the series' official fuel supplier, VP Racing Fuel (as of 2025). Each time a team purchases nitromethane, it is logged by the Series fuel supplier, which dispenses the correct amount of nitromethane ordered to the specific team.\nImpact according to McVeigh.\nMcVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1\u00a0million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, \"Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around.\"\nEvacuation issues.\nSeveral agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City, have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, with consideration of other events, including the Oklahoma City bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter disaster areas more quickly. By helping civilians get out and rescue workers get in, casualties would hopefully be decreased.\nMemorial observances.\nOklahoma City National Memorial.\nFor two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350 members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997, the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624 submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29 million, which was raised by public and private funds. The national memorial is part of the National Park System as an affiliated area and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Within the first year, it had 700,000 visitors.\nThe memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs\u2014one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the \"survivor tree\", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial. North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service. The building also contained the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a law enforcement training center.\nSt. Joseph's Old Cathedral.\nSt. Joseph's Old Cathedral, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches in the city, is located to the southwest of the memorial and was severely damaged by the blast. To commemorate the event, a statue and sculpture work entitled \"And Jesus Wept\" was installed adjacent to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The work was dedicated in May 1997 and the church was rededicated on December 1 of the same year. The church, the statue, and the sculpture are not part of the Oklahoma City memorial.\nRemembrance observance.\nAn observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24 days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02\u00a0a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168 seconds of silence\u2014one second for each person who was killed. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.\nVice President Dick Cheney, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, Frank Keating, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that \"goodness overcame evil\". The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City. President George W. Bush issued a written statement, part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: \"For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on.\"\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the memorial site was closed to the public and local television networks broadcast pre-recorded remembrances to mark the 25th anniversary.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ideologically a pan-Islamist, Bin Laden participated in the Afghan \"mujahideen\" during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War of the 1980s, and supported the Bosnian \"mujahideen\" during the Bosnian War of the 1990s. Opposed to American foreign policy in the Middle East, Bin Laden declared war on the United States in 1996 and supervised numerous terrorist attacks in various countries, including the September 11 attacks in 2001 in the U.S.\nBorn in Riyadh to the aristocratic bin Laden family, he studied at Saudi and foreign universities until 1979, when he joined the \"mujahideen\" fighting against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1984, he co-founded Maktab al-Khidamat, which recruited foreign \"mujahideen\" into the war. As the Soviet war in Afghanistan came to an end, Bin Laden founded al-Qaeda in 1988 to carry out worldwide \"jihad\". In the Gulf War, Bin Laden's offer of support to Saudi Arabia against Iraq was rejected by the Saudi royal family, which instead sought American aid.\nBin Laden's views on pan-Islamism and anti-Americanism resulted in his expulsion from Saudi Arabia in 1991. He shifted his headquarters to Sudan until 1996, when he established a new base in Afghanistan, where he was supported by the Taliban. Bin Laden declared two \"fat\u0101w\u0101\" in August 1996 and February 1998, declaring holy war against the U.S. After al-Qaeda's bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998, which killed hundreds of civilians, he was indicted by a U.S. district court and listed on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists and Most Wanted Fugitives lists. In October 1999, the United Nations designated al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization.\nBin Laden organized the September 11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. This resulted in the U.S. invading Afghanistan and launching the war on terror. Bin Laden became the subject of a nearly decade-long international manhunt led by the U.S. During this period, he hid in the mountains of Afghanistan and later escaped to neighboring Pakistan. On 2 May 2011, Bin Laden was killed by U.S. special operations forces at his compound in Abbottabad. His corpse was buried in the Arabian Sea and he was succeeded by his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri on 16 June 2011. During his lifetime, Bin Laden was considered a war hero by many within the Islamist movement due to his role in opposing the Soviet and American interventions in Afghanistan. In the West and elsewhere, he is widely seen as a global symbol of terrorism and reviled as a mass murderer due to his orchestration of numerous terrorist attacks.\nName.\nBin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as \"Osama bin Laden\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either \"Usama bin Laden\" or the accepted transliteration \"Usama bin Ladin\".\nOsama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means \"Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden\". \"Mohammed\" refers to Bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; \"Awad\" refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman. Aboud's father was Ali, whose father was Omar. The family includes many individuals over a number of generations.\nHe was named , meaning \"lion\", after Usama ibn Zayd, one of the companions of Muhammad. Osama bin Laden had assumed the (teknonym) , meaning \"father of Abdallah\" The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as \"Osama\" or \"Osama bin Laden\", not \"Bin Laden\" alone, as \"Bin Laden\" is a patronym, not a surname in the Western manner. According to one of his sons Omar, the family's hereditary surname is , but Bin Laden's father, Muhammad bin Ladin, never officially registered the name.\nEarly life and education.\nOsama bin Laden was born on 10 March 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. His father was Muhammad bin Ladin, a Yemeni-born billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family, and his mother was Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem). Despite it being generally accepted that Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents.\nMohammed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The couple had four children, and Bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister. The Bin Laden family made $5\u00a0billion in the construction industry, of which Osama later inherited around $25\u201330\u00a0million.\nBin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim. From 1968 to 1976, he attended the elite Al-Thager Model School. Bin Laden attended an English-language course in Oxford, England, during 1971. He studied economics and business administration at King Abdulaziz University. Some reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979, or a degree in public administration in 1981. One source described him as \"hard working\"; another said he left university during his third year without completing a college degree.\nAt university, Bin Laden's main interest was religion, where he was involved in both \"interpreting the Quran and \"jihad\"\" and charitable work. Other interests included writing poetry; reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at centre forward and followed the English club Arsenal. During his studies in Jeddah, Bin Laden became a pupil of the influential Islamist scholar Abdullah Yusuf Azzam and avidly read his treatises. He also read the writings of several Muslim Brotherhood leaders and was highly influenced by the Islamic revolutionary ideas advocated by Sayyid Qutb.\nPersonal life.\nAt age 17 in 1974, Bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; however, they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001, two days before the 9/11 attacks. His other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1993); Khairiah Sabir (married 1985); Siham Sabir (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to Bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony. Bin Laden fathered 24 children with his wives. Many of Bin Laden's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks, and as of 2010[ [update]] Iranian authorities closely controlled them there.\nNasser al-Bahri, who was Bin Laden's personal bodyguard from 1997 to 2001, details Bin Laden's personal life in his memoir. He describes him as a frugal man and strict father, who enjoyed taking his large family on shooting trips and picnics in the desert.\nBin Laden's father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington misjudged a landing. Bin Laden's eldest half-brother, Salem bin Laden, the subsequent head of the Bin Laden family, was killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the U.S., when he accidentally flew a plane into power lines.\nThe FBI described Bin Laden as an adult as tall and thin, between and in height and weighing about , although author Lawrence Wright, in his book on al-Qaeda, \"The Looming Tower\", writes that a number of Bin Laden's close friends confirmed that reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that he was actually \"just over tall\". After his death, he was measured to be roughly . Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. At one point, he stopped wearing the traditional Saudi male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh. He was described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered in demeanor.\nPolitical views.\nAccording to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, who led the CIA's hunt for Bin Laden, Bin Laden was motivated by a belief that U.S. foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East. As such, the threat to U.S. national security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what the U.S. is but rather by what the U.S. does, or in the words of Scheuer, \"They (al-Qaeda) hate us (Americans) for what we do, not who we are.\" Nonetheless, Bin Laden criticized the U.S. for its secular form of governance, calling upon Americans to convert to Islam and reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and usury, in a letter published in late 2002.\nBin Laden believed that the Islamic world was in crisis and that the complete restoration of Sharia law would be the only way to set things right in the Muslim world. He opposed such alternatives as secular government, as well as pan-Arabism, socialism, communism, and democracy. He subscribed to the Athari (literalist) school of Islamic theology.\nThese beliefs, in conjunction with violent \"jihad\", have sometimes been called Qutbism after being promoted by Sayyid Qutb. Bin Laden believed that Afghanistan, under the rule of Mullah Omar's Taliban, was \"the only Islamic country\" in the Muslim world. Bin Laden consistently dwelt on the need for violent \"jihad\" to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the U.S. and sometimes by other non-Muslim states. In his \"Letter to the American People\" published in 2002, Bin Laden described the formation of the Israeli state as \"a crime which must be erased\" and demanded that the United States withdraw all of its civilians and military personnel from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from all Muslim lands.\nHis viewpoints and methods of achieving them had led to him being designated as a terrorist by scholars; journalists from \"The New York Times\", the BBC, and Qatari news station Al Jazeera; and analysts such as Peter Bergen, Michael Scheuer, Marc Sageman, and Bruce Hoffman. He was indicted on terrorism charges by law enforcement agencies in Madrid, New York City, and Tripoli.\nBin Laden supported the targeting of American civilians, in retaliation against U.S. troops indiscriminately attacking Muslims. He asserted that this policy could deter U.S. troops from targeting Muslim women and children. Furthermore, he argued that all Americans were complicit in the crimes of their government due to majority of them electing it to power and paying taxes that fund the U.S. military. According to Noah Feldman, Bin Laden's assertion was that \"since the United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for its government's actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets.\"\nTwo months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bin Laden stated during an interview with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir:\"According to my information, if the enemy occupies an Islamic land and uses its people as human shields, a person has the right to attack the enemy. ... The targets of September 11 were not women and children. The main targets were the symbol of the United States: their economic and military power. Our Prophet Muhammad was against the killing of women and children. When he saw the body of a non-Muslim woman during a war, he asked what the reason for killing her was. If a child is older than thirteen and bears arms against Muslims, killing him is permissible.\"Bin Laden's overall strategy for achieving his goals against much larger enemies such as the Soviet Union and U.S. was to lure them into a long war of attrition in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy countries, by \"bleeding\" them dry. Al-Qaeda manuals express this strategy. In a 2004 tape broadcast by Al Jazeera, Bin Laden spoke of \"bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy\".\nA number of errors and inconsistencies in Bin Laden's arguments have been alleged by authors such as Max Rodenbeck and Noah Feldman. He invoked democracy both as an example of the deceit and fraudulence of Western political system\u2014American law being \"the law of the rich and wealthy\"\u2014and as the reason civilians are responsible for their government's actions and so can be lawfully punished by death. He denounced democracy as a \"religion of ignorance\" that violates Islam by issuing man-made laws, but in a later statement compares the Western democracy of Spain favorably to the Muslim world in which the ruler is accountable. Rodenbeck states, \"Evidently, [Bin Laden] has never heard theological justifications for democracy, based on the notion that the will of the people must necessarily reflect the will of an all-knowing God.\"\nBin Laden was heavily anti-Semitic, stating that most of the negative events that occurred in the world were the direct result of Jewish actions. In a December 1998 interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Bin Laden stated that Operation Desert Fox was proof that Israeli Jews controlled the governments of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, directing them to kill as many Muslims as they could. In a letter released in late 2002, he stated that Jews controlled the civilian media outlets, politics, and economic institutions of the United States. In a May 1998 interview with ABC News, Bin Laden claimed that the Israeli state's ultimate goal was to annex the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East into its territory and enslave its peoples, as part of what he called a \"Greater Israel\". He stated that Jews and Muslims could never get along, that war was \"inevitable\" between them, and accusing the U.S. of stirring up anti-Islamic sentiment. He claimed that the U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Defense were controlled by Jews, for the sole purpose of serving the Israeli state's goals. He often delivered warnings against alleged Jewish conspiracies: \"These Jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next.\" Shia Muslims have been listed along with heretics, the United States, and Israel as the four principal enemies of Islam at ideology classes of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization.\nBin Laden was opposed to music on religious grounds, and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in earth-moving machinery and genetic engineering of plants, while rejecting the use of chilled water. He also believed climate change to be a serious threat and penned a letter urging Americans to work with U.S. president Barack Obama to make a rational decision to \"save humanity from the harmful gases that threaten its destiny\".\nMilitant and political career.\nSoviet\u2013Afghan War.\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Yusuf Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the \"mujahideen\" resistance in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. He later told a journalist: \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" From 1979 to 1992, the U.S. (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6\u201312 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of \"mujahideen\" through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).\nBritish journalist Jason Burke wrote: \"[Bin Laden] did not receive any direct funding or training from the U.S. during the 1980s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan \"mujahideen\", via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant.\" Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani Army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistan Armed Forces and the ISI. According to Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, the person in charge of the ISI's Afghan operations at the time, it was a strict policy of Pakistan to prevent any American involvement in the distribution of funds or weapons or in the training of the \"mujahideen\", and the CIA officials stayed in the embassy in Islamabad, never entering Afghanistan or meeting with the Afghan resistance leaders themselves. According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, Bin Laden acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords; no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives. Steve Coll states that although Bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that Bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S. Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed.\nBy 1984, Bin Laden and Azzam established Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneled money, arms, and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, Bin Laden's inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the \"jihadi\" fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Between 1986 and 1987, Bin Laden set up a base in eastern Afghanistan for several dozen of his own Arab soldiers. From this base, Bin Laden participated in some combat activity against the Soviets, such as the Battle of Jaji in 1987. Despite its little strategic significance, the battle was lionized in the mainstream Arab press. It was during this time that he became idolized by many Arabs.\nAllegation of involvement in 1988 Gilgit massacre.\nIn May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis by Shias, large numbers of Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan were killed in a massacre. Shia civilians were also subjected to rape. The massacre is alleged by B. Raman, a founder of India's Research and Analysis Wing, to have been in response to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgit during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq. He alleged that the Pakistan Army induced Osama bin Laden to lead an armed group of Sunni tribals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and its surrounding areas to suppress the revolt.\nFormation and structuring of al-Qaeda.\nBy 1988, Bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, Bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force. Notes of a meeting of Bin Laden and others on 20 August 1988, indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: \"Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious.\" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (\"bayat\") to follow one's superiors.\nAccording to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret. His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an 11 August 1988, meeting between several senior leaders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), Azzam, and Bin Laden, where it was agreed to join Bin Laden's money with the expertise of the EIJ and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. Others argue that the organization was founded earlier and already existed when the leaders met on 11 August 1988.\nFollowing the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, Bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero of \"jihad\". Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to have brought down the mighty superpower of the Soviet Union. After his return to Saudi Arabia, Bin Laden engaged in opposition movements to the Saudi monarchy while working for his family business. He offered to send al-Qaeda to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Yemeni Socialist Party government in South Yemen, but was rebuffed by Prince Turki bin Faisal. He then tried to disrupt the Yemeni unification process by assassinating YSP leaders, but was halted by Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz after President Ali Abdullah Saleh complained to King Fahd. He was also angered by the internecine tribal fighting among the Afghans. However, he continued working with the Saudi GID and the Pakistani ISI. In March 1989, Bin Laden led 800 Arab foreign fighters during the unsuccessful Battle of Jalalabad. Bin Laden led his men in person to immobilize the 7th Sarandoy Regiment but failed doing so leading to massive casualties. He funded the 1990 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt led by hardcore communist General Shahnawaz Tanai. He also lobbied the Parliament of Pakistan to carry out an unsuccessful motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\nThe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Gulf war.\nThe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein on 2 August 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the royal family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the Saudi border, Saddam's appeal to pan-Arabism was potentially inciting internal dissent. One week after King Fahd agreed to U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's offer of American military assistance, Bin Laden met with King Fahd and Saudi Defense Minister Sultan bin Abdulaziz, telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the U.S. and others and offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion. When Sultan asked how Bin Laden would defend the fighters if Saddam used Iraqi chemical and biological weapons against them, he replied, \"We will fight him with faith.\" Bin Laden's offer was rebuffed, and the Saudi monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory.\nBin Laden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. forces, arguing that it was indignity that the kingdom was being defended by an army of American unbelievers. Bin Laden tried to convince the Saudi \"ulama\" to issue a fatwa condemning the American military deployment but senior clerics refused out of fear of repression. Bin Laden's continued criticism of the Saudi monarchy led them to put him under house arrest, under which he remained until he was ultimately forced to leave the country in 1991. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in the north-eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and was deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina.\nMeanwhile, on 8 November 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of El Sayyid Nosair, an associate of al-Qaeda operative Ali Mohamed. They discovered copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers. This marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terrorist plans outside of Muslim countries. Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and, years later, admitted guilt for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City on 5 November 1990.\nMove to Sudan.\nIn 1991, Bin Laden was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its government after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States. He and his followers moved first to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992, in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed. Bin Laden's personal security detail consisted of bodyguards personally selected by him. Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns. Meanwhile, in March\u2013April 1992, Bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war in Afghanistan, by urging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the other \"mujahideen\" leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself.\nIt is believed that the first bombing attack involving Bin Laden was the 29 December 1992, bombing of the Gold Mohur Hotel in Aden in which two people were killed.\nIn the 1990s, Bin Laden's al-Qaeda assisted \"jihadis\" financially, and sometimes militarily, in Algeria, Egypt, and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993, Bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The war that followed caused the deaths of 150,000 to 200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamists surrendering to the government.\nIn Sudan, Bin Laden established a new base for \"mujahideen\" operations in Khartoum. He bought a house on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at Soba on the Blue Nile. During his time in Sudan, he heavily invested in the infrastructure, in agriculture and businesses. He was the Sudan agent for the British firm Hunting Surveys, and built roads using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct mountain tracks in Afghanistan. Many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the war against the Soviet Union. He was generous to the poor and popular with the people. He continued to criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In response, in 1994, Fahd stripped Bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his $7\u00a0million a year stipend.\nBy that time, Bin Laden was being linked with EIJ, which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995, the EIJ attempted to assassinate the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. The attempt failed, and Sudan expelled the EIJ. After this bombing, al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to \"Jannah\" (paradise) if they were good Muslims and to \"Jahannam\" (hell) if they were bad or non-believers. The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.\nThe U.S. State Department accused Sudan of being a sponsor of international terrorism and Bin Laden of operating terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert. However, according to Sudan officials, this stance became obsolete as the Islamist political leader Hassan al-Turabi lost influence in their country. The Sudanese wanted to engage with the U.S., but American officials refused to meet with them even after they had expelled Bin Laden. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized U.S. intelligence officials to visit Sudan.\nThe 9/11 Commission Report states:\nIn late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer Billy Waugh tracked down Bin Ladin in Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization. US Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against Bin Laden in any country.\nIn January 1996, the CIA launched a new unit of its Counterterrorism Center (CTC) called the Bin Laden Issue Station, code-named \"Alec Station\", to track and to carry out operations against his activities. Bin Laden Issue Station was headed by Michael Scheuer, a veteran of the Islamic Extremism Branch of the CTC. U.S. intelligence monitored Bin Laden in Sudan using operatives to run by daily and to photograph activities at his compound, and using an intelligence safe house and signals intelligence to surveil him and to record his moves.\nReturn to Afghanistan.\nThe 9/11 Commission Report states:\nIn February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. US officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the CIA.\nDue to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States, Bin Laden was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to Jalalabad, Afghanistan aboard a chartered flight on 18 May 1996; there he forged a close relationship with Mullah Omar. The expulsion from Sudan significantly weakened Bin Laden and his organization. Some African intelligence sources have argued that the expulsion left Bin Laden without an option other than becoming a full-time radical, and that most of the 300 Afghan Arabs who left with him subsequently became terrorists. Various sources report that he lost between $20\u00a0million and $300\u00a0million in Sudan; the government seized his construction equipment, and he was forced to liquidate his businesses, land, and even his horses.\n1996 Declaration of war and 1998 fatwa.\nIn August 1996, Bin Laden issued a \"fataw\u0101\" titled \"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\", which was published by \"Al-Quds Al-Arabi\", a London-based newspaper. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"The Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Mecca and Medina. The reference to occupation in the \"fatw\u0101\" referred to U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch. Despite the assurance of President George H. W. Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there. Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam Hussein's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that \"the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony\".\nFervently attacking American support for Israel and Saudi Arabia as well as its sanctions on Iraq, Bin Laden declared in the \"fatwa\": \"Terrorising you, while you are carrying arms on our land, is a legitimate and morally demanded duty. It is a legitimate right well known to all humans and other creatures... [our] youths are different from your soldiers. Your problem will be how to convince your troops to fight, while our problem will be how to restrain our youths.. The youths hold you responsible for all of the killings and evictions of the Muslims and the violation of the sanctities, carried out by your Zionist brothers in Lebanon; you openly supplied them with arms and finance. More than 600,000 Iraqi children have died due to lack of food and medicine and as a result of the unjustifiable aggression (sanction) imposed on Iraq and its nation. The children of Iraq are our children. You, the USA, together with the Saudi regime are responsible for the shedding of the blood of these innocent children. Due to all of that, what ever treaty you have with our country is now null and void.\"\nOn 23 February 1998; Bin Laden, alongside Ayman al-Zawahiri, Ahmad Refai Taha, Shaykh Mir Hamzah and Maulana Fazlur Rahman; issued another \"fatw\u0101\" against the U.S., calling upon Muslims to attack the country and its allies. It was entitled \"Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders\". After listing numerous acts of aggression committed by the U.S., such as the presence of American forces in the Arabian Peninsula, sanctions against Iraq, Israeli repression of Palestinians, among other things. The fatwa stated: \"All these American crimes and sins are a clear proclamation of war against God, his Messenger, and the Muslims. Religious scholars throughout Islamic history have agreed that \"jihad\" is an individual duty when an enemy attacks Muslim countries. This was related by the Imam ibn Qudama in \"\"The Resource\",\" by Imam al-Kisa'i in \"\"The Marvels\",\" by al-Qurtubi in his exegesis, and by the Sheikh of Islam when he states in his chronicles that \"As for fighting to repel an enemy, which is the strongest way to defend freedom and religion, it is agreed that this is a duty. After faith, there is no greater duty than fighting an enemy who is corrupting religion and the world.\"\"\nAt the public announcement, Bin Laden said that North Americans are \"very easy targets\". He told the attending journalists, \"You will see the results of this in a very short time.\" It also claimed the \"individual duty for every Muslim \"was to liberate Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and the Grand Mosque in Mecca from their grip.\nLate 1990s attacks.\nIn Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Afghan \"jihad\", and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for \"mujahideen\" fighters. Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of Bin Laden's terrorist network. The arms smuggler Viktor Bout helped to run the airline, maintaining planes and loading cargo. Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's Bin Laden unit, concluded that Ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service.\nIt has been claimed that Bin Laden funded the Luxor massacre of 17 November 1997, which killed 62 civilians, and outraged the Egyptian public. The Swiss Federal Police later determined that bin Laden had financed the operation. In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing him to abandon his Najim Jihad compound and move his operations to Tarnak Farms in the south.Another successful attack was carried out in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement his alliance with the Taliban by sending several hundred Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand Hazaras overrunning the city.\nBin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on 24 June 1998. The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings were a series of attacks that occurred on 7 August 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the U.S. embassies in the major East African cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. The attacks were linked to local members of the EIJ, and brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the U.S. public for the first time. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the bombings.\nIn retaliation for the embassy bombings, U.S. president Bill Clinton ordered a series of cruise missile strikes on Bin Laden-related targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on 20 August 1998. In December 1998, the CIA reported to Clinton that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the U.S., including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft. On 7 June 1999, the FBI placed Bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list. On October 15, 1999, the United Nations designated al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization through UN Security Council Resolution 1267. This resolution aimed to impose sanctions on individuals and entities associated with al-Qaeda, including freezing assets and imposing travel bans.\nIn late 2000, Richard Clarke revealed that Islamic militants headed by Bin Laden had planned a triple attack on 3 January 2000, which would have included bombings in Jordan of the Radisson SAS Hotel in Amman, tourists at Mount Nebo, and a site on the Jordan River, as well as the sinking of the destroyer in Yemen, and an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam.\nYugoslav Wars.\nA former U.S. State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Bin Laden.\nAccording to Middle East intelligence reports, Bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was Karim Said Atmani, who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the United States. He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canada\u2013United States border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials. He was convicted of colluding with Bin Laden by a French court.\nA Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former \"mujahideen\" who were linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the area north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. Khalil al-Deek was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Bin Laden. In its 26 June 1997 report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, \"The New York Times\" noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslim forces. Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with Bin Laden.\nIn 1999, the press reported that Bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passports in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. The Bosnian government denied this information following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that Bin Laden did not personally collect his Bosnian passport and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who he was at the time.\nThe head of Albania's State Intelligence Service (SHISH), Fatos Klosi, said that Bin Laden was running a terror network in Albania to take part in the Kosovo War under the guise of a humanitarian organization and it was reported to have been started in 1994. Claude Kader, who was a member, testified its existence during his trial. By 1998, four members of EIJ were arrested in Albania and extradited to Egypt. The \"mujahideen\" fighters were organized by Islamic leaders in Western Europe allied to him and al-Zawahiri.\nDuring his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, former Serbian president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 quoted from a purported FBI report that al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the Kosovo Liberation Army. He claimed Bin Laden had used Albania as a launchpad for violence in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed Richard Holbrooke that KLA was being aided by al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with the KLA and thus indirectly with Osama despite the U.S. embassy bombings earlier. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had argued that the U.S. aided the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War.\nCriminal charges.\nOn 16 March 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against Bin Laden and three other people. They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on 10 March 1994. Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death. He was first indicted by a grand jury of the U.S. on 8 June 1998, on a charges of conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the U.S. and prosecutors further charged that Bin Laden was the head of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide.\nDuring the Clinton administration, capturing Bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, it was revealed that Clinton had signed a directive authorizing the CIA (specifically, their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend Bin Laden and bring him to the U.S. to stand trial for the 1998 embassy attacks; if taking him alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized. On 20 August 1998, 66 cruise missiles launched by U.S. Navy ships in the Arabian Sea struck Bin Laden's training camps near Khost in Afghanistan, missing him by a few hours.\nOn 4 November 1998, Bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on charges of \"Murder of US Nationals Outside the United States, Conspiracy to Murder US Nationals Outside the United States, and Attacks on a Federal Facility Resulting in Death\" for his alleged role in the 1998 embassy attacks. The evidence against Bin Laden included courtroom testimony by former al-Qaeda members and satellite phone records, from a phone purchased for him by al-Qaeda procurement agent Ziyad Khaleel in the U.S. However, the Taliban ruled not to extradite Bin Laden on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence published in the indictments and that non-Muslim courts lacked standing to try Muslims.\nBin Laden became the 456th person listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, when he was added on 7 June 1999, following his indictment along with others for capital crimes in the 1998 embassy attacks. Attempts at assassination and requests for the extradition of Bin Laden from the Taliban of Afghanistan were met with failure before the bombing of Afghanistan in October 2001. In 1999, US president Bill Clinton convinced the United Nations to impose sanctions against Afghanistan in an attempt to force the Taliban to extradite him.\nIn 1999, the CIA, together with Pakistani military intelligence, had prepared a team of approximately 60 Pakistani commandos to infiltrate Afghanistan to capture or kill Bin Laden, but the plan was aborted by the 1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat; in 2000, foreign operatives working on behalf of the CIA had fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a convoy of vehicles in which Bin Laden was traveling through the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles but not the one in which Bin Laden was riding.\nIn 2000, before the September 11 attacks, Paul Bremer characterized the Clinton administration as correctly focused on Bin Laden, while Robert Oakley criticized their obsession with Osama.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God knows it did not cross our minds to attack the Towers, but after the situation became unbearable\u2014and we witnessed the injustice and tyranny of the American-Israeli alliance against our people in Palestine and Lebanon\u2014I thought about it. And the events that affected me directly were that of 1982 and the events that followed\u2014when America allowed the Israelis to invade Lebanon, helped by the US Sixth Fleet. As I watched the destroyed towers in Lebanon, it occurred to me punish the unjust the same way: to destroy towers in America so it could taste some of what we are tasting and to stop killing our children and women.U.S. president George W. Bush received an intelligence report on 6 August 2001, titled \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\" On 11 September 2001 (the \"September 11 attacks\" or \"9/11\"), the U.S. was attacked by al-Qaeda, who used four commercial airplanes as missiles against various targets. Two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon. United Airlines Flight 93 did not reach its intended destination, as its passengers overtook the plane, which crashed in Pennsylvania. The Twin Towers eventually collapsed. At least 2,750 people died from the attacks.\nOn the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency intercepted communications that pointed to Bin Laden's responsibility, as did German intelligence agencies. At 11:30\u00a0p.m., Bush wrote in his diary: \"The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today... We think it's Osama bin Laden.\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that classified evidence linking al-Qaeda and Bin Laden to the September 11 attacks is clear and irrefutable. The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding al-Qaeda and Bin Laden's culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that the evidence presented is not necessarily sufficient to prosecute the case. Identified motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, presence of the U.S. military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.\nBin Laden initially denied involvement in the attacks. On 16 September 2001, he read a statement, later broadcast by Al Jazeera, denying responsibility for the attack. In a videotape recovered by U.S. forces in November 2001 in Jalalabad, Bin Laden was seen discussing the attack with Khaled al-Harbi in a way that indicates foreknowledge. The tape was broadcast on various news networks on 13 December 2001. The merits of this translation have been disputed. Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini stated: \"This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of Bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic.\"\nIn the 2004 video, Bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it, he said he had personally directed the nineteen hijackers. In the 18-minute tape, played on Al-Jazeera, four days before the American presidential election, Bin Laden accused George W. Bush of negligence in the hijacking of the planes on September 11. He said he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. Through two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Bin Laden announced, \"I am the one in charge of the nineteen brothers. ... I was responsible for entrusting the nineteen brothers ... with the raids\" (23 May 2006). In the tapes, he was seen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi and Wail al-Shehri, as they made preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast 7 September 2006).\nManhunt and activities after the September 11 attacks.\nBush administration.\nIn response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks. The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden. U.S. officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25\u00a0million for information leading to his capture or death. On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50\u00a0million, although the amount was never changed. The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2\u00a0million reward.\nWhile referring to Bin Laden in a CNN film clip on 17 September 2001, then-president George W. Bush stated, \"I want justice. There is an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, 'Wanted: Dead or alive'\". Subsequently, Bin Laden retreated further from public contact to avoid capture. Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed Bin Laden in different locations during overlapping time periods.\nOn 10 October 2001, Bin Laden appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the George W. Bush administration and based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of 13 fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 attack. He remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists. Despite these multiple indictments, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. However, they did offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial, in return for the U.S. ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by George W. Bush, stating that this was no longer negotiable: \"there's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty.\"\nBin Laden was believed to be hiding in the White Mountains (Spin Ghar) in Afghanistan's east, near the Pakistani border. According to \"The Washington Post\", the US government concluded that Bin Laden was present during the Battle of Tora Bora, Afghanistan, in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the U.S. to commit enough U.S. ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the U.S. in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled what they believed to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that Bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan's mountainous eastern border.\nOn 11 December 2005, a letter from Atiyah Abd al-Rahman to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi indicated that Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were based in the Waziristan region of Pakistan at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military's Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, Atiyah instructs al-Zarqawi to send messengers to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership. Al-Rahman also indicates that Bin Laden and al-Qaeda are weak and have many of their own problems. The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to \"The Washington Post\".\n\"The Washington Post\" also reported that the CIA unit composed of special operations paramilitary forces dedicated to capturing Bin Laden was shut down in late 2005.\nU.S. and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in Tora Bora between 14 and 16 August 2007. The military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence of a pre-Ramadan meeting held by al-Qaeda members. After killing dozens of al-Qaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either Bin Laden or al-Zawahiri.\nAl-Qaeda continued to release time-sensitive and professionally verified videos demonstrating Bin Laden's continued survival, including in August 2007. He claimed sole responsibility for the September 11 attacks and specifically denied any prior knowledge of them by the Taliban or the Afghan people.\nObama administration.\nOn 7 October 2008, in the second debate of that year's U.S. presidential election, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, \"We will kill Bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority.\" Upon being elected, Obama expressed his plans to renew and ramp up the U.S. search for Bin Laden. Obama rejected the Bush administration's policy on Bin Laden that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a covert, narrow focus on al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates.\nIn 2009, a research team led by Thomas Gillespie and John A. Agnew of UCLA used satellite-aided geographical analysis to pinpoint three compounds in Parachinar as Bin Laden's likely hideouts. In March 2009, the \"New York Daily News\" reported that the hunt for Bin Laden had centered in the Chitral District of Pakistan, including the Kalam Valley. Author Rohan Gunaratna stated that captured al-Qaeda leaders had confirmed that Bin Laden was hiding in Chitral. Pakistan's prime minister Gillani rejected claims that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan.\nEarly in December 2009, a Taliban detainee in Pakistan said he had information that Bin Laden was in Afghanistan that year; he said that in January or February 2009, he met a trusted contact who had seen Bin Laden in Afghanistan about 15 to 20 days earlier. However, on 6 December 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the United States had had no reliable information on the whereabouts of Bin Laden in years. On 9 December, General Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that al-Qaeda would not be defeated unless Bin Laden were captured or killed, thus indicating that the U.S. high command believed that he was still alive. Testifying to the U.S. Congress, he said that Bin Laden had become an iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world, and that Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. He said killing or capturing Bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large.\nIn a 2010 letter, Bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpreted \"al-tatarrus\"\u2014an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances\u2014to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaeda, Bin Laden condemned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants. Bin Laden wrote that the \"tatarrus\" doctrine needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established. He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a truce that would bring the country stability, or would at least show the people that they were careful in keeping Muslims safe on the basis of peace. In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised al-Shabab to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than entering into confrontations with Islamic political parties.\nOn 2 February 2010, Afghan president Hamid Karzai arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit. The agenda included a discussion of a possible Saudi role in Karzai's plan to reintegrate Taliban militants. During the visit, an anonymous official of the Saudi Foreign Affairs Ministry declared that the kingdom had no intention of getting involved in peacemaking in Afghanistan unless the Taliban severed ties with extremists and expelled Osama bin Laden. On 7 June 2010, the Kuwaiti newspaper \"Al-Seyassah\" reported that Bin Laden was hiding out in the mountainous town of Sabzevar, in northeastern Iran. On 9 June, \"The Australian\"'s online edition repeated the claim. This report turned out to be false.\nOn 18 October 2010, an unnamed NATO official suggested that Bin Laden was alive, well, and living comfortably in Pakistan, protected by elements of the country's intelligence services. A senior Pakistani official denied the allegations and said that the accusations were designed to put pressure on the Pakistani government ahead of talks aimed at strengthening ties between Pakistan and the U.S.\nIn April 2011, various U.S. intelligence outlets traced Bin Laden to Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was previously believed that he was hiding near the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but he was found away in a three-story mansion in Abbottabad at , southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy. Imagery from Google Earth indicates that the compound was built between 2001 and 2005.\nDeath and aftermath.\nOsama bin Laden was shot and killed by Navy Seal operatives in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011, shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM Eastern Time on 1 May 2011) by a U.S. military special operations unit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by Barack Obama in April 2011 and carried out in a CIA operation by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground.\nThe raid on Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, reports at the time stated that U.S. forces had taken Bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for positive identification, then buried it at sea, in accordance with Islamic law, within 24 hours of his death. Subsequent reporting has called this account into question\u2014citing, for example, the absence of evidence that there was an imam on board the , where the burial was said to have taken place. On 15 June 2011, U.S. federal prosecutors officially dropped all criminal charges against Bin Laden.\nPakistani authorities later demolished the compound in February 2012 to prevent it from becoming a neo-Islamist shrine. In February 2013, Pakistan announced plans to build a PKR\u00a0265 million (US$30 million) amusement park in the area, including the property of the former hideout. In an interview in 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan claimed that Pakistani intelligence led the CIA to Osama bin Laden.\nIt was widely reported by the press that Bin Laden was fatally wounded by Robert J. O'Neill; however, it has also been widely discredited by witnesses, who claim that Bin Laden was possibly already dead by the time O'Neill arrived, having been injured by an anonymous SEAL Team Six member referred to under the pseudonym \"Red\". According to Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette, Bin Laden was struck by two suppressed shots to the side of the head from around ten feet away after leaning out of his bedroom doorway to survey Bissonnette and a point man. Once the Navy SEALs entered the bedroom, his body began convulsing and Bissonnette along with another SEAL responded by firing multiple shots into his chest.\nOn 29 March 2012, Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" acquired a report produced by Pakistani security officials, based on interrogation of his three surviving wives, that detailed his movements while living underground in Pakistan.\nAllegations of Pakistan support and protection of Bin Laden.\nBin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him, and had reportedly been his home for at least five years. The compound was located less than from the Pakistan Military Academy and less than from Pakistan's capital. While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew Bin Laden's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the U.S. strike, Carlotta Gall, writing in \"The New York Times Magazine\" in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad. In a 2015 \"London Review of Books\" article, investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh asserted\u2014citing U.S. sources\u2014that Bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the U.S. mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of Bin Laden's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence of Ahmad Shuja Pasha, who was paid an estimated $25\u00a0million for the information. Both stories were denied by U.S. and Pakistani officials.\nMosharraf Zia, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, \"It seems deeply improbable that Bin Laden could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state.\" Pakistan's U.S. envoy, Ambassador Husain Haqqani, promised a \"full inquiry\" into how Pakistani intelligence services could have failed to find Bin Laden in a fortified compound so close to Islamabad. \"Obviously Bin Laden did have a support system\", he said. \"The issue is, was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan, or within the society of Pakistan?\"\nOthers argued that Bin Laden lived in the compound with a local family, and never used the internet or a mobile phone, which would have made him much easier to locate. Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari denied that his country's security forces sheltered Bin Laden, and called any supposed support for Bin Laden by the Pakistani government baseless speculation. Government officials said that the country's limited resources had been committed to its war against the Pakistan Taliban, and other insurgents who posed an active threat to it, rather than to finding or sheltering Bin Laden. Coll states that as of 2019 there is no direct evidence showing Pakistani knowledge of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad. Documents captured from the Abbottabad compound generally show that Bin Laden was wary of contact with Pakistani intelligence and police, especially in light of Pakistan's role in the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\nReception and legacy.\nDuring the early 2000s, despite condemnations from U.S-allied governments in the Arab world, anti-American protestors from Pakistan to Palestinian territories used his portraits during their protests, speeches and public campaigns. His popularity in the Muslim world reached its apex through the course of the Iraq War; during which opinion polls conducted in some countries gave him 50% \u2013 60% favourable ratings. However, at his death, Arab reaction was described as \"muted\", overshadowed by the beginning of the Arab Spring. The Pew Research Center found in 2011 that support for Bin Laden and al-Qaeda had declined steadily across a number of Muslim countries, and was as low as 1% in Lebanon, describing him as \"discredited\". Latin American political leaders expressed opposition to Bin Laden, with Peruvian president Alan Garc\u00eda calling him \"demonic\"; however, at his death, some leftist Latin American leaders also denounced the United States for violating Pakistani sovereignty to target Bin Laden. His death was celebrated in India, and the fact that he was found in Pakistan was regarded as cause for concern due to the complex Indo-Pakistani relationship. During a June 2020 Pakistani parliament session, Prime Minister Imran Khan denounced Bin Laden's killing, labelling it as \"an embarrassing moment\" in their country's history, and also praised Bin Laden as a \"Shaheed\" (martyr).\nBin Laden is a reviled figure in the Western world, where he is regarded as a terrorist and mass murderer. His obituary in the \"New York Times\" referred to him as \"the North Star\" of global terrorism, seen by Americans as equivalent to \"Hitler or Stalin.\" Mark Hosenball wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In history's long list of villains, bin Laden will find a special place. He ha[d] no throne, no armies, not even any real territory, aside from the rocky wastes of Afghanistan.

{"id": "22469", "revid": "1317198992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22469", "title": "Ontogeny", "text": "Origination and development of an organism\nOntogeny (also ontogenesis) is the origination and development of an organism (both physical and psychological, e.g., moral development), usually from the time of fertilization of the egg to adult. The term can also be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan.\nOntogeny is the developmental history of an organism within its own lifetime, as distinct from phylogeny, which refers to the evolutionary history of a species. Another way to think of ontogeny is that it is the process of an organism going through all of the developmental stages over its lifetime. The developmental history includes all the developmental events that occur during the existence of an organism, beginning with the changes in the egg at the time of fertilization and events from the time of birth or hatching and afterward (i.e., growth, remolding of body shape, development of secondary sexual characteristics, etc.). While developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e.g., phylogenetic) processes (see evolutionary developmental biology and recapitulation theory), individual organisms develop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny).\nOntogeny, embryology and developmental biology are closely related studies and those terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Aspects of ontogeny are morphogenesis, the development of form and shape of an organism; tissue growth; and cellular differentiation. The term ontogeny has also been used in cell biology to describe the development of various cell types within an organism. Ontogeny is an important field of study in many disciplines, including developmental biology, cell biology, genetics, developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychobiology. Ontogeny is used in anthropology as \"the process through which each of us embodies the history of our own making\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"ontogeny\" comes from the Greek \"on\" meaning a being, individual; and existence, and from the suffix \"-geny\" from the Greek -\"geniea\", meaning genesis, origin, and mode of production.\nHistory.\nThe term ontogeny was coined by Ernst Haeckel, a German zoologist and evolutionist in the 1860s. Haeckel, born in Germany on February 16, 1834, was also a strong supporter of Darwinism. Haeckel suggested that ontogeny briefly and sometimes incompletely recapitulated or repeated phylogeny in his 1866 book, \"Generelle Morphologie der Organismen\" (\"General Morphology of Organisms\"). Even though his book was widely read, the scientific community was not very convinced or interested in his ideas, so he turned to producing more publications to get more attention. In 1866, Haeckel and others imagined development as producing new structures after earlier additions to the developing organism have been established. He proposed that individual development followed developmental stages of previous generations and that the future generations would add something new to this process, and that there was a causal parallelism between an animal's ontogeny and phylogeny. In addition, Haeckel suggested a biogenetic law that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, based on the idea that the successive and progressive origin of new species was based on the same laws as the successive and progressive origin of new embryonic structures. According to Haeckel, development produced novelties, and natural selection would eliminate species that had become outdated or obsolete. Though his view of development and evolution wasn't justifiable, future embryologists tweaked and collaborated with Haeckel's proposals and showed how new morphological structures can occur by the hereditary modification of embryonic development. Marine biologist Walter Garstang reversed Haeckel's relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny, stating that ontogeny creates phylogeny, not recapitulates it.\nA seminal 1963 paper by Nikolaas Tinbergen named ontogeny as one of the four primary questions of biology, along with Julian Huxley's three others: causation, survival value and evolution. Tinbergen emphasized that the change of behavioral \"machinery\" during development was distinct from the change in behavior during development. We can conclude that the thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavior change occurred while the environment was held constant...When we turn from description to causal analysis, and ask in what way the observed change in behavior machinery has been brought about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish between environmental influences and those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is 'innate') is reached by \"elimination\". Tinbergen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to establish, and the use of the word innate is often misleading.\nDevelopmental stages.\nDevelopment of an organism happens through fertilization, cleavage, blastulation, gastrulation, organogenesis, and metamorphosis into an adult. Each species of animal has a slightly different journey through these stages, since some stages might be shorter or longer when compared to other species, and where the offspring develops is different for each animal type (e.g., in a hard egg shell, uterus, soft egg shell, on a plant leaf, etc.).\nFertilization.\nIn humans, the process of fetal development starts after sperm fertilizes an egg and they fuse together, kickstarting embryonic development. The fusion of egg and sperm into a zygote changes the surrounding membrane to not allow any more sperm to penetrate the egg, so multiple fertilizations can be prevented. Fusion of a zygote also activates the egg so it can begin undergoing cell division. Each animal species might not have specifically a sperm and an egg, but two gametes that contain half of the species' typical genetic material and the membranes of these gametes fuse to start creating an offspring.\nCleavage.\nNot long after successful fertilization by sperm, the zygote undergoes many mitotic divisions, which are also non-sexual cell divisions. Cleavage is the process of cell division, so the starting zygote becomes a collection of identical cells which is a morula and contains cells called blastomeres. Cleavage prepares the zygote to become an embryo, which is from 2 weeks to 8 weeks after conception (fertilization) in humans.\nBlastulation.\nAfter the zygote has become an embryo, it continues dividing into a hollow sphere of cells, which is a blastula. These outer cells form a single epithelial layer, the blastoderm, that essentially encases the fluid-filled inside that is the blastocoel. The figure to the right shows the basic process that is modified in different species. Blastulation differs slightly in different species, but in mammals, the eight-cell stage embryo forms into a slightly different type of blastula, called a blastocyst. Other species such as sea stars, frogs, chicks, and mice have all the same structures in this stage, yet the orientation of these features differs, plus these species have additional types of cells in this stage.\nGastrulation.\nAfter blastulation, the single-layered blastula expands and reorganizes into multiple layers, a gastrula (seen in the figure to the right). Reptiles, birds and mammals are triploblastic organisms, meaning the gastrula comprises three germ layers; the endoderm (inner layer), mesoderm (middle layer), and ectoderm (outer layer). As seen in the figure below, each germ layer will become multi-potent stem cells that can become a specific tissue depending on the germ layer and is what happens in humans. This differentiation of germ layers differs slightly, because not all of the organs and tissues below are in all organisms, but corresponding body systems can be substituted in place of these.\nOrganogenesis.\nIn the figure below, human germ cells are able to differentiate into the specific organs and tissues they become later on in life. Germ cells are able to migrate to their final locations to rearrange themselves and some organs are made of two germ layers; one for the outside, the other for the inside. The endoderm cells become the internal linings of organisms, such as the stomach, colon, small intestine, liver, and pancreas of the digestive system and the lungs. The mesoderm gives rise to other tissues not formed by the ectoderm, such as the heart, muscles, bones, blood, dermis of the skin, bone marrow, and the urogenital system. This germ layer is more specific for species, as it is the distinguishing layer of the three that can identify evolutionarily higher life-forms (e.g., bilateral organisms like humans) from lower-life forms (with radial symmetry). Lastly, the ectoderm is the outer layer of cells that become the epidermis and hair while being the precursor to the mammary glands, central nervous system, and the peripheral nervous systems.\nThe figure above shows how the development of a pig, cow, rabbit, and human offspring are similar when compared to one another. This figure shows how the germ layers can become different organs and tissues in evolutionarily higher life-forms and how these species essentially develop very similarly. Additionally, it shows how multiple species develop in a parallel manner but branch off to develop more specific features for the organism such as hooves, a tail, or ears. \nNeurulation.\nIn developing vertebrate offspring, a neural tube is formed through either primary or secondary neurulation. Some species develop their spine and nervous system using both primary and secondary neurulation, while others use only primary or secondary neurulation. In human fetal development, primary neurulation occurs during weeks 3 and 4 of gestation to develop the brain and spinal cord. Then during weeks 5 and 6 of gestation, secondary neurulation forms the lower sacral and coccygeal cord.\nPrimary Neurulation.\nThe diagram to the right illustrates primary neurulation, which is the process of cells surrounding the neural plate interacting with neural plate cells to proliferate, converge, and pinch off to form a hollow tube above the notochord and mesoderm. This process is discontinuous and can start at different points along the cranial-caudal axis necessary for it to close. After the neural crest closes, the neural crest cells and ectoderm cells separate and the ectoderm becomes the epidermis surrounding this complex. The neural crest cells differentiate to become components of most of the peripheral nervous system in animals. Next, the notochord degenerates to become only the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs and the mesoderm cells differentiate to become the somites and skeletal muscle later on. Also during this stage, the neural crest cells become the spinal ganglions, which function as the brain in organisms like earthworms and arthropods. In more advanced organisms like amphibians, birds and mammals; the spinal ganglions consists of a cluster of nerve bodies positioned along the spinal cord at the dorsal and ventral roots of a spinal nerve, which is a pair of nerves that correspond to a vertebra of the spine.\nSecondary Neurulation.\nIn secondary neurulation, caudal and sacral regions of the spine are formed after primary neurulation is finished. This process initiates once primary neurulation is finished and the posterior neuropore closes, so the tail bud can proliferate and condense, then create a cavity and fuse with the central canal of the neural tube. Secondary neurulation occurs in the small region starting at the spinal tail bud up to the posterior neuropore, which is the open neural folds near the tail region that don't close through primary neurulation. As canalization progresses over the next few weeks, neurons and ependymal cells (cells that create cerebral spinal fluid) differentiate to become the tail end of the spinal cord. Next, the closed neural tube contains neuroepithelial cells that immediately divide after closure and a second type of cell forms; the neuroblast. Neuroblast cells form the mantle layer, which later becomes the gray matter, which then gives rise to a marginal layer that becomes the white matter of the spinal cord. Secondary neurulation is seen in the neural tube of the lumbar and tail vertebrae of frogs and chicks and in both instances, this process is like a continuation of gastrulation.\nLarval and juvenile phases.\nIn most species, the young organism that is just born or hatched is not sexually mature yet and in most animals, this young organism looks quite different than the adult form. This young organism is the larva and is the intermediate form before metamorphosing into an adult. A well known example of a larval form of an animal is the caterpillar of butterflies and moths. Caterpillars keep growing and feeding in order for enough energy during the pupal stage, when necessary body parts for metamorphosis are grown. The juvenile phase is different in plants and animals, but in plants juvenility is an early phase of plant growth in which plants can't flower. In animals, the juvenile stage is most commonly found in social mammals, such as wild dogs, monkeys, apes, lions, wolves, and more. In humans, puberty marks the end of this stage and adolescence follows. Some species begin puberty and reproduction before the juvenile stage is over, such as in female non-human primates. The larval and pupal stages can be seen in the figure to the right.\nMetamorphosis.\nThe process of an organism's body undergoing structural and physical changes after birth or hatching to become suitable for its adult environment is metamorphosis. For example, amphibian tadpoles have a maturation of liver enzymes, hemoglobin, and eye pigments, in addition to their nervous, digestive, and reproductive systems being remodeled. In all species, molting and juvenile hormones appear to regulate these changes. The figure to the right shows the stages of life in butterflies and their metamorphosis transforms the caterpillar into a butterfly.\nAdulthood.\nAdulthood is the stage of when physical and intellectual maturity have been achieved and this differs between species. In humans, adulthood is thought to be around 20 or 21 years old and is the longest stage of life, but in all species it ends with death. In dogs, small breeds (e.g., Yorkshire Terrier, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, etc.) physically mature faster than large breeds (e.g., Saint Bernard, Great Dane, Golden Retriever, etc.), so adulthood is reached anywhere from 12 to 24 months or 1 to 2 years. In contrast, many insect species have long larval stages and the adult stage is only for reproduction. The silkworm moths don't have mouthparts and don't feed, so they have to consume enough food during the larval stage for energy to survive and mate.\nSenescence.\nSenescence is when cells stop dividing but don't die, but these cells can build up and cause problems in the body. These cells can release substances that cause inflammation and can damage healthy nearby cells. Senescence can be induced by un-repaired DNA damage (e.g., from radiation, old age, etc.) or other cellular stress and also is the state of being old.\nOntogenetic allometry.\nMost organisms undergo allometric changes in shape as they grow and mature, while others engage in metamorphosis. Even reptiles (non-avian sauropsids, e.g., crocodilians, turtles, snakes, and lizards), in which the offspring are often viewed as miniature adults, show a variety of ontogenetic changes in morphology and physiology.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning \"serpent-bearer\", and it is commonly represented as a man grasping a snake. The serpent is represented by the constellation Serpens. Ophiuchus was one of the 48\u00a0constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88\u00a0modern constellations. An old alternative name for the constellation was Serpentarius.\nLocation.\nOphiuchus lies between Aquila, Serpens, Scorpius, Sagittarius, and Hercules, northwest of the center of the Milky Way. The southern part lies between Scorpius to the west and Sagittarius to the east. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is best visible in summer. It is opposite of Orion. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent; the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda. Ophiuchus straddles the equator with the majority of its area lying in the Southern Hemisphere. Rasalhague, its brightest star, lies near the northern edge of Ophiuchus at about \u00b0\u00a030\u2032 declination. The constellation extends southward to \u221230\u00b0\u00a0declination. Segments of the ecliptic within Ophiuchus are south of \u221220\u00b0\u00a0declination (see chart at right).\nIn contrast to Orion, from November to January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere), Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However, for much of the polar region north of the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the south. In the Northern Hemisphere's spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, because the midnight sun obscures the stars at those times and places in the Arctic. In countries close to the equator, Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October evening sky.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nThe brightest stars in Ophiuchus include \u03b1 Ophiuchi, called Rasalhague (\"head of the serpent charmer\"), at magnitude\u00a02.07, and \u03b7 Ophiuchi, known as Sabik (\"the preceding one\"), at magnitude\u00a02.43. Alpha Ophiuchi is composed of an A-type (bluish-white) giant star and a K-type main sequence star. The primary is a rapid rotator with an inclined axis of rotation. Eta Ophiuchi is a binary system. Other bright stars in the constellation include \u03b2 Ophiuchi, Cebalrai (\"dog of the shepherd\") and \u03bb Ophiuchi, or Marfik (\"the elbow\"). Beta Ophiuchi is an evolved red giant star that is slightly more massive than the Sun. Lambda Ophiuchi is a binary star system with the primary being more massive and luminous than the Sun.\nRS Ophiuchi is part of a class called recurrent novae, whose brightness increase at irregular intervals by hundreds of times in a period of just a few days. It is thought to be at the brink of becoming a Type Ia supernova. It erupts around every 15 years and usually has a magnitude of around 5.0 during eruptions, most recently in 2021.\nBarnard's Star, one of the nearest stars to the Solar System (the only stars closer are the Alpha Centauri binary star system and Proxima Centauri), lies in Ophiuchus. It is located to the left of \u03b2 and just north of the V-shaped group of stars in an area that was once occupied by the now-obsolete constellation of Taurus Poniatovii (Poniatowski's Bull). It is thought that an exoplanet orbits around the star,\nbut later studies have refuted this claim. In 1998, an intense flare was observed. The star has also been a target of plans for interstellar travel such as Project Daedalus. In 2005, astronomers using data from the Green Bank Telescope discovered a superbubble so large that it extends beyond the plane of the galaxy. It is called the Ophiuchus Superbubble.\nIn April 2007, astronomers announced that the Swedish-built Odin satellite had made the first detection of clouds of molecular oxygen in space, following observations in the constellation Ophiuchus. The supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9\u00a0October 1604, near \u03b8\u00a0Ophiuchi. Johannes Kepler saw it first on 16\u00a0October and studied it so extensively that the supernova was subsequently called \"Kepler's Supernova\". He published his findings in a book titled \"De stella nova in pede Serpentarii\" (\"On the New Star in Ophiuchus's Foot\"). Galileo used its brief appearance to counter the Aristotelian dogma that the heavens are changeless. It was a Type Ia supernova and the most recent Milky Way supernova visible to the unaided eye. In 2009 it was announced that GJ 1214, a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeated, cyclical dimming with a period of about 1.5\u00a0days consistent with the transit of a small orbiting planet. The planet's low density (about 40% that of Earth) suggests that the planet might have a substantial component of low-density gas\u2014possibly hydrogen or steam. The proximity of this star to Earth (42\u00a0light years) makes it a feasible target for further observations. The host star emits X-rays which could have removed mass from the exoplanet. In April 2010, the naked-eye star \u03b6 Ophiuchi was occulted by the asteroid 824 Anastasia.\nDeep-sky objects.\nOphiuchus contains several star clusters, such as IC\u00a04665, NGC 6633, M9, M10, M12, M14, M19, M62, and M107, as well as the nebula IC\u00a04603-4604.\nM9 is a globular cluster which may have an extra-galactic origin. M10 is a fairly close globular cluster, only 20,000\u00a0light-years from Earth. It has a magnitude of 6.6 and is a Shapley class\u00a0VII cluster. This means that it has \"intermediate\" concentration; it is only somewhat concentrated towards its center. M12 is a globular cluster which is around 5 kiloparsecs from the Solar System. M14 is another globular cluster which is somewhat farther away. Globular cluster M19 is oblate-shaped with multiple different types of variable stars. M62 is a globular cluster rich in variable stars such as RR Lyrae variables and has two generations of stars with different element abundances. M107 is also rich in variable stars.\nThe unusual galaxy merger remnant and starburst galaxy NGC 6240 is also in Ophiuchus. At a distance of 400\u00a0million light-years, this \"butterfly-shaped\" galaxy has two supermassive black holes 3,000\u00a0light-years apart. Confirmation of the fact that both nuclei contain black holes was obtained by spectra from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Astronomers estimate that the black holes will merge in another billion years. NGC\u00a06240 also has an unusually high rate of star formation, classifying it as a starburst galaxy. This is likely due to the heat generated by the orbiting black holes and the aftermath of the collision. Both have active galactic nuclei.\nIn 2006, a new nearby star cluster was discovered associated with the 4th magnitude star Mu Ophiuchi. The Mamajek 2 cluster appears to be a poor cluster remnant analogous to the Ursa Major Moving Group, but 7\u00a0times more distant (approximately 170\u00a0parsecs away). Mamajek\u00a02 appears to have formed in the same star-forming complex as the NGC 2516 cluster roughly 135\u00a0million years ago.\nBarnard 68 is a large dark nebula, located 410\u00a0light-years from Earth. Despite its diameter of 0.4\u00a0light-years, Barnard\u00a068 only has twice the mass of the Sun, making it both very diffuse and very cold, with a temperature of about 16\u00a0kelvins. Though it is currently stable, Barnard\u00a068 will eventually collapse, inciting the process of star formation. One unusual feature of Barnard\u00a068 is its vibrations, which have a period of 250,000\u00a0years. Astronomers speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the shock wave from a supernova. Barnard 68 has blocked thousands of stars visible at other wavelengths and the distribution of dust in Barnard 68 has been mapped.\nThe space probe Voyager 1, the furthest man-made object from earth, is traveling in the direction of Ophiuchus. It is located between \u03b1 Herculis, \u03b1 Ophiuchi and \u03ba Ophiuchi at right ascension 17h 13m and declination +12\u00b0 25\u2019 (July 2020).\nIn November 2022, the USA's NSF NOIRLab (National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory) announced the unambiguous identification of the nearest stellar black hole orbited by a G-type main-sequence star, the system identified as Gaia BH1 at around 1,560 light years from the Sun.\nHistory and mythology.\nThere is no evidence of the constellation preceding the classical era, and in Babylonian astronomy, a \"Sitting Gods\" constellation seems to have been located in the general area of Ophiuchus. However, Gavin White proposes that Ophiuchus may in fact be remotely descended from this Babylonian constellation, representing Nirah, a serpent-god who was sometimes depicted with his upper half human but with serpents for legs.\nThe earliest mention of the constellation is in Aratus, informed by the lost catalogue of Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC): &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To the Phantom's back the Crown is near, but by his head mark near at hand the head of Ophiuchus, and then from it you can trace the starlit Ophiuchus himself: so brightly set beneath his head appear his gleaming shoulders. They would be clear to mark even at the midmonth moon, but his hands are not at all so bright; for faint runs the gleam of stars along on this side and on that. Yet they too can be seen, for they are not feeble. Both firmly clutch the Serpent, which encircles the waist of Ophiuchus, but he, steadfast with both his feet well set, tramples a huge monster, even the Scorpion, standing upright on his eye and breast. Now the Serpent is wreathed about his two hands \u2013 a little above his right hand, but in many folds high above his left.\nTo the ancient Greeks, the constellation represented the god Apollo struggling with a huge snake that guarded the Oracle of Delphi.\nLater myths identified Ophiuchus with Laoco\u00f6n, the Trojan priest of Poseidon, who warned his fellow Trojans about the Trojan Horse and was later slain by a pair of sea serpents sent by the gods to punish him. According to Roman era mythography, the figure represents the healer Asclepius, who learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius' care, Jupiter killed him with a bolt of lightning, but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works. In medieval Islamic astronomy (Azophi's \"Uranometry\", 10th century), the constellation was known as \"Al-\u1e24awwa\"', \"the snake-charmer\".\nAratus describes Ophiuchus as trampling on Scorpius with his feet. This is depicted in Renaissance to Early Modern star charts, beginning with Albrecht D\u00fcrer in 1515; in some depictions (such as that of Johannes Kepler in \"De Stella Nova\", 1606), Scorpius also seems to threaten to sting Serpentarius in the foot. This is consistent with Azophi, who already included \u03c8\u00a0Oph and \u03c9\u00a0Oph as the snake-charmer's \"left foot\", and \u03b8 Oph and \u03bf\u00a0Oph as his \"right foot\", making Ophiuchus a zodiacal constellation at least as regards his feet. This arrangement has been taken as symbolic in later literature and placed in relation to the words spoken by God to the serpent in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).\nZodiac.\nOphiuchus is one of the 13 constellations that cross the ecliptic. It has sometimes been suggested as the \"13th sign of the zodiac\". However, this confuses zodiac or astrological signs with constellations. The signs of the zodiac are a 12-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30\u00b0 of celestial longitude, approximately the distance the Sun travels in a month, and (in the Western tradition) are aligned with the seasons so that the March equinox always falls on the boundary between Pisces and Aries. Constellations, on the other hand, are unequal in size and are based on the positions of the stars. The constellations of the zodiac have only a loose association with the signs of the zodiac, and do not in general coincide with them. In Western astrology the constellation of Aquarius, for example, largely corresponds to the sign of Pisces. Similarly, the constellation of Ophiuchus occupies most (29\u00a0November \u2013 18\u00a0December) of the sign of Sagittarius (23\u00a0November \u2013 21\u00a0December). The differences are due to the fact that the time of year that the Sun passes through a particular zodiac constellation's position has slowly changed (because of the precession of the Earth's rotational axis) over the millennia from when the Babylonians originally developed the zodiac.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was an educated lawyer, forming the first Welsh parliament under his rule, and was the last native-born Welshman to claim the title Prince of Wales.\nDuring the year 1400, Glynd\u0175r, a Welsh soldier and Lord of Glyndyfrdwy had a dispute with a neighbouring English Lord, the event which spiralled into a national revolt pitted common Welsh countrymen and nobles against the English military. In response to the rebellion, discriminatory penal laws were implemented against the Welsh people; this deepened civil unrest and significantly increased support for Glynd\u0175r across Wales. Then, in 1404, after a series of successful castle sieges and several battlefield victories for the Welsh, Glynd\u0175r gained control of most of Wales and was proclaimed by his supporters as the Prince of Wales, in the presence of envoys from several other European kingdoms, and military aid was given from France, Brittany, and Scotland. He proceeded to summon the first Welsh parliament in Machynlleth, where he outlined his plans for Wales which included building two universities, reinstating the medieval Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and build an independent Welsh church.\nThe war continued, and over the next several years, the English gradually gained control of large parts of Wales. By 1409 Owain's last remaining castles of Harlech and Aberystwyth had been captured by English forces. Glynd\u0175r refused two royal pardons and retreated to the Welsh hills and mountains with his remaining forces, where he continued to resist English rule by using guerrilla warfare tactics, until his disappearance in 1415, when he was recorded as having died by one of his followers, Adam of Usk.\nGlynd\u0175r was never captured or killed, and he was also never betrayed despite being a fugitive of the law with a large bounty. In Welsh culture he acquired a mythical status alongside Cadwaladr, Cynon ap Clydno and King Arthur as a folk hero \u2013 'The Foretold Son' (). In William Shakespeare's play \"Henry IV, Part 1\" he appears as the character Owen Glendower as a king rather than a prince.\nEarly life and marriage.\nOwain ap Gruffydd (Owain Glynd\u0175r) was born during 1354 in Sycharth, North East Wales, into a powerful Anglo-Welsh gentry family. His father, Gruffydd Fychan II had a claim to be hereditary Prince of Powys Fadog and was the Baron of Glyndyfrdwy and Lord of Cynllaith Owain, who died around 1370, leaving Glynd\u0175r's mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn, a woman with an accent from Ceredigion (Deheubarth), a widow when he was still a boy. Owain Glynd\u0175r was a descendant of all three Welsh Royal Principalities (royal houses). Through his father, he was the heir of the former Kingdom of Powys (House of Mathrafal). And through his mother, he was the direct descendant and heir of both Deheubarth (House of Dinefwr) and Gwynedd (House of Aberffraw). He may also have been a descendant of the English King Edward I, through his granddaughter Eleanor. However, the existence of Eleanor is disputed.\nThe young Owain ap Gruffydd was possibly fostered at the home of David Hanmer, a rising lawyer shortly to be a justice of the King's Bench, or at the home of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. Owain is then thought to have been sent to London to study law at the Inns of Court, as a student in Westminster, London, for over a period of seven years. He was possibly in London during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. By 1384, he was living in Wales and married to David's daughter, Margaret Hanmer; their marriage took place, perhaps in 1383, in St Chad's Church, Hanmer in north-east Wales. Although other sources state that they were married in the 1370s. They started a large family and Owain established himself as the squire of his ancestral lands at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy.\nMilitary service.\nGlynd\u0175r joined the king's military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison duty under the Welshman Sir Gregory Sais on the English\u2013Scottish border at Berwick-upon-Tweed. His surname Sais, meaning 'Englishman' in Welsh, refers to his ability to speak English, not common in Wales at the time. In August 1385, he served King Richard II under the command of John of Gaunt, again in Scotland. Then, in 1386, he was called to give evidence at the High Court of Chivalry, in the \"Scrope v Grosvenor\" trial at Chester on 3 September that year. In March 1387, Owain fought as a squire to Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, where he saw action in the English Channel at the defeat of a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off the coast of Kent during the Battle of Margate. Upon the death in late 1387 of his father-in-law, Sir David Hanmer, knighted earlier that same year by the then King of England, Richard II, Glynd\u0175r returned to Wales as executor of his estate. Glynd\u0175r next served as a squire to Henry Bolingbroke (later King Henry IV), son of John of Gaunt, at the short Battle of Radcot Bridge in December 1387. From 1384 until 1388 he had been active in military service and had gained three full years of military experience in different theatres, and had witnessed some key events and noteworthy people at first hand.\nKing Richard was distracted by a growing conflict with the Lords Appellant from this time on. Glynd\u0175r's opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of FitzAlan, and he probably returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The bard Iolo Goch, himself a Welsh Lord, visited Glynd\u0175r in Sycharth in the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising his host's liberality and writing of Sycharth, \"Very rarely was a bolt or lock to be seen there.\"\nGlynd\u0175r's Welsh rebellion.\nPrelude to rebellion.\nIn the late 1390s, a series of events occurred which cornered Owain, and forced his ambitions towards a rebellion. The events would later be called the Welsh Revolt, the Glynd\u0175r Rising (within Wales), or the Last War of Independence. His neighbour, Baron Grey of Ruthin, had seized control of some land, for which Glynd\u0175r appealed to the English Parliament; however, Owain's petition for redress was ignored. Later, in 1400, Lord Grey did not inform Glynd\u0175r in time about a royal command to levy feudal troops for Scottish border service, thus enabling him to call Glynd\u0175r a traitor in London court circles. Lord Grey had stature in the royal court of Henry IV. The law courts refused to hear the case, or it was delayed because Lord Grey prevented Owain's letter from reaching the King, which would have repercussions. Sources state that Glynd\u0175r was under threat because he had written an angry letter to Lord Grey, boasting that lands had come into his possession, and he had stolen some of Lord Grey's horses; and believing Lord Grey had threatened to \"burn and slay\" within his lands, he threatened retaliation in the same manner. Lord Grey then denied making the initial threat to burn and slay, and replied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IV's council and that Glynd\u0175r would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained within the letter. The deposed king, Richard II, had support in Wales, and in January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester after the public execution of an officer of Richard II.\nInitial revolts.\nAt Sycharth, in Glyndyfrdwy on 16 September 1400, in front of his immediate family, his in-laws, Welsh people from Berwyn, friends from North-East Wales, the Dean of St Asaph totalling 300 men, Owain Glynd\u0175r prophecised that he was the person to save his people from the English invasions, and proclaimed himself the Prince of Wales. The following day, he instigated a 15-year rebellion against the rule of Henry IV. Then came a number of initial confrontations between Henry IV and Owain's followers in September and October 1400, as the revolt began to spread around North Wales. Glynd\u0175r, the self appointed Prince of Wales and his hundreds of followers launched an assault on Lord Grey's territories burning Ruthin, they continued to Denbigh, Rhuddlan, Flint, Holt, Oswestry and Welshpool, all of which were seen as English towns in Wales. The initial revolt got the attention of the King of England after letters were sent asking for military assistance to combat the Welsh rebels. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Glynd\u0175r, and from then on, he would only make an appearance to attack his enemy, his army using effective guerrilla warfare tactics against the English occupying territories.\nWelsh rebellion.\nOn Good Friday (1 April) 1401, 40 of Glyndwr's men who were led by his cousins, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur took Conwy Castle in North Wales. In response, King Henry IV appointed Henry Percy (Hotspur) to bring the country to order. A month later, the King and the English parliament issued an amnesty on 10 March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, the Tudurs; however, both the Tudurs were eventually pardoned after they gave up Conwy Castle on 28 May that same year. Hotspur won a battle at Cadair Idris two days later, but that was to be his final service for the King of England, as he retired his command as leader of the English troops after dealing with Glynd\u0175r. During that time in the spring of 1401, Glynd\u0175r appears in South Wales.\nIn June, Glynd\u0175r scored his first major victory in the field at Mynydd Hyddgen on Pumlumon; however, retaliation by Henry IV on Strata Florida Abbey was to follow in October that same year. The rebel uprising had occupied all of North Wales; labourers seized whatever weapons they could, and farmers sold their cattle to buy arms. Secret meetings were held everywhere, and bards \"wandered about as messengers of sedition\". Henry IV heard of a Welsh uprising at Leicester; Henry's army wandered North Wales to Anglesey and drove out Franciscan friars who favoured Richard II. All the while Glynd\u0175r, who was in hiding, had his estate at Sycharth forfeited by the King to John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset on 9 November 1400. Then, by autumn, Gwynedd and Ceredigion (which temporarily submitted to England for a pardon) and Powys adhered to the rising against the English rule by supporting the rebellion. Glynd\u0175r's attempts at stoking rebellion with help from the Scottish and Irish were quashed, with the English showing no mercy and hanging some messengers.\nAs a response to the situation of warfare in Wales, the English Parliament between 1401 and 1402 enacted penal laws against the Welsh, designed to coerce submission in Wales, but the result was to create resentment that pushed many Welshmen into the rebellion. In the same year, Glynd\u0175r captured his archenemy Baron Grey de Ruthyn. He held him for almost a year until he received a substantial ransom from Henry. In June 1402, Glynd\u0175r defeated an English force led by Sir Edmund Mortimer near Pilleth (the Battle of Bryn Glas), where Mortimer was captured. Glynd\u0175r offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to de Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer's nephew could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than Henry himself, so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Mortimer negotiated an alliance with Glynd\u0175r and married one of Glynd\u0175r's daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the French and the people of Flanders helping Owain's daughter Janet, who was negotiating on the continent for her father for two years until 1404.\nNews of the rebellion's success spread across Europe, and Glynd\u0175r began to receive naval support from Scotland and Brittany. He also received the support of King Charles VI of France, who agreed to send French troops and supplies to aid the rebellion. In 1403 Glyndwr had amassed an army of 4,000 in his first division, and 12,000 soldiers in total. A Welsh army including a French contingent assimilated into forces mainly from Glamorgan and the Rhondda Valleys region commanded by Owain Glynd\u0175r, his senior general Rhys Gethin and Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda, defeated a large English invasion force reputedly led by King Henry IV himself at the Battle of Stalling Down in Glamorgan.\nGlynd\u0175r, facing years on the run, finally lost his estate in the spring of 1403, when Prince Henry as usual marched into Wales unopposed and burnt down Glynd\u0175r's houses at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy, as well as the commote of Edeirnion and parts of Powys. Glynd\u0175r continued to besiege towns and burn down castles; for 10 days in July that year, he toured the south and southwest of Wales until all of the south joined arms in rebelling against English rule. These actions induced an internal rebellion against the King of England, with the Percys joining the rising. It is around this stage of Glynd\u0175r's life that Hywel Sele, a cousin of the Welsh prince, attempted to assassinate Glynd\u0175r at the Nannau estate.\nIn 1403, the revolt became truly national in Wales. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities were leaving their studies to join Glynd\u0175r, and also that Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales. Owain could also draw on Welsh troops seasoned by the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh archers and experienced men-at-arms left the English service to join the rebellion.\nIn 1404, Glynd\u0175r's forces took Aberystwyth Castle and Harlech Castle, then continued to ravage the south by burning Cardiff Castle. Then, a court was held at Harlech and Gruffydd Young was appointed as the Welsh Chancellor. There had been communication to Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans in Paris to try (unsuccessfully) to open the Welsh ports to French trade.\nCrowning as Prince of Wales.\nBy 1404, no less than four royal military expeditions into Wales had been repelled, and Owain had solidified his control of the nation. In 1404, he was proclaimed by his supporters Prince of Wales () and held parliaments at Machynlleth and Harlech. He also planned to build two national universities (one in the south and one in the north), to re-introduce the traditional Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and to establish an independent Welsh church. There were envoys from other countries including France, Scotland, and the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n (in Spain). In the summer of 1405, four representatives from every commote in Wales were sent to Harlech.\nTripartite indenture.\nIn February 1405, Glynd\u0175r negotiated the Tripartite Indenture with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales among the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers Severn and Mersey, including most of Cheshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire. The Mortimer Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and the Percys would take the north of England.\nAlthough negotiations with the lords of Ireland were unsuccessful, Glynd\u0175r had reason to hope that the French and Bretons might be more welcoming. He dispatched Gruffydd Yonge and his brother-in-law (Margaret's brother), John Hanmer, to negotiate with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Glynd\u0175r and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to Kidwelly Castle. The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from the Duchy of Brittany and from Scotland. Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain's war. Scottish ships had raided English settlements on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1400 and 1401. In 1403, a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated Jersey, Guernsey and Plymouth, while the French made a landing on the Isle of Wight. By 1404, they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to Dartmouth and devastating the coast of Devon.\n1405 was the \"Year of the French\" in Wales. A formal treaty between Wales and France was negotiated. On the continent, the French pressed the English as the French army invaded the English Plantagenet Aquitaine. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at Milford Haven in west Wales, burned Haverfordwest, and attempted to capture Pembroke Castle before they were bought off. The combined forces of French and Welsh took Carmarthen, which Owain had captured in 1403 but lost again. The occupants were given safe passage out, and they burned the town walls. Enguerrand de Monstrelet, a later chronicler gives an uncorroborated account of a march through Herefordshire and on into Worcestershire to Woodbury Hill, ten miles from Worcester. They met the English army and took positions from which they daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days. Then, both sides seeming to find engagement too risky, departed.\nLetter to Charles VI of France.\nBy 1405, most French forces had withdrawn after politics in Paris shifted towards peace, with the Hundred Years' War continuing between England and France. On 31 March 1406 Glynd\u0175r wrote a letter to be sent to Charles VI of France in St Peter ad Vincula church at Pennal, hence its naming after the location it was written at. Glynd\u0175r's letter requested to maintain military support from the French to fend off the English in Wales. Glynd\u0175r suggested that in return, he would recognise Benedict XIII of Avignon as the Pope. The letter sets out the ambitions of Glynd\u0175r for an independent Wales with its own parliament, led by himself as Prince of Wales. These ambitions also included the return of the traditional law of Hywel Dda, rather than the enforced English law, establishment of an independent Welsh church as well as two universities, one in south Wales, and one in north Wales. Following this letter, senior churchmen and important members of society flocked to Glynd\u0175r's banner and English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and fortified manor houses.\nGlynd\u0175r's Great Seal and a letter handwritten by him to the French in 1406 are in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France in Paris. This letter is currently held in the Archives Nationales in Paris. Facsimile copies involving specialist ageing techniques and moulds of Glynd\u0175r's seal were created by the National Library of Wales and presented by the heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones to six Welsh institutions in 2009. The royal great seal from 1404 was given to Charles IV of France and contains images and Glynd\u0175r's title \u2013 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2013 \"Owain, by the grace of God, Prince of Wales\". Glyndwr referred to himself as the \"Prince of Wales\" and claimed his \"right of inheritance\" in these letters\nThe faltering rebellion.\nIn early 1405, the Welsh forces, who had until then won several easy victories, suffered a series of defeats. Glynd\u0175r's brother, Lord Tudur ap Gruffudd, a commander during the war, died at the Battle of Pwll Melyn in May 1405. English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland and would over time push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.\nFollowing the intervention of French forces, battling ensued for years, and in 1406 Prince Henry restored fines and redemption for Welsh soldiers to choose their own fate, prisoners were taken after the battle, and castles were restored to their original owners, this same year a son of Glynd\u0175r died in battle. By 1408 Glynd\u0175r had taken refuge in the North of Wales, having lost his ally from Northumberland.\nDespite the initial success of the revolution, in 1407 the superior numbers, resources, and wealth that England had at its disposal eventually began to turn the tide of the war, and the much larger and better-equipped English forces gradually began to overwhelm the Welsh. In times of war, the English changed their strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions as favoured by his father, the young Prince Henry adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control, he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407, this strategy was beginning to bear fruit, and by 1408, the English regained Aberystwyth and then marched north Harlech Castle, which also surrendered during the cold winter into 1409. Edmund Mortimer died during the siege, and Owain's wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of Mortimer's granddaughters were captured on the fall of the castle and imprisoned in the Tower of London. They were all to die in the Tower in 1413 and were buried at St Swithin, London Stone. Before his downfall, Glynd\u0175r was considered the wealthiest of all Welshmen.\nGlynd\u0175r managed to escape capture by disguising himself as an elderly man, sneaking out of the castle and slipping past the English military blockade in the darkness of the night. Glynd\u0175r retreated to the Welsh wilderness with a band of loyal supporters; he refused to surrender and continued the war with guerrilla tactics such as launching sporadic raids and ambushes throughout Wales and the English borderlands.\nGlynd\u0175r remained free, but he had lost his ancestral home and was a hunted prince. He continued the rebellion, particularly wanting to avenge his wife. In 1410, Owain led a raid into rebel-controlled Shropshire, and in 1412, he carried out one of the final successful raids. With his most faithful soldiers, he cut through the King's men in an ambush in Brecon, where he captured, and later ransomed, a leading Welsh supporter of King Henry, Dafydd Gam ('Crooked David'). This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies, although it was claimed he took refuge with the Scudamore family. In the autumn, Glynd\u0175r's Aberystwyth Castle surrendered, while he was away fighting, but by then things were changing. Henry IV died in 1413, and his son Henry V began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Welsh. Royal pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the Herefordshire-based Lollard leader Sir John Oldcastle was communicating with Owain, and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south.\nOn 21 December 1411, the King of England issued pardons to all Welsh except their leader and Thomas of Trumpington (until 9 April 1413, from which Glynd\u0175r was no longer excepted). Glynd\u0175r ignored offers of a pardon on many different occasions, his followers continued to be punished for crimes of war until the 1410s. His death was recorded by a former follower in the year 1415.\nDisappearance.\nNothing certain is known of Glynd\u0175r after 1412. Despite enormous rewards being offered, he was neither captured nor betrayed. He ignored royal pardons, and it is thought he died in 1415, and certainly by 1417. Adam of Usk, a one-time supporter of Glynd\u0175r, and writing after the fact, made the following entry in his Chronicle for the year 1415: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"he was buried at night by his followers. But his burial was detected by his opponents; so he was re-buried. But where his body lies is unknown.\"Thomas Pennant writes that Glynd\u0175r died on 20 September 1415 at the age of 61 (which would place his birth at approximately 1354).\nGlynd\u0175r may have lived his last days at Kentchurch in south Herefordshire, the home of the Scudamore family. The poet Lewys Glyn Cothi wrote an elegy for Gwenllian, an illegitimate daughter of Glynd\u0175r, where it was mentioned that at the time of the Welsh War of independence, the whole of Wales was under Glynd\u0175r's command, with forty dukes as the prince's allies, and that later in life he supported 62 female pensioners.\nThere are many folk tales of Glynd\u0175r donning disguises to gain an advantage over opponents during the rebellion, and after his disappearance, there has been persistent speculation that the Welsh religious poet, Si\u00f4n Cent, the family chaplain of the Scudamore family, was Owain Glynd\u0175r in disguise.\nBurial.\nAlthough the location of his burial is unknown, there has long been speculation where Glynd\u0175r's final resting place may be. In 1875, the Rev. Francis Kilvert wrote in his diary that he saw the grave of \"Owen Glendower\" in the churchyard at Monnington on Wye \"[h]ard by the church porch and on the western side of it ... It is a flat stone of whitish-grey shaped like a rude obelisk figure, sunk deep into the ground in the middle of an oblong patch of earth from which the turf has been pared away, and, alas, smashed into several fragments.\" Another nearby location is suggested by Adrien Jones, the president of the Owain Glynd\u0175r Society, who stated, \"Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glynd\u0175r, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle in Herefordshire, where one of Glynd\u0175r's daughters, Alice, lived. Mr. Skidmore told us that he (Glynd\u0175r) spent his last days there and eventually died there... It was a family secret for 600 years, and even Mr Skidmore's mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle.\"\nThe historian Gruffydd Aled Williams suggests in a 2017 monograph that the burial site is in the Kimbolton Chapel near Leominster, the present parish church of St James the Great which used to be the chapelry of Leominster Priory, based upon a number of manuscripts held in the National Archives. Although Kimbolton is an unexceptional and relatively unknown place outside of Herefordshire, it is closely connected to the Scudamore family.\nIssue and descendants.\nOwain married Margaret Hanmer, also known by her Welsh name Marred ferch Dafydd, and together they had five or six sons and four or five daughters. Also, Owain had some illegitimate children out of wedlock.\nSons.\nAll of Owain and Margaret's sons from their marriage were either taken prisoner and died in confinement, or died in battle and had no issue. Gruffudd was captured in Gwent by Prince Henry, imprisoned in Nottingham Castle, and later taken to the Tower of London in 1410. Maredudd was recorded as communicating with John Talbot and the English Crown on 24 February 1416, and receiving a royal pardon in 1421, but dying a few years later.\nDaughters.\nUpon Owain's disappearance and death, his eldest (oldest child with descendants) daughter Alice came to be known as the Lady of Glyndyfrdwy and Cynllaith, and heiress de jure of the Principalities of Powys, South Wales and Gwynedd. During 1431, she successfully went to court in Meirionydd to regain her inheritance as the heiress of Sycharth in Glyndyfrdwy against John, Earl of Somerset, who had been granted Owain's forfeited lands by the King of England in 1400. Alice's descendants married into the Scudamore family and her direct descendant John Lucy Scudamore married the daughter of Harford Jones-Brydges in the early 19th century, and whose daughter in 1852 married the son of Edward Lucas from the Castleshane estate in Ireland. Another daughter, Jane, married Henry, Lord Grey de Ruthin without issue. Then, Janet married into the noble family of Croft Castle in Herefordshire, whose descendants today are titled the Croft Baronets. Whilst Margaret married a knight from Monnington, also in Herefordshire.\nIllegitimate.\nGlynd\u0175r's illegitimate children with other women included Ieuan, Myfanwy and Gwenllian, whilst it is debated whether his son David was born out of wedlock. Ieuan became Glynd\u0175r's only male descendant to have children. Like his other illegitimate kin, they remained in Wales and married locally into Welsh families. Gwenllian became the wife of Philip ab Rhys ab Cenarth, and died near St Harmon in Powys (Radnorshire).\nFamily poem.\nIolo Goch wrote of Glynd\u0175r's wife, Margaret:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The best of wives.\nEminent woman of a knightly family,\nHer children come in pairs,\nA beautiful nest of chieftains.\nWelsh kingdoms lineage.\nOwain Glynd\u0175r had claims to royal ancestry from all three of the final ruling royal houses of Wales; Powys (Mathrafal) and Deheubarth (Dinefwr), and Gwynedd (Aberffraw). His claims were clearest for the first two of these:\nGwynedd ancestry.\nAs well as being a direct genealogical descendant of the final ruling monarchs of Powys and Deheubarth, Owain Glyndwr's ancestors were also descended from the Welsh medieval Kingdom of Gwynedd, descended from the Gwynedd King Gruffudd ap Cynan (d. 1137), via his great-grandmother Gwenllian. However, some sources claim that another ruler of Gwynedd, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn I, The Great d. 1240), Gruffudd ap Cynan's great-grandson, was Glyndwr's nearest Gwynedd royal ancestor. Elsewhere, a third suggestion is that he was descended from Llywelyn II, Prince of Wales (Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, d. 1282), and his daughter Catherine. Llywelyn II was Llywelyn I's grandson, and also the penultimate Prince of Gwynedd from the final generation of the Aberffraw rulers in Wales before his brother, Dafydd III. Yet some historians note that Llywelyn II's only recorded child was a daughter, Gwenllian, who died in 1337 without issue. Professor John Edward Lloyd said: \"There is no evidence that Llywelyn had any daughter but Gwenllian, born in the last year of his life and after his death confined for the rest of her days as a nun of the order of Sempringham\". Lloyd's assessment has been repeated by those scholars. The claim to Gwynedd heritage through female lines, however, was subject to Welsh law and was legitimate, albeit with the recognition that \"the direct male line of Gwynedd had undeniably become extinct in 1378. Its last representative was Owain Lawgoch.\"\nLegacy.\nIn Welsh culture Glynd\u0175r acquired a mythical status alongside other medieval kings such as Cadwaladr, Cynon ap Clydno and King Arthur. He was perceived as a folk hero awaiting a call to return and liberate his people in the classic Welsh mythical role \u2013 (\"The Foretold Son\"). The myth was that one day after a thousand years of servitude under English rule, a 'Son of Prophecy' would return the Welsh people as rulers of the island of Great Britain. Also, in Welsh folklore, the name Owain has been connected to a legend of the 'son of destiny'. His claim as the Prince of Wales was similar to that of another distant relative from the Gwynedd dynasty. It was another Owain, Lawgoch (Owain ap Thomas ap Rhodri) who proclaimed his patrimony a few decades earlier, when he attempted to regain his family stature with aid from the King of France in a Franco-Welsh alliance from the late 1360s, until his assassination in 1378.\nModern legacy.\nMeibion Glynd\u0175r.\nGlynd\u0175r is now remembered as a national hero and numerous small groups have adopted his symbolism to advocate independence for Wales or Welsh nationalism. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling itself Meibion Glynd\u0175r (\"the Sons of Glynd\u0175r\") claimed responsibility for the burning of English holiday homes in Wales.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name is Latin for the eighth part of a circle, but it is named after the octant, a navigational instrument. Devised by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752, Octans remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The southern celestial pole is located within the boundaries of Octans.\nHistory and mythology.\nOctans was one of 14 constellations created by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, and was originally named \"l\u2019Octans de Reflexion\" (\u201cthe reflecting octant\u201d) in 1752, after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment.\nIt was part of his catalogue of the southern sky, the \"Coelum Australe Stelliferum\", which was published posthumously in 1763. In Europe, it became more widely known as \"Octans Hadleianus\", in honor of English mathematician John Hadley, who invented the octant in 1730. There is no real mythology related to Octans, partially due to its faintness and relative recentness, but mostly because of its extreme southerly latitude.\nNotable features.\nStars.\nOctans is a generally inconspicuous constellation with only one star brighter than magnitude 4.\nThis constellation is unusual on that its brightest member has a very late Bayer designation: Nu Octantis. A spectral class K1\u00a0IV subgiant with an apparent magnitude\u00a03.73, it has a white dwarf companion and is orbited by one exoplanet.\nBeta Octantis is the second brightest star in the constellation.\nPolaris Australis (Sigma Octantis), the southern pole star, is a magnitude\u00a05.4 star just over 1\u00a0degree away from the true south celestial pole. Its relative faintness means that it is not practical for navigation.\nBQ Octantis is a fainter, magnitude 6.82 star located much closer to the South Pole (at less than a degree) than Sigma.\nIn addition to having the current southern pole star of Earth, Octans also contains the southern pole star of the planet Saturn, which is the magnitude\u00a04.3 Delta Octantis.\nThe Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 reported that observations of the Mira variable stars R and T Octantis were urgently needed.\nAt least four star systems are known to have planets. Mu2 Octantis is a binary star system, the brighter component of which has a planet. Nu Octantis A also has a planet orbiting. HD 142022 is a binary system, a component of which is a sunlike star with a massive planet with an orbital period of 1928 \u00b1 46 days. HD 212301 is a yellow-white main sequence star with a hot jupiter that completes an orbit every 2.2 days.\nDeep sky objects.\nNGC 2573 (also known as Polarissima Australis) is a faint barred spiral galaxy that happens to be the closest NGC object to the south celestial pole. NGC 7095 and NGC 7098 are two barred spiral galaxies that are 115 million and 95 million light-years distant from Earth respectively. The sparse open cluster Collinder 411 is also located in the constellation.\nNamesakes.\n was a stores ship used by the United States Navy during World War II.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of three main island groups\u2014the Okinawa Islands, the Sakishima Islands, and the Dait\u014d Islands\u2014spread across a maritime zone approximately 1,000 kilometers east to west and 400 kilometers north to south. Despite a modest land area of 2,281 km2 (880 sq mi), Okinawa's territorial extent over surrounding seas makes its total area nearly half the combined size of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Of its 160 islands, 49 are inhabited. The largest and most populous island is Okinawa Island, which hosts the capital city, Naha, as well as major urban centers such as Okinawa, Uruma, and Urasoe. The prefecture has a subtropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and high rainfall throughout the year. People from the Nansei Islands, including Okinawa, the Sakishima Islands, and parts of Kagoshima Prefecture, are often collectively referred to as Ryukyuans. However, there are significant cultural and customary differences between individual islands and even between local communities.\nHistorically the center of the Ryukyu Kingdom, Okinawa long served as a maritime trading hub and cultural gateway; the kingdom participated in the Chinese tributary system\u2014maintaining formal tribute relations with the Ming and Qing\u2014and retained distinct statehood until it was incorporated into Japan as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879 following the Ryukyu Disposition. After the Battle of Okinawa (1945), the islands were under U.S. administration until reversion to Japan in 1972, and today host a large share of U.S. military facilities in Japan (around 70% by area of land exclusively used by U.S. forces), a continuing source of local and national debate. A small but persistent independence movement exists, reflecting Okinawa's distinct historical trajectory and identity.\nOver time, Okinawa developed its own distinctive traditions, cuisine, and performing arts. Today, Okinawan music, characterized by the iconic \"sanshin\" instrument, and festivals such as \"Eisa\" have gained popularity across the country. The islands are also the birthplace of karate, later popularized on the Japanese mainland and worldwide. The prefectural economy is predominantly service-based, with tourism and related services as major drivers, while manufacturing plays a comparatively small role.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric and ancient history.\nThe prehistoric history of Okinawa differs significantly from that of mainland Japan. Prior to written records, it is generally divided into two periods: the Paleolithic era and the Shellmidden period (Kaizuka period). The earliest evidence of human activity in Okinawa includes the Yamashita Cave Man, dating back approximately 32,000 years, and the Minatogawa Man from around 18,000 years ago. In 2012, the world's oldest known fishhook was discovered in the Sakitari Cave site in Nanjo City, Okinawa Prefecture.\nThe Shellmidden Period in Okinawa roughly corresponds to the J\u014dmon through Heian periods of mainland Japan, with a chronological gap of about 10,000 years from the Paleolithic era.\nAt the Kogachibaru Shell Mound, archaeological findings include pottery styles such as Sobata and Ichiki, which originate from the Kyushu region, obsidian from Koshidake in Saga Prefecture, and jade from Itoigawa in Niigata Prefecture used for ornamental pendants. These discoveries indicate that close exchanges with Kyushu were already taking place during this time.\nHowever, by the middle of the Shellmidden Period, Okinawan pottery began to exhibit clearly localized characteristics. Examples include the Iha and Ogido pottery styles, which are distinct to the region.\nIn contrast to the Shellmidden culture of Okinawa Island, which was influenced primarily by mainland Japan, the prehistoric cultures of the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands were shaped more significantly by southern cultures, including those from the Philippines.\nGusuku and Sanzan periods.\nFrom the 12th century onward, Okinawa entered the Gusuku period, characterized by the development of an agrarian society. During this time, populations moved from coastal dunes to more fertile limestone plateaus, leading to significant population growth and the beginnings of international trade. Local chieftains, known as Aji, constructed fortified residences called Gusuku to protect their territories and expand their influence through foreign trade. Gusuku sites are found throughout the Ryukyu Islands, from the Amami Islands in the north to the Yaeyama Islands in the south, with estimates ranging from 300 to 400 sites in total. Early Gusuku were generally small, covering about 1,000 square meters, but larger fortresses appeared in later periods.\nBy the 14th century, Okinawa Island was divided into three polities, marking the beginning of the Sanzan period. These were the Kingdom of Hokuzan, centered at Nakijin Castle in the north; the Kingdom of Ch\u016bzan, centered at Urasoe Castle in the central region; and the Kingdom of Nanzan, centered at \u014czato Castle in the south.\nAccording to official histories compiled by the royal government in Shuri\u2014such as the \"Ch\u016bzan Seikan\", \"Ch\u016bzan Seifu\", and \"Ky\u016by\u014d\"\u2014the first royal lineage of Ryukyu was the legendary Tenson dynasty. After internal conflict during its 25th generation, a local Aji named Shunten from Urasoe was supported by the people, quelled the unrest, and was crowned as the first king of the Ryukyu Kingdom. However, these early historical accounts are heavily mythologized, and even if Shunten was a real historical figure, he likely ruled only the Urasoe area as an Aji. The Shunten dynasty lasted for three generations before being overthrown by the Eiso dynasty, which in turn was replaced by the Satto dynasty after four generations. By this time, Okinawa Island had effectively split into the three kingdoms of Hokuzan, Ch\u016bzan, and Nanzan.\nIn 1372, the Ming dynasty of China dispatched an envoy, Yang Zai, to the Kingdom of Ch\u016bzan, requesting the king, Satto, to enter into a tributary relationship. Satto agreed, and soon after, the kings of Nanzan (Ch\u014dsatto) and Hokuzan (Hanishi) also began paying tribute to the Ming court, bringing all three kingdoms into the Chinese tributary system.\nIn 1406, the Aji of Sashiki, Sh\u014d Hashi, overthrew King Bunei of the Satto dynasty and installed his father, Sh\u014d Shish\u014d, as king, establishing the First Sh\u014d Dynasty. In 1416, Sh\u014d Hashi capitalized on dissatisfaction among the Aji of Hokuzan with their king, Hananchi, and conquered the kingdom. The Kingdom of Nanzan, plagued by internal conflict under the rule of Tarumoi, was defeated by Sh\u014d Hashi in 1429, completing the unification of Okinawa Island under the Ch\u016bzan Kingdom.\nRyukyu Kingdom period.\nThe First Sh\u014d Dynasty experienced political instability due to the early deaths of several kings. After the death of the fifth king, Sh\u014d Kinpuku, a succession dispute known as the Shirii-Tumui rebellion broke out. Order was eventually restored when Sh\u014d Taiky\u016b ascended as the sixth king. During his reign, another major conflict, the Gosamaru\u2013Amawari rebellion, occurred, but Sh\u014d Taiky\u016b was able to suppress it. His successor, King Sh\u014d Toku, was known as a tyrant. After his death, a coup led by royal officials installed the high-ranking bureaucrat Kanemaru as king. Kanemaru took the royal name Sh\u014d En, founding the Second Sh\u014d Dynasty.\nUnder the rule of the third king of the dynasty, Sh\u014d Shin, a centralized administration was firmly established. Sh\u014d Shin relocated powerful regional chieftains (Aji) to the capital of Shuri and appointed state officials to govern the provinces directly. The territorial extent of the Ryukyu Kingdom also expanded, covering the area from the Amami Islands in the north to the Yaeyama Islands in the south. Culturally, this era was a golden age for the kingdom, with significant development in the arts, religion, and architecture.\nBy actively participating in the tribute system with the Ming dynasty, the Ryukyu Kingdom received preferential treatment and became a key intermediary trading hub in East Asia. Many of the tribute goods presented to China originated from Japan, while Chinese goods were exported to Japan through Ryukyu. Southeast Asia, China, and Japan were Ryukyu's primary trade partners, and the kingdom also maintained trade with the Korean Peninsula. However, Ryukyu's significance as a trade hub declined in the 16th century with the Age of Discovery, as Portuguese and Spanish merchants entered East Asia, and China gradually relaxed its maritime prohibition policies.\nThe Miyako Islands and Yaeyama Islands had long been politically fragmented. In 1474, local strongman Nakasone Toyomiya of Miyako Island submitted to the Ryukyu Kingdom, bringing the island under centralized control. In 1500, Ryukyuan forces defeated Oyake Akahachi, the ruler of Ishigaki Island. In 1522, Nakasone Toyomiya conquered Yonaguni Island, completing the unification of the Yaeyama Islands under Ryukyuan rule. The Amami Islands in the north also came under Ryukyuan control by 1466.\nIn 1609, the Shimazu clan of the Satsuma Domain invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom in what is known as the Invasion of Ryukyu. King Sh\u014d Nei surrendered, and the kingdom became a vassal state under Satsuma's control. The Amami Islands were ceded to Satsuma as part of the settlement. While Ryukyu was partially integrated into Japan's feudal han system, it continued to function as a nominally independent kingdom and maintained its tributary relationship with China.Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate. Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years.\nIn the mid-17th century, the Ryukyuan reformer Haneji Ch\u014dsh\u016b implemented significant political and social reforms promoting pro-Japanese policies. In the mid-18th century, Sai On, a statesman and scholar, continued these reforms and greatly improved the internal administration of the kingdom.\nIn 1816, two British ships visited Ryukyu but made no demands for trade or missionary activity. In 1844, France became the first European country to officially request trade with Ryukyu. In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States East India Squadron stopped in Ryukyu prior to his negotiations with the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan.\nFirst Okinawa Prefecture period.\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration, Japan began its modernization process by abolishing the han system and establishing prefectures in 1871. That same year, the Mudan Incident occurred when a Ryukyuan ship drifted to Taiwan and its crew was killed by local indigenous people. This event became a pretext for Japan to assert control over the Ryukyu Kingdom. In 1872, Japan reclassified the kingdom as the Ryukyu Domain, a move known as the Ryukyu Disposition. To avoid backlash from the Qing dynasty and Ryukyuan royalty, the Meiji government initially designated Ryukyu as a \"domain\" rather than a \"prefecture\", a designation that had already been abolished in mainland Japan.\nIn 1874, another Ryukyuan shipwreck incident led to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874 (the Botan War), in which Japan dispatched troops to Taiwan. During post-conflict negotiations, the Qing acknowledged Japan's actions as \"a righteous act of protecting its people.\" Japan interpreted this as de facto recognition of Ryukyu as Japanese territory and subsequently ordered the Ryukyu Domain to cease its tribute missions to China. This triggered internal division within the Ryukyuan court between pro-Japan and pro-China factions.\nIn March 1879, the Japanese government officially abolished the Ryukyu Domain and established Okinawa Prefecture, relocating King Sh\u014d Tai to Tokyo. Some Ryukyuan nobles and civilians fled to China and appealed to the Qing government to restore the Ryukyu Kingdom. Resistance in the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands was especially strong, culminating in the K\u014dchi Incident, in which locals killed a Japanese interpreter. However, the rebellion was eventually suppressed.\nThe Qing dynasty invited former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant to mediate the dispute. Grant proposed a compromise in which the Okinawa Islands would go to Japan, while the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands would be ceded to China. The Qing countered with a plan that would return the Ryukyu Kingdom to the Okinawa Islands, assign the Amami Islands to Japan, and annex the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands to China. Ultimately, the negotiations failed. After the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan and lost influence in the region, silencing calls for the restoration of Ryukyu.\nIn the early years of direct Japanese rule, a policy known as the was implemented, maintaining Ryukyuan land and tax systems, which slowed Okinawa's modernization. After the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan replaced this policy with an assimilation strategy, accelerating Okinawa's Japanization. However, Okinawa's strategic and economic importance declined, particularly after Taiwan became Japan's new southern frontier and sugar-producing center.\nIn the 20th century, Japan undertook major land reforms and prioritized sugar production in Okinawa, though economic development remained far behind mainland Japan. Transportation infrastructure also modernized, with new roads, railways, and ferry routes to the Japanese mainland established in the early 1900s. During the early Taish\u014d era, Okinawa briefly prospered as sugar prices soared due to World War I. However, by the late Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa era, the Great Depression struck, causing widespread famine. Many impoverished farmers resorted to eating the toxic cycad plant to survive, in what became known as the \"Cycad Hell\" (). Many Okinawans migrated to mainland Japan or abroad. Between 1923 and 1930, Okinawans accounted for 10% of all Japanese emigrants. Remittances from overseas workers contributed 40% to 65% of the prefecture's annual budget.\nIn the 1930s, Japan increasingly pursued a path of militarism. By the 1940s, Okinawa Prefecture was integrated into the wartime regime. The government enforced standard Japanese language use and replaced traditional Ryukyuan name pronunciations with Japanese ones as part of a broader imperial assimilation policy.\nIn 1943, the Japanese military began seizing land in Okinawa to build airbases. In 1944, the 32nd Army was stationed in Okinawa, requisitioning resources from civilians and initiating evacuations to mainland Japan and Taiwan. In August 1944, the evacuation ship Tsushima Maru, carrying about 1,700 evacuees, was sunk by an American submarine, resulting in 1,476 deaths. In October that same year, Naha was bombed in the 10-10 air raids, destroying 90% of the city.\nIn 1945, Okinawa became the site of the largest ground battle on Japanese soil during the Pacific War. The Battle of Okinawa resulted in the deaths of approximately 12,520 American soldiers and an estimated 200,000 Japanese personnel, including military and civilians.\nThe United States military landed on the coast of Yomitan Village, Okinawa Island, on April 1 and quickly secured control over the northern half of the island. The Japanese forces, facing overwhelming American attacks, retreated to the southern part of the island. Shuri Castle, which served as the headquarters of the Japanese command, was destroyed, and on June 23, organized resistance ended with the suicide of Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, the commanding officer of the Okinawan defense forces, and other high-ranking staff at Mabuni.\nOver approximately three months of intense fighting, a large number of civilians were killed as a result of American naval bombardment that affected residential areas, extensive aerial bombing, and the use of flamethrowers against natural caves (gama) and civilian air-raid shelters. Additionally, there were numerous instances of group suicides among civilians, driven in part by fear of American capture. It is estimated that one in four residents of Okinawa perished, and the island was left devastated.\nPostwar disposition disputes.\nDuring World War II, the Allied powers engaged in multiple rounds of discussions regarding the postwar status of the Ryukyu Islands. At the Cairo Conference in 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proactively raised the issue of Ryukyu's sovereignty, suggesting that China might administer the islands after the war. However, Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek responded only cautiously, proposing instead a joint occupation and international trusteeship. As a result, the Cairo Declaration made no explicit reference to the Ryukyus, instead stating that territories such as Taiwan and the Pescadores\u2014seized by Japan\u2014should be returned to China. Historians believe Chiang hesitated because he was unsure whether Roosevelt's offer was sincere or a diplomatic probe, and because the wartime Nationalist government relied heavily on American support and wished to avoid a territorial dispute.\nAs the Pacific War progressed, the U.S. military increasingly emphasized the strategic importance of the Ryukyus. In 1944, some U.S. officials proposed exclusive control of the islands to serve as a bulwark against Soviet expansion and threats from the Asian mainland. Roosevelt reportedly expressed to Joseph Stalin his support for returning the Ryukyus to China, but no formal agreements emerged from the Cairo, Yalta, or Potsdam meetings. The Potsdam Declaration stated only that Japanese sovereignty would be limited to the islands of Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Hokkaido, while other territories\u2014including the Ryukyus\u2014would be subject to future decisions by the Allied powers.\nAfter the war, the Nationalist government of China recognized the strategic value of the Ryukyu Islands and proposed a joint trusteeship with the United States for a period of five to ten years. Later proposals included allowing the U.S. to establish bases on some islands, indicating a willingness to compromise and an understanding that the U.S. would not readily transfer sovereignty to China. Chinese domestic opinion was divided: some called for an independent Ryukyuan state, others demanded the full incorporation of the Ryukyus into Chinese territory. Most emphasized the islands' strategic importance as a buffer zone and argued they should not fall into the hands of another power.\nIn 1946, the United States Department of State advocated for the return of the Ryukyus to Japan, citing anti-expansion principles and concerns over economic burdens. In contrast, the U.S. military proposed that the islands be designated as a \"strategic trust territory,\" with Okinawa Island declared a \"strategic area.\" Military leaders argued that the high cost of American lives during the Battle of Okinawa justified permanent military governance as compensation for their sacrifice. After internal debate, the plan was formalized in SWNCC 59 / 1, which proposed placing Okinawa under U.S. military administration rather than returning it to Japan, using trusteeship arrangements to sidestep sovereignty issues. The directives SCAPIN-677 and SCAPIN-841 established the legal and administrative basis for U.S. jurisdiction south of the 29th parallel north, forming the framework for postwar American control.\nU.S. administration (1945\u20131972).\nOn April 1, 1945, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps launched an invasion of Okinawa with approximately 185,000 troops. They encountered determined and intense resistance from the Japanese defenders. During the subsequent fighting, approximately one-third of Okinawa's civilian population lost their lives. The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the Cornerstone of Peace.\nAfter the end of World War II, the United States set up the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands, which later became the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands. The United States established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu Islands during its 27-year-long \"trusteeship rule\". \nContinued U.S. military buildup.\nDuring the Korean War, B-29 Superfortresses flew bombing missions over Korea from Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. The military buildup on the island during the Cold War increased a division between local inhabitants and the American military. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, United States Forces Japan (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence.\nDuring the mid-1950s, the U.S. seized land from Okinawans to build new bases or expand currently existing ones. According to the Melvin Price Report, by 1955, the military had displaced 250,000 residents.\nSecret U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons.\nSince 1960, the U.S. and Japan have maintained an agreement that allows the U.S. to secretly bring nuclear weapons into Japanese ports. The Japanese people tended to oppose the introduction of nuclear arms into Japanese territory; the Japanese government's assertion of Japan's non-nuclear policy and a statement of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles reflected this popular opposition. Most of the weapons were alleged to be stored in ammunition bunkers at Kadena Air Base. Between 1954 and 1972, 19 different types of nuclear weapons were deployed in Okinawa, but with fewer than around 1,000 warheads at any one time. In fall 1960, U.S. commandos in Green Light Teams secret training missions carried small nuclear weapons on the east coast of Okinawa Island.\nVietnam War.\nBetween 1965 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for United States in its military operations directed towards North Vietnam. Along with Guam, it presented a geographically strategic launch pad for covert bombing missions over Cambodia and Laos. Anti-Vietnam War sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan. In 1965, the U.S. military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the differences between United States and Okinawa but showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan.\nAs controversy grew regarding the alleged placement of nuclear weapons on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation of the Vietnam War. Okinawa was perceived by some inside Japan as a potential target for China, should the communist government feel threatened by United States. American military secrecy blocked any local reporting on what was actually occurring at bases such as Kadena Air Base. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the local population began to fear the potential for retaliation.\nPolitical leaders such as Makoto Oda, a major figure in the Beheiren movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces, ending Japan's involvement in Vietnam. In a speech delivered in 1967, Oda was critical of Prime Minister Eisaku Sat\u014d's unilateral support of America's war in Vietnam, claiming \"Realistically we are all guilty of complicity in the Vietnam War\". The Beheiren became a more visible anti-war movement on Okinawa as the American involvement in Vietnam intensified. The movement employed tactics ranging from demonstrations to handing leaflets to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines directly, warning of the implications for a third World War.\nThe U.S. military bases on Okinawa became a focal point for anti-Vietnam War sentiment. By 1969, over 50,000 American military personnel were stationed on Okinawa. United States Department of Defense began referring to Okinawa as the \"Keystone of the Pacific\". This slogan was imprinted on local U.S. military license plates.\nIn 1969, chemicals leaked from the U.S. storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under Operation Red Hat. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide area for two months. Even two years later, government investigators found that Okinawans and the environment near the leak were still suffering because of the depot.\nOn May 15, 1972, the U.S. government returned the islands to Japan following the signing of the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement.\nPost-reversion history (1972\u2013present).\nThe U.S. Marine Corps buried a massive stockpile of Agent Orange at the Futenma air station in Okinawa, seriously sickening the base's former head of maintenance and potentially contaminating nearby residents and the ground beneath the base. The barrels were abandoned in Okinawa at the end of the Vietnam War \u2013 when the U.S. government banned the dioxin-laden defoliant for health reasons \u2014 and were buried at the installation in the city of Ginowan after the Pentagon ignored repeated requests to safely dispose of them, according to the veterans who served at the installation in the 1970s and 1980s.The 1995 kidnaping, beating, and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen triggered widespread protests in Okinawa. Reports by the local media of accidents and crimes committed by U.S. servicemen have reduced the local population's support for the U.S. military bases. A strong emotional response has emerged from certain incidents. \nDocuments declassified in 1997 proved that both tactical and strategic weapons have been maintained in Okinawa. In 1999 and 2002, the \"Japan Times\" and the \"Okinawa Times\" reported speculation that not all weapons were removed from Okinawa. On October 25, 2005, after a decade of negotiations, the governments of the U.S. and Japan officially agreed to move Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from its location in the densely populated city of Ginowan to the more northerly and remote Camp Schwab in Nago by building a heliport with a shorter runway, partly on Camp Schwab land and partly running into the sea. The move is partly an attempt to relieve tensions between the people of Okinawa and the Marine Corps.\nDespite Okinawa prefecture constituting only 0.6% of Japan's land surface, in 2006 75% of all USFJ bases were located on Okinawa, occupying 18% of the main island.\nIn a poll conducted by \"The Asahi Shimbun\" in May 2010, 43% of the Okinawan population wanted the complete closure of the U.S. bases, 42% wanted reduction, and 11% wanted to maintain the status quo. Okinawan feelings about the U.S. military are complex.\nIn early 2008, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a young girl of 14 by a Marine on Okinawa. The U.S. military imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew on military personnel and their families to ease the anger of local residents. Some cited statistics that the crime rate of military personnel is consistently less than that of the general Okinawan population. However, some criticized the statistics as unreliable, since violence against women is under-reported. Between 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 burglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults and 2,827 thefts. Yet, per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data, U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans.\nIn 2009, a new Japanese government came to power and froze the U.S. forces relocation plan but in April 2010 indicated their interest in resolving the issue by proposing a modified plan. A study done in 2010 found that the prolonged exposure to aircraft noise around the Kadena Air Base and other military bases cause health issues such as a disrupted sleep pattern, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system in children, and a loss of hearing.\nIn 2011, it was reported that the U.S. military\u2014contrary to repeated denials by The Pentagon\u2014had kept tens of thousands of barrels of Agent Orange on the island. The Japanese and American governments have angered some U.S. veterans, who believe they were poisoned by Agent Orange while serving on the island, by characterizing their statements regarding Agent Orange as \"dubious\", and ignoring their requests for compensation. Reports that more than a third of the barrels developed leaks have led Okinawans to ask for environmental investigations, but as of 2012[ [update]] both Tokyo and Washington refused such action. Jon Mitchell has reported concern that the U.S. used American Marines as chemical-agent guinea pigs.\nOn September 30, 2018, Denny Tamaki was elected as the next governor of Okinawa prefecture, after a campaign focused on sharply reducing the U.S. military presence on the island.\nMarine Corps Air Station Futenma relocation.\nIn 2006, some 8,000 U.S. Marines were removed from the island and relocated to Guam. The move to Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz was expected to be completed in 2023 but as of January 1, 2025, is still in process. Japan paid for a majority of the cost to construct the new base. The U.S. still maintains Air Force, Marine, Navy, and Army military installations on the islands. These bases include Kadena Air Base, Camp Foster, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Camp Hansen, Camp Schwab, Torii Station, Camp Kinser, and Camp Gonsalves. The area of 14 U.S. bases are , occupying 18% of the main island. Okinawa hosts about two-thirds of the 50,000 American forces in Japan although the islands account for less than one percent of total lands in Japan.\nSuburbs have grown towards and now surround two historic major bases, Futenma and Kadena. A sizable portion of the land used by the U.S. military is Camp Gonsalves in the north of the island. On December 21, 2016, 10,000 acres of Camp Gonsalves were returned to Japan. On June 25, 2018, Okinawa residents held a protest demonstration at sea against scheduled land reclamation work for the relocation of a U.S. military base within Japan's southernmost island prefecture. A protest gathered hundreds of people.\nSince the early 2000s, Okinawans have opposed the presence of American troops helipads in the Takae zone of the Yanbaru forest near Higashi and Kunigami. This opposition grew in July 2016 after the construction of six new helipads.\nGeography.\nMajor islands.\nThe islands comprising the prefecture are the southern two thirds of the archipelago of the . Okinawa's inhabited islands are typically divided into three geographical archipelagos. From northeast to southwest:\nNatural parks.\nApproximately 36% percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as natural parks, namely the Iriomote-Ishigaki, Kerama Shot\u014d, and Yambaru National Parks; Okinawa Kaigan and Okinawa Senseki Quasi-National Parks; and Irabu, Kumejima, Tarama, and Tonaki Prefectural Natural Parks.\nEcology.\nThe dugong is an endangered marine mammal related to the manatee. Iriomote is home to one of the world's rarest and most endangered cat species, the Iriomote cat. The region is also home to at least one endemic pit viper, \"Trimeresurus elegans\". The islands of Okinawa are surrounded by some of the most abundant coral reefs found in the world. The world's largest colony of rare blue coral is found off Ishigaki Island. The sea turtles return yearly to the southern islands of Okinawa to lay their eggs. The summer months carry warnings to swimmers regarding venomous jellyfish and other dangerous sea creatures.\nOkinawa is a major producer of sugar cane, pineapple, papaya, and other tropical fruit, and the Southeast Botanical Gardens represent tropical plant species.\nGeology.\nThe island is largely composed of coral, and rainwater filtering through that coral has given the island many caves, which played an important role in the Battle of Okinawa. Gyokusendo is an extensive limestone cave in the southern part of Okinawa's main island.\nClimate.\nThe island experiences temperatures above for most of the year. The climate of the islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa\") in the north, such as Okinawa Island, to tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Af\") in the south such as Iriomote Island. Snowfall is unheard of at sea level. However, on January 24, 2016, sleet was reported in Nago for the first time on record.\nPolitics.\nDue to its unique historical background, Okinawa has a significantly stronger progressive (left-wing) presence compared to most other Japanese prefectures; this makes it one of the most politically polarized regions in the country. The Okinawa Social Mass Party, a local progressive political party, has played an important role in postwar Okinawan politics.\nIn 2014, various progressive parties such as the Social Democratic Party, Japanese Communist Party, Democratic Party, and the Okinawa Social Mass Party formed a cross-party electoral alliance with some conservative figures who also opposed the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to the city of Nago. This movement, known as the \"All-Okinawa\" campaign, achieved electoral victories in the 2014 Okinawa gubernatorial election, the 2016 Okinawa prefectural election, and others.\nSince Japan introduced the Single-member district system in 1996, Okinawa has been divided into four electoral districts for the House of Representatives. Among these, Okinawa's 2nd District, which hosts the highest concentration of U.S. military bases, has long been a stronghold for the progressive camp. Kantoku Teruya of the Social Democratic Party held this seat from 2003 onwards. The other three districts have seen fierce competition between conservatives and progressives, with frequent changes in party control.\nIn the 2014 Japanese general election, all four Okinawan districts elected candidates opposed to the relocation of the Futenma base to Nago. In the 1st District, Seiken Akamine of the Japanese Communist Party won a seat\u2014marking the JCP's first single-member district victory in Okinawa and its first nationwide in 18 years.\nIn the 2017 Japanese general election, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won the seat in the 4th District. In the 2021 Japanese general election, LDP candidates won in both the 3rd and 4th Districts and also gained proportional representation seats in the 1st and 2nd Districts. The Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party each retained one seat.\nIn the House of Councillors, Okinawa is represented by two seats in a single at-large district. Both are currently held by politicians who oppose the Futenma base relocation. However, in proportional representation voting, the LDP has consistently received the highest number of votes in Okinawa.\nOkinawa has also experienced multiple changes in political leadership throughout its gubernatorial history. In 2014, Takeshi Onaga, backed by progressive forces, was elected governor of Okinawa Prefecture. After Onaga's death in 2018, another progressive candidate, Denny Tamaki, was elected governor in the September 2018 election. Tamaki was re-elected in 2022. However, in recent years, rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait have led to growing unease among Okinawans toward the People's Republic of China, resulting in a loss of momentum for progressive forces.\nThe Okinawa Prefectural Assembly consists of 48 members, with the Liberal Democratic Party holding the largest number of seats at 22.\nIn terms of administrative jurisdiction, the disputed Senkaku Islands (referred to by China and Taiwan as the Diaoyu Islands) are administered by the city of Ishigaki in Okinawa Prefecture.\nAccording to a 2015 Okinawa Prefectural Government survey, only 9.3% of Okinawans felt an affinity toward the People's Republic of China, while 88.1% did not. Similarly, 90.8% of respondents reported a negative impression of China.\nOkinawa has long experienced social and cultural frictions with mainland Japan. In 2016, controversy erupted when police officers from Osaka Prefecture assigned to duty at U.S. military bases in Okinawa used the derogatory term \"dojin\" (meaning \"savage\" or \"native\") to insult local protestors. According to a 2017 NHK survey, only 19% of Okinawans felt that people from mainland Japan understood Okinawan sentiments, while 79.6% believed they did not. Additionally, 56.9% reported an increase in discriminatory or derogatory remarks against Okinawans over the past five years. On the other hand, instances of discrimination against Amerasians (children of mixed Okinawan and American parentage) have also been reported within Okinawa.\nOkinawa faces chronic fiscal challenges and relies heavily on subsidies from Japan's central government. Its fiscal capacity index is only 0.29\u2014significantly below the national average.\nU.S. military bases.\nAlthough some land used by U.S. military bases has been returned to Japan since Okinawa reverted to Japanese control, a significant portion remains under American jurisdiction. While Okinawa comprises only 0.6% of Japan's land area, it hosts approximately 74% of all U.S. military facilities in the country. The 33 American bases in Okinawa occupy around 10% of the prefecture's land\u2014up to 18% on Okinawa Island. Approximately 47,300 U.S. military personnel and their families reside in the prefecture.\nAmong the many military issues, the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma has been the most contentious. Due to its proximity to residential areas and repeated accidents, Futenma has been labeled one of the most dangerous military bases in the world. The prefectural government has long called for its relocation outside of Okinawa. In 2010, Japan and the U.S. agreed to relocate the base to Camp Schwab in Nago, sparking widespread protests.\nAnother key issue is crime involving U.S. military personnel. Between the 1972 reversion and 2015, 5,896 criminal cases involving U.S. forces were reported in Okinawa. In 2016, a high-profile rape and murder case involving a U.S. military contractor in Uruma triggered mass protests.\nOn the other hand, U.S. bases are Okinawa's second-largest source of employment.\nAccording to a 2017 NHK survey, 25.7% of Okinawans wanted the complete removal of U.S. military bases, while 50.6% preferred reducing their presence to levels comparable to mainland Japan. Only 26.5% supported relocating Futenma to Nago, while 62.6% were opposed. According to a 2015 prefectural survey, 42.2% of Okinawans reported no affinity toward the U.S., while 55.4% did.\nOn February 24, 2019, a prefectural referendum was held on land reclamation in Henoko for the new U.S. base. With a turnout of 52.48%, 71.74% opposed the project, 18.99% supported it, and 8.70% expressed no clear opinion.\nIndependence movement.\nAfter Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879 during the so-called Ryukyu Disposition, the last king, Sh\u014d Tai, was relocated to Tokyo. In the following years, Ryukyuan figures who opposed the new arrangements petitioned the Qing dynasty for redress, organizing in treaty-port communities such as Fuzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin. Contemporary sources referred to some \u00e9migr\u00e9s as \"dasshinnin\" (\u8131\u6e05\u4eba), who advocated Qing intervention to restore Ryukyuan autonomy or statehood. Diplomatic mediation was even sought from former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant in 1879\u20131880, but negotiations ultimately failed to produce a settlement; the issue receded after the First Sino-Japanese War.\nFollowing World War II, the Ryukyu Islands were placed under U.S. administration (1945\u20131972). During this period, proposals ranging from restoration of Ryukyuan statehood to enhanced local self-government were debated among Okinawan actors and in Japanese civil society. Under the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement, administrative rights returned to Japan in 1972 while U.S. bases remained under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan.\nIn contemporary politics, independence advocacy persists alongside broader autonomy movements and base-related activism. Polling generally shows limited support for full independence but greater backing for stronger local autonomy; for example, a 2022 \"Okinawa Times\" survey reported 3% support for independence, 48% for a \"strongly empowered\" local government, and 42% for maintaining the status quo. Public debate has increasingly extended to digital platforms; Japanese media and academic outlets have reported instances of inauthentic social-media activity linked to foreign information operations concerning Okinawa and independence narratives.\nMunicipalities.\nCities.\nEleven cities are located within the Okinawa Prefecture:\nTowns and villages.\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\nDemographics.\nEthnic groups.\nThe indigenous Ryukyuans make up the majority of Okinawa Prefecture's population and are also the main ethnic group of the Amami Islands to the north. Large Okinawan diaspora communities persist in places such as South America and Hawaii. With the introduction of American military bases, there are an increasing number of half-American children in Okinawa, including prefecture governor Denny Tamaki. The prefecture also has a sizable minority of Yamato people from mainland Japan; exact population numbers are difficult to establish, as the Japanese government does not officially recognize Ryukyuans as a distinct ethnic group from Yamatos.\nThe overall ethnic identity of Okinawa residents is rather split. According to a telephone poll conducted by Lim John Chuan-tiong (\u6797\u6cc9\u5fe0), an associate professor with the University of the Ryukyus, 40.6% of respondents identified as \" (Okinawan)\", 21.3% identified as \" (Japanese)\" and 36.5% identified as both.\nPopulation.\nOkinawa prefecture age pyramid as of 2003[ [update]]\nOkinawa Prefecture age pyramid, divided by sex, as of 2003[ [update]]\nPer Japanese census data, Okinawa prefecture has had continuous positive population growth since 1960.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLanguage.\nThere remain six Ryukyuan languages which, although related, are incomprehensible to speakers of Japanese. One of the Ryukyuan languages is spoken in Kagoshima Prefecture, rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as the younger generation of Okinawans uses Standard Japanese. Mainland Japanese and some Okinawans generally perceive the Ryukyuan languages as \"dialects\". Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, \"de facto\" everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese (\"Okinawan Japanese\"), which is often mistaken by non-Okinawans as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music and folk dance. There is a radio-news program in the language as well.\nCulture.\nOkinawan culture retains strong influences from its historical trading partners. Among these, Kyushu has maintained the closest economic and cultural ties with Okinawa from ancient times to the present, and the two regions share many cultural traits. Elements of Okinawan culture can be found throughout Kyushu, and vice versa. For instance, Okinawan musical scales appear in Kyushu's folk songs, and there are notable similarities in cuisine and language. Kyushu is also home to a traditional instrument called the \"gottan(\u30b4\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3)\", which closely resembles the Okinawan \"sanshin\"(\u4e09\u7dda).\nFurthermore, the customs of the Okinawan islands show strong influences from China, Thailand, and Austronesian-speaking regions.\nOne of the most famous cultural traditions of Okinawa is undoubtedly karate. Karate is a martial art that originated when Chinese kung fu was introduced to the Ryukyu Kingdom and then developed independently within the islands before being brought to mainland Japan. Today, karate is practiced around the world in various styles, including Shotokan, Goju-ryu, Shito-ryu, and Uechi-ryu. \nA cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of \"moais\". A is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may have been a contributing factor to the longevity of its people. However, in recent decades Okinawans' life expectancy has fallen significantly (also bringing into question the general validity of the 'Blue Zones' denominaton), which often has been blamed on cultural influence from the rest of Japan, as well as foreign influences on Okinawans' lifestyle.\nTwo Okinawan writers have received the Akutagawa Prize: Eiki Matayoshi in 1995 for and Shun Medoruma in 1997 for \"A Drop of Water\" (\"Suiteki\"). The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by Tatsuhiro Oshiro for \"Cocktail Party\" () and in 1971 by Mineo Higashi for \"Okinawan Boy\" ().\nA traditional craft, the fabric named bingata, is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.\nMusic.\nThe music of the prefecture contains native and imported influences in both \"koten\" (classical) and \"min'y\u014d\" (folk) styles. Okinawan instruments include the sanshin\u2014a three-stringed banjo-like instrument, closely related to the Chinese sanxian, and ancestor of the Japanese shamisen. Its body is often bound with snakeskin (from pythons, imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa's venomous habu, which are too small for this purpose). Okinawan musical cultures integrate dance with music, such as in eisa, a traditional drumming dance.\nReligion.\nOkinawan people have inherited a traditional religious belief system known as Ryukyuan Shinto, which is similar to but distinct from modern Japanese Shinto. This indigenous belief system is animistic in nature, characterized by ancestor worship and a deep respect for the relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods or spirits of the natural world.\nShamanic practitioners, known as Yuta, continue to play an active role in Okinawan society. They perform ritual prayers, divination, spiritual consultations, and even communicate with the spirits of the deceased. For many people, \"yuta\" serve as important spiritual guides who offer advice and solutions to both supernatural and everyday life problems.\nThroughout Okinawa, there are sacred sites known as \"utaki\", where rituals and ceremonies are performed. Ryukyuan beliefs preserve many elements of ancient Japanese spirituality\u2014such as those from the J\u014dmon and Yayoi periods\u2014which have largely disappeared on the Japanese mainland. As such, they are considered important resources in comparative mythology and religious studies.\nCuisine and diet.\nThe Okinawan diet consists of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. Okinawans are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, also known as Okinawan sweet potatoes. Okinawans used to be known for their longevity compared to the rest of Japan and the world in general. This particular island is a so-called Blue Zone, an area where people are purported to live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Possible explanations for this were diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island.\nA traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa's trading history is awamori\u2014an Okinawan distilled spirit made from \"indica\" rice imported from Thailand.\nArchitecture.\nDespite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as \"gusuku\"; the most significant are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List (Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu). In addition, twenty-three Ryukyuan architectural complexes and forty historic sites have been designated for protection by the national government. Shuri Castle in Naha is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhereas most homes in Japan are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular typhoons. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan. The Nakamura House (\u4e2d\u6751\u5bb6\u4f4f\u5b85 (\u6c96\u7e04\u770c)) is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki. Many roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a shisa, which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.\nEducation.\nThe public schools in Okinawa are overseen by the Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education. The agency directly operates several public high schools including Okinawa Shogaku High School. The U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools operates 13 schools total in Okinawa. Seven of these schools are located on Kadena Air Base.\nOkinawa has many types of private schools. Some of them are cram schools, also known as juku. Others, such as Nova, solely teach language. There are 10 colleges / universities in Okinawa, including the University of the Ryukyus, the only national university in the prefecture, and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, a new international research institute. Okinawa's American military bases also host the Asian Division of the University of Maryland University College.\nSports.\nMartial arts.\nMartial arts, such as tegumi and Okinawan kobud\u014d originated among the indigenous people of Okinawa Island. Due to its central location, Okinawa was influenced by various cultures including Japan, China and Southeast Asia in its martial arts culture.\nKarate.\nKarate originated in the Ryukyu Kingdom, under Chinese influence. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b, G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b and Uechi-ry\u016b. Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include Matsubayashi-ry\u016b, Wad\u014d-ry\u016b, Isshin-ry\u016b, Sh\u014drinkan, Shotokan, Shit\u014d-ry\u016b, Sh\u014drinjiry\u016b Kenk\u014dkan, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai, and Sh\u014drinji-ry\u016b.\nFollowing Okinawa's occupation, karate spread to the United States and the rest of the world. It is now popular across the world, and has since been included in the Olympic Games.\nAssociation football.\nFC Ryukyu is a professional football team based on Okinawa. Since 2014 they have competed in the second or third tier in the national league system.\nBasketball.\nThe Ryukyu Golden Kings are a professional basketball team that compete in the B.League, the top-tier professional basketball league of Japan. They are successful, having won the national title five times (most recently in 2023).\nThe Okinawa Arena has hosted the Japanese men's basketball team for various 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers. It was also one of five venues to host the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, the other four were in the Philippines and Indonesia.\nHarii.\nHarii (\u30cf\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc) is a traditional rowing sport practiced mainly in Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan.\nIt is typically held during events such as the Kaijin-sai (\u6d77\u795e\u796d) around the 4th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar (\u30e6\u30c3\u30ab\u30cc\u30d2\u30fc), or near the lunar Obon season.\nThe sport features a boat race in which dozens of men board a \"harii boat\" and row competitively; the team that reaches the finish line first is declared the winner.\nVarious \"harii\" races are held throughout Okinawa, with the most prominent being the Naha Harii in the city of Naha.\nBaseball.\nIn 2019, BASE Okinawa Baseball Club attempted forming the first-ever professional baseball team on Okinawa, the Ryukyu Blue Oceans. The team was expected to be fully organized by January 2020 with a view to joining the Nippon Professional Baseball league.\nHowever, complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic compounded with allegations of financial mismanagement \u2013 including reports of unpaid wages to players \u2013 resulted in the project being put on hold in November 2022. An exodus of players and staff followed, resulting in management company BASE officially filing for bankruptcy on April 6, 2023.\nDespite the lack of a local team, various professional baseball teams hold winter training camps in Okinawa as it is the warmest prefecture of Japan, with no snow and higher average temperatures than other prefectures. In 2025, ten teams held such camps across the prefecture, including two teams from the KBO League.\nGolf.\nThere are numerous golf courses in the prefecture, and there was formerly a professional tournament called the Okinawa Open.\nTransportation.\nPorts.\nThe major ports of Okinawa include:\nEconomy.\nThe island economy is primarily driven by tourism and the U.S. military presence. Other significant contributors to the economy include public utilities and public works, as well as, to a lesser extent, limestone mining, cement production, agriculture, telecommunications (Okinawa Cellular Telephone), and alcoholic beverage production (Orion Breweries).\nThe 34 U.S. military installations on Okinawa are financially supported by the U.S. and Japan. The bases provide jobs for Okinawans, both directly and indirectly; in 2011, the U.S. military employed over 9,800 Japanese workers in Okinawa. As of 2012[ [update]] the bases accounted for up to 5% of the economy. However, Koji Taira argued in 1997 that because the U.S. bases occupy around 20% of Okinawa's land, they impose a deadweight loss of 15% on the Okinawan economy. The Tokyo government also pays the prefectural government around \u00a510 billion per year in compensation for the American presence, including, for instance, rent paid by the Japanese government to the Okinawans on whose land American bases are situated. A 2005 report by the U.S. Forces Japan Okinawa Area Field Office estimated that in 2003 the combined U.S. and Japanese base-related spending contributed $1.9 billion to the local economy. On January 13, 2015, in response to the citizens electing governor Takeshi Onaga, the national government announced that Okinawa's funding will be cut, due to the governor's stance on removing the US military bases from Okinawa, which the national government does not want happening.\nThe Okinawa Convention and Visitors Bureau is exploring the possibility of using facilities on the military bases for large-scale meetings, conferencing, exhibitions events.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22478", "revid": "6399654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22478", "title": "Olive oil", "text": "Liquid fat made from olives\nOlive oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing whole olives (the fruit of \"Olea europaea\", a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin) and extracting the oil.\nIt is commonly used in cooking for frying foods, as a condiment, or as a salad dressing. It can also be found in some cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, and fuels for traditional oil lamps. It also has additional uses in some religions. The olive is one of three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, with wheat and grapes. Olive trees have been cultivated around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC.\nIn 2022, Spain was the world's largest producer, manufacturing 24% of the world's total. Other large producers were Italy, Greece, and Turkey, collectively accounting for 59% of the global market.\nThe composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid (up to 21%) and palmitic acid (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity, and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics.\nHistory.\nOlive oil has long been a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine, including ancient Greek and Roman cuisine. Wild olives, which originated in Asia Minor, were collected by Neolithic people as early as the 8th millennium BC. Besides food, olive oil has been used for religious rituals, medicines, as a fuel in oil lamps, soap-making, and skincare application. The Spartans and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the gymnasia. From its beginnings early in the 7th century BC, the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of the Hellenic city-states, together with athletes training in the nude, and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense. Olive oil was also popular as a form of birth control; Aristotle in his \"History of Animals\" recommends applying a mixture of olive oil combined with either oil of cedar, ointment of lead, or ointment of frankincense to the cervix to prevent pregnancy.\nEarly cultivation.\nThe exact date and location of olive tree domestication are unclear. The modern olive tree may have originated in ancient Persia and Mesopotamia and spread to the Levant and later to North Africa, though some scholars argue for an Egyptian origin.\nThe oldest traces of olive oil in Italy date back to the 3rd millennium BC. The olive tree reached Greece, Carthage and Libya sometime in the 28th century BC, having been spread westward by the Phoenicians. Until around 1500 BC, eastern coastal areas of the Mediterranean were most heavily cultivated. Evidence also suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2500 BC. The earliest surviving olive oil amphorae date to 3500 BC (Early Minoan times), though the production of olive oil is assumed to have started before 4000 BC. Olive trees were certainly cultivated by the Late Minoan period (1500 BC) in Crete, and perhaps as early as the Early Minoan. The cultivation of olive trees in Crete became particularly intense in the post-palatial period and played an important role in the island's economy, as it did across the Mediterranean. Later, as Greek colonies were established in other parts of the Mediterranean, olive farming was introduced to places like Spain and continued to spread throughout the Roman Empire.\nOlive trees were introduced to the Americas in the 16th century, when cultivation began in areas with a climate similar to the Mediterranean, such as Chile, Argentina, and California.\nRecent genetic studies suggest that species used by modern cultivars descend from multiple wild populations, but detailed history of domestication is unknown.\nTrade and production.\nArchaeological evidence in Galilee shows that by 6000 BC olives were being turned into olive oil and in 4500 BC at a now-submerged prehistoric settlement south of Haifa.\nOlive trees and oil production in the Eastern Mediterranean can be traced to archives of the ancient city-state Ebla (2600\u20132240 BC), which were located on the outskirts of Aleppo. Here, some dozen documents dated 2400 BC describe the lands of the king and the queen. These belonged to a library of clay tablets perfectly preserved by having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace. A later source is the frequent mentions of oil in the Tanakh.\nDynastic Egyptians before 2000\u00a0BC imported olive oil from Crete, Syria, and Canaan, and oil was an important item of commerce and wealth. Remains of olive oil have been found in jugs over 4,000 years old in a tomb on the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea. Sinuhe, the Egyptian exile who lived in northern Canaan c.1960\u00a0BC, wrote of abundant olive trees. The Minoans used olive oil in religious ceremonies. The oil became a principal product of the Minoan civilization, where it is thought to have represented wealth.\nOlive oil was also a major export of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1450\u20131150 BC). Scholars believe the oil was made by a process where olives were placed in woven mats and squeezed. The oil was collected in vats. This process was known from the Bronze Age, was used by the Egyptians, and continued to be used through the Hellenistic period. In the Iron Age, settlements in and around the Judaean Lowlands, including Ekron, Timnah, and Gezer, emerged as key hubs for olive oil production and commerce. Evidence from the Samaria ostraca, discovered in the capital of the Kingdom of Israel, includes a reference to \"washed oil,\" a term believed to refer to virgin olive oil.\nThe importance of olive oil as a commercial commodity increased after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Greece, and Asia Minor, which led to more trade along the Mediterranean. Olive trees were planted throughout the entire Mediterranean basin during the evolution of the Roman Republic and Empire. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, Italy had \"excellent olive oil at reasonable prices\" by the 1st century AD\u2014\"the best in the Mediterranean\". As olive production expanded in the 5th century AD the Romans began to employ more sophisticated production techniques such as the olive press and \"trapetum\" (pictured left). Many ancient presses still exist in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and some dating to the Roman period are still used today. Productivity was greatly improved by Joseph Graham's development of the hydraulic pressing system in 1795.\nSymbolism and mythology.\nThe olive tree has historically been a symbol of peace between nations. It has played a religious and social role in Greek mythology, especially concerning the city of Athens, named after the goddess Athena because her gift of an olive tree was held to be more precious than rival Poseidon's gift of a salt spring.\nVarieties.\nThere are many olive cultivars, each with a particular flavor, texture, and shelf life that make them more or less suitable for different applications, such as direct human consumption on bread or in salads, indirect consumption in domestic cooking or catering, or industrial uses such as animal feed or engineering applications. During the stages of maturity, olive fruit changes color from green to violet, and then black. Olive oil taste characteristics depend on the stage of ripeness at which olive fruits are collected.\nUses.\nCulinary use.\nOlive oil is an important cooking oil in countries surrounding the Mediterranean, and it forms one of the three staple food plants of Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat (as in pasta, bread, and couscous), and the grape, used as a dessert fruit and for wine.\nExtra virgin olive oil is mostly used raw as a condiment and as an ingredient in salad dressings. If uncompromised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It can also be used for saut\u00e9ing.\nWhen extra virgin olive oil is heated above , depending on its free fatty acid content, the unrefined particles within the oil are burned. This leads to a deteriorated taste. Refined olive oils are suited for deep frying because of the higher smoke point and milder flavour. Extra virgin oils have a smoke point around , with higher-quality oils having a higher smoke point, whereas refined light olive oil has a smoke point up to . That they can be used for deep frying is contrary to the common misconception that there are no olive oils with a smoke point as high as many other vegetable oils. In the misconception, heating at these high temperatures is theorised to impact taste or nutrition.\nReligious use.\nChristianity.\nThe Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil for the oil of catechumens (used to bless and strengthen those preparing for baptism) and oil of the sick (used to confer the Sacrament of anointing of the sick or extreme unction). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as balsam is consecrated by bishops as sacred chrism, which is used to confer the sacrament of confirmation (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit), in the rites of baptism and the ordination of priests and bishops, in the consecration of altars and churches, and, traditionally, in the anointing of monarchs at their coronation.\nEastern Orthodox Christians still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners, and cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass filled with olive oil, floating on a half-inch of water. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a cotton ball in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses virgin olive oil that the priesthood has blessed for anointing the sick.\nJudaism.\nIn Jewish observance, olive oil was the only fuel allowed to be used in the seven-branched menorah in the Mishkan service during the Exodus of the Tribes of Israel from Egypt, and later in the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. In modern times, although candles can be used to light the menorah at Hanukkah, oil containers are preferred to imitate the original menorah.\nIn Judaism of Ancient Israel, olive oil was also used to prepare the holy anointing oil used for priests, kings, prophets, and others.\nOther.\nOlive oil is also a natural and safe lubricant, and can be used to lubricate kitchen machinery (grinders, blenders, cookware, etc.). It can also be used for illumination (oil lamps) or as the base for soaps and detergents. Some cosmetics also use olive oil as their base, and it can be used as a substitute for machine oil. Olive oil has also been used as both solvent and ligand in the synthesis of cadmium selenide quantum dots.\nThe Ranieri Filo della Torre is an international literary prize for writings about extra virgin olive oil. It yearly honors poetry, fiction, and non-fiction about extra virgin olive oil.\nExtraction.\nOlive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means. Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil with fermentation defects, so for good olive oil, care is taken to ensure the olives are perfectly ripe. The process is generally as follows:\nAncient Levant.\nIn the ancient Levant, three methods were used to produce different grades of olive oil. The finest oil was produced from fully developed and ripe olives harvested solely from the apex of the tree, and lightly pressed, \"for what flows from light pressure is very sweet and very thin\". The remaining olives are pressed with a heavier weight, and vary in ripeness. Inferior oil is produced from unripe olives that are stored for extended periods until they grow soft or begin to shrivel to become more fit for grinding. Others are left for extended periods in pits in the ground to induce sweating and decay before they are ground. According to the \"Geoponica\", salt and a little nitre are added when oil is stored.\nIn countries of the levant, a sharp-tasting green oil was sometimes extracted from unripe olives, known in medieval times as \"anpeqinon\" (; ), being a corruption of the Latin words and used in cuisine and in medicine. Today, this oil is called \"virgin oil\" in English.\nPomace handling.\nThe remaining semi-solid waste, called pomace, retains a small quantity (about 5\u201310%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents. This is done in specialized chemical plants, not in the oil mills. The resulting oil is named pomace oil.\nHandling of olive waste is an environmental challenge because the wastewater, which amounts to millions of tons (billions of liters) annually in the European Union, has low biodegradability, is toxic to plants, and cannot be processed through conventional water treatment systems. Traditionally, olive pomace would be used as compost or developed as a possible biofuel, although these uses introduce concern due to chemicals present in the pomace. A process called \"valorization\" of olive pomace is under research and development, consisting of additional processing to obtain value-added byproducts, such as animal feed, food additives for human products, and phenolic and fatty acid extracts for potential human use.\nGlobal market.\nProduction.\nIn 2022, world production of olive oil was 2.7 million tonnes, led by Spain with 24% of the total (table). Other major producers were Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Tunisia (table). \nVillacarrillo, Ja\u00e9n, Andaluc\u00eda, Spain, is a center of olive oil production. Spain's olive oil production derives 75% from the region of Andaluc\u00eda, particularly within Ja\u00e9n province which produces 70% of the olive oil in Spain. The world's largest olive oil mill (\"almazara\", in Spanish), capable of processing 2,500 tonnes of olives per day, is in the town of Villacarrillo, Ja\u00e9n. \nItalian major producers are the regions of Calabria and, above all, Apulia. Many PDO and PGI extra-virgin olive oils are produced in these regions. Extra-virgin olive oil is also produced in Tuscany, in cities including Lucca, Florence, and Siena, which are also included in the association of Citt\u00e0 dell'Olio. Italy imports about 65% of Spanish olive oil exports.\nGlobal consumption.\nGreece has the highest per capita consumption of olive oil worldwide, around 24\u00a0liters per year. Consumption in Spain is 15\u00a0liters; Italy 13\u00a0liters; and Syria, around 3\u00a0liters. Canada consumes 1.5\u00a0liters and the US 1\u00a0liter.\nRegulation.\nThe International Olive Council (IOC) is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce olives or products derived from olives, such as olive oil. The IOC officially governs 95% of international production and influences the rest. The EU regulates the use of different protected designation of origin labels for olive oils.\nThe United States is not a member of the IOC and is not subject to its authority, but on October 25, 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the IOC, with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the U.S. U.S. Customs regulations on \"country of origin\" state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label in letters of comparable size, so as not to mislead the consumer. Yet most major U.S. brands continue to put \"imported from Italy\" on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print. \"In fact, olive oil labeled 'Italian' often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece.\" This makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin.\nCommercial grades.\nAll production begins by crushing or pressing the olive fruit to transform it into olive paste. This paste is malaxed (slowly churned or mixed) to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). The residue that remains after pressing or centrifugation can also produce a small amount of oil, called pomace.\nOne parameter used to characterise an oil is its acidity. In this context, \"acidity\" is not chemical acidity in the sense of pH, but the percent (measured by weight) of free oleic acid. Olive oil acidity is a measure of the hydrolysis of the oil's triglycerides: as the oil degrades and becomes oxidized, more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides, increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity. Rancidity not only impacts the taste and color but also its nutritional value.\nAnother measure of the oil's chemical degradation is the peroxide value, which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized by free radicals, leading to \"oxidative\" rancidity. Phenolic acids present in olive oil also add acidic sensory properties to aroma and flavor.\nThe grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as:\nInternational Olive Council.\nIn countries that adhere to the standards of the International Olive Council, as well as in Australia, and under the voluntary United States Department of Agriculture labeling standards in the United States:\nExtra virgin olive oil is the highest grade of virgin olive oil derived by cold mechanical extraction without use of solvents or refining methods. It contains no more than 0.8% free acidity, and is judged to have a superior taste, having some fruitiness and no defined sensory defects. Extra virgin olive oil accounts for less than 10% of oil in many producing countries; the percentage is far higher in some Mediterranean countries.\nThe International Olive Council requires the median of the fruity attribute to be higher than zero for a given olive oil in order to meet the criteria of extra virgin olive oil classification.\nVirgin olive oil is a lesser grade of virgin oil, with free acidity of up to 2.0%, and is judged to have a good taste, but may include some sensory defects.\nRefined olive oil is virgin oil refined using charcoal and other chemical and physical filters, methods which do not alter the glyceridic structure. It has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams (0.3%), and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard. It is obtained by refining virgin oils to eliminate high acidity or organoleptic defects. Oils labeled as \"pure olive oil\" or \"olive oil\" are primarily refined olive oil, with a small addition of virgin oil for taste.\nOlive pomace oil is refined pomace olive oil, often blended with some virgin oil. It is fit for consumption, but may not be described simply as \"olive oil\". It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil, making it less desirable to users concerned with flavor; however, it has the same fat composition as regular olive oil, giving it the same health benefits. It also has a high smoke point, and consequently is widely used in restaurants and home cooking in some countries.\nUnited States.\nThe United States is not a member of the IOC and does not implement its grades, but on October 25, 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) established Standards for Grades of Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil which closely parallel the IOC standards:\nThese grades are voluntary. Certification is available, for a fee, from the USDA.\nIn 2014, California adopted a set of olive oil standards for olive oil made from California-grown olives. The California Department of Food and Agriculture Grade and Labeling Standards for Olive Oil, Refined-Olive Oil, and Olive-Pomace Oil are mandatory for producers of more than 5,000 gallons of California olive oil. This joins other official state, federal, and international olive oil standards.\nSeveral olive producer associations, such as the North American Olive Oil Association and the California Olive Oil Council, also offer grading and certification within the United States. Oleologist Nicholas Coleman suggests that the California Olive Oil Council certification is the most stringent of the voluntary grading schemes in the United States.\nCountry of origin can be established by one or two-letter country codes printed on the bottle or label. Country codes include I=Italy, GR=Greece, E=Spain, TU=Tunisia, MA=Morocco, CL=Chile, AG=Argentina, AU=Australia.\nAdulteration.\nThere have been allegations, particularly in Italy and Spain, that regulation can be sometimes lax and corrupt. Major shippers are claimed to routinely adulterate olive oil so that only about 40% of olive oil sold as \"extra virgin\" in Italy actually meets the specification. In some cases, colza oil (extracted from rapeseed) with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil. This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil, under which every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced, as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used, for blended oils. In February 2008, however, EU officials took issue with the new law, stating that under EU rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory. Under EU rules, olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil.\nExtra-virgin olive oil has strict requirements and is checked for \"sensory defects\" that include: rancid, fusty, musty, winey (vinegary), and muddy sediment. These defects can occur for different reasons. The most common are:\nIn March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted Operation Golden Oil, arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a large-scale scheme to relabel oils from other Mediterranean nations as Italian. In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soya bean oil and selling it as extra virgin olive oil, both in Italy and abroad; 25,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported.\nOn March 15, 2011, the prosecutor's office in Florence, Italy, working in conjunction with the forestry department, indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli, one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS (which recently changed its name to Deoleo). The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that \"the case is based on an irregularity in the documents.\"\nIn February 2012, Spanish authorities investigated an international olive oil fraud in which palm, avocado, sunflower, and other cheaper oils were passed off as Italian olive oil. Police said the oils were blended in an industrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature. The oils were not toxic and posed no health risk, according to a statement by the Guardia Civil. Nineteen people were arrested following the year-long joint probe by the police and Spanish tax authorities, as part of Operation Lucerna.\nUsing tiny print to state the origin of blended oil is used as a legal loophole by manufacturers of adulterated and mixed olive oil.\nJournalist Tom Mueller has investigated crime and adulteration in the olive oil business, publishing the article \"Slippery Business\" in \"New Yorker\" magazine, followed by the 2011 book \"Extra Virginity\". On 3 January 2016 Bill Whitaker presented a program on CBS News including interviews with Mueller and with Italian authorities. It was reported that in the previous month, 5,000 tons of adulterated olive oil had been sold in Italy, and that organised crime was heavily involved\u2014the term \"Agrimafia\" was used. The point was made by Mueller that the profit margin on adulterated olive oil was three times that on the illegal narcotic drug cocaine. He said that over 50% of olive oil sold in Italy was adulterated, as was 75\u201380% of that sold in the US. Whitaker reported that three samples of \"extra virgin olive oil\" had been bought in a US supermarket and tested; two of the three samples did not meet the required standard, and one of them\u2014from a top-selling US brand\u2014was exceptionally poor.\nIn early February 2017, the Carabinieri police arrested 33 suspects in the Calabrian mafia's Piromalli 'ndrina ('Ndrangheta), which was allegedly exporting fake extra virgin olive oil to the U.S.; the product was actually inexpensive olive pomace oil fraudulently labeled. Less than a year earlier, the American television program \"60 Minutes\" had warned that \"the olive oil business has been corrupted by the Mafia\" and that \"Agromafia\" was a 16 billion dollar per year enterprise. A Carabinieri investigator interviewed on the program said that \"olive oil fraud has gone on for the better part of four millennia\" but today, it's particularly \"easy for the bad guys to either introduce adulterated olive oils or mix in lower quality olive oils with extra-virgin olive oil\". Weeks later, a report by \"Forbes\" magazine stated that \"it's reliably reported that 80% of the Italian olive oil on the [US] market is fraudulent\" and that \"a massive olive oil scandal is being uncovered in Southern Italy (Puglia, Umbria and Campania)\".\nQuality control and fraud.\nIn July 2024, the European Union reported a significant increase in olive oil fraud and mislabeling cases. The European Commission's annual report on food fraud revealed that olive oil remained one of the most frequently adulterated food products, with incidents reaching a record high.\nMislabeling and adulteration.\nThe most common forms of olive oil fraud include:\nThese fraudulent practices not only deceive consumers but also undermine the reputation of legitimate producers, particularly those from traditional olive-growing regions in the Mediterranean.\nEU response.\nTo combat the rising fraud cases, the European Union has implemented several measures:\nThe EU has also launched a public awareness campaign to educate consumers about olive oil quality and how to identify authentic products.\nImpact on the industry.\nThe surge in fraud cases has led to:\nIndustry experts emphasize the importance of supporting reputable producers and urge consumers to be more vigilant when purchasing olive oil, particularly when prices seem unusually low for claimed quality.\nConstituents.\nOlive oil is composed mainly of the mixed triglyceride esters of oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid and of other fatty acids, along with traces of squalene (up to 0.7%) and sterols (about 0.2% phytosterol and tocosterols). The composition varies by cultivar, region, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process.\nPhenolic composition.\nOlive oil contains traces of phenolics (about 0.5%), such as esters of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal and oleuropein, which give extra virgin olive oil its bitter, pungent taste, and are also implicated in its aroma. Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds, among which are elenolic acid, a marker for maturation of olives, and alpha-tocopherol, one of the eight members of the Vitamin E family. Oleuropein, together with other closely related compounds such as 10-hydroxyoleuropein, ligstroside and 10-hydroxyligstroside, are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid.\nOther phenolic constituents include flavonoids, lignans and pinoresinol.\nNutrition.\nOlive oil is 100% fat, containing no carbohydrates, dietary fiber, protein or water (table).\nIn a reference amount of , olive oil supplies 884 kcals of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin E (96% DV) and vitamin K (57% DV) (table). \nOne tablespoon (13.5\u00a0g) of olive oil supplies of food energy and contains 13.5 g of fat, including 9.9 g of monounsaturated fat (mainly as oleic acid), 1.4 g of polyunsaturated fat (mainly as linoleic acid), and 1.9 g of saturated fat (mainly as palmitic acid).\nPotential health effects.\nIn the United States, the FDA allows producers of olive oil to place the following qualified health claim on product labels:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about 2 tbsp. (23 g) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the monounsaturated fat in olive oil. To achieve this possible benefit, olive oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the overall number of calories consumed in a day.\nIn a review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2011, health claims on olive oil were approved for protection by its polyphenols against oxidation of blood lipids, and for maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol levels by replacing saturated fats in the diet with oleic acid. (See also: Commission Regulation (EU) 432/2012 of 16 May 2012). Despite its approval, the EFSA has noted that a definitive cause-and-effect relationship has not been adequately established for consumption of olive oil and maintaining normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides, normal blood HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and normal blood glucose concentrations.\nA 2014 meta-analysis concluded that increased consumption of olive oil was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke, while monounsaturated fatty acids of mixed animal and plant origin showed no significant effects. Another meta-analysis in 2018 found high-polyphenol olive oil intake was associated with improved measures of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, malondialdehyde, and oxidized LDL when compared to low-polyphenol olive oils, although it recommended longer studies, and more investigation of non-Mediterranean populations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originating in Asia Minor, it is abundant throughout the Mediterranean Basin, with wild subspecies in Africa and western Asia; modern cultivars are traced primarily to the Near East, Aegean Sea, and Strait of Gibraltar. The olive is the type species for its genus, \"Olea\", and lends its name to the Oleaceae plant family, which includes lilac, jasmine, forsythia, and ash. The olive fruit is classed botanically as a drupe, similar in structure and function to the cherry or peach. The term oil\u2014now used to describe any viscous water-insoluble liquid\u2014was originally synonymous with olive oil, the liquid fat derived from olives.\nThe olive has deep historical, economic, and cultural significance in the Mediterranean. It is among the oldest fruit trees domesticated by humans, being first cultivated in the Eastern Mediterranean between 6,000 and 4,000 BC, most likely in the Levant. The olive gradually disseminated throughout the Mediterranean via trade and human migration starting in the 16th century BC; it took root in Crete around 3500\u00a0BC and reached Iberia by about 1050 BC. Olive cultivation was vital to the growth and prosperity of various Mediterranean civilizations, from the Minoans and Myceneans of the Bronze Age to the Greeks and Romans of classical antiquity.\nThe olive has long been prized throughout the Mediterranean for its myriad uses and properties. Aside from its edible fruit, the oil extracted from the fruit has been used in food and for lamp fuel, personal grooming, cosmetics, soap making, lubrication, and medicine, while the wood of olive trees was sometimes used for construction. Owing to its utility, resilience, and longevity\u2014an olive tree can allegedly live for thousands of years\u2014the olive also held symbolic and spiritual importance in various cultures; its branches and leaves were used in religious rituals, funerary processions, and public ceremonies, from the ancient Olympic games to the coronation of Israelite kings. Ancient Greeks regarded the olive tree as sacred and a symbol of peace, prosperity, and wisdom\u2014associations that have persisted. The olive is a core ingredient in traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, particularly in the form of olive oil, and a defining feature of local landscapes, commerce, and folk traditions.\nThe olive is cultivated in all countries of the Mediterranean, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, and South Africa. Spain, Italy, and Greece lead the world in commercial olive production; other major producers are Turkey, Tunisia, Syria, Morocco, Algeria, and Portugal. There are thousands of cultivars of olive tree, and the fruit of each cultivar may be used primarily for oil, for eating, or both, although some varieties are grown as sterile ornamental shrubs, and are known as \"Olea europaea\" \"Montra\", \"dwarf olive\", or \"little olive\". Approximately 80% of all harvested olives are processed into oil, while about 20% are for consumption as fruit, generally referred to as \"table olives\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"olive\" derives from Latin ' 'olive fruit; olive tree', possibly through Etruscan () from the archaic Proto-Greek form *\u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03dd\u03b1 (*\"ela\u00edwa\") (Classic Greek ' 'olive fruit; olive tree'). The word \"oil\" originally meant 'olive oil', from ', (' 'olive oil'). The word for 'oil' in multiple other languages also ultimately derives from the name of this tree and its fruit. The oldest attested forms of the Greek words are Mycenaean , ', and , ' or , \"\", written in the Linear B syllabic script.\nDescription.\nThe olive tree, \"Olea europaea\", is an evergreen tree or shrub native to Mediterranean Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat and rarely exceeds in height. Pisciottana\u2014a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy\u2014often exceeds this, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring long and wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.\nSmall, white flowers are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from leaf axils. Each flower is made of four yellowish white petals fused at the bottom joined to a base of four\nfused green sepals. The flower buds grow slowly from 4 to 6 weeks before they reach a length of about 2\u00a0cm and bloom, they bloom quicker between 5\u20136 days in hot weather and 2 weeks in colder areas. The flowers also pollinate and fertilize faster in hotter climates.\nThe fruit is a small drupe, long when ripe, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage. \"O. europaea\" contains a pyrena commonly referred to in American English as a \"pit\", and in British English as a \"stone\".\nTaxonomy.\nThe six natural subspecies of \"Olea europaea\" are distributed over a wide range:\nThe subspecies \"europaea\" is divided into two varieties, the \"europaea\", which was formerly named \"Olea sativa\", with the seedlings called \"olivasters\", and \"silvestris\", which corresponds to the old wildly growing Mediterranean species \"O.\u00a0oleaster\", with the seedlings called \"oleasters\". The \"sylvestris\" is characterized by a smaller, shrubby tree that produces smaller fruits and leaves.\nThe subspecies \"O.\u00a0e. cerasiformis\" is tetraploid, and \"O.\u00a0e. maroccana\" is hexaploid. Wild-growing forms of the olive are sometimes treated as the species \"Olea oleaster\", or \"oleaster\". The trees referred to as \"white\" and \"black\" olives in Southeast Asia are not actually olives but species of \"Canarium\".\nCultivars.\nHundreds of cultivars of the olive tree are known. An olive's cultivar has a significant impact on its colour, size, shape, and growth characteristics, as well as the qualities of olive oil. Olive cultivars may be used primarily for oil, eating, or both. Olives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as \"table olives\".\nSince many olive cultivars are self-sterile or nearly so, they are generally planted in pairs with a single primary cultivar and a secondary cultivar selected for its ability to fertilize the primary one. In recent times, efforts have been directed at producing hybrid cultivars with qualities useful to farmers, such as resistance to disease, quick growth, and larger or more consistent crops.\nHistory.\nAs one of the oldest cultivated trees on Earth, the history of the olive is deeply intertwined with humans; its ecological success and expansion is largely the result of human activity rather than environmental conditions, with the tree's genetic and geographic trajectory directly reflecting the rise and fall of several civilizations. Owing to this deep relationship with humans, the olive has been disseminated well beyond its native range, spanning 28.6 million acres across 66 countries. There were an estimated 865\"\u00a0\"million olive trees in the world in 2005, of which the vast majority were found in Mediterranean countries; traditionally marginal areas accounted for no more than 25% of olive-planted area and 10% of oil production.\nMediterranean Basin.\nFossil evidence indicates that the olive tree had its origins 20\u201340 million years ago in the Oligocene, in what now corresponds to Italy and the eastern Mediterranean Basin. Around 100,000 years ago, olives were used by humans in Africa, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, for fuel and most probably for consumption. Wild olive trees, or oleasters, have been collected in the Eastern Mediterranean since approximately 19,000 BP; the genome of cultivated olives reflects their origin from oleaster populations in the region.\nThe olive plant was first cultivated in the Mediterranean between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago. Domestication likely began in the Levant, based on archeological findings in ancient tombs\u2014including written tablets, olive pits, and olive wood fragments\u2014as well as genetic analyses. Hittite texts dating to the second millennium BCE in present-day Turkey describe anointing a newborn child and mother with olive oil to protect against the dangers of childbirth. \nFor thousands of years, olives were grown primarily for lamp oil rather than for culinary purposes, as the natural fruit has an extremely bitter taste. It is very likely that the first mechanized agricultural methods and tools were those designed to produce olive oil; the earliest olive oil production dates back some 6,500 years ago in coastal Canaan (present-day Israel). As early as 3000BC, olives were grown commercially in Crete and may have been the main source of wealth for the Minoan civilization.\nThe exact ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. Fossil \"olea\" pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of \"olea\" were found in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini and dated to about 37,000\"\u00a0\"BP. Imprints of larvae of olive whitefly \"Aleurobus olivinus\" were found on the leaves. The same insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island date back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.\nExpansion and propagation.\nIn the 16th century BC, the Phoenicians\u2014a seafaring people native to the Levantine heartland where olives likely were first cultivated\u2014started disseminating the olive throughout the Mediterranean. Owing to their dominance as traders, merchants, and mariners, they succeeded in spreading the olive to the Greek isles, particularly Crete, later introducing it to the Greek mainland between the 14th and 12th centuries BC. Olive cultivation increased and gained great importance among the Greeks; Athenian statesman Solon (c.\u2009630\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009560 BC) issued decrees regulating olive planting and encouraging its cultivation, particularly for export. Greek literature and mythology reflected the privileged and even sacred position of the olive, while leading thinkers and figures like Hippocrates, Homer, and Theophrastus observed its various positive properties and benefits.\nThe earliest evidence of the olive tree in Egypt traces back to the Eighteenth Dynasty (1570\u20131345 BC), during the same period the Phoenicians began distributing it across the Mediterranean. However, scenes on the walls of the tomb of King Teti (ruled c.\"\u00a0\"2345\"\u00a0\"BC to c.\"\u00a0\"2333\"\u00a0\"BC) show olive fruits and trees, though it is unclear if these represent domestic cultivation. Pharoah Ramses III (reigned 1186\u20131155 BC) promoted cultivating olive trees and offered the olive oil extracted from Heliopolis to the Sun God Ra; papyrus manuscripts dated to his reign (c.\"\u00a0\"1550 BC), as well as temple engravings, depict the growing of olive trees and the use of olive oil in cooking, lamps, cosmetics, medicine and embalming. Pharoah Tutankhamun, who ruled from ca. 1333 to 1323\"\u00a0\"BC, wore a garland of olive branches originated from Dakhla Oasis, 360\u00a0km to the east. Egyptian mummies dating back to the 20-25th dynasties (c.\"\u00a0\"1185\"\u00a0\"BC to c.\"\u00a0\"656\"\u00a0\"BC) have also been found wearing olive wreaths.\nWhile there is no evidence of olive cultivation in Mesopotamia, olive wood appears as early as the mid third millennium BC; the site of Emar in present-day Syria has olive wood and olive pits dating to the Middle Bronze Age (2000\u20131600 BC). The Code of Hammurabi, a compilation of laws and edicts made by King Hammurabi of the Old Babylonian Empire (reigning from c.\"\u00a0\"1792 to c.\"\u00a0\"1750 BC), makes repeated references to olive oil as a key commodity. The Assyrian Empire (858\u2013627 BC) may have expanded into the southern Levant partly to secure control over its lucrative olive oil production.\nFrom the sixth century BC onwards, the olive continued spreading toward the central and western Mediterranean through colonization and commerce, reaching Sicily, Libya, and Tunisia. From there, it expanded into southern Italy among the various Etruscan, Sabine, and Italic peoples. The introduction of the olive tree to mainland Italy allegedly occurred during the reign of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (616\u2013578 BC), possibly from Tripoli (Libya) or Gabes (Tunisia). Cultivation moved as far upwards as Liguria near the border with France. When the Romans arrived in North Africa beginning in the second half of the first century BC, the native Berbers knew how to graft wild olives and had highly developed its cultivation throughout the region.\nThe olive's expansion and cultivation reached its greatest extent through Rome's gradual conquest and settlement across virtually the entire Mediterranean; the Romans continued propagating the olive for commercial and agricultural purposes, as well as to assimilate local populations. It was introduced in present-day Marseille around 600\"\u00a0\"BC and spread from there to the whole of Gaul (modern France). The olive tree made its appearance in Sardinia following Roman conquest in the third century BC, though it may not have reached nearby Corsica until after the fall of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD.\nAlthough olive growing was introduced to Spain by the Phoenicians some time in 1050\"\u00a0\"BC, it did not reach a larger scale until the arrival of Scipio (212 BC) during the Second Punic War against Carthage. After the Third Punic War (149\u2013146 BC), olives occupied a large stretch of the Baetica valley in southwest Spain and spread towards the central and Mediterranean coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula, including Portugal. Through the second century AD, this region would become the largest source of olives and olive oil within the empire. Olive became a core part of the Roman diet, and by extension a major economic pillar; the cultivation, harvesting, and trade in olives and their derived goods sustained many livelihoods and regions. The emperor Hadrian (117\u2013138 AD) passed laws prompting olive cultivation by exempting individuals who grew olive trees from rent payments on their land for ten years.\nThe degree to which the olive benefited from the Romans is demonstrated by the significant decline in olive planting and olive oil production that followed the collapse of the Roman Empire. Beginning in the early eighth century AD, Muslim Arabs and North Africans brought their own varieties of olives during their conquest of Iberia, reinvigorating and expanding olive growing throughout the peninsula. The spread and importance of olives during subsequent Islamic rule is reflected in the Arabic roots of the Spanish words for olive (\"aceituna\"), oil (\"aceite\"), and wild olive tree (\"acebuche\") and the Portuguese words for olive (\"azeitona\") and olive oil (\"azeite\").\nOutside the Mediterranean.\nThe olive is not native outside the Mediterranean Basin, although various wild subspecies are endemic throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, southern Arabia, and central and south Asia. Beyond its immediate native range, the cultivated olive historically spread across West Asia through southwest China, and into parts of southern Egypt, northeast Sudan, the Canary Islands, and possibly the mountains of the Sahara. Olive domestication is present on every inhabited continent due to human introduction.\nAmericas.\nSpanish colonists brought the olive to the New World in the 18th century, where its cultivation prospered in present-day Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. The first seedlings from Spain were planted in Lima by Antonio de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quickly spread along the valleys of South America's dry Pacific coast where the climate is similar to the Mediterranean.\nSpanish missionaries established the olive tree in California between 1769 and 1795 at Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1. Orchards were started at other missions, but by 1838, only two olive orchards were confirmed in California. Cultivation for oil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 1860s onward.\nOlive growing in the United States is primarily concentrated in warmer regions like California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Georgia, and Florida. California is by far the largest olive producer in the U.S., accounting for 95 percent of domestic olives; as of 2021, there are roughly 36,000 acres under olive cultivation in the U.S., of which about 35,000 acres are in California. However, the industry is also expanding into the southeastern U.S., with Florida and Georgia experiencing growth in olive farming.\nAsia.\nOlive trees were successfully introduced in Japan in 1908 on Shodo Island; located in the Seto Inland Sea, the island has a moderate climate characterized by stable year-round temperature and relatively low rainfall. It became the cradle of olive cultivation in Japan, accounting for over 95% of the country's total production, and earning the nickname \"Olive Island\". Olives play a central role in the local culture and economy, with the island's mascot and tourism merchandise reflecting olive themes. Olive cultivation has spread to other regions in Japan, namely neighboring Kagawa and Okayama and nearby Kyushu. The vast majority of Japanese growers are small-scale farmers.\nSince 2010, Pakistan has been pursuing large scale commercial olive production, which it identified as a strategic national priority to reduce dependence on foreign oils and expand economic opportunity. As part of the national Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Project launched in 2019, which aimed to plant 10 billion trees to mitigate climate change and environmental degradation, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government planted thousands of olives to symbolize peace and provide commercial opportunities in the war-torn region. By 2020, with the help of experts from Spain and Italy, Pakistan imported thousands of trees and identified 10 million acres for growing olives. The following year, the federal Ministry of Climate Change launched the Olive Trees Tsunami Project to plant nearly 10 million hectares of olive trees. In 2022, Pakistan announced its intention to join the International Olive Council as part of ongoing efforts to develop its domestic olive industry. As of January 2025, the country had 5.6 million cultivated olive trees, with 500,000 to 800,000 new trees planted annually, as well as 80 million wild olive trees. Punjab province plans to plant 50\"\u00a0\"million olive trees on about 9.8 million acres by 2026.\nCommercial olive oil production started in India in 2016, following the planting of olive saplings imported from Israel in Rajasthan's Thar Desert in 2008. Production was spearheaded by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited, a state government-funded agency that offered subsidies and incentives for growing olives, with support from Israeli experts. Olive farms continued expanding into 2020 but saw a precipitous decline in size and production volume by 2023, due to the difficult climate and declining government interest and support.\nGlobal expansion.\nAmid ongoing climate warming, several small-scale olive production farms have also been established at fairly high latitudes in Europe and North America since the early 21st century, including in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada.\nSymbolic and cultural significance.\nModern researchers and historians have identified the olive as one of the defining characteristics of both ancient and contemporary Mediterranean culture, geography, and cuisine. Georges Duhamel remarked that the \"Mediterranean ends where the olive tree no longer grows\".\nAncient Greece.\nOlives are thought to have been domesticated in the third millennium BC at the latest, at which point they, along with grain and grapes, became part of Colin Renfrew's Mediterranean triad of staple crops that fueled the emergence of more complex societies. Olives, and especially (perfumed) olive oil, became a major export product during the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. Dutch archaeologist Jorrit Kelder proposed that the Mycenaeans sent shipments of olive oil, probably alongside live olive branches, to the court of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten as a diplomatic gift. In Egypt, these imported olive branches may have acquired ritual meanings, as they are depicted as offerings on the wall of the Aten temple and were used in wreaths for the burial of Tutankhamun. It is likely that, as well as being used for culinary purposes, olive oil had various other purposes, including as a perfume.\nThe ancient Greeks smeared olive oil on their bodies and hair as a matter of grooming and good health. Olive oil was used to anoint kings and athletes in ancient Greece. It was burnt in the sacred lamps of temples and was the \"eternal flame\" of the original Olympic games, whose victors were crowned with its leaves. The olive appears frequently, and often prominently, in ancient Greek literature. Homer's \"Odyssey\" (c. eighth century BC), Odysseus crawls beneath two shoots of olive that grow from a single stock, and in the \"Iliad\", (XVII.53ff) there is a metaphoric description of a lone olive tree in the mountains by a spring; the Greeks observed that the olive rarely thrives at a distance from the sea, which in Greece invariably means up mountain slopes. Greek myth attributed to the primordial culture-hero Aristaeus the understanding of olive husbandry, along with cheese-making and beekeeping. Olive was one of the woods used to fashion the most primitive Greek cult figures, called \"xoana\", referring to their wooden material; they were reverently preserved for centuries.\nIn an archaic Athenian foundation myth, Athena won the patronage of Attica from Poseidon with the gift of the olive. According to the fourth-century BC father of botany, Theophrastus, olive trees ordinarily attained an age around 200 years, and he mentions that the very olive tree of Athena still grew on the Acropolis; it was still to be seen there in the second century AD, and when Pausanias was shown it c.\u2009170 AD, he reported \"Legend also says that when the Persians fired Athens the olive was burnt down, but on the very day it was burnt it grew again to the height of two cubits.\" Because olive suckers sprout readily from the stump, and some existing olive trees are purportedly many centuries old, it is possible that the olive tree of the Acropolis dated to the Bronze Age. The olive remained sacred to Athens and its patron deity Athena, appearing on its coinage. According to another myth, Elaea\u2014whose name translates to \"olive\"\u2014was an accomplished athlete killed by fellow athletes out of envy; owing to her impressive achievement, Athena and Gaia turn her into an olive tree as a reward.\nThe olive and its properties were subject to early scientific and empirical observation. Theophrastus, in \"On the Causes of Plants\", states that the cultivated olive must be vegetatively propagated; indeed, the pits give rise to thorny, wild-type olives, spread far and wide by birds. He also reports how the bearing olive can be grafted on the wild olive, for which the Greeks had a separate name, \"kotinos\". In his \"Enquiry into Plants\", Theophrastus states that the olive can be propagated from a piece of the trunk, the root, a twig, or a stake. Homer described olive oil as \"liquid gold\", while Hippocrates (c.\"\u00a0\"460 BC \u2013 c.\"\u00a0\"375 BC), widely regarded as the father of medicine, considered it \"the great healer\".\nAncient Egypt.\nAncient Egyptians believed that Isis, the consort of Osiris and the mother of university, taught mankind to extract oil from olives; olive oil has been found among valuable treasures buried in the tombs of important prehistoric Egyptians, and was used as an offering to the gods.\nAncient Rome.\nLike the Greeks, the Romans held olives in high regard for various purposes, both practical and symbolic. Roman mythology held that Hercules introduced the olive tree to Italy from North Africa, while the goddess of wisdom, Minerva, taught the art of cultivation and oil extraction. Numerous archaeological finds indicate the presence of the olive tree in Lazio, the region around Rome, as early as the 7th century BC; however, rudimentary olive production has also been traced back to earlier Etruscan and Sabine settlements in the area.\nThe olive tree was subject to many treatises and agronomic works by the Romans. Pliny the Elder, in his first century AD encyclopedia, \"Naturalis Historia,\" describes at least 22 different varieties and qualities of olive trees, detailing their respective techniques for cultivation and production. He also observes that an olive tree is one of only three plants\u2014along with a vine and fig tree\u2014growing in the middle of the Roman Forum, which served as the center of daily life in the city; the olive was purportedly planted to provide shade. (The garden was recreated in the 20th century). Pliny also remarked on the health properties of olive oil, describing it as an \"absolute necessity.\"\nRoman poet Horace mentions the olive in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: \"As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance.\" Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius describes of the use of charred olive wood in tying together walls and foundations in his \"\". Olive cultivation and production was also recognized for its commercial and economic importance; according to Cato the Younger, among the various tasks of the \"pater familias\" (the family patriarch and head of household) was that of keeping an account of the olive oil. The city of Rome designated a special area for negotiating and selling olive oil that was managed by \"negotiatores oleari\", who were analogous to stockbrokers.\nJudaism and Israel.\nOlives were one of the main elements in ancient Israelite cuisine. Olive oil was used not only culinarily, but also for lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointing religious and political officials. The word \"moshiach\"\u2014Hebrew for Messiah\u2014means \"anointed one\"; in Jewish eschatology, the Messiah is a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who is expected to be anointed with holy oil partially derived from olive oil. The olive tree is one of the first plants mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and one of the most significant; an olive branch (or leaf, depending on translation) was brought back to Noah by a dove to demonstrate that the flood was over (Genesis 8:11).\nThe olive's importance in Israel is expressed in the parable of Jotham in Judges 9:8\u20139: \"One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king.' But the olive tree answered, 'Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?'\" The olive tree is also analogized to a righteous man (Psalm 52:8; Hosea 14:6) whose \"children will be like vigorous young olive trees\" (Psalm 128:3).\nDeuteronomy characterizes the \"Promised Land\" of the Hebrews as containing olive groves (6:11) and subsequently lists olives as one of the seven species that are special products of the Land of Israel (8:8). According to the Halakha, the Jewish law mandatory for all Jews, the olive is one of the seven species that require the recitation of \"me'eyn shalosh,\" a blessing of gratitude, after they are consumed. Olive oil is also the most recommended and best possible oil for lighting Shabbat candles.\nOlive oil features prominently in the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which commemorates the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple during the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BC. According to the Talmud, the central text of Rabbinical Judaism, after Seleucid forces had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all the ritual olive oil for the Temple menorah had been profaned. They found only single container with just enough pure oil to keep the menorah lit for a single day; however, it burned for eight days\u2014the time needed for new oil to have been prepared\u2014a miracle that forms a major part of Hanukkah celebrations. Subsequently, the olive tree and its oil have come to represent the strength and persistence of the Jewish people. In common with other Mediterranean cultures, the Jewish people used it for many practical and ritualistic purposes, from fuel and medicine to cosmetics and even currency; as in Greek and Roman societies, athletes were cleansed by covering their skin with oil then scraping it to remove the dirt. Jews who settled in foreign lands often became olive merchants.\nDue to its importance in the Hebrew Bible, the olive has significant national meaning in modern Israeli culture. Two olive branches appear as part of Israel's emblem, which may have been inspired by the vision of biblical Hebrew prophet Zechariah, who describes seeing a menorah flanked by an olive tree on each side; the trees represent Zerubbabel and Joshua, the governor and high priest, respectively. The olive tree was declared the unofficial national tree of Israel in 2021 by a survey of Israelis; it is often planted during Tu BiShvat and its fruit is a customary part of the accompanying seder.\nChristianity.\nThe olive tree, as well as its fruit and oil, play an important role in Christianity. Apart from being mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (the Christian Old Testament), they appear several times in the New Testament. The Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem figures prominently in the Bible: It is part of the route to Bethany, which is the site of several key biblical events; where Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem; and where he ascended to heaven (Acts 1:9\u201312). Jesus is said to have spent time on the mount, teaching and prophesying to his disciples (Matthew 24\u201325)\u2014most notably the Olivet Discourse\u2014and returning after each day to rest (Luke 21:37, and John 8:1).\nGethsemane, an olive garden at the foot of the Mount of Olives, whose name derives from the Hebrew word for \"oil press\", is where Jesus underwent his agonized prayer to God and was ultimately betrayed and arrested before his crucifixion. According to Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, it is where the Virgin Mary was buried and was assumed into heaven after her dormition on Mount Zion. Gethsemane became a focal point for Christian pilgrims during the Middle Ages and remains revered in Christianity; many of its olive trees, which are purportedly among the oldest living trees in the world, are divided among various churches.\nThe apostle Paul uses the olive tree as an allegory in his Epistle to the Romans, comparing Israelites to a tame olive tree and Gentiles to a wild olive branch (Romans 11:17\u201324).The cultivated olive tree is pruned and nurtured so as to bear fruit, whereas its barren branches are trimmed and discarded; God has preserved the holy root of Israel so that the wild branches (the Gentiles) can be grafted onto it and thus share in the blessings of the cultivated tree (Israel)\nIslam.\nThe olive tree and olive oil are mentioned seven times in the Quran; it is one of a handful of plants to appear by name, along with the fig, date palm, ginger, and grapevine. The olive is praised as a precious fruit and a gift from God (Surah Al-An'am: 99). Muhammad is reported to have said: \"Take oil of olive and massage with it\u2014it is a blessed tree\" (Sunan al-Darimi, 69:103). Olives are substitutes for dates (if not available) during Ramadan fasting, and olive tree leaves are used as incense in some Muslim Mediterranean countries.\nPalestine.\nIn Palestine, the olive tree carries symbolic connotations of resilience, health, ancestral ties, and community. Researchers have found that it represents many Palestinian cultural values such as Sutra, A'wana and Sumud. Olive trees are also a symbol of Palestinian identity: they are viewed as the first witnesses that Palestine is the homeland of the Palestinian people, and signify the bond between Palestinians and their land. The olive tree is a means of survival and security, serving as the primary source of income for over 800,000 families and accounting for 14 percent of the Palestinian economy. Almost half the cultivated land in the West Bank is planted with about 10\"\u00a0\"million olive trees.\nThe harvest season is referred to as \"Palestine's wedding\" and is considered a national holiday when schools close for two days so that pupils and teachers can join in the harvest. This holiday allows community and family members to gather and serves as a ritual that encompasses their values surrounding family, labour, community and aid for other members of the community that do not possess land. This is practised through the tradition of leaving fruit on a tree during the harvest so that those who do not have land and are unable to take part in the harvest can still reap the benefits.\nThe olive tree's enduring cultural and economic significance to the Palestinians has put it at the center of the ongoing Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict; an estimated 800,000 olive trees have been uprooted by Israeli authorities and settlers since 1967, and groves are frequently targeted in attacks or acts of vandalism. These destructions are considered a way to forcibly displace Palestinians and seize their land.\nUnited States.\nDuring the early stage of the American Revolutionary War, the Second Continental Congress of the Thirteen American Colonies issued the \"Olive Branch Petition\" to Great Britain to prevent further escalation. The Great Seal of the United States, first used in 1782, depicts an eagle clutching an olive branch and arrows in its talons, indicating the power of peace and war, respectively. The eagle is portrayed as casting its gaze towards the olive branch, symbolizing the United States' preference to pursue peace before war.\nThomas Jefferson, a founding father and third president of the United States, was a great admirer of olives and olive oil, regarding the olive tree as \"the richest gift of heaven\", \"one of the most precious productions of nature\", and \"the most interesting plant in existence\". Jefferson's fascination stemmed from his experiences in Europe, particularly France and Italy, while serving as the U.S. Minister to France in the late 1780s. He was impressed by the olive tree's resilience and suitability for various climates, taking detailed notes of its various \"virtues\" and qualities; he also observed the widespread use of olive oil and encouraged its consumption for its health benefits and ability to provide \"a proper and comfortable nourishment\" compared to existing staples in the U.S. such as rice.\nJefferson believed the olive tree would be a valuable crop in America and could help alleviate poverty and improve the lives of enslaved people; he wrote letters to various agricultural societies urging them to consider introducing olive cultivation in the U.S., advocating for \"an olive tree planted for every American slave\", particularly in the American South. Jefferson experimented with growing olive trees at his home in Monticello, Virginia and attempted to establish a domestic olive oil industry, expressing bitter disappointment when this effort failed in the early 1810s.\nJefferson remained a lifelong connoisseur of olive oil, which \"had joined the exclusive company of wine and books as a ... 'necessary of life'\"; every year until his death, he imported four to five gallons of \"virgin oil of Aix\" from France, and at least one fragment of an olive oil bottle has been unearthed at Monticello.\nUnited Nations.\nThe flag of the United Nations adopted in 1946 is a world map surrounded by two olive branches. Likewise, a similar design is adopted for the flags of many U.N. agencies and programs, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization.\nUses and properties.\nThe olive tree, \"Olea europaea\", has been cultivated for the olive fruit, olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, and ornamental reasons. About 80% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 20% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the \"trinity\" or \"triad\" of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, along with wheat (for bread, pasta, and couscous) and the grape (for wine).\nOlive oil.\nOlive oil is a liquid fat obtained from olives, produced by pressing whole olives and extracting the resulting oil. It is most commonly used for culinary purposes, namely frying, marinating, or flavoring food or as a salad dressing. Olive oil is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps. Olive oil serves a ritual purpose in some religions. Pursuant to historical tradition, various Christian churches use olive oil as part of consecration ceremonies, such as administering certain sacraments and ecclesiastical functions.\nSpain accounts for almost half of global olive oil production; other major producers are Portugal, Italy, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey. Per capita consumption is highest in Greece, followed by Italy and Spain.\nThe composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, elevation, time of harvest and extraction process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid (up to 21%) and palmitic acid (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity and fruity flavor characteristics.\nTable olives.\nTable olives are classified by the International Olive Council (IOC) into three groups according to the degree of ripeness achieved before harvesting:\nFermentation and curing.\nRaw or fresh olives are naturally very bitter and astringent; to make them palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products, which render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the \"throubes\" black olive, which becomes edible when allowed to ripen in the sun, shrivel, and fall from the tree.\nThe curing process may take from a few days with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.\nThe many types of preparations for table olives depend on local tastes and traditions. The most important commercial examples are listed below.\nOlive wood.\nOlive wood is very hard and tough and is prized for its durability, colour, high combustion temperature, and interesting grain patterns. Because of the commercial importance of the fruit, slow growth, and relatively small size of the tree, olive wood and its products are relatively expensive. Common uses of olive wood include kitchen utensils, carved wooden bowls, cutting boards, fine furniture, and decorative items. The yellow or light greenish-brown wood is often finely veined with a darker tint; being very hard and close-grained, it is valued by woodworkers.\nOrnamental.\nIn modern landscape design, olive trees are frequently used as ornamental features for their distinctively gnarled trunks and evergreen silvery-gray foliage. Smaller cultivars have become increasingly popular as indoor plants due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal.\nOlive mill wastewater.\nThe pressing of olives to create olive oil results in a liquid byproduct known in Latin as \"amurca\" or olive mill wastewater. Owing to its bitterness and unpleasant aroma, it was historically discarded as a waste product.\nOlive stone.\nThe hard, inedible core of the olive fruit, also known as the pit or kernel, has various potential applications, including for biofuel, activated carbon (used for water filtration and absorption), furfural production, filler, animal feed, or resin formation. Spain, the world's leading olive grower, produces about 400,000 tons of olive pits annually, which are mostly used as biomass for residential boilers, olive mills, and some industries.\nEnvironmental health and sustainability.\nOlive tree cultivation has been linked to promoting biodiversity, improving soil quality, and mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. As long-lived perennial plants, they absorb carbon dioxide over long time frames, with groves sequestering approximately 2.2 to 4.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per hectare annually.\nCultivation.\nThe earliest evidence for the domestication of olives comes from the Chalcolithic period archaeological site of Teleilat el Ghassul in modern Jordan. Farmers in ancient times believed that olive trees would not grow well if planted more than a certain distance from the sea; Theophrastus gives 300 stadia () as the limit. Modern experience does not always confirm this, and, though showing a preference for the coast, they have long been grown further inland in some areas with suitable climates, particularly in the southwestern Mediterranean (Iberia and northwest Africa) where winters are mild. An article on olive tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, \"Book on Agriculture\".\nOlives are cultivated in many regions of the world with Mediterranean climates, such as South Africa, Chile, Peru, Pakistan, Australia, and the western United States (particularly California), as well as in areas with temperate climates such as New Zealand and the C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina.\nGrowth and propagation.\nOlive trees show a marked preference for calcareous soils, flourishing best on limestone slopes and crags, and coastal climate conditions. They grow in any light soil, even on clay if well drained, but in rich soils, they are predisposed to disease and produce poor quality oil. (This was noted by Pliny the Elder.) Olives like hot weather and sunny positions without any shade, while temperatures below may injure even a mature tree. They tolerate drought well because of their sturdy and extensive root systems. Olive trees can remain productive for centuries as long as they are pruned correctly and regularly.\nOnly a handful of olive varieties can be used to cross-pollinate. 'Pendolino' olive trees are partially self-fertile, but pollenizers are needed for a large fruit crop. Other compatible olive tree pollinators include 'Leccino' and 'Maurino'. 'Pendolino' olive trees are used extensively as pollinizers in large olive tree groves.\nOlives are propagated by various methods. The preferred ways are cuttings and layers; the tree roots easily in favourable soil and throws up suckers from the stump when cut down. However, yields from trees grown from suckers or seeds are poor; they must be budded or grafted onto other specimens to do well. Branches of various thickness cut into lengths around planted deeply in manured ground soon vegetate. Shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow trenches and, when covered with a few centimetres of soil, rapidly throw up sucker-like shoots. In Greece, grafting the cultivated tree on the wild tree is a common practice. In Italy, embryonic buds, which form small swellings on the stems, are carefully excised and planted under the soil surface, where they soon form a vigorous shoot.\nThe olive is also sometimes grown from seed. To facilitate germination, the oily pericarp is first softened by slight rotting, or soaked in hot water or in an alkaline solution.\nIn situations where extreme cold has damaged or killed the olive tree, the rootstock can survive and produce new shoots which in turn become new trees. In this way, olive trees can regenerate themselves. In Tuscany in 1985, a very severe frost destroyed many productive and aged olive trees and ruined many farmers' livelihoods. However, new shoots appeared in the spring and, once the dead wood was removed, became the basis for new fruit-producing trees.\nOlives grow very slowly, and over many years, the trunk can attain a considerable diameter. A. P. de Candolle recorded one exceeding in girth. The trees rarely exceed in height and are generally confined to much more limited dimensions by frequent pruning. Olives are very hardy and are resistant to disease and fire. Its root system is robust and capable of regenerating the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. \nThe crop from old trees is sometimes enormous, but they seldom bear well two years in succession, and in many cases, a large harvest occurs every sixth or seventh season. Where the olive is carefully cultivated, as in Liguria, Languedoc, and Provence, the trees are regularly pruned. The pruning preserves the flower-bearing shoots of the preceding year, while keeping the tree low enough to allow the easy gathering of the fruit.\nPests, diseases, and weather.\nVarious pathologies can affect olives. The most serious pest is the olive fruit fly (\"Dacus oleae\" or \"Bactrocera oleae\") which lays its eggs in the olive most commonly just before it becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding the puncture rots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest, the practice has been to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. dimethoate). Classic organic methods have been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium \"Bacillus thuringiensis\", and spraying with kaolin. Such methods are obligatory for organic olives.\nA fungus, \"Cycloconium oleaginum\", can infect the trees for several successive seasons, causing great damage to plantations. A species of bacterium, \"Pseudomonas savastanoi\" pv. \"oleae\", induces tumour growth in the shoots. Certain lepidopterous caterpillars feed on the leaves and flowers. \"Xylella fastidiosa\" bacteria, which can also infect citrus fruit and vines, has attacked olive trees in Apulia, southern Italy, causing olive quick decline syndrome (OQDS). The main vector is \"Philaenus spumarius\" (meadow spittlebug).\nA pest that spreads through olive trees is the black scale bug, a small black scale insect that resembles a small black spot. They attach themselves firmly to olive trees and reduce the quality of the fruit; their main predators are wasps. The curculio beetle eats the edges of leaves, leaving sawtooth damage.\nRabbits eat the bark of olive trees and can do considerable damage, especially to young trees. If the bark is removed around the entire circumference of a tree, it is likely to die. Voles and mice also do damage by eating the roots. At the northern edge of their cultivation zone, for instance in northern Italy, southern France and Switzerland, olive trees suffer occasionally from frost. Gales and long-continued rains during the gathering season also cause damage. In the colder Mediterranean hinterland, olive cultivation is replaced by other fruits, typically the chestnut.\nAs an invasive species.\nSince its first domestication, \"O. europaea\" has been spreading back to the wild from planted groves. Its original wild populations in southern Europe have been largely swamped by feral plants.\nIn some other parts of the world where it has been introduced, most notably South Australia, the olive has become a major weed that displaces native vegetation. In South Australia, its seeds are spread by the introduced red fox and by many bird species, including the European starling and the native emu, into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dense canopy that prevents regeneration of native trees. As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire prone, the oil-rich feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard of native sclerophyll woodlands.\nHarvesting.\nOlives are harvested in the autumn and winter. More specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, green olives are picked from the end of September to about the middle of November. In the Southern Hemisphere, green olives are picked from the middle of October to the end of November, and black olives are collected worldwide from the middle of November to the end of January or early February. In southern Europe, harvesting is done for several weeks in winter, but the time varies in each country, and with the season and the cultivar. Large olive trees produce on average about 400 pounds of olives annually.\nMost olives today are harvested by shaking the boughs or the whole tree. Using olives found lying on the ground can result in poor quality oil, due to damage. Another method involves standing on a ladder and \"milking\" the olives into a sack tied around the harvester's waist. This method produces high quality oil. A third method uses a device called an oli-net that wraps around the tree trunk and opens to form an umbrella-like catcher from which workers collect the fruit. Another method uses an electric tool with large tongs that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the tree.\nTable olive varieties are more difficult to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.\nThe amount of oil contained in the fruit differs greatly by cultivar; the pericarp is usually 60\u201370% oil. Typical yields are of oil per tree per year.\nLongevity.\nOlive trees have been venerated for their resilience and longevity since antiquity; several specimens are reputed to be several thousand years old. However, compared to other woody plants, the exact lifespan is difficult to determine through common methods like dendrochronology (analyzing tree rings) due to the olive tree's irregular growth patterns, which can include missing annual tree rings, hollowed-out interiors, and multiple trunks. For example, a 2013 study revealed wide disparities among different laboratories conducting tree-ring dating of the same specimens. Alternatively, although age can be inferred from a tree's diameter, this method is imperfect due to a range of other factors that affect size and length, such as soil fertility and climatic conditions. Based on a combination of tree-ring and radiocarbon dating, olive trees have maximum ages between 300 and 500 years, with some research finding that most of the oldest trees live up to 700 years.\nGlobal production.\nOlives are one of the most extensively cultivated fruit crops in the world. As of 2024, olive groves occupied roughly 11.6 million hectares (28.6 million acres), comprising one-quarter of the world's permanent cultivated area. By comparison, in 2011, about were planted with olive trees, which was more than twice the amount of land devoted to apples, bananas, or mangoes; only coconut trees and oil palms commanded more space. Cultivation area tripled from between 1960 and 1998 and reached a peak of in 2008. Nevertheless, live production in the Mediterranean region has declined since 2019 due to climate, economic and political factors.\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the 10 leading producers are all in the Mediterranean region and responsible for 95% of the world's olives. Spain is the world's leading producer and concentrates the largest land area to olive cultivation, with more than 180\"\u00a0\"million trees spanning over 2,507,684 hectares, followed by Tunisia (1,746,360 ha) and Italy (1,143,363 ha). In Italy, olive tree cultivation is widespread in the south, accounting for three quarters of its production; it is less abundant in the colder north of Italy, although growth has increased, particularly in the more temperate microclimates of Liguria and the hills around Lake Garda. Approximately 170 million plants are distributed over one million farms.\nIn terms of olive oil output, Spain is by far the largest producer, making up 25% of the global supply, followed by Italy, Morocco, and Tunisia. The European Union is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's olive oil.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNutrition.\nA reference serving of cured green olives provides of food energy, are a rich source of vitamin\"\u00a0\"E (25% of the Daily Value, DV), and contain a large amount of sodium (104% DV); other nutrients are insignificant. Green olives are 75% water, 15% fat, 4% carbohydrates and 1% protein (table).\nPhytochemicals.\nThe polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, as measured by the Folin method, are 117\u00a0mg/100 g in black olives and 161\u00a0mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21\u00a0mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82\u00a0mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59\u00a0mg/100 g in green olives.\nDuring the crushing, kneading and extraction of olive fruit to obtain olive oil, oleuropein, demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous beta-glucosidases to form aldehydes, dialdehydes, and aldehydic aglycones. Polyphenol content also varies with olive cultivar and the manner of presentation, with plain olives having higher contents than those that are pitted or stuffed.\nAllergenic potential.\nOlive tree pollen is extremely allergenic, with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. \"Olea europaea\" is primarily wind-pollinated and its buoyant pollen is a strong trigger for asthma. One popular variety, 'Swan Hill', is widely sold as an \"allergy-free\" olive tree; however, this variety does bloom, and it produce allergenic pollen.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the second emperor of the Year of the Four Emperors.\nA member of a noble Etruscan family, Otho was initially a friend and courtier of the young emperor Nero until he was effectively banished to the governorship of the remote province of Lusitania in 58 following his wife Poppaea Sabina's affair with Nero. After a period of moderate rule in the province, he allied himself with Galba, the governor of neighbouring Hispania Tarraconensis, during the revolts of 68. He accompanied Galba on his march to Rome, but revolted and murdered Galba at the start of the next year.\nInheriting the problem of the rebellion of Vitellius, commander of the army in Germania Inferior, Otho led a sizeable force which met Vitellius' army at the Battle of Bedriacum. After initial fighting resulted in 40,000 casualties, and a retreat of his forces, Otho committed suicide rather than fight on, and Vitellius was proclaimed emperor.\nEarly life.\nOtho was born on 28 April AD 32. His grandfather Marcus had been a senator, and Claudius granted patrician status to Otho's father Lucius Salvius Otho. \nSuetonius, in \"The Lives of the Caesars\", comments on Otho's appearance and personal hygiene: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He is said to have been of moderate height, splay-footed and bandy-legged, but almost feminine in his care of his person. He had the hair of his body plucked out, and because of the thinness of his locks wore a wig so carefully fashioned and fitted to his head, that no one suspected it. Moreover, they say that he used to shave every day and smear his face with moist bread, beginning the practice with the appearance of the first down, so as never to have a beard.\nJuvenal, in a passage in the Satire II ridiculing male homosexuality, specifically mentions Otho as being vain and effeminate, looking at himself in the mirror before going into battle, and \"plaster[ing] his face with dough\" in order to look good.\nGreenhalgh writes that \"he was addicted to luxury and pleasure to a degree remarkable even in a Roman\". An aged freedwoman brought him into the company of the emperor Nero. Otho married the emperor's mistress Poppaea Sabina; Nero forced Otho to divorce Poppaea so that he himself could marry her. He exiled Otho to the province of Lusitania in 58 or 59 by appointing him to be its governor.\nOtho proved to be capable as governor of Lusitania, yet he never forgave Nero for marrying Poppaea. He allied himself with Galba, governor of neighboring Hispania Tarraconensis, in the latter's rebellion against Nero in 68. Nero committed suicide later that year, and Galba was proclaimed emperor by the Senate. Otho accompanied the new emperor to Rome in October 68. Before they entered the city, Galba's army fought against a legion that Nero had organized.\nReign, decline and fall.\nOverthrow of Galba.\nOn 1 January 69, the day Galba took the office of consul alongside Titus Vinius, the fourth and first Germanica legions of Germania Superior refused to swear loyalty to the emperor. They toppled the statues of Galba and demanded that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of Germania inferior also refused to swear their loyalty and proclaimed the governor of the province, Aulus Vitellius, as emperor. Galba tried to ensure his authority as emperor was recognized by adopting the nobleman Piso Licinianus as his successor, an action that gained resentment from Otho. Galba was killed by the praetorians on 15 January, followed shortly by Vinius and Piso. Their heads were placed on poles and Otho was proclaimed emperor.\nNero's statues were again set up, his freedmen and household officers reinstalled, including the young castrated boy Sporus whom Nero had taken in marriage and Otho also would live intimately with. The populace acclaimed him as \"Nero Otho\", although Otho did not appear to like the title. \nAt the same time, the fears of the more sober and respectable citizens were relieved by Otho's liberal professions of his intention to govern equitably, and by his judicious clemency towards Aulus Marius Celsus, a consul-designate and devoted adherent of Galba. He assumed the consulate of the year alongside his brother Lucius Salvius Otho Titianus, but only until the 1st of March.\nWar with Vitellius.\nUpon becoming emperor, Otho soon realized that it was much easier to overthrow an emperor than to rule as one. According to Suetonius, Otho once remarked \"With long pipes what concern have I?\" (referring to undertaking something beyond one's ability to do so). Any further development of Otho's policy was checked once he had read through Galba's private correspondence and realized the extent of the revolution in Germania, where several legions had declared for Vitellius and were already advancing upon Italy.\nThe conflict began in earnest when Vitellius's forces under Aulus Caecina Severus and Fabius Valens crossed the Alps into northern Italy. Otho dispatched forces from Pannonia and Dalmatia, including veteran legions such as the Legio XIV Gemina, which had distinguished itself in the suppression of Boudica's revolt in Britain.\nThe decisive engagement occurred at the Battle of Bedriacum on 14 April 69 AD, approximately 35 kilometers from Cremona. Despite initial successes by some Othonian units, including the capture of a Vitellian eagle standard, the battle resulted in a decisive defeat for Otho's forces. The Praetorian Guard, core of Otho's military strength, performed poorly in the engagement, fleeing before engaging in close combat.\nFollowing the defeat, Otho's remaining forces retreated to their camp at Bedriacum. Despite the urging of his soldiers to continue the fight and the approach of reinforcements from the Balkans, Otho chose to end the civil war rather than subject the Roman people to further bloodshed. On 16 April 69 AD, one day after the battle, Otho committed suicide by stabbing himself with a dagger, stating that he could \"die more honourably than he could reign.\" His death ended the war and cleared the path for Vitellius to assume undisputed control of the empire.\nDeath.\nOtho was still in command of a formidable force as the Dalmatian legions had reached Aquileia and the spirit of his soldiers and their officers was unbroken. He was resolved to accept the verdict of the battle that his own impatience had hastened. In a speech, he bade farewell to those about him, declaring: \"It is far more just to perish one for all, than many for one\", and then retiring to rest soundly for some hours. Early in the morning he stabbed himself in the heart with a dagger, which he had concealed under his pillow, and died as his attendants entered the tent.\nOtho had reigned three months; his ashes were placed within a modest monument and funeral was celebrated at once as he had wished. A plain tomb was erected in his honour at Brixellum, with the inscription \"Diis Manibus Marci Othonis\". His 91-day reign was the shortest until that of Pertinax, whose reign lasted 87 days in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors.\nIt has been thought that Otho's suicide was committed to steer his country away from the path to civil war and to avoid casualties in his legions. Just as he had come to power, many Romans learned to respect Otho in his death. Few could believe that a renowned former companion of Nero had chosen such an honourable end. Tacitus wrote that some of the soldiers committed suicide beside his funeral pyre \"because they loved their emperor and wished to share his glory\". Writing during the reign of the Emperor Domitian (AD 81\u201396), the Roman poet Martial expressed his admiration for Otho's choice to spare the empire from civil war through sacrificing himself,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Although the goddess of civil warfare was still in doubt,\nAnd soft Otho had perhaps still a chance of winning,\nHe renounced fighting that would have cost much blood,\nAnd with sure hand pierced right through his breast.\nBy all means let Cato in his life be greater than Caesar himself;\nIn his death was he greater than Otho?&lt;/poem&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22482", "revid": "47988270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22482", "title": "Orsini family", "text": "Italian noble family\nThe House of Orsini is an Italian noble family that was one of the most influential princely families in medieval Italy and Renaissance Rome. Members of the Orsini family include five popes: Stephen II (752\u2013757), Paul I (757\u2013767), Celestine III (1191\u20131198), Nicholas III (1277\u20131280), and Benedict XIII (1724\u20131730). The family also included 34 cardinals, numerous \"condottieri\", and other significant political and religious figures. The Orsini are part of the Black nobility who were Roman aristocratic families who supported the Popes in the governance of the Papal States.\nOrigins.\nAccording to their own family legend, the Orsini are descended from the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome. The Orsini carried on a political feud with the Colonna family for centuries in Rome, until it was stopped by Papal Bull in 1511. In 1571, the heads of both families married nieces of Pope Sixtus V as an act of reconciliation. The Colonna family also claims descent from the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome.\nThe Orsini descend from Cajo Orso Orsini who lived c. 600 AD. Five popes are descended from him: Stephen II, Paul I, Celestine III, Nicholas III and Benedict XIII. Some members used the surname of Bobone-Orsini. One member by the name Bobone, lived during the early 11th century, father of Pietro, who was in turn father of Giacinto Bobone (1110\u20131198), who in 1191 became pope as Celestine III. One of the first great nepotist popes, he made two of his nephews cardinals and allowed his cousin Giovanni Gaetano (Giangaetano, died 1232) to buy the fiefs of Vicovaro, Licenza, Roccagiovine and Nettuno, which formed the nucleus of the future territorial power of the family.\nThe Bobone surname was lost with his children, who were called \"de domo filiorum Ursi\". Two of them, Napoleone and Matteo Rosso the Great (1178\u20131246), considerably increased the prestige of the family. The former was the founder of the first southern line, which died out with Camillo Pardo in 1553. He obtained the city of Manoppello, later a countship, and was \"gonfaloniere\" of the Papal States. Matteo Rosso, called the Great, was the effective lord of Rome from 1241, when he defeated the Imperial troops, until 1243, holding the title of Senator. Two of his sons, and Napoleone, were also Senators. Matteo ousted the family's traditional rivals, the Colonna family, from Rome and extended the Orsini territories southwards down to Avellino and northwards to Pitigliano. During his life, the family was firmly in the Guelph faction. He had some ten sons, who divided the fiefs after his deaths: Gentile (died 1246) originated the Pitigliano line and the second southern line, Rinaldo that of Monterotondo, Napoleone (died 1267) that of Bracciano, and another Matteo Rosso that of Montegiordano, from the name of the district in Rome housing the family's fortress. The most distinguished of his sons was Giovanni Gaetano (died 1280): elected pope as Nicholas III, he named his nephew Bertoldo (d. 1289) as count of Romagna, and had two nephews and a brother created cardinals.\nThe second southern line.\nThe rise of the Orsini did not stop after Nicholas' death. Bertoldo's son, Gentile II (1250\u20131318), was two times Senator of Rome, podest\u00e0 of Viterbo and, from 1314, \"Gran Giustiziere\" (\"Great Justicer\") of the Kingdom of Naples. He married Clarice Ruffo, daughter of the counts of Catanzaro, forming an alliance of the most powerful Calabrian dynasty. His son Romano (1268\u20131327), called Romanello, was Royal Vicar of Rome in 1326, and inherited the countship of Soana through his marriage with Anastasia de Montfort, Countess of Nola. Romano's stance was markedly Guelph. After his death, his two sons divided his fiefs, forming the Pitigliano and the second southern line.\nRoberto (1295\u20131345), Gentile II's grandson, married Sibilla del Balzo, daughter of the Great Senechal of the Kingdom of Naples. Among his sons, Giacomo (died 13 August 1379; Dean of Salisbury, Archdeacon of Leicester and Archdeacon of Durham) was created cardinal by Gregory XI in 1371, while Nicola (August 27, 1331\u00a0\u2013 February 14, 1399) obtained the counties of Ariano and Celano. The latter was also Senator of Rome and enlarged the family territories in Lazio and Tuscany.\nHis second son, Raimondello Orsini del Balzo, supported Charles III' \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" in Naples against Queen Joan I. Under king Ladislaus he was among the few Neapolitan feudataries who were able to maintain their territorial power after the royal war against them. However, at his death in 1406 the southern Orsini fiefs were confiscated. Relationships with the royal family remained cold under Joan II; However, when Raimondello's son Giannantonio (1386\u20131453) sent his troops to help her against the usurpation attempt of James of Bourbon, he received in exchange the Principality of Taranto.\nThe links with the court increased further under Sergianni Caracciolo, Joan's lover and Great Senechal. A younger brother of Giannantonio married one of Sergianni's daughters. However, the Orsini changed side when Alfonso V of Aragon started his conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. Giannantonio was awarded with the duchy of Bari, the position of Great Connestable and an appanage of 100,000 \"ducati\". Giannantonio remained faithful to Alfonso's heir, Ferdinand I, but was killed during a revolt of nobles. Having died without legitimate sons, much of his possessions were absorbed into the Royal Chamber.\nPitigliano line.\nThis line was initiated by Guido Orsini, second son of Romano, who inherited the county of Soana, on the western side of Lake Bolsena in southern Tuscany. He and his descendants ruled over the fiefs of Soana, Pitigliano and Nola, but in the early 15th century wars against the Republic of Siena and the Colonnas caused the loss of several territories. Bertoldo (died 1417) managed to keep only Pitigliano, while his grandson Orso (died July 5, 1479) was count of Nola and fought as condottiere under the Duke of Milan and the Republic of Venice. Later he entered the service of Ferdinand I of Naples, but, not having taken part in the Barons' conspiracy, he was rewarded with the fiefs of Ascoli and Atripalda. He took part in the Aragonese campaign in Tuscany and was killed at the siege of Viterbo.\nThe most outstanding member of the Pitigliano line was Niccol\u00f2, one of the major condottiere of the time. His son Ludovico (died January 27, 1534) and his nephew Enrico (died 1528) participated in the Italian Wars at the service of both France and Spain, often changing side with the typical ease of the Italian military leaders of the time. Two of Ludovico's daughters married relevant figures: Geronima to Pier Luigi Farnese, illegitimate son of Pope Paul III and Marzia to Gian Giacomo Medici of Marignano, an important general of the Spanish army.\nThe line started to decay after the loss of Nola by Ludovico, who was also forced to accept the Sienese suzerainty over Pitigliano. Under his son Giovan Francesco (died May 8, 1567) the county entered the orbit of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Later, the attempt of Alessandro (died February 9, 1604) to obtain the title of Monterotondo was thwarted by Pope Gregory XIII. His son Giannantonio (March 25, 1569\u00a0\u2013 1613) sold Pitigliano to Tuscany, in exchange for the marquisate of Monte San Savino.\nThe line became extinct in 1640 with the death of Alessandro.\nMonterotondo line.\nThis line was founded by Rinaldo, third son of Matteo Rosso the Great. His son, Napoleone, became a cardinal in 1288 and remained a prominent member of the Curia until his death at Avignon in 1342.\nThis branch of the family was often involved in the baronial struggles of the Late Middle Ages Rome, at least three members of the family being elected as Senators, while others fought as condottieri. Francesco in 1370 took part to the war of Florence against the Visconti of Milan. Orso (died July 24, 1424) died fighting for the king of Naples in the Battle of Zagonara against the Milanese. His sons Giacomo (died 1482) and Lorenzo (1452) battled for the Papal States, Naples and Florence. One of Giacomo's daughters, Clarice (1453\u2013July 30, 1488) became Lorenzo de' Medici's wife. Franciotto Orsini was created cardinal by Leo X in 1517.\nThe most important member of the Monterotondo Orsinis was Giovani Battista Orsini, who became cardinal under Sixtus IV (1483). He was probably among the promoters of the failed plot against Cesare Borgia in 1502, being assassinated on February 22 of 1503 as retaliation, together with other members of the family: Giulio survived captivity under Cesare, and Paolo and Francesco 4th Duke of Gravina were strangled to death on 18 January 1503.\nThe line decayed from the late 16th century, when several members were assassinated or lost their lands for various reasons. Its last representatives Enrico (died September 12, 1643) and Francesco (1592 - September 21, 1650) sold Monterotondo to the Barberini in 1641.\nBracciano line.\nNapoleone, another son of Matteo Rosso the Great, received Bracciano, Nerola and other lands in what is now northern Lazio. In 1259 he was Senator of Rome. Thanks to the strategic positions of their fiefs, and to their famous castle built in Bracciano in 1426, they were the most powerful Orsini line in the Lazio. Count Carlo (died after 1485), son of another Napoleone (died October 3, 1480), was Papal Gonfaloniere. By his marriage with a Francesca Orsini of Monterotondo was born Gentile Virginio Orsini, one of the most prominent figures of Italian politics in the late 15th century. After Carlo's death, he enlarged the family's tenure with lands inherited by his wife, another Orsini from Salerno, and most of all he was amongst the favourites of Ferdinand I of Naples, who appointed him as Great Constable of Naples. Together with his cousin, the Cardinal Giovanni Battista, he was among the fiercest opponents of popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI. In 1492 Gentile Virginio bought the county of Anguillara from Franceschetto Cybo.\nDuring Charles VIII of France's descent into Italy, he managed to keep Bracciano. Ferdinand II had his fiefs confiscated and imprisoned him in Castel dell'Ovo, where he was poisoned in 1497. The family recovered this setback under the more friendly Medici popes of the early 16th century. His son Gian Giordano was Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne. His nephew Virginio was a famous admiral for the Papal States and France, but in 1539 he had his fiefs confiscated under the charge of treason.\nPaolo Giordano was created first Duke of Bracciano in 1560. The son of Girolamo Orsini and Francesca Sforza, he was grandson, on his father's side, of Felice della Rovere (illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II) and Gian Giordano Orsini and, on his mother's side, of Count Bosio Sforza and Costanza Farnese, an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III. An accomplished condottiero, he was however also a ruthless figure who had his wife Isabella de' Medici murdered. For this and other homicides he had to flee to northern Italy. He was succeeded by Virginio, whose heir Paolo Giordano II married the princess of Piombino and was created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. His brother Alessandro was cardinal and Papal legate, and another brother, Ferdinando (died March 4, 1660) acquired the assets of the other line of San Gemini. In the 17th century the Dukes of Bracciano moved their residence to Rome. This, along with a general economical decadence, damaged the dukedom, and last Duke and Prince, Flavio (March 4, 1620\u00a0\u2013 April 5, 1698) was forced by the huge debts to sell it to Livio Odescalchi.\nGravina line.\nThe line of Gravina, from the name of the eponymous city in Apulia, is the only existing line of the Orsini. It descends from Francesco (died 1456), a son of Count Carlo of Bracciano. Most of his fief was located in northern Lazio, but he entered in the Neapolitan orbit when in 1418 he was called by Sergianni Caracciolo to fight against the Angevine troops, which he defeated. By marriage, he obtained the title of Count of Gravina. He was made Duke of Gravina by King Alfonso, a title definitely assigned to his son Giacomo (died 1472), to which had been added the counties of Conversano, Campagna and Copertino. Two of Francesco's sons, Marino (died 1471) and Giovanni Battista (died June 8, 1476), were respectively archbishop of Taranto and Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes.\nThe fourth duke, Francesco, was part of a conspiracy along with his brothers Giulio and Paolo against Cesare Borgia but were found out, and Francesco was strangled to death on 18 January 1503 along with his brother Paolo. One of Francesco's nephews, Flavio Orsini, was created cardinal in 1565. The fifth duke, Ferdinando (died December 6, 1549), had all his fiefs confiscated by the Spaniards, but he regained them after a 40,000 scudi payment.\nAfter the heirless death of Duke Michele Antonio (January 26, 1627), his lands passed to his cousin Pietro Orsini, count of Muro Lucano (died 1641). The latter's nephew Pier Francesco, who had renounced the succession in favour of his brother Domenico to become a Dominican, was later elected pope with the name of Benedict XIII.\nHis successor raised Benedict XIII's nephew, Prince Beroaldo Orsini, to the dignity of Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne (title held until 1958), after the emperor Charles VI had already, in 1724, made him a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. The last cardinal from the family was Domenico.\nThis branch of the family moved to Rome in the 18th century, where Duke Domenico (November 23, 1790\u00a0\u2013 April 28, 1874), married Maria Luisa Torlonia in 1823. In 1850, he was Minister of War and General Lieutenant of the Papal Armies, and also Senator of Rome.\nThe remaining princely family is represented by Prince Domenico Napoleone Orsini, Duke of Gravina (b. 1948). With no sons or male-line descendants, the heir to the dukedom of Gravina is his brother Don Benedetto Orsini (b. 1956), followed by his cousin Prince Lelio Orsini d'Aragona (b. 1981), whose mother is Princess Ketevan Bagration of Mukhrani.\nNotable buildings.\nApart from the Bracciano castle, other notable buildings and structures associated with the Orsini include:\nOrsinis in literature.\nThe Orsini family was briefly mentioned in Boccaccio's book \"The Decameron\" in the 5th day, 3rd story. In the woods, it is described that soldiers from a rival family's soldiers attacked a fictional character in the book named Pietro while they had become lost in the woods about eight miles from Rome. Boccaccio describes the soldiers acting to spite of the Orsini's. Furthermore, a castle named Campo de' Fiori, was included in the text. \"L'Idole\" (R. Merle) also has Paolo and Lodovico Orsini as main protagonists, since the book is about Vittoria Accoramboni's life.\nA \"Princess Orsini\" is mentioned in Book II, Chapter XXII of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"Tender is the Night\", as Dick Diver relates an anecdote to Collis Clay in the bar of Rome's Quirinal Hotel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22483", "revid": "50865928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22483", "title": "Optics", "text": "Branch of physics that studies light\nOptics is the branch of physics that studies the behaviour, manipulation, and detection of electromagnetic radiation, including its interactions with matter and instruments that use or detect it. Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. The study of optics extends to other forms of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, microwaves, \nand X-rays. The term \"optics\" is also applied to technology for manipulating beams of elementary charged particles.\nMost optical phenomena can be accounted for by using the classical electromagnetic description of light, however, complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are often difficult to apply in practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, geometric optics, treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot be accounted for in geometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.\nSome phenomena depend on light having both wave-like and particle-like properties. Explanation of these effects requires quantum mechanics. When considering light's particle-like properties, the light is modelled as a collection of particles called \"photons\". Quantum optics deals with the application of quantum mechanics to optical systems.\nOptical science is relevant to and studied in many related disciplines including astronomy, various engineering fields, photography, and medicine, especially in radiographic methods such as beam radiation therapy and CT scans, and in the physiological optical fields of ophthalmology and optometry. Practical applications of optics are found in a variety of technologies and everyday objects, including mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, lasers, and fibre optics.\nHistory.\nOptics began with the development of lenses by the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians. The earliest known lenses, made from polished crystal, often quartz, date from as early as 2000\u00a0BC from Crete (Archaeological Museum of Heraclion, Greece). Lenses from Rhodes date around 700\u00a0BC, as do Assyrian lenses such as the Nimrud lens. The ancient Romans and Greeks filled glass spheres with water to make lenses. These practical developments were followed by the development of theories of light and vision by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers, and the development of geometrical optics in the Greco-Roman world. The word \"optics\" comes from the ancient Greek word , 'appearance, look'.\nGreek philosophy on optics broke down into two opposing theories on how vision worked, the intromission theory and the emission theory. The intromission approach saw vision as coming from objects casting off copies of themselves (called eidola) that were captured by the eye. With many propagators including Democritus, Epicurus, Aristotle and their followers, this theory seems to have some contact with modern theories of what vision really is, but it remained only speculation lacking any experimental foundation.\nPlato first articulated the emission theory, the idea that visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in \"Timaeus\". Some hundred years later, Euclid (4th\u20133rd century BC) wrote a treatise entitled \"Optics\" where he linked vision to geometry, creating \"geometrical optics\". He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that a beam of light from the eye could instantaneously light up the stars every time someone blinked. Euclid stated the principle of the shortest trajectory of light, and considered multiple reflections on flat and spherical mirrors.\nPtolemy, in his treatise \"Optics\", held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer's intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarized much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence. Plutarch (1st\u20132nd century AD) described multiple reflections on spherical mirrors and discussed the creation of magnified and reduced images, both real and imaginary, including the case of chirality of the images.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Greek ideas about optics were resurrected and extended by writers in the Muslim world. One of the earliest of these was Al-Kindi (c.\u2009801\u2013873) who wrote on the merits of Aristotelian and Euclidean ideas of optics, favouring the emission theory since it could better quantify optical phenomena. In 984, the Persian mathematician Ibn Sahl wrote the treatise \"On burning mirrors and lenses\", correctly describing a law of refraction equivalent to Snell's law. He used this law to compute optimum shapes for lenses and curved mirrors. In the early 11th century, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) wrote the \"Book of Optics\" (\"Kitab al-manazir\") in which he explored reflection and refraction and proposed a new system for explaining vision and light based on observation and experiment. He rejected the \"emission theory\" of Ptolemaic optics with its rays being emitted by the eye, and instead put forward the idea that light reflected in all directions in straight lines from all points of the objects being viewed and then entered the eye, although he was unable to correctly explain how the eye captured the rays. Alhazen's work was largely ignored in the Arabic world but it was anonymously translated into Latin around 1200 A.D. and further summarised and expanded on by the Polish monk Witelo making it a standard text on optics in Europe for the next 400 years.\nIn the 13th century in medieval Europe, English bishop Robert Grosseteste wrote on a wide range of scientific topics, and discussed light from four different perspectives: an epistemology of light, a metaphysics or cosmogony of light, an etiology or physics of light, and a theology of light, basing it on the works of Aristotle and Platonism. Grosseteste's most famous disciple, Roger Bacon, wrote works citing a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of Alhazen, Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Euclid, al-Kindi, Ptolemy, Tideus, and Constantine the African. Bacon was able to use parts of glass spheres as magnifying glasses to demonstrate that light reflects from objects rather than being released from them.\nThe first wearable eyeglasses were invented in Italy around 1286.\nThis was the start of the optical industry of grinding and polishing lenses for these \"spectacles\", first in Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century, and later in the spectacle making centres in both the Netherlands and Germany. Spectacle makers created improved types of lenses for the correction of vision based more on empirical knowledge gained from observing the effects of the lenses rather than using the rudimentary optical theory of the day (theory which for the most part could not even adequately explain how spectacles worked). This practical development, mastery, and experimentation with lenses led directly to the invention of the compound optical microscope around 1595, and the refracting telescope in 1608, both of which appeared in the spectacle making centres in the Netherlands.\nIn the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler expanded on geometric optics in his writings, covering lenses, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, the principles of pinhole cameras, inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, and the optical explanations of astronomical phenomena such as lunar and solar eclipses and astronomical parallax. He was also able to correctly deduce the role of the retina as the actual organ that recorded images, finally being able to scientifically quantify the effects of different types of lenses that spectacle makers had been observing over the previous 300 years. After the invention of the telescope, Kepler set out the theoretical basis on how they worked and described an improved version, known as the \"Keplerian telescope\", using two convex lenses to produce higher magnification.\nOptical theory progressed in the mid-17th century with treatises written by philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, which explained a variety of optical phenomena including reflection and refraction by assuming that light was emitted by objects which produced it. This differed substantively from the ancient Greek emission theory. In the late 1660s and early 1670s, Isaac Newton expanded Descartes's ideas into a corpuscle theory of light, famously determining that white light was a mix of colours that can be separated into its component parts with a prism. In 1690, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory for light based on suggestions that had been made by Robert Hooke in 1664. Hooke himself publicly criticised Newton's theories of light and the feud between the two lasted until Hooke's death. In 1704, Newton published \"Opticks\" and, at the time, partly because of his success in other areas of physics, he was generally considered to be the victor in the debate over the nature of light.\nNewtonian optics was generally accepted until the early 19th century when Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel conducted experiments on the interference of light that firmly established light's wave nature. Young's famous double slit experiment showed that light followed the superposition principle, which is a wave-like property not predicted by Newton's corpuscle theory. This work led to a theory of diffraction for light and opened an entire area of study in physical optics. Wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.\nThe next development in optical theory came in 1899 when Max Planck correctly modelled blackbody radiation by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called \"quanta\". In 1905, Albert Einstein published the theory of the photoelectric effect that firmly established the quantization of light itself. In 1913, Niels Bohr showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy, thus explaining the discrete lines seen in emission and absorption spectra. The understanding of the interaction between light and matter that followed from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also was crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. The ultimate culmination, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, explains all optics and electromagnetic processes in general as the result of the exchange of real and virtual photons. Quantum optics gained practical importance with the inventions of the maser in 1953 and of the laser in 1960.\nFollowing the work of Paul Dirac in quantum field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light.\nClassical optics.\nClassical optics is divided into two main branches: geometrical (or ray) optics and physical (or wave) optics. In geometrical optics, light is considered to travel in straight lines, while in physical optics, light is considered as an electromagnetic wave.\nGeometrical optics can be viewed as an approximation of physical optics that applies when the wavelength of the light used is much smaller than the size of the optical elements in the system being modelled.\nGeometrical optics.\n\"Geometrical optics\", or \"ray optics\", describes the propagation of light in terms of \"rays\" which travel in straight lines, and whose paths are governed by the laws of reflection and refraction at interfaces between different media. These laws were discovered empirically as far back as 984 AD and have been used in the design of optical components and instruments from then until the present day. They can be summarised as follows:\nWhen a ray of light hits the boundary between two transparent materials, it is divided into a reflected and a refracted ray.\nThe laws of reflection and refraction can be derived from Fermat's principle which states that \"the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.\"\nApproximations.\nGeometric optics is often simplified by making the paraxial approximation, or \"small angle approximation\". The mathematical behaviour then becomes linear, allowing optical components and systems to be described by simple matrices. This leads to the techniques of Gaussian optics and \"paraxial ray tracing\", which are used to find basic properties of optical systems, such as approximate image and object positions and magnifications.\nReflections.\nReflections can be divided into two types: specular reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for the production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection.\nIn specular reflection, the direction of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal, a line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray hits. The incident and reflected rays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal. This is known as the Law of Reflection.\nFor flat mirrors, the law of reflection implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are in front of the mirror. The image size is the same as the object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors produce reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came. This is called retroreflection.\nMirrors with curved surfaces can be modelled by ray tracing and using the law of reflection at each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces, parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus. Other curved surfaces may also focus light, but with aberrations due to the diverging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration. Curved mirrors can form images with a magnification greater than or less than one, and the magnification can be negative, indicating that the image is inverted. An upright image formed by reflection in a mirror is always virtual, while an inverted image is real and can be projected onto a screen.\nRefractions.\nRefraction occurs when light travels through an area of space that has a changing index of refraction; this principle allows for lenses and the focusing of light. The simplest case of refraction occurs when there is an interface between a uniform medium with index of refraction \"n\"1 and another medium with index of refraction \"n\"2. In such situations, Snell's Law describes the resulting deflection of the light ray:\nformula_2\nwhere \"\u03b8\"1 and \"\u03b8\"2 are the angles between the normal (to the interface) and the incident and refracted waves, respectively.\nThe index of refraction of a medium is related to the speed, \"v\", of light in that medium by\nformula_3\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light in vacuum.\nSnell's Law can be used to predict the deflection of light rays as they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and the geometry of the media are known. For example, the propagation of light through a prism results in the light ray being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. In most materials, the index of refraction varies with the frequency of the light, known as dispersion. Taking this into account, Snell's Law can be used to predict how a prism will disperse light into a spectrum. The discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton.\nSome media have an index of refraction which varies gradually with position and, therefore, light rays in the medium are curved. This effect is responsible for mirages seen on hot days: a change in index of refraction air with height causes light rays to bend, creating the appearance of specular reflections in the distance (as if on the surface of a pool of water). Optical materials with varying indexes of refraction are called gradient-index (GRIN) materials. Such materials are used to make gradient-index optics.\nFor light rays travelling from a material with a high index of refraction to a material with a low index of refraction, Snell's law predicts that there is no \"\u03b8\"2 when \"\u03b8\"1 is large. In this case, no transmission occurs; all the light is reflected. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection and allows for fibre optics technology. As light travels down an optical fibre, it undergoes total internal reflection allowing for essentially no light to be lost over the length of the cable.\nLenses.\nA device that produces converging or diverging light rays due to refraction is known as a \"lens\". Lenses are characterized by their focal length: a converging lens has positive focal length, while a diverging lens has negative focal length. Smaller focal length indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The focal length of a simple lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation.\nRay tracing can be used to show how images are formed by a lens. For a thin lens in air, the location of the image is given by the simple equation\nformula_4\nwhere \"S\"1 is the distance from the object to the lens, \"S\"2 is the distance from the lens to the image, and f is the focal length of the lens. In the sign convention used here, the object and image distances are positive if the object and image are on opposite sides of the lens.\nIncoming parallel rays are focused by a converging lens onto a spot one focal length from the lens, on the far side of the lens. This is called the rear focal point of the lens. Rays from an object at a finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal distance; the closer the object is to the lens, the further the image is from the lens.\nWith diverging lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge after going through the lens, in such a way that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens. This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at a finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and on the same side of the lens as the object. The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.\nLenses suffer from aberrations that distort images. \"Monochromatic aberrations\" occur because the geometry of the lens does not perfectly direct rays from each object point to a single point on the image, while chromatic aberration occurs because the index of refraction of the lens varies with the wavelength of the light.\nPhysical optics.\nIn physical optics, light is considered to propagate as waves. This model predicts phenomena such as interference and diffraction, which are not explained by geometric optics. The speed of light waves in air is approximately 3.0\u00d7108\u00a0m/s (exactly 299,792,458\u00a0m/s in vacuum). The wavelength of visible light waves varies between 400 and 700\u00a0nm, but the term \"light\" is also often applied to infrared (0.7\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm) and ultraviolet radiation (10\u2013400\u00a0nm).\nThe wave model can be used to make predictions about how an optical system will behave without requiring an explanation of what is \"waving\" in what medium. Until the middle of the 19th century, most physicists believed in an \"ethereal\" medium in which the light disturbance propagated. The existence of electromagnetic waves was predicted in 1865 by Maxwell's equations. These waves propagate at the speed of light and have varying electric and magnetic fields which are orthogonal to one another, and also to the direction of propagation of the waves. Light waves are now generally treated as electromagnetic waves except when quantum mechanical effects have to be considered.\nModelling and design of optical systems using physical optics.\nMany simplified approximations are available for analysing and designing optical systems. Most of these use a single scalar quantity to represent the electric field of the light wave, rather than using a vector model with orthogonal electric and magnetic vectors.\nThe Huygens\u2013Fresnel equation is one such model. This was derived empirically by Fresnel in 1815, based on Huygens' hypothesis that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary spherical wavefront, which Fresnel combined with the principle of superposition of waves. The Kirchhoff diffraction equation, which is derived using Maxwell's equations, puts the Huygens-Fresnel equation on a firmer physical foundation. Examples of the application of Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle can be found in the articles on diffraction and Fraunhofer diffraction.\nMore rigorous models, involving the modelling of both electric and magnetic fields of the light wave, are required when dealing with materials whose electric and magnetic properties affect the interaction of light with the material. For instance, the behaviour of a light wave interacting with a metal surface is quite different from what happens when it interacts with a dielectric material. A vector model must also be used to model polarised light.\nNumerical modeling techniques such as the finite element method, the boundary element method and the transmission-line matrix method can be used to model the propagation of light in systems which cannot be solved analytically. Such models are computationally demanding and are normally only used to solve small-scale problems that require accuracy beyond that which can be achieved with analytical solutions.\nAll of the results from geometrical optics can be recovered using the techniques of Fourier optics which apply many of the same mathematical and analytical techniques used in acoustic engineering and signal processing.\nGaussian beam propagation is a simple paraxial physical optics model for the propagation of coherent radiation such as laser beams. This technique partially accounts for diffraction, allowing accurate calculations of the rate at which a laser beam expands with distance, and the minimum size to which the beam can be focused. Gaussian beam propagation thus bridges the gap between geometric and physical optics.\nSuperposition and interference.\nIn the absence of nonlinear effects, the superposition principle can be used to predict the shape of interacting waveforms through the simple addition of the disturbances. This interaction of waves to produce a resulting pattern is generally termed \"interference\" and can result in a variety of outcomes. If two waves of the same wavelength and frequency are \"in phase\", both the wave crests and wave troughs align. This results in constructive interference and an increase in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a brightening of the waveform in that location. Alternatively, if the two waves of the same wavelength and frequency are out of phase, then the wave crests will align with wave troughs and vice versa. This results in destructive interference and a decrease in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a dimming of the waveform at that location. See below for an illustration of this effect.\nSince the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle states that every point of a wavefront is associated with the production of a new disturbance, it is possible for a wavefront to interfere with itself constructively or destructively at different locations producing bright and dark fringes in regular and predictable patterns. Interferometry is the science of measuring these patterns, usually as a means of making precise determinations of distances or angular resolutions. The Michelson interferometer was a famous instrument which used interference effects to accurately measure the speed of light.\nThe appearance of thin films and coatings is directly affected by interference effects. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, and can be used to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a single layer with a thickness of one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The reflected wave from the top of the film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180\u00b0 out of phase, causing destructive interference. The waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550\u00a0nm. More complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a broad band, or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength.\nConstructive interference in thin films can create a strong reflection of light in a range of wavelengths, which can be narrow or broad depending on the design of the coating. These films are used to make dielectric mirrors, interference filters, heat reflectors, and filters for colour separation in colour television cameras. This interference effect is also what causes the colourful rainbow patterns seen in oil slicks.\nDiffraction and optical resolution.\nDiffraction is the process by which light interference is most commonly observed. The effect was first described in 1665 by Francesco Maria Grimaldi, who also coined the term from the Latin 'to break into pieces'. Later that century, Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton also described phenomena now known to be diffraction in Newton's rings while James Gregory recorded his observations of diffraction patterns from bird feathers.\nThe first physical optics model of diffraction that relied on the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle was developed in 1803 by Thomas Young in his interference experiments with the interference patterns of two closely spaced slits. Young showed that his results could only be explained if the two slits acted as two unique sources of waves rather than corpuscles. In 1815 and 1818, Augustin-Jean Fresnel firmly established the mathematics of how wave interference can account for diffraction.\nThe simplest physical models of diffraction use equations that describe the angular separation of light and dark fringes due to light of a particular wavelength (\u03bb). In general, the equation takes the form\nformula_5 where d is the separation between two wavefront sources (in the case of Young's experiments, it was two slits), \u03b8 is the angular separation between the central fringe and the order fringe, where the central maximum is \"m\" = 0.\nThis equation is modified slightly to take into account a variety of situations such as diffraction through a single gap, diffraction through multiple slits, or diffraction through a diffraction grating that contains a large number of slits at equal spacing. More complicated models of diffraction require working with the mathematics of Fresnel or Fraunhofer diffraction.\nX-ray diffraction makes use of the fact that atoms in a crystal have regular spacing at distances that are on the order of one angstrom. To see diffraction patterns, x-rays with similar wavelengths to that spacing are passed through the crystal. Since crystals are three-dimensional objects rather than two-dimensional gratings, the associated diffraction pattern varies in two directions according to Bragg reflection, with the associated bright spots occurring in unique patterns and d being twice the spacing between atoms.\nDiffraction effects limit the ability of an optical detector to optically resolve separate light sources. In general, light that is passing through an aperture will experience diffraction and the best images that can be created (as described in diffraction-limited optics) appear as a central spot with surrounding bright rings, separated by dark nulls; this pattern is known as an Airy pattern, and the central bright lobe as an Airy disk. The size of such a disk is given by formula_6 where \u03b8 is the angular resolution, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light, and D is the diameter of the lens aperture. If the angular separation of the two points is significantly less than the Airy disk angular radius, then the two points cannot be resolved in the image, but if their angular separation is much greater than this, distinct images of the two points are formed and they can therefore be resolved. Rayleigh defined the somewhat arbitrary \"Rayleigh criterion\" that two points whose angular separation is equal to the Airy disk radius (measured to first null, that is, to the first place where no light is seen) can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that the greater the diameter of the lens or its aperture, the finer the resolution. Interferometry, with its ability to mimic extremely large baseline apertures, allows for the greatest angular resolution possible.\nFor astronomical imaging, the atmosphere prevents optimal resolution from being achieved in the visible spectrum due to the atmospheric scattering and dispersion which cause stars to twinkle. Astronomers refer to this effect as the quality of astronomical seeing. Techniques known as adaptive optics have been used to eliminate the atmospheric disruption of images and achieve results that approach the diffraction limit.\nDispersion and scattering.\nRefractive processes take place in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type of scattering is Thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, elastic scattering of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie scattering with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering, wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.\nDispersion occurs when different frequencies of light have different phase velocities, due either to material properties (\"material dispersion\") or to the geometry of an optical waveguide (\"waveguide dispersion\"). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease in index of refraction with increasing wavelength, which is seen in most transparent materials. This is called \"normal dispersion\". It occurs in all dielectric materials, in wavelength ranges where the material does not absorb light. In wavelength ranges where a medium has significant absorption, the index of refraction can increase with wavelength. This is called \"anomalous dispersion\".\nThe separation of colours by a prism is an example of normal dispersion. At the surfaces of the prism, Snell's law predicts that light incident at an angle \u03b8 to the normal will be refracted at an angle arcsin(sin (\"\u03b8\") / \"n\"). Thus, blue light, with its higher refractive index, is bent more strongly than red light, resulting in the well-known rainbow pattern.\nMaterial dispersion is often characterised by the Abbe number, which gives a simple measure of dispersion based on the index of refraction at three specific wavelengths. Waveguide dispersion is dependent on the propagation constant. Both kinds of dispersion cause changes in the group characteristics of the wave, the features of the wave packet that change with the same frequency as the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave. \"Group velocity dispersion\" manifests as a spreading-out of the signal \"envelope\" of the radiation and can be quantified with a group dispersion delay parameter:\nformula_7\nwhere \"v\"g is the group velocity. For a uniform medium, the group velocity is\nformula_8\nwhere n is the index of refraction and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This gives a simpler form for the dispersion delay parameter:\nformula_9\nIf D is less than zero, the medium is said to have \"positive dispersion\" or normal dispersion. If D is greater than zero, the medium has \"negative dispersion\". If a light pulse is propagated through a normally dispersive medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes \"positively chirped\", or \"up-chirped\", increasing in frequency with time. This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least refracted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) dispersive medium, high-frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes \"negatively chirped\", or \"down-chirped\", decreasing in frequency with time.\nThe result of group velocity dispersion, whether negative or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fibres, since if dispersion is too high, a group of pulses representing information will each spread in time and merge, making it impossible to extract the signal.\nPolarisation.\nPolarisation is a general property of waves that describes the orientation of their oscillations. For transverse waves such as many electromagnetic waves, it describes the orientation of the oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. The oscillations may be oriented in a single direction (linear polarisation), or the oscillation direction may rotate as the wave travels (circular or elliptical polarisation). Circularly polarised waves can rotate rightward or leftward in the direction of travel, and which of those two rotations is present in a wave is called the wave's chirality.\nThe typical way to consider polarisation is to keep track of the orientation of the electric field vector as the electromagnetic wave propagates. The electric field vector of a plane wave may be arbitrarily divided into two perpendicular components labeled x and y (with z indicating the direction of travel). The shape traced out in the x-y plane by the electric field vector is a Lissajous figure that describes the \"polarisation state\". The following figures show some examples of the evolution of the electric field vector (blue), with time (the vertical axes), at a particular point in space, along with its x and y components (red/left and green/right), and the path traced by the vector in the plane (purple): The same evolution would occur when looking at the electric field at a particular time while evolving the point in space, along the direction opposite to propagation.\n\"Linear\"\n\"Circular\"\n\"Elliptical polarisation\"\nIn the leftmost figure above, the x and y components of the light wave are in phase. In this case, the ratio of their strengths is constant, so the direction of the electric vector (the vector sum of these two components) is constant. Since the tip of the vector traces out a single line in the plane, this special case is called linear polarisation. The direction of this line depends on the relative amplitudes of the two components.\nIn the middle figure, the two orthogonal components have the same amplitudes and are 90\u00b0 out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when the other component is at maximum or minimum amplitude. There are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement: the x component can be 90\u00b0 ahead of the y component or it can be 90\u00b0 behind the y component. In this special case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarisation is called circular polarisation. The rotation direction in the circle depends on which of the two-phase relationships exists and corresponds to \"right-hand circular polarisation\" and \"left-hand circular polarisation\".\nIn all other cases, where the two components either do not have the same amplitudes and/or their phase difference is neither zero nor a multiple of 90\u00b0, the polarisation is called elliptical polarisation because the electric vector traces out an ellipse in the plane (the \"polarisation ellipse\"). This is shown in the above figure on the right. Detailed mathematics of polarisation is done using Jones calculus and is characterised by the Stokes parameters.\nChanging polarisation.\nMedia that have different indexes of refraction for different polarisation modes are called \"birefringent\". Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, this is the case with macroscopic crystals of calcite, which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarisation, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarisation state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarisation microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarisation of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarisation rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.\nMedia that reduce the amplitude of certain polarisation modes are called \"dichroic\", with devices that block nearly all of the radiation in one mode known as \"polarising filters\" or simply \"polarisers\". Malus' law, which is named after \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus, says that when a perfect polariser is placed in a linear polarised beam of light, the intensity, I, of the light that passes through is given by\nformula_10\nwhere \"I\"0 is the initial intensity, and \"\u03b8\"i is the angle between the light's initial polarisation direction and the axis of the polariser.\nA beam of unpolarised light can be thought of as containing a uniform mixture of linear polarisations at all possible angles. Since the average value of cos2 \"\u03b8\" is 1/2, the transmission coefficient becomes\nformula_11\nIn practice, some light is lost in the polariser and the actual transmission of unpolarised light will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarisers but considerably higher (&gt;49.9%) for some birefringent prism types.\nIn addition to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarisation effects can also occur at the (reflective) interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by the Fresnel equations. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected, with the ratio depending on the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, physical optics recovers Brewster's angle. When light reflects from a thin film on a surface, interference between the reflections from the film's surfaces can produce polarisation in the reflected and transmitted light.\nNatural light.\nMost sources of electromagnetic radiation contain a large number of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, in which case the light is said to be \"unpolarised\". If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is \"partially polarised\". If the polarisation is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarisation, and the parameters of the polarisation ellipse.\nLight reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarised, except when the light is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. It was this effect that allowed the mathematician \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus to make the measurements that allowed for his development of the first mathematical models for polarised light. Polarisation occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies. This partial polarisation of scattered light can be taken advantage of using polarising filters to darken the sky in photographs. Optical polarisation is principally of importance in chemistry due to circular dichroism and optical rotation (\"circular birefringence\") exhibited by optically active (chiral) molecules.\nModern optics.\n\"Modern optics\" encompasses the areas of optical science and engineering that became popular in the 20th century. These areas of optical science typically relate to the electromagnetic or quantum properties of light but do include other topics. A major subfield of modern optics, quantum optics, deals with specifically quantum mechanical properties of light. Quantum optics is not just theoretical; some modern devices, such as lasers, have principles of operation that depend on quantum mechanics. Light detectors, such as photomultipliers and channeltrons, respond to individual photons. Electronic image sensors, such as CCDs, exhibit shot noise corresponding to the statistics of individual photon events. Light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, too, cannot be understood without quantum mechanics. In the study of these devices, quantum optics often overlaps with quantum electronics.\nSpecialty areas of optics research include the study of how light interacts with specific materials as in crystal optics and metamaterials. Other research focuses on the phenomenology of electromagnetic waves as in singular optics, non-imaging optics, non-linear optics, statistical optics, and radiometry. Additionally, computer engineers have taken an interest in integrated optics, machine vision, and photonic computing as possible components of the \"next generation\" of computers.\nToday, the pure science of optics is called optical science or optical physics to distinguish it from applied optical sciences, which are referred to as optical engineering. Prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of optical components, and image processing. Some of these fields overlap, with nebulous boundaries between the subjects' terms that mean slightly different things in different parts of the world and in different areas of industry. A professional community of researchers in nonlinear optics has developed in the last several decades due to advances in laser technology.\nLasers.\nA laser is a device that emits light, a kind of electromagnetic radiation, through a process called \"stimulated emission\". The term \"laser\" is an acronym for 'Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation'. Laser light is usually spatially coherent, which means that the light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Because the microwave equivalent of the laser, the \"maser\", was developed first, devices that emit microwave and radio frequencies are usually called \"masers\".\nThe first working laser was demonstrated on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. When first invented, they were called \"a solution looking for a problem\". Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in the daily lives of the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Lasers are also used in holograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and laser hair removal.\nKapitsa\u2013Dirac effect.\nThe Kapitsa\u2013Dirac effect causes beams of particles to diffract as the result of meeting a standing wave of light. Light can be used to position matter using various phenomena (see optical tweezers).\nApplications.\nOptics is part of everyday life. The ubiquity of visual systems in biology indicates the central role optics plays as the science of one of the five senses. Many people benefit from eyeglasses or contact lenses, and optics are integral to the functioning of many consumer goods including cameras. Rainbows and mirages are examples of optical phenomena. Optical communication provides the backbone for both the Internet and modern telephony.\nHuman eye.\nThe human eye functions by focusing light onto a layer of photoreceptor cells called the retina, which forms the inner lining of the back of the eye. The focusing is accomplished by a series of transparent media. Light entering the eye passes first through the cornea, which provides much of the eye's optical power. The light then continues through the fluid just behind the cornea\u2014the anterior chamber, then passes through the pupil. The light then passes through the lens, which focuses the light further and allows adjustment of focus. The light then passes through the main body of fluid in the eye\u2014the vitreous humour, and reaches the retina. The cells in the retina line the back of the eye, except for where the optic nerve exits; this results in a blind spot.\nThere are two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. Rod cells are sensitive to the intensity of light over a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. Rod cells are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision.\nIn contrast, cone cells are less sensitive to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus are used in the perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.\nCiliary muscles around the lens allow the eye's focus to be adjusted. This process is known as accommodation. The near point and far point define the nearest and farthest distances from the eye at which an object can be brought into sharp focus. For a person with normal vision, the far point is located at infinity. The near point's location depends on how much the muscles can increase the curvature of the lens, and how inflexible the lens has become with age. Optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians usually consider an appropriate near point to be closer than normal reading distance\u2014approximately 25\u00a0cm.\nDefects in vision can be explained using optical principles. As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the eye, a condition known as presbyopia. Similarly, people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough to allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Conversely, people who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant objects to be imaged on the retina suffer from myopia and have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as astigmatism results when the cornea is not spherical but instead is more curved in one direction. This causes horizontally extended objects to be focused on different parts of the retina than vertically extended objects, and results in distorted images.\nAll of these conditions can be corrected using corrective lenses. For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.\nThe optical power of corrective lenses is measured in diopters, a value equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres; with a positive focal length corresponding to a converging lens and a negative focal length corresponding to a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for astigmatism as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, and one for the angle of orientation of the astigmatism.\nVisual effects.\nOptical illusions (also called visual illusions) are characterized by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that differs from the object being imaged. Optical illusions can be the result of a variety of phenomena including physical effects that create images that are different from the objects that make them, the physiological effects on the eyes and brain of excessive stimulation (e.g. brightness, tilt, colour, movement), and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences.\nCognitive illusions include some which result from the unconscious misapplication of certain optical principles. For example, the Ames room, Hering, M\u00fcller-Lyer, Orbison, Ponzo, Sander, and Wundt illusions all rely on the suggestion of the appearance of distance by using converging and diverging lines, in the same way that parallel light rays (or indeed any set of parallel lines) appear to converge at a vanishing point at infinity in two-dimensionally rendered images with artistic perspective. This suggestion is also responsible for the famous moon illusion where the moon, despite having essentially the same angular size, appears much larger near the horizon than it does at zenith. This illusion so confounded Ptolemy that he incorrectly attributed it to atmospheric refraction when he described it in his treatise, \"Optics\".\nAnother type of optical illusion exploits broken patterns to trick the mind into perceiving symmetries or asymmetries that are not present. Examples include the caf\u00e9 wall, Ehrenstein, Fraser spiral, Poggendorff, and Z\u00f6llner illusions. Related, but not strictly illusions, are patterns that occur due to the superimposition of periodic structures. For example, transparent tissues with a grid structure produce shapes known as moir\u00e9 patterns, while the superimposition of periodic transparent patterns comprising parallel opaque lines or curves produces line moir\u00e9 patterns.\nOptical instruments.\nSingle lenses have a variety of applications including photographic lenses, corrective lenses, and magnifying glasses while single mirrors are used in parabolic reflectors and rear-view mirrors. Combining a number of mirrors, prisms, and lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical uses. For example, a periscope is simply two plane mirrors aligned to allow for viewing around obstructions. The most famous compound optical instruments in science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented by the Dutch in the late 16th century.\nMicroscopes were first developed with just two lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece. The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has a longer focal length. This has the effect of producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as \"compound microscopes\" have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope, looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.\nThe first telescopes, called refracting telescopes, were also developed with a single objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses an image of a distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much smaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather the collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.\nSince crafting large lenses is much more difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are \"reflecting telescopes\", that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.\nPhotography.\nThe optics of photography involves both lenses and the medium in which the electromagnetic radiation is recorded, whether it be a plate, film, or charge-coupled device. Photographers must consider the reciprocity of the camera and the shot which is summarized by the relation\nExposure \u221d ApertureArea \u00d7 ExposureTime \u00d7 SceneLuminance\nIn other words, the smaller the aperture (giving greater depth of focus), the less light coming in, so the length of time has to be increased (leading to possible blurriness if motion occurs). An example of the use of the law of reciprocity is the Sunny 16 rule which gives a rough estimate for the settings needed to estimate the proper exposure in daylight.\nA camera's aperture is measured by a unitless number called the f-number or f-stop, &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/#, often notated as formula_12, and given by\nformula_13\nwhere formula_14 is the focal length, and formula_15 is the diameter of the entrance pupil. By convention, \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/#\" is treated as a single symbol, and specific values of &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/# are written by replacing the number sign with the value. The two ways to increase the f-stop are to either decrease the diameter of the entrance pupil or change to a longer focal length (in the case of a zoom lens, this can be done by simply adjusting the lens). Higher f-numbers also have a larger depth of field due to the lens approaching the limit of a pinhole camera which is able to focus all images perfectly, regardless of distance, but requires very long exposure times.\nThe field of view that the lens will provide changes with the focal length of the lens. There are three basic classifications based on the relationship to the diagonal size of the film or sensor size of the camera to the focal length of the lens:\nModern zoom lenses may have some or all of these attributes.\nThe absolute value for the exposure time required depends on how sensitive to light the medium being used is (measured by the film speed, or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency). Early photography used media that had very low light sensitivity, and so exposure times had to be long even for very bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the sensitivity through film cameras and digital cameras.\nOther results from physical and geometrical optics apply to camera optics. For example, the maximum resolution capability of a particular camera set-up is determined by the diffraction limit associated with the pupil size and given, roughly, by the Rayleigh criterion.\nAtmospheric optics.\nThe unique optical properties of the atmosphere cause a wide range of spectacular optical phenomena. The blue colour of the sky is a direct result of Rayleigh scattering which redirects higher frequency (blue) sunlight back into the field of view of the observer. Because blue light is scattered more easily than red light, the sun takes on a reddish hue when it is observed through a thick atmosphere, as during a sunrise or sunset. Additional particulate matter in the sky can scatter different colours at different angles creating colourful glowing skies at dusk and dawn. Scattering off of ice crystals and other particles in the atmosphere are responsible for halos, afterglows, coronas, rays of sunlight, and sun dogs. The variation in these kinds of phenomena is due to different particle sizes and geometries.\nMirages are optical phenomena in which light rays are bent due to thermal variations in the refraction index of air, producing displaced or heavily distorted images of distant objects. Other dramatic optical phenomena associated with this include the Novaya Zemlya effect where the sun appears to rise earlier than predicted with a distorted shape. A spectacular form of refraction occurs with a temperature inversion called the Fata Morgana where objects on the horizon or even beyond the horizon, such as islands, cliffs, ships or icebergs, appear elongated and elevated, like \"fairy tale castles\".\nRainbows are the result of a combination of internal reflection and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops. A single reflection off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40\u00b0 to 42\u00b0 with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5\u00b0 to 54\u00b0 with violet on the outside. Because rainbows are seen with the sun 180\u00b0 away from the centre of the rainbow, rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homogeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, any line of sight from Earth must end at the surface of a star and hence the night sky should be completely illuminated and very bright. This contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night sky. \nThe darkness of the night sky is one piece of evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the Big Bang model. That model explains the observed darkness by invoking expansion of the universe, which increases the wavelength of visible light originating from the Big Bang to microwave scale via a process known as redshift. The resulting microwave radiation background has wavelengths much longer (millimeters instead of nanometers), which appear dark to the naked eye. Although he was not the first to describe it, the paradox is popularly named after the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758\u20131840).\nHistory.\nEdward Robert Harrison's \"Darkness at Night: A Riddle of the Universe\" (1987) gives an account of the dark night sky paradox, seen as a problem in the history of science. According to Harrison, the first to conceive of anything like the paradox was Thomas Digges, who was also the first to expound the Copernican system in English and also postulated an infinite universe with infinitely many stars. Kepler also posed the problem in 1610, and the paradox took its mature form in the 18th-century work of Halley and Cheseaux. The paradox is commonly attributed to the German amateur astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who described it in 1823, but Harrison points out that Olbers was far from the first to pose the problem, nor was his thinking about it particularly valuable. Harrison argues that the first to set out a satisfactory resolution of the paradox was Lord Kelvin, in a little known 1901 paper, and that Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"\" (1848) anticipated some qualitative aspects of Kelvin's argument:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe paradox and resolution.\nThe paradox is that a static, infinitely old universe with an infinite number of stars distributed in an infinitely large space would be bright rather than dark.\nThe paradox comes in two forms: flux within the universe and the brightness along any line of sight. The two forms have different resolutions. \nFlux form.\nThe flux form can be shown by dividing the universe into a series of concentric shells, 1 light year thick. A certain number of stars will be in the shell, say, 1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,001 light years away. If the universe is homogeneous at a large scale, then there would be four times as many stars in a second shell between 2,000,000,000 and 2,000,000,001 light years away. However, the second shell is twice as far away, so each star in it would appear one quarter as bright as the stars in the first shell. Thus the total light received from the second shell is the same as the total light received from the first shell. Thus each shell of a given thickness will produce the same net amount of light regardless of how far away it is. That is, the light of each shell adds to the total amount. Thus the more shells, the more light; and with infinitely many shells, there would be an infinitely bright night sky.\nIf intervening gas is added to this infinite model, the light from distant stars will be absorbed. However, that absorption will heat the gas, and over time the gas itself will begin to radiate. With this added feature, the sky would not be infinitely bright, but every point in the sky would still be like the surface of a star. \nThe flux form assumes a static universe age. With a finite age, only a limited volume of the universe contributes to light on Earth, resolving the paradox.\nAnother way to describe the flux version is to suppose that the universe were not expanding and always had the same stellar density; then the temperature of the universe would continually increase as the stars put out more radiation. After something like 1023 years, the universe would reach the average surface temperature of a star. However, the universe is only 13.8 billion (1010) years old, eliminating the paradox.\nLine-of-sight form.\nThe line-of-sight version of the paradox starts by imagining a line in any direction in an infinite Euclidean universe. In such universe, the line would terminate on a star, and thus all of the night sky should be filled with light. This version is known to be correct, but the result is different in our expanding universe governed by general relativity. The termination point is on the surface of last scattering where light from the Big Bang first emerged. This light is dramatically redshifted from the energy similar to star surfaces down to 2.73\u00a0K. Such light is invisible to human observers on Earth.\nRecent observations suggest that the estimated number of galaxies based on direct observations is too low by a factor of ten. However this does not materially alter the resolution of the paradox. A full explanation involves a combination of finite age and redshifts, and UV absorption by hydrogen followed by re-emission in near-IR wavelengths also plays a role.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can also refer to paranormal ideas such as extra-sensory perception and parapsychology.\nThe term occult sciences was used in 16th-century Europe to refer to astrology, alchemy, and natural magic. The term occultism emerged in 19th-century France, among figures such as Antoine Court de G\u00e9belin. It came to be associated with various French esoteric groups connected to \u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi and Papus, and in 1875 was introduced into the English language by the esotericist Helena Blavatsky.\nThroughout the 20th century, the term 'occult' was used idiosyncratically by a range of different authors. By the 21st century the term 'occultism' was commonly employed \u2013including by academic scholars in the field of Western esotericism studies\u2013 to refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. Occultism is thus often used to categorise such esoteric traditions as Qabalah, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Wicca, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, New Age, Thelema and the left-hand path and right-hand path.\nWhile Rosicrucianism is not directly 'occult', various Christian Rosicrucian societies have also engaged in esoteric study and are historically adjacent; for example, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and its members influenced the foundation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\nUse of the term as a nominalized adjective ('the occult') has developed especially since the late twentieth century. In that same period, \"occult\" and \"culture\" were combined to form the neologism \"occulture\".\nEtymology.\nThe occult (from the Latin word \"occultus\"; lit. 'clandestine', 'hidden', 'secret') is \"knowledge of the hidden\". In common usage, \"occult\" refers to \"knowledge of the paranormal\", as opposed to \"knowledge of the measurable\", usually referred to as science. The terms \"esoteric\" and \"arcane\" can also be used to describe the occult, in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural. The term \"occult sciences\" was used in the 16th century to refer to astrology, alchemy, and natural magic.\nThe earliest known usage of the term \"occultism\" is in the French language, as \"l'occultisme\". In this form it appears in A. de Lestrange's article that was published in \"Dictionnaire des mots nouveaux\" (\"Dictionary of new words\") by Jean-Baptiste Richard de Radonvilliers in 1842. However, it was not related, at this point, to the notion of \"\u00c9sot\u00e9risme chr\u00e9tien\", as has been claimed by Hanegraaff, but to describe a political \"system of occulticity\" that was directed against priests and aristocrats.\nIn 1853, the Freemasonic author Jean-Marie Ragon had already used \"occultisme\" in his popular work \"Ma\u00e7onnerie occulte\", relating it to earlier practices that, since the Renaissance, had been termed \"occult sciences\" or \"occult philosophy\", but also to the recent socialist teachings of Charles Fourier. The French esotericist \u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi then used the term in his influential book on ritual magic, \"Dogme et rituel de la haute magie\", first published in 1856. L\u00e9vi was familiar with that work and might have borrowed the term from there. In any case, L\u00e9vi also claimed to be a representative of an older tradition of occult science or occult philosophy. It was from his usage of the term \"occultisme\" that it gained wider usage; according to Faivre, L\u00e9vi was \"the principal exponent of esotericism in Europe and the United States\" at that time. The term \"occultism\" emerged in 19th-century France, where it came to be associated with various French esoteric groups connected to \u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi and Papus.\nThe earliest use of the term \"occultism\" in the English language appears to be in \"A Few Questions to 'Hiraf'\", an 1875 article by Helena Blavatsky, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in the United States who founded the religion of Theosophy. The article was published in the American Spiritualist magazine, \"Spiritual Scientist\".\nVarious twentieth-century writers on the subject used the term \"occultism\" in different ways. Some writers, such as the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno in his \"Theses Against Occultism\", employed the term as a broad synonym for irrationality. In his 1950 book \"L'occultisme\", Robert Amadou used the term as a synonym for esotericism, an approach that the later scholar of esotericism Marco Pasi suggested left the term superfluous. Unlike Amadou, other writers saw occultism and esotericism as different, albeit related, phenomena. In the 1970s, the sociologist Edward A. Tiryakian distinguished between occultism, which he used in reference to practices, techniques, and procedures, and esotericism, which he defined as the religious or philosophical belief systems on which such practices are based. This division was initially adopted by the early academic scholar of esotericism, Antoine Faivre, although he later abandoned it; it has been rejected by most scholars who study esotericism.\nBy the 21st century the term was commonly employed \u2013 including by academic scholars of esotericism \u2013 to refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. Occultism is thus often used to categorise such esoteric traditions as Spiritualism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and New Age.\nA different division was used by the Traditionalist author Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, who used esotericism to describe what he believed was the Traditionalist, inner teaching at the heart of most religions, while occultism was used pejoratively to describe new religions and movements that he disapproved of, such as Spiritualism, Theosophy, and various secret societies. Gu\u00e9non's use of this terminology was adopted by later writers like Serge Hutin and Luc Benoist. As noted by Hanegraaff, Gu\u00e9non's use of these terms are rooted in his Traditionalist beliefs and \"cannot be accepted as scholarly valid\".\nThe term \"occultism\" derives from the older term \"occult\", much as the term \"esotericism\" derives from the older term \"esoteric\". However, the historian of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff stated that it was important to distinguish between the meanings of the term \"occult\" and \"occultism\". Occultism is not a homogenous movement and is widely diverse.\nOver the course of its history, the term \"occultism\" has been used in various different ways. However, in contemporary uses, occultism commonly refers to forms of esotericism that developed in the nineteenth century and their twentieth-century derivations. In a descriptive sense, it has been used to describe forms of esotericism which developed in nineteenth-century France, especially in the Neo-Martinist environment. According to the historian of esotericism Antoine Faivre, it is with the esotericist \u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi that \"the occultist current properly so-called\" first appears. Other prominent French esotericists involved in developing occultism included Papus, Stanislas de Guaita, Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan, Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville, and Jean Bricaud.\nOccult sciences.\nThe idea of occult sciences developed in the sixteenth century. The term usually encompassed three practices\u00a0\u2013 astrology, alchemy, and natural magic\u00a0\u2013 although sometimes various forms of divination were also included rather than being subsumed under natural magic. These were grouped together because, according to the Dutch scholar of hermeticism Wouter Hanegraaff, \"each one of them engaged in a systematic investigation of nature and natural processes, in the context of theoretical frameworks that relied heavily on a belief in occult qualities, virtues or forces.\" Although there are areas of overlap between these different occult sciences, they are separate and in some cases practitioners of one would reject the others as being illegitimate.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, occultism increasingly came to be seen as intrinsically incompatible with the concept of science. From that point on, use of \"occult science(s)\" implied a conscious polemic against mainstream science. Nevertheless, the philosopher and card game historian Michael Dummett, whose analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations using cards were unknown before the 18th century, said that the term \"occult science\" was not misplaced because \"people who believe in the possibility of unveiling the future or of exercising supernormal powers do so because the efficacy of the methods they employ coheres with some systematic conception which they hold of the way the universe functions...however flimsy its empirical basis.\"\nIn his 1871 book \"Primitive Culture\", the anthropologist Edward Tylor used the term \"occult science\" as a synonym for magic.\nOccult qualities.\nOccult qualities are properties that have no known rational explanation; in the Middle Ages, for example, magnetism was considered an occult quality. Aether is another such element. Newton's contemporaries severely criticized his theory that gravity was effected through \"action at a distance\", as occult.\nOccultism.\nIn the English-speaking world, notable figures in the development of occultism included Helena Blavatsky and other figures associated with her Theosophical Society, senior figures in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn like William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, as well as other individuals such as Paschal Beverly Randolph, Emma Hardinge Britten, Arthur Edward Waite, and\u00a0\u2013 in the early twentieth century\u00a0\u2013 Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and Israel Regardie. By the end of the nineteenth century, occultist ideas had also spread into other parts of Europe, such as the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, and the Kingdom of Italy.\nUnlike older forms of esotericism, occultism does not necessarily reject \"scientific progress or modernity\". L\u00e9vi had stressed the need to solve the conflict between science and religion, something that he believed could be achieved by turning to what he thought was the ancient wisdom found in magic. The French scholar of Western esotericism Antoine Faivre noted that rather than outright accepting \"the triumph of scientism\", occultists sought \"an alternative solution\", trying to integrate \"scientific progress or modernity\" with \"a global vision that will serve to make the vacuousness of materialism more apparent\". The Dutch scholar of hermeticism Wouter Hanegraaff remarked that occultism was \"essentially an attempt to adapt esotericism\" to the \"disenchanted world\", a post-Enlightenment society in which growing scientific discovery had eradicated the \"dimension of irreducible mystery\" previously present. In doing so, he noted, occultism distanced itself from the \"traditional esotericism\" which accepted the premise of an \"enchanted\" world. According to the British historian of Western esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, occultist groups typically seek \"proofs and demonstrations by recourse to scientific tests or terminology\".\nIn his work about L\u00e9vi, the German historian of religion Julian Strube has argued that the occultist wish for a \"synthesis\" of religion, science, and philosophy directly resulted from the context of contemporary socialism and progressive Catholicism. Similar to spiritualism, but in declared opposition to it, the emergence of occultism should thus be seen within the context of radical social reform, which was often concerned with establishing new forms of \"scientific religion\" while at the same time propagating the revival of an ancient tradition of \"true religion\". Indeed, the emergence of both modern esotericism and socialism in July Monarchy France have been inherently intertwined.\nAnother feature of occultists is that\u00a0\u2013 unlike earlier esotericists\u00a0\u2013 they often openly distanced themselves from Christianity, in some cases (like that of Crowley) even adopting explicitly anti-Christian stances. This reflected how pervasive the influence of secularisation had been on all areas of European society. In rejecting Christianity, these occultists sometimes turned towards pre-Christian belief systems and embraced forms of Modern Paganism, while others instead took influence from the religions of Asia, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. In various cases, certain occultists did both. Another characteristic of these occultists was the emphasis that they placed on \"the spiritual realization of the individual\", an idea that would strongly influence the twentieth-century New Age and Human Potential Movement. This spiritual realization was encouraged both through traditional Western 'occult sciences' like alchemy and ceremonial magic, but by the start of the twentieth century had also begun to include practices drawn from non-Western contexts, such as yoga.\nAlthough occultism is distinguished from earlier forms of esotericism, many occultists have also been involved in older esoteric currents. For instance, occultists like Fran\u00e7ois-Charles Barlet and Rudolf Steiner were also theosophers, adhering to the ideas of the early modern Lutheran thinker Jakob Bohme, and seeking to integrate ideas from Bohmian theosophy and occultism. It has been noted, however, that this distancing from the Theosophical Society should be understood in the light of polemical identity formations among esotericists towards the end of the nineteenth century.\nEtic uses of the term.\nIn the mid-1990s, a new definition of \"occultism\" was put forth by Wouter Hanegraaff. According to Hanegraaff, the term \"occultism\" can be used not only for the nineteenth-century groups which openly self-described using that term but can also be used in reference to \"the \"type\" of esotericism that they represent\".\nSeeking to define occultism so that the term would be suitable \"as an etic category\" for scholars, Hanegraaff devised the following definition: \"a category in the study of religions, which comprises \"all attempts by esotericists to come to terms with a disenchanted world or, alternatively, by people in general to make sense of esotericism from the perspective of a disenchanted secular world\". Hanegraaff noted that this etic usage of the term would be independent of emic usages of the term employed by occultists and other esotericists themselves.\nIn this definition, occultism covers many esoteric currents that have developed from the mid-nineteenth century onward, including Spiritualism, Theosophy, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and the New Age. Employing this etic understanding of \"occultism\", Hanegraaff argued that its development could begin to be seen in the work of the Swedish esotericist Emanuel Swedenborg and in the Mesmerist movement of the eighteenth century, although added that occultism only emerged in \"fully-developed form\" as Spiritualism, a movement that developed in the United States during the mid-nineteenth century.\nMarco Pasi suggested that the use of Hanegraaff's definition might cause confusion by presenting a group of nineteenth-century esotericists who called themselves \"occultists\" as just one part of a broader category of esotericists whom scholars would call \"occultists\".\nFollowing these discussions, Julian Strube argued that L\u00e9vi and other contemporary authors who would now be regarded as esotericists developed their ideas not against the background of an esoteric tradition in the first place. Rather, L\u00e9vi's notion of occultism emerged in the context of highly influential radical socialist movements and widespread progressive, so-called neo-Catholic ideas. This further complicates Hanegraaff's characteristics of occultism, since, throughout the nineteenth century, they apply to these reformist movements rather than to a supposed group of esotericists.\nModern usage.\nThe term \"occult\" has also been used as a substantivized adjective as \"the occult\", a term that has been particularly widely used among journalists and sociologists. This term was popularised by the publication of Colin Wilson's 1971 book \"\". This term has been used as an \"intellectual waste-basket\" into which a wide array of beliefs and practices have been placed because they do not fit readily into the categories of religion or science. According to Hanegraaff, \"the occult\" is a category into which gets placed a range of beliefs from \"spirits or fairies to parapsychological experiments, from UFO-abductions to Oriental mysticism, from vampire legends to channelling, and so on\".\nOcculture.\nThe neologism \"occulture\" used within the industrial music scene of the late twentieth century was probably coined by one of its central figures, the musician and occultist Genesis P-Orridge. The scholar of religion Christopher Partridge used the term in an academic sense, stating that occulture was \"the new spiritual environment in the West; the reservoir feeding new spiritual springs; the soil in which new spiritualities are growing\".\nOccultism and technology.\nRecently scholars have offered perspectives on the occult as intertwined with media and technology. Examples include the work of film and media theorist Jeffrey Sconce and religious studies scholar John Durham Peters, both of whom suggest that occult movements historically utilize media and apparatuses as tools to reveal hidden aspects of reality or laws of nature. Erik Davis in his book \"Techgnosis\" gives an overview of occultism both ancient and modern from the perspective of cybernetics and information technologies. Philosopher Eugene Thacker discusses Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\" in his book \"In The Dust Of This Planet\", where he shows how the horror genre utilizes occult themes to reveal hidden realities.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It borders Texas to the south and west, Kansas to the north, Missouri to the northeast, Arkansas to the southeast, New Mexico to the west, and Colorado to the northwest. Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.\nThe state's name is derived from the Choctaw words , 'people' and , which translates as 'red'. Oklahoma is also known informally by its nickname, \"The Sooner State\", in reference to the Sooners, American settlers who staked their claims in formerly American Indian-owned lands until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 authorized the Land Rush of 1889 opening the land to settlement.\nWith ancient mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone to severe weather. Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American cultural regions. Historically, it served as a government-sanctioned territory for American Indians moved from east of the Mississippi River, a route for cattle drives from Texas and related regions, and a destination for Southern settlers. There are currently 25 . According to the 2020 U.S. census, 14.2 percent of Oklahomans identify as American Indians, the highest Indigenous population by percentage in any state.\nA major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Oklahoma\" comes from the Choctaw language phrase , 'people', and , translated as 'red'. Choctaw Nation Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1865 during treaty negotiations with the federal US government on the use of Indian Territory. He envisioned an all exclusive American Indian state controlled by the United States bureau of Indian Affairs. A painting of the 1865 Council now hangs in the Oklahoma Senate. \"Oklahoma\" later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after that area was opened to American settlers.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian.\nIndigenous peoples were present in what is now Oklahoma by the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (including Teyas and Escanjaques and Tawakoni), Tonkawa, and Caddo (including Kichai) lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern Plains villagers lived in the central and west of the state, with a subgroup, the Panhandle culture people, living in the panhandle region. Caddoan Mississippian culture peoples lived in the eastern part of the state. Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, was a major Mississippian mound complex that flourished between AD 850 and 1450. Plains Apache people settled in the Southern Plains and in Oklahoma between 1300 and 1500.\nEuropean exploration and colonization.\nThe expedition of Spaniard Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado traveled through the area in 1541, but French explorers claimed the area in the early 18th century. By the 18th century, Comanche and Kiowa entered the region from the west and Quapaw and Osage peoples moved into what is now eastern Oklahoma. French colonists claimed the region until 1803, when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. The territory was a part of the Arkansas Territory from 1819 until 1828.\n19th century.\nDuring the 19th century, the U.S. federal government forcibly removed tens of thousands of American Indians from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported them to the area including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to be removed from the Southeastern United States. The phrase \"Trail of Tears\" originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal.\nSeventeen thousand Cherokees and 2,000 of their black slaves were deported. The area, already occupied by Osage and Quapaw tribes, was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Americans. By 1890, more than 30 Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or \"Indian Country\".\nAll Five Civilized Tribes signed treaties with the Confederate military during the American Civil War. The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war. Slavery in Indian Territory was not abolished until 1866.\nBetween 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory. In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory.\nAs white settlers arrived in Indian Territory and demanded for land owned and guaranteed to Indian tribes by treaties, the U.S. government responded by enacting the Dawes Act in 1887 and the Curtis Act of 1898. The acts abolished tribal governments, eliminated tribal ownership of land, and allotted of land to each head of an Indian family. An objective of the acts was the forced assimilation of Indians into white society. Land not allotted to individual Indians was owned by the U.S. government and sold or distributed to settlers and railroads. The proceeds of the land sales were used to educate Indian children and advance the policy of assimilation. As a result of the two acts, about one-half of the land previously owned by Indian tribes was owned by whites by 1900. Moreover, much of the land allotted to individual Indian heads of families became white-owned. Allottees often sold or were fraudulently deprived of their land.\nThe acquisition of tribal lands by the U.S. government led to land runs, also called \"land rushes,\" from 1887 and 1895. Major land runs, including the Land Rush of 1889, opened up millions of acres of formerly tribal lands to white settlement. The \"rushes\" began at a precise times as each prospective settler literally raced with other prospective settlers to claim ownership of of land under the Homestead Act of 1862. Usually land was claimed by settlers on a first come, first served basis. Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time were said to have been crossing the border \"sooner\", leading to the term \"sooners\", which eventually became the state's official nickname. George Washington Steele was appointed the first governor of the territory of Oklahoma in 1890.\n20th century.\nAttempts to create an all-Indian state named \"Oklahoma\" and a later attempt to create an all-Indian state named \"Sequoyah\" failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On June 16, 1906, Congress enacted a statute authorizing the people of the Oklahoma and Indian Territories (as well what would become the states of Arizona and New Mexico) to form a constitution and state government in order to be admitted as a state. On November 16, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt issued Presidential Proclamation no. , establishing Oklahoma as the 46th state in the Union.\nThe new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry, as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the \"Oil Capital of the World\" for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy. In 1927, Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the \"Father of Route 66\", began the campaign to create U.S. Route 66. Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo, Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway 66, Avery spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to oversee the planning of Route 66, based in his hometown of Tulsa.\nIn late September 1918, the first cases of the Spanish flu appeared in Oklahoma. Although public health authorities statewide had some early indication that the disease being reported on the East coast had traveled westward, the turmoil caused by the rapid increase in cases in Oklahoma quickly overwhelmed both health workers and local governing bodies. In Oklahoma City, shortages of both supplies and personnel were mitigated, in part, by the mobilization of the American Red Cross. Rough estimates based on contemporary reports indicate that approximately 100,000 people fell ill with the disease before the pandemic ebbed in 1919. Of those 100,000 cases, it is estimated that around 7,500 proved fatal, placing total mortality rates for the state at roughly 7.5%.\nOklahoma also has a rich African-American history. Many Black towns, founded by the Freedmen of the Five Tribes during Reconstruction, thrived in the early 20th century with the arrival of Black Exodusters who migrated from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged Black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. McCabe discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-Black state.\nBy the early 20th century, the Greenwood district of Tulsa was one of the most prosperous African-American communities in the United States. Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation since before the start of the 20th century, but Tulsa's Black residents had created a thriving area.\nSocial tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa race massacre occurred in 1921, with White mobs attacking Black people and carrying out a pogrom in Greenwood. In one of the costliest episodes of racist violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in the destruction of 35 city blocks, $1.8 million in property damage, and an estimated death toll of between 75 and 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.\nDuring the 1930s, parts of the state began to suffer from the consequences of poor farming practices. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, abnormally high temperatures, and most notably, severe dust storms sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.\nSoil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state, leading to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. As of 2024, Oklahoma had more than 4,700 dams, about 20% of all dams in the U.S.\nIn 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of the most destructive act of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.\n21st century.\nOn May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.\nOn July 9, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States determined in \"McGirt v. Oklahoma\" that the reservations of the Five Tribes, comprising much of Eastern Oklahoma, were never disestablished by Congress and thus are still \"Indian Country\" for the purposes of criminal law.\nLater decisions by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals also found the Quapaw Nation, Ottawa Tribe, Peoria Tribe, and Miami Tribe also had existing reservations. The Osage Nation is awaiting for a possible appellate decision after a district judge had ruled that the Osage reservation was disestablished.\nGeography.\nOklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of , with of land and of water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bordered on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas.\nBorders.\nOklahoma's border with Kansas was defined as the 37th Parallel in the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act. This was disputed with the Cherokee and Osage Nations, which claimed their border extended North of this line and could not be part of the Kansas Territory. This was resolved in 1870 with the Drum Creek Treaty, which reestablished Kansas's southern border as the 37th parallel. This also applied to the then No-Man's Land that became the Oklahoma Panhandle.\nThe Oklahoma-Texas border consists of the Red River of the South in the south and the 100th meridian west as the western border between Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. These were first established in the 1819 Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty between the United States and Spain.\nThe Oklahoma panhandle was originally part of the Panhandle of the Republic of Texas, but when Texas joined the Union as a slave state, it could not retain any lands north of 36 degrees 30 minutes, as specified in the Missouri Compromise. The Panhandle existed as a no-man's land until 1907 when Oklahoma acquired the territory upon gaining statehood.\nOklahoma's Eastern border is divided between Missouri and Arkansas. The Missouri-Oklahoma border is defined as the Meridian passing through the Kawsmouth, where the Kansas River meets the Missouri River. This is the same Meridian as the Kansas-Missouri border.\nThe Oklahoma-Arkansas border was originally defined by two lines: the borders between Arkansas and the Cherokee and Choctaw Reservations. This formed two diagonal lines meeting at the western edge of Fort Smith Arkansas, with one line running northeast from the Red River and the other running southeast from the Oklahoma-Arkansas-Missouri border. The Choctaw-Arkansas border was established in the 1820 Treaty of Doak's Sand, and later refined in the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. These treaties left a 57-acre exclave of the Choctaw reservation bounded by Arkansas, the Arkansas River and the Poteau River. This became the site of a smuggling camp called \"Coke Hill\", noted mostly for its importance in cocaine smuggling.\nAfter Petitioning congress to hand over jurisdiction, the 57 acres was given to Arkansas in 1905. The 1985 US Supreme Court Case Oklahoma v. Arkansas decided the land would remain Arkansas, even though the Choctaw had not been notified or asked about the territory being handed over. Therefore, the Poteau River serves as the Oklahoma-Arkansas boundary for approximately 1 mile, reducing the Choctaw Reservation and later Oklahoma by 57 acres as established in the treaties of the early 1800s.\nTopography.\nOklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary. Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at above sea level, situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel, which dips to above sea level.\nAmong the most geographically diverse states, Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions, with 11 in its borders\u2014more per square mile than in any other state. Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare, relic species.\nOklahoma has four primary mountain ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita Mountains, and the Ozark Mountains. Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains are the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians. A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the state's eastern border, The Oklahoma Tourism &amp; Recreation Department regards Cavanal Hill as the world's tallest hill; at , it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot.\nThe semi-arid high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests; the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains. Partial plains interrupted by small, sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma; transitional prairie and oak savannas cover the central portion of the state. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction.\nMore than 500 named creeks and rivers make up Oklahoma's waterways, and with 200 lakes created by dams, it holds the nation's highest number of artificial reservoirs. Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas Rivers, though the Lee and Little Rivers also contain significant drainage basins.\nFlora and fauna.\nDue to Oklahoma's location at the confluence of many geographic regions, Oklahoma's climatic regions have a high rate of biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species, including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina, and Texas live oak.\nMarshlands, cypress forests, and mixtures of shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, blue palmetto, and deciduous forests dominate the state's southeastern quarter, while mixtures of largely post oak, elm, red cedar (\"Juniperus virginiana\"), and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma.\nOklahoma has populations of white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie-chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, and some of the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, gray fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator.\nProtected lands.\nOklahoma has fifty-one state parks, six national parks or protected regions, two national protected forests or grasslands, and a network of wildlife preserves and conservation areas. Six percent of the state's of forest is public land, including the western portions of the Ouachita National Forest, the largest and oldest national forest in the Southern United States.\nWith , the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in north-central Oklahoma is the largest protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem that encompasses only ten percent of its former land area, once covering fourteen states. In addition, the Black Kettle National Grassland covers of prairie in southwestern Oklahoma. The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is the oldest and largest of nine National Wildlife Refuges in the state and was founded in 1901, encompassing .\nOf Oklahoma's federally protected parks or recreational sites, the Chickasaw National Recreation Area is the largest, with . Other sites include the Santa Fe and Trail of Tears national historic trails, the Fort Smith and Washita Battlefield national historic sites, and the Oklahoma City National Memorial.\nClimate.\nOklahoma is in a humid subtropical region that lies in a transition zone between semiarid further to the west, humid continental to the north, and humid subtropical to the east and southeast. Most of Oklahoma lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year\u2014one of the highest rates in the world.\nBecause of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds, weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances, and they can change drastically in a short time. On November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached (the record high for that date), then a cold front of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state, causing the temperature to reach (the record low for that date) by midnight. This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour.\nThe humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\") of central, southern, and eastern Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Traveling westward, the climate transitions progressively toward a semiarid zone (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\") in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward, less frequently touched by southern moisture. Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west. Areas in the southeast average an annual temperature of and an annual rainfall of generally over and up to . Areas of the higher-elevation panhandle average , with annual rainfall under .\nOver almost all of Oklahoma, winter is the driest season. Average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring, to a peak in May, the wettest month over most of the state, with its frequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activity. Early June can still be wet, but most years see a marked decrease in rainfall during June and early July. Mid-summer (July and August) represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma, with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years.\nSevere drought is common in the hottest summers, such as those of 1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and highs well over . Average precipitation rises again from September to mid-October, representing a secondary wetter season, then declines from late October through December.\nThe entire state frequently experiences temperatures above or below , though below-zero temperatures are rare in south-central and southeastern Oklahoma. Snowfall ranges from an average of less than in the south to just over on the border of Colorado in the panhandle. Oklahoma is home to the Storm Prediction Center, the National Severe Storms Laboratory, the Warning Decision Training Division, and the Radar Operations Center, all part of the National Weather Service and in Norman.\nCities and towns.\nOklahoma had 598 incorporated places in 2010, including four cities over 100,000 in population and 43 over 10,000. Two of the fifty largest cities in the United States are in Oklahoma, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Sixty-five percent of Oklahomans live within their metropolitan areas, or spheres of economic and social influence defined by the United States Census Bureau as a metropolitan statistical area. Oklahoma City, the state's capital and largest city, had the largest metropolitan area in the state in 2020, with 1,425,695 people. The metropolitan area of Tulsa had 1,015,331 residents. Between 2000 and 2010, the leading cities in population growth were Blanchard (172.4%), Elgin (78.2%), Jenks (77.0%), Piedmont (56.7%), Bixby (56.6%), and Owasso (56.3%).\nIn descending order of population, Oklahoma's largest cities in 2010 were: Oklahoma City (579,999, +14.6%), Tulsa (391,906, \u22120.3%), Norman (110,925, +15.9%), Broken Arrow (98,850, +32.0%), Lawton (96,867, +4.4%), Edmond (81,405, +19.2%), Moore (55,081, +33.9%), Midwest City (54,371, +0.5%), Enid (49,379, +5.0%), and Stillwater (45,688, +17.0%). Of the state's ten largest cities, three are outside the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and only Lawton has a metropolitan statistical area of its own as designated by the United States Census Bureau, though the metropolitan statistical area of Fort Smith, Arkansas extends into the state.\nUnder Oklahoma law, municipalities are divided into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have legislative, judicial, and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose between a mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager, or strong mayor form of government, while towns operate through an elected officer system.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom a 1920 U.S. census population of 2,028,283, Oklahoma's population has continued to increase. At the 2010 census, its population was 3,751,675. The 2020 census revealed its population to be was 3,959,353, an 5.5% increase since 2010. A 2022 American Community Survey estimate found that the population had surpassed 4 million residents for the first time. Among the states of the South Central region, Oklahoma had the second-largest population increase from 2010 to 2020, behind Texas.\nIn 2018, of Oklahoma's total resident population, approximately 236,882 were immigrants, making up 6% of Oklahoma's population at the time. Most of its immigrant population came from Mexico (45%), Vietnam (5%), India (5%), Germany (3%), and Guatemala (3%). In the state, 246,550 residents were native-born Americans who had at least one immigrant parent.

Life expectancy for the state as a whole was 76.0 years.\nImpact of COVID-19.\nAs of December 22, 2022, Oklahoma has been impacted more by the COVID-19 pandemic (2020\u20132023) than the average U.S. state. Statistics for the U.S. as a whole are 331 deaths per 100,000 population with 68 percent of the population fully vaccinated. The comparable statistics for Oklahoma are 405 deaths per 100,000 population with 59 percent of the population fully vaccinated; 16,041 deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded in Oklahoma. A wide variation in deaths from COVID-19 exists among Oklahoma counties. Greer County recorded the highest death rate of .00753 (753 deaths per 100,000 residents). Payne County recorded the lowest death rate of .00231 (231 deaths per 100,000 residents).\nMedia.\nOklahoma City and Tulsa are the 45th- and 61st-largest media markets in the United States as ranked by Nielsen Media Research. The state's third-largest media market, Lawton-Wichita Falls, Texas, is ranked 149th nationally by the agency. Broadcast television in Oklahoma began in 1949 when KFOR-TV (then WKY-TV) in Oklahoma City and KOTV-TV in Tulsa began broadcasting a few months apart. Currently, all major American broadcast networks have affiliated television stations in the state.\nOklahoma has two primary newspapers. \"The Oklahoman\", based in Oklahoma City, is the largest newspaper in the state and 54th-largest in the nation by circulation, with a weekday readership of 138,493 and a Sunday readership of 202,690. The \"Tulsa World\", the second-most widely circulated newspaper in Oklahoma and 79th in the nation, holds a Sunday circulation of 132,969 and a weekday readership of 93,558. Oklahoma's first newspaper was established in 1844, called the \"Cherokee Advocate\", and was written in both Cherokee and English. In 2006, there were more than 220 newspapers in the state, including 177 with weekly publications and 48 with daily publications.\nOklahoma's first radio station, WKY in Oklahoma City, began broadcasting in 1920. In 2006, there were more than 500 radio stations in Oklahoma broadcasting with various local or nationally owned networks. Five universities in Oklahoma operate non-commercial, public radio stations/networks.\nOklahoma has a few ethnic-oriented TV stations broadcasting in Spanish and Asian languages, and there is some Native American programming. TBN, a Christian religious television network, has a studio in Tulsa, and built its first entirely TBN-owned affiliate in Oklahoma City in 1980.\nTransportation.\nTransportation in Oklahoma is generated by an anchor system of Interstate Highways, inter-city rail lines, airports, inland ports, and mass transit networks. Situated along an integral point in the Interstate Highway system, Oklahoma contains three three primary and four auxiliary Interstate Highways. In Oklahoma City, Interstate\u00a035 (I-35) intersects with I-44 and I-40, forming one of the most important intersections along the United States highway system.\nMore than of roads make up the state's major highway skeleton, including state-operated highways, ten turnpikes or major toll roads, and the longest drivable stretch of Route 66 in the nation. In 2008, I-44 in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma's busiest highway, with a daily traffic volume of 123,300 cars. In 2010, the state had the nation's third-highest number of bridges classified as structurally deficient, with nearly 5,212 bridges in disrepair, including 235 National Highway System bridges.\nOklahoma's largest commercial airport is Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, averaging a yearly passenger count of more than 3.5 million (1.7 million boardings) in 2010. Tulsa International Airport, the state's second-largest commercial airport, served more than 1.3 million boardings in 2010. Between the two, six airlines operate in Oklahoma. In terms of traffic, R. L. Jones Jr. (Riverside) Airport in Tulsa is the state's busiest airport, with 335,826 takeoffs and landings in 2008. Oklahoma has more than 150 public-use airports.\nOklahoma is connected to the nation's rail network via Amtrak's \"Heartland Flyer\", its only regional passenger rail line. It currently stretches from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth, Texas. Lawmakers began seeking funding in early 2007 to connect the \"Heartland Flyer\" to Tulsa, but nothing came of this. In June 2023, following studies and negotiations, Oklahoma and Kansas state officials began seeking federal approval and funding to extend the \"Heartland Flyer\" from Oklahoma City to Newton, Kansas. The two locations are currently connected by an Amtrak Thruway Bus route that includes a stop in Wichita, Kansas. In November 2023, KDOT said the service would start in 2029 if approved, but could begin sooner were the project to be fast tracked.\nTwo inland ports on rivers serve Oklahoma: the Port of Muskogee and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa. The Tulsa Port of Catoosa is one of the United States' most inland international ports, at head of navigation of the McClellan\u2013Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which connects barge traffic from Tulsa and Muskogee to the Mississippi River. The port ships over two million tons of goods annually and is a designated foreign trade zone.\nLaw and government.\nOklahoma is a constitutional republic with a government modeled after the federal government of the United States, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Oklahoma has 77 counties with jurisdiction over most local government functions within each respective domain, five congressional districts, and a voting base with a majority in the Republican Party. State officials are elected by plurality voting in the state of Oklahoma.\nOklahoma has capital punishment as a legal sentence. Between 1976 and mid-2011, Oklahoma had the highest per capita execution rate in the nation. Authorized methods of execution include the electric chair, the gas chamber and the firing squad.\nIn a 2020 study, Oklahoma was ranked as the 14th most difficult state for citizens to vote in. In May 2020, it became the first state to enact an anti-red flag law, prohibiting the acceptance of any grants or funding to enact red flag laws. Abortion in Oklahoma is illegal in nearly all circumstances.\nState government.\nThe Legislature of Oklahoma consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts any one person to twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.\nOklahoma's judicial branch consists of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serve one county. The Oklahoma judiciary contains two independent courts: a Court of Impeachment for impeachment trials, and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases. This split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas. Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.\nThe executive branch consists of the governor, their staff, and other elected officials. The principal head of government, the governor is the chief executive of the Oklahoma executive branch. He serves as the ex officio Commander-in-chief of the Oklahoma National Guard when not called into Federal use and reserving the power to veto bills passed through the legislature. The responsibilities of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring state laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved.\nLocal government.\nOklahoma is divided into 77 counties that govern locally, each headed by a three-member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, court clerk, treasurer, and sheriff. Each municipality operates as a separate and independent local government with executive, legislative and judicial power. County governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, and have executive power but no legislative or judicial power.\nBoth county and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction. Other local government units include school districts, technology center districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts.\nThirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While Indian reservations are typical in most of the United States, they are not present in Oklahoma. Tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction, and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.\nOklahoma has 11 substate districts, including the two large Councils of Governments, INCOG in Tulsa (Indian Nations Council of Governments) and ACOG (Association of Central Oklahoma Governments).\nNational politics.\nDuring the first half-century of statehood, Oklahoma was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections, 1920 and 1928. After the 1948 election, the state turned firmly Republican. Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election since 1952: Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide victory.\nEvery single county in Oklahoma has been won by the Republican candidate in each election since 2004. Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any counties in 2008. Oklahoma City was the largest city in the United States carried by Republican Donald Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.\nDemocrats are strongest in urban areas, such as the inner parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as well as the college towns of Norman and Stillwater, and areas which are most heavily African American. The Democrats once held dominance in the eastern part of Oklahoma and Little Dixie before the area gradually shifted Republican in the late 2000s. As of the 2020 election, Native American voters, 16% of the state's population, are split, with urban populations supporting the Democrats, and rural reservation populaces favoring the Republicans.\nFollowing the 2000 census, the Oklahoma delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one congressional district. Oklahoma has had an all-Republican congressional delegation since 2021 and previously from 2013 to 2019.\nState symbols.\nState law codifies Oklahoma's state emblems and honorary positions. The Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for special events and to benefit organizations. In 2012 the House passed HCR 1024, which would change the state motto from \"Labor Omnia Vincit\" to \"Oklahoma\u2014In God We Trust!\". The author of the resolution stated a constituent researched the Oklahoma Constitution and found no \"official\" vote regarding \"Labor Omnia Vincit\", therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is used to refer to them collectively, in contrast to other British universities, and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status or elitism.\nOrigins.\nAlthough both universities were founded more than eight centuries ago, the term \"Oxbridge\" is relatively recent. In William Makepeace Thackeray's novel \"Pendennis\", published in 1850, the main character attends the fictional Boniface College, Oxbridge. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first recorded use of the word was by Virginia Woolf, who, citing William Makepeace Thackeray, referenced it in her 1929 extended essay \"A Room of One's Own\". The term was used in the \"Times Educational Supplement\" in 1957, and the following year in \"Universities Quarterly\".\nWhen expanded, the universities are almost always referred to as \"Oxford and Cambridge\", the order in which they were founded. A notable exception is Tokyo's \"Cambridge and Oxford Society\"; this probably arises from the fact that the Cambridge Club was founded there first, and also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905.\nMeaning.\nIn addition to being a collective term, \"Oxbridge\" is often used as shorthand for characteristics the two institutions share:\nCriticism.\nThe word \"Oxbridge\" may also be used pejoratively: as a descriptor of social class (referring to the professional classes who dominated the intake of both universities at the beginning of the twentieth century), as shorthand for an elite that \"continues to dominate Britain's political and cultural establishment\" and a parental attitude that \"continues to see UK higher education through an Oxbridge prism\", or to describe a \"pressure-cooker\" culture that attracts and then fails to support overachievers \"who are vulnerable to a kind of self-inflicted stress that can all too often become unbearable\" and high-flying state school students who find \"coping with the workload very difficult in terms of balancing work and life\" and \"feel socially out of [their] depth\".\nThe Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge \"recruit\" disproportionately from eight schools (Westminster School, Eton College, Hills Road Sixth Form College, St Paul's School, Peter Symonds College, St Paul's Girls' School, King's College School, and Magdalen College School). They examined published admissions data from 2015 to 2017 and found that, out of the 19,851 places during the three years, the eight schools accounted for 1,310, whereas 2,900 other schools with historically few admissions to Oxbridge accounted for 1,220.\nRelated terms.\nOther portmanteaus have been coined that extend the term \"Oxbridge\", with different degrees of recognition:\nThe term \"Loxbridge\" is also used referring to the golden triangle of London, Oxford, and Cambridge. It was also adopted as the name of the Ancient History conference now known as \"AMPAH\".\nDoxbridge is another example of this, referring to Durham, Oxford and Cambridge. \"Doxbridge\" was also used for an annual inter-collegiate sports tournament between some of the colleges of Durham, Oxford, Cambridge and York.\n\"Woxbridge\" is the name of the annual conference between the business schools of Warwick, Oxford and Cambridge.\nWhen the University of St Andrews topped the 2023 UK universities ranking in \"The Guardian\", the top three institutions were labelled \"Stoxbridge\" to reflect the new order.\nThackeray's \"Pendennis\", which introduced the term \"Oxbridge\", also introduced \"Camford\" as another combination of the university names \u2013 \"he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem\" \u2013 but this term has never achieved the same degree of usage as \"Oxbridge\". Camford is, however, used as the name of a fictional university city in the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Adventure of the Creeping Man\" (1923).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22492", "revid": "23483242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22492", "title": "Osman I", "text": "First sultan of the Ottoman Empire\nOsman I or as he is known, Osman Gazi or Osman Bey.(; or \"Osman Gazi;\" died 1323/4) was the eponymous founder of the Ottoman Empire (first known as a beylik or emirate). While initially a small Turkoman principality during Osman's lifetime, his beylik transformed into a vast empire in the centuries after his death. It existed until 1922 shortly after the end of World War I, when the sultanate was abolished.\nOwing to the scarcity of historical sources dating from his lifetime, very little factual information about Osman has survived. Not a single written source survives from Osman's reign, and the Ottomans did not record the history of his life until the fifteenth century, more than a hundred years after his death. Because of this, historians find it very challenging to differentiate between fact and myth in the many stories told about him. One historian has even gone so far as to declare it impossible, describing the period of Osman's life as a \"black hole\".\nAccording to later Ottoman tradition, Osman's ancestors were descendants of the Kay\u0131 tribe of Oghuz Turks. However, many scholars of the early Ottomans regard it as a later fabrication meant to reinforce dynastic legitimacy.\nThe Ottoman principality was one of many Anatolian beyliks that emerged in the second half of the thirteenth century. Situated in the region of Bithynia in the north of Asia Minor, Osman's principality found itself particularly well placed to launch attacks on the vulnerable Byzantine Empire, which his descendants would eventually go on to conquer.\nName.\nSome scholars have argued that Osman's original name was Turkish, probably Atman or Ataman, and was only later changed to \"\u02bfOsm\u0101n\", of Arabic origin. The earliest Byzantine sources, including Osman's contemporary and Greek historian George Pachymeres, spell his name as \u1f08\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd (Atouman) or \u1f08\u03c4\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd (Atman), whereas Greek sources regularly render both the Arabic form \"\u02bfUthm\u0101n\" and the Turkish version \"\u02bfOsm\u0101n\" with \u03b8, \u03c4\u03b8, or \u03c4\u03c3. An early Arabic source mentioning him also used \"\u0637\" (\"\u1e6d\") rather than \"\u062b\" (\"th\") in one instance. Osman thus could have adopted the more prestigious Muslim name later in his life. Turkish historian Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k argued that the hypotheses that Osman was in fact named Ataman (per George Pachymeres), and that he came from the \"Dasht-i Qipchaq\" north of the Black Sea, are both remote possibilities.\nArab scholars like Shihab al-Umari and Ibn Khaldun used the name Othman, while Ibn Battuta, who visited the region during Orhan's reign, called him Osmanc\u0131k (also spelled Othm\u0101njiq or Osmanjiq). The suffix -c\u0131k (or -cuk), indicates the diminutive in Turkish, thus he was known by the name of Osmancik, which means \"Osman the Little\", to differentiate between him and the third Rashidun Caliph \"Uthman the Great\".\nFrom the 16th century until well into the 18th century, his name was written as \"Ottoman\", \"Otoman\" or \"Othoman\" in English (Early Modern English). The adjective \"Ottoman\" comes from this name.\nHistorical background.\nMost sources agree that the Ottoman Turks belonged to the Kay\u0131 Oghuz Turkic clan, who, according to Ottoman traditions, fled their native homeland in Central Asia during the early 13th century due to the Mongol invasions. The clan settled in Anatolia, in a region belonging to the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm. Other sources claim that the Kay\u0131 clan moved to Anatolia two centuries earlier than the previously mentioned date, alongside the Seljuks, when they left Transoxiana to Khurasan around 1040 to reside near the city of Merv. Then, the Kay\u0131 clan moved towards eastern Anatolia after 1071 CE, where it displaced other Turkic clans. Later, it became involved in the army of Sultan Kayqubad I and fought against the Khwarazmians, Mongols and Byzantines, who were raiding Seljuk lands. According to several sources, the Kay\u0131 warriors were known for filling first lines in battles, and their fighting skills and bravery were among the major factors the Seljuks were victorious in many battles. This fact prompted Sultan Kayqubad to appoint Ertu\u011frul, the clan's Emir, as a \"Moqaddam\" (Lieutenant), and to reward the Kay\u0131s some fertile lands near Ankara, where they settled and remained in the service of the Sultan for several years.\nLater, Ertu\u011frul was granted dominion over the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct in northwestern Anatolia on the Byzantine frontier. He also obtained the title of \"U\u00e7 beyli\u011fi\" or \"U\u00e7 bey\" (literally: marcher-lord). Granting this title was in line with the traditions of the Seljuk Sultanate, which is rewarding any clan chieftain who rises to power and is joined by a number of smaller clans, the title of marcher-lord. However, Ertu\u011frul had far-reaching political ambitions. He sought to expand beyond the lands rewarded to him. Thus, he started raiding the Byzantine possessions in the name of the Sultan successfully conquering several towns and villages, and slowly expanding his dominion during the half of the century he spent as a Seljuk governor. In 1281, Ertu\u011frul died at nearly 90 years of age.\nBirth, lineage, and early years.\nSources about Osman's early life.\nThe exact date of Osman's birth is unknown, and very little is known about his early life and origins due to the scarcity of sources and the many myths and legends which came to be told about him by the Ottomans in later centuries. The reason for the lack of information available about this stage of Osman's life is due to the fact that the oldest-known source about this time period was written about a hundred years after Osman's death. Among these sources are: \"Destan-\u0131 Tevarih-i Al-i Osman\" (The Oral history of the Ottomans), written in the 14th century by the Ottoman poet and court physician T\u00e2cedd\u00een \u0130br\u00e2h\u00eem bin H\u0131z\u00eer better known as Ahmed\u00ee (1334\u20131413), \"Behcet\u00fc't-Tev\u00e2r\u00eeh\" (The Joy of histories) by \u015e\u00fckrullah (d. 1464), and \"Tevarih-i \u00c2l-i Osman\" (History of the Ottomans) by Dervi\u015f Ahmed \u00c2\u015f\u0131k\u00ee, known as \u00c2\u015f\u0131kpa\u015faz\u00e2de (1400\u20131484). Additionally, these remaining sources are not the originals, but rather copies, or copies of the copies that were rewritten over the years, leading to a probable loss or altering in the information. In fact, it is accepted that Ottoman, European, and Byzantine sources are not very reliable when considering the origins of Osman and his clan. On one hand, the oldest known records originally written by the Ottomans all date back to the period that followed the conquest of Constantinople (1453 CE). On the other hand, none of the Byzantine historians did refer in their writings to the origin of the Ottomans. As for European historians, these Turkic Muslim peoples were outside of their interest. However, that changed after a century of this period, when the Ottomans began to pose a threat to Europe.\nBirth.\nSome sources indicate that Osman was born on 13 February 1258, the exact same day the Mongol hordes invaded Baghdad, killing its inhabitants and ravaging its landmarks. He was most likely born around the middle of the thirteenth century, possibly in 1254/5, the date given by the sixteenth-century Ottoman historian Kemalpa\u015fazade. The few available sources agree that he was born in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct, which his father Ertu\u011frul took as the capital of his emirate.\nLineage.\nAccording to Ottoman tradition, Osman's father Ertu\u011frul led the Turkic Kay\u0131 tribe west from Central Asia into Anatolia, fleeing the Mongol onslaught. He then pledged allegiance to the Sultan of the Anatolian Seljuks, who granted him dominion over the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct on the Byzantine frontier. This connection between Ertu\u011frul and the Seljuks, however, was largely invented by court chroniclers a century later, and the true origins of the Ottomans thus remain obscure. According to the Karamanid historian Shikari, Osman was a lowborn Y\u00f6r\u00fck and shepherd.\nIn terms of proportions, the most popular and classic narration is that Osman is the grandson of S\u00fcleyman \u015eah, who died drowning while crossing the Euphrates River on horseback. The Turkish historian Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6ztuna considers that Osman's grandfather, and Ertu\u011frul's father, is called G\u00fcnd\u00fcz Alp, saying that it is more likely that S\u00fcleyman \u015eah is a name stuck in Anatolian popular memory, and it actually refers to S\u00fcleyman bin Qutulmish who founded the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm. \u00d6ztuna adds that it is possible that Ottoman historians tried forming a connection between the Ottomans and the Seljuks, especially since the Ottomans appeared on the stage of history claiming to be the legitimate successors of the Seljuks. Based on this, Osman's assumed lineage is as follows: \"Osman bin Ertu\u011frul bin G\u00fcnd\u00fcz Alp bin Kaya Alp bin G\u00f6kalp bin Sarquk Alp bin Kay\u0131 Alp\". Other researchers agree that the connection between Ertu\u011frul, Osman, and the Seljuks may have been largely invented by court chroniclers a century later, and the true origins of the Ottomans thus remain obscure. On the other hand, some Ottoman sources indicate further lineage to Osman and the Oghuz Turks, which is closer to myth than reality, saying that these people are descendants of Japheth, son of Noah, and that Osman's genealogical tree contains 52 ancestors or more and ends with the Prophet Noah himself. This lineage includes G\u00f6kalp and Oghuz Han (who is said to be the father of G\u00f6kalp), and all the Oghuz Turkic peoples, including the Seljuks.\nEarly years.\nThe Ottoman historian Kemalpa\u015faz\u00e2de mentioned that Osman was Ertu\u011frul's youngest son and that he was raised in the traditional nomadic Turkic ways: he learned wrestling, swordsmanship, horse riding, arrow shooting, and falconry, from an early age. He quickly mastered the previously mentioned skills, outperforming all his brothers. He was also taught the principles of Islam, and was influenced by the teachings of Sufi sheikhs, mostly his mentor Sheikh Edebali, and this was reflected in his personality and lifestyle.\nOrigin of the Ottoman Empire.\nAlmost nothing is known for certain about Osman's early activities, except that he controlled the region around the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct and from there launched raids against the neighboring Byzantine Empire. The first datable event in Osman's life is the Battle of Bapheus in 1301 or 1302, in which he defeated a Byzantine force sent to counter him.\nOsman appears to have followed the strategy of increasing his territories at the expense of the Byzantines while avoiding conflict with his more powerful Turkish neighbors. His first advances were through the passes which lead from the barren areas of northern Phrygia near modern Eski\u015fehir into the more fertile plains of Bithynia; according to Stanford Shaw, these conquests were achieved against the local Byzantine nobles, \"some of whom were defeated in battle, others being absorbed peacefully by purchase contracts, marriage contracts, and the like.\"\nAscendance to leadership.\nOsman became Emir, or \"Bey\", upon his father's death around 1281. According to some historians, Osman's accession to power wasn't peaceful as he had to fight his relatives before he got hold of his clan's leadership. One of Osman's major rivals was his uncle D\u00fcndar Bey, who might have plotted to kill his nephew or rebelled against him when the latter decided to attack a small Greek island. D\u00fcndar Bey saw that Osman's ambition as a threat that might put the whole clan in danger. However, Osman had to pull out his sword to kill his uncle for disobeying.\nIn the \"Vilayetname\", a book containing the narrations about Haji Bektash Veli, Osman's younger uncle, was the one who became Bey after Ertu\u011frul's death. During that time, Osman and several other warriors started organizing raids on Byzantine lands adjacent to S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct, such as Yarhisar, Bilecik, \u0130neg\u00f6l, and \u0130znik. As a result, the Byzantine \"Tekfur\" (governor) of Bursa was provoked, and he sent envoys to the Seljuk Sultan Al\u00e2eddin Kayqubad III, complaining about these constant assaults. Thus, the Sultan ordered G\u00fcnd\u00fcz Alp to bring forth his young nephew to stand before him, and so Osman was arrested and sent to Konya. According to this narration, Sultan Kayqubad admired Osman's courage and deeds, and didn't wish to punish him, instead, Osman was sent to \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Bakt\u0101\u0161 Wal\u012b to consider his matter. Osman was warmly received by the Sufi mystic, who then ordered his release saying: \"I have been waiting for someone like him for years\". After that, \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Bakt\u0101\u0161 Wal\u012b wrapped Osman's head with the same Turban associated with Sufi sheikhs, and sent him back to Konya with a message to the sultan, asking that Osman to become the Kay\u0131 Emir. Thus, Osman became the clan's leader.\nImportance of the Osmanic Beylik location.\nFrom a military point of view, the location of Osman's Beylik had a significant impact on his success as a conquering warrior. His capital S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct was located on a hill in a well-defended position, mediating the main road from Constantinople to Konya. The importance of this site emerged due to the political fragmentation of Anatolia that gave small states greater importance than they originally had. Being an Emir to a beylik bordering Byzantine lands, Osman had the opportunity to direct all his efforts towards war and Jihad following the footsteps of the Seljuks with intentions to conquer all Byzantine territories, and absorb them into the Islamic Caliphate. Encouraged by the weakness of the ancient Empire and its ongoing wars in Europe, Osman had the chance to expand towards western Anatolia crossing the Dardanelles to southeastern Europe. Commenting on these actions, some historians argue that Osman's strategy of increasing his territories at the expense of the Byzantines was due to his intention to avoid conflicts with his more powerful Turkic neighbours.\nPolitically, Osman showed great skills forming and applying new administrative systems in his beylik. During his reign, the Ottomans made great strides towards transitioning from the Nomadic tribe system to settling down in permanent settlements. This helped them consolidate their position and rapidly develop into a major power. Moreover, the beylik's location in northwestern Anatolia, next to Christendom, imposed a military policy on the Ottomans, which gave them better chances to grow and expand compared to the beyliaks of the interior. Osman's beylik was also relatively far from both the Mongol invasions and the influence of the powerful Turkoman beyliks in southern and southwestern Anatolia. Add to that, its proximity to the Silk Road linking Byzantine lands in the west to areas controlled by the Mongols in the east, gave it prominent strategic and economic characteristics. Also, the Osmanic beylik was the only Islamic base facing the yet unconquered Byzantine regions, which made it a magnet to many Turkomen farmers, warriors, and Dervishes fleeing the Mongols, and aspiring to conquer new lands for economic and religious reasons.\nOsman's Dream.\nOsman I had a close relationship with a local religious leader of dervishes named Sheikh Edebali, whose daughter he married. A story emerged among later Ottoman writers to explain the relationship between the two men, in which Osman had a dream while staying in the Sheikh's house. The story appears in the late-fifteenth-century chronicle of A\u015f\u0131kpa\u015fazade as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He saw that a moon arose from the holy man's breast and came to sink in his own breast. A tree then sprouted from his navel and its shade compassed the world. Beneath this shade there were mountains, and streams flowed forth from the foot of each mountain. Some people drank from these running waters, others watered gardens, while yet others caused fountains to flow. When Osman awoke he told the story to the holy man, who said 'Osman, my son, congratulations, for God has given the imperial office to you and your descendants and my daughter Malhun shall be your wife.\nThe dream became an important foundational myth for the empire, imbuing the House of Osman with God-given authority over the earth and providing its fifteenth-century audience with an explanation for Ottoman success. The dream story may also have served as a form of compact: just as God promised to provide Osman and his descendants with sovereignty, it was also implicit that it was the duty of Osman to provide his subjects with prosperity.\nPolitical relations at the beginning of Osman's reign.\nAccording to the Bektashi narration, whose accuracy cannot be confirmed since it was only mentioned in Bektashi sources, plus the fact that it did not enjoy much support from the majority of researchers, \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Bakt\u0101\u0161 Wal\u012b was one of the \"Waf\u0101'\u012byyah tariqah\" dervishes, a Murid of B\u0101b\u0101 Eliy\u0101s al-Khor\u0101s\u0101n\u012b. Once B\u0101b\u0101 Eliy\u0101s died, both \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Bakt\u0101\u0161 Wal\u012b and Sheikh Edebali became among his 60 successors, and grandmasters of the Ahyan R\u00fbm brotherhood of warriors and farmers, who enjoyed great influence among the people. When Osman married Sheikh Edebali's daughter, he secured his control over the brotherhood, and soon became their new grandmaster. As a result of this marriage, all the Ahyan sheikhs became under Ottoman control. This has a major impact on the establishment and development of the Osmanic beylik after Osman's death during the reign of his son Orhan. Some argue that Osman's marriage to sheikh Edebali's daughter was his first brilliant political undertake. On the other hand, Turkish historian Professor Cemal Kafadar considers that the intermarriage between the Osmanic and Edebali's houses, explains the hostilities that later rose between the Ottomans and the Germiyanids, since the Germiyanid Turkoman house was rewarded lands and titles by the Seljuks because of their services in subjugating the B\u0101b\u0101'\u012b revolt in 1240, and because Sheikh Edebali was considered by his followers a leader and successor to B\u0101b\u0101 Ish\u0101q, they all became the focus of attention of the Germiyanids.\nKafadar adds that early in Osman's reign, the young Emir showed political ingenuity forming relations with his neighbours. Osman's alliances transcended tribal, ethnic, and religious lines, and he may have followed his instinct and the requirements of his political aspirations, not mistaking the future results of the family connections he created and secured for his son after him. Osman reconstituted the political culture of the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm in line with the needs of his beylik. He was more creative than his Turkomen neighbours in combining Turkic, Islamic, and Byzantine traditions.\nAdditionally, the Emir also cooperated with the Byzantine \"Tekfurs\" of the neighbouring cities and villages. He forged an agreement, so his clan, whenever they move between grazing areas in the summer, leave their belongings in the Byzantine fortress of Bilecik, and upon their return, they give its governor a token of appreciation, in the form of cheese and butter made from sheep milk and preserved in animal skins, or a good carpet made from wool. This agreement reflects the coexistence between herders, farmers and urban dwellers, during Osman's reign. Osman's friendship with K\u00f6se Mihal, governor of Chirmenkia (modern Harmank\u00f6y), was the culmination of this coexistence between Muslims and Byzantines. As for his relations with other peoples, such as the Mongols, most of whom moved to the borders of western Anatolia, and the Germiyanid Turkomen, it was hostile. That is because the Turks, in general, despised the Mongols, and the Germiyanids were probably of non-Oghuz origin. Osman allied with the Ahyan R\u00fbm brotherhood, they formed organized groups, members in each of which worked in a single trade. The brotherhood took the responsibility to preserve justice, prevent injustice, stop oppression, follow sharia law, dictate good morals, and carry out military duties if the need arises, to defend their rights and the rights of Muslims.\nThe Emir also allied with newly arrived Turkomen clans to Anatolia. In general, the nomads have always had a strong militarized spirit compared to people installed in the cities. Thus, the clans were more active and effective than their city-dwelling kin. Soon enough, they become the beating heart of the Seljuk border provinces in total, and the Osmanic beylik in particular. Osman also enticed many Turkomen from the region of Paphlagonia to join his forces. These Turkomen were fine warriors, eager for jihad and conquest, each of them followed a \"Tariqah\" (an order of Sufism) and was supervised by a sheikh who taught them the meaning of jihad alongside many Islamic principles. However, another section of these Turkomen did not have close ties to Islam for various reasons, thus Osman entrusted them to several sheikhs and dervishes to be given proper Islamic education and be satiated with the values that glorify conquests aiming to spread the word of Islam. In fact, these sheikhs and dervishes were very enthusiastic about promoting the \"Turuq\" of the Khorasani Walis, and Osman's request gave them this chance.\nAs for the ruling hierarchy, Osman was firstly subordinate to the Chobanid Emir in Kastamonu, followed by the Seljuk Sultan through the Germiyanid Bey in K\u00fctahya, who was in turn subordinate to the Mongol Ilkhan in Tabriz. During this period, the Seljuk Sultans had lost their power over their local Emirs, and the Mongol Ilkhan practised his authority in Anatolia through his appointed Generals, where he requested that every local governor, including Osman, sends him soldiers whenever he requests so. As for the hierarchy of name delivering in \"khu\u1e6dbah\", Imams used to pray for the guidance of the: Abbasid caliph in Egypt first, the Mongol Ilkhan in Tabriz, Seljuk Sultan in Konya, and finally the local Bey or Emir.\nExpansion of the beylik.\nUntil the end of thirteenth century, Osman I's conquests include the areas of Bilecik (Belokomis), Yeni\u015fehir (Melangeia), \u0130neg\u00f6l (Angelokomis) and Yarhisar (K\u00f6pr\u00fchisar), and Byzantine castles in these areas.\nAccording to Shaw, Osman's first real conquests followed the collapse of Seljuk authority when he was able to occupy the fortresses of Kulucahisar and Eski\u015fehir. Then he captured the first significant city in his territories, Yeni\u015fehir, which became the Ottoman capital.\nIn 1302, after soundly defeating a Byzantine force near Nicaea, Osman began settling his forces closer to Byzantine controlled areas.\nAlarmed by Osman's growing influence, the Byzantines gradually fled the Anatolian countryside. Byzantine leadership attempted to contain Ottoman expansion, but their efforts were poorly organized and ineffectual. Meanwhile, Osman spent the remainder of his reign expanding his control in two directions, north along the course of the Sakarya River and southwest towards the Sea of Marmara, achieving his objectives by 1308.\nOsman's last campaign was against the city of Bursa. Although Osman did not physically participate in the battle, the victory at Bursa proved to be extremely vital for the Ottomans as the city served as a staging ground against the Byzantines in Constantinople, and as a newly adorned capital for Osman's son, Orhan. Ottoman tradition holds that Osman died just after the capture of Bursa, but some scholars have argued that his death should be placed in 1324, the year of Orhan's accession.\nConquest of Karacahisar.\nAfter establishing his beylik, Osman had to fight on two fronts: one against the Byzantine, and the other against the Turkomen beyliks that opposed his rule, especially the Germiyanids. Osman focused on expanding at the expense of the Byzantines, and since that time, the primary Ottoman goal became the conquest of the remaining Byzantine lands. Some accounts indicate that the first battle Osman launched against the Byzantines was aimed to revenge a defeat that he suffered in the spring of 1284 or 1285, where the Byzantines, led by the \"Tekfur\" of Bursa, ambushed him and his men. It is in doubt that Osman knew about this ambush from one of his spies. Nevertheless, he chose to clash with the Byzantines and he was defeated and forced to withdraw with casualties, including his nephew Koca Saruhan bey, son of Savc\u0131 Bey. Based on this, around 1286, Osman went forward to Kulacahisar at the head of a military force of three hundred fighters, it was a fortress located two leagues away from \u0130neg\u00f6l, within the scope of mount Uluda\u011f. The Emir attacked the fort at night and managed to conquer it, extending his beylik northwards toward Lake \u0130znik's proximity. The Ottoman victory at Kulacahisar triggered the fort's governor, who refused to be a subordinate subject to a Muslim ruler, especially a border Emir, so he allied himself with Karacahisar's governor, and both men agreed to fight the Muslims aiming at retaking all Byzantine lands that were lost recently. Thus, the Ottomans and the Byzantines met again in battle, somewhere between Bilecik and \u0130neg\u00f6l, where fierce fighting took place in which Osman's brother Savc\u0131 Bey and the Byzantine commander Pilatos were killed. The Battle ended with an Ottoman victory. Then, the Ottomans entered Karacahisar where they, reportedly for the first time, converted the town's church into a mosque. Osman appointed a \"Qadi\" (magistrate) and a \"Suba\u015f\u0131\" (chief of police) for the newly conquered city. Historians differed in determining the date of this conquest, yet none made it prior to 1286, or exceeding 1291. Osman made his new city a staging base of his military campaigns against the Byzantines, and ordered that his name be delivered at the Friday \"khu\u1e6dbah\", which was the first manifestation of his sovereignty and authority.\nOsman's latest victory was his greatest up to that date. Seljuk Sultan Al\u00e2eddin Kayqubad III expressed his deep appreciation for Osman's accomplishments in the name of the Seljuks and Islam, giving him the title of \u1e24a\u1e0drat \u02bbUthm\u0101n gh\u0101z\u012b marzub\u0101n '\u00c2li J\u00e2h \u02bbUthm\u0101n Sh\u0101h (the honourable conqueror and border guardian Osman Sh\u0101h). The Sultan also bestowed upon Osman the governance of all the land he did conquered as well as the towns of Eski\u015fehir and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc. Moreover, The Seljuk Sultan issued a decree exempting Osman from all types of taxes. Osman also received several gifts from the Sultan reflecting the new high stature to the Seljuk court. These gifts included: a golden war banner, a \"mehter\" (war drum), a \"tu\u011f\" (a pole with circularly arranged horse tail hairs), a tassel, a gilded sword, a loose saddle, and one hundred thousand dirhams. The decree also included the recognition of Osman's right to be mentioned in the Friday \"khu\u1e6dbah\" in all areas subject to him, and was permitted to mint coins in his name. Thus, Osman became a Sultan, but lacking only the title.\nIt is narrated that when drums were beaten announcing Sultan's Kayqubad's arrival, Osman stood up in glorification, and remained so till the music halted. Since that day, Ottoman soldiers enacted standing in glorification for their Sultan whenever drums were beaten.\nConquest of Bilecik, Yarhisar, and \u0130neg\u00f6l.\nSoon after the conquest of Karacahisar, Osman marched with his soldiers north towards Sakarya River. Upon his arrival there, he raided and looted the forts of G\u00f6yn\u00fck and Yenice Tarakl\u0131. Many argue that during this time, Osman received a message from his Byzantine friend K\u00f6se Mihal, warning him of a secret conspiracy that was being prepared by the \"tekfurs\" of Bilecik and Yarhisar. The two were aiming at killing Osman after inviting him to attend their children's wedding. Osman was disappointed by being betrayed by Bilecik's tekfur. That is because he considered the relationship with Bilecik to have been built on trust and good faith, as demonstrated by the aforementioned custom of his clan leaving their belongings in this fortress whenever they moved between grazing areas. Osman devised a plan to escape the trap and take over the fortress. He sent forty of his soldiers carrying some of the clan's belongings to be kept in Bilecik, while most of its inhabitants were outside attending the wedding. Once his men entered the fort, they quickly overpowered its small garrison, and it fell to the Ottomans. Then, Osman went to the feast followed by some Byzantine knights who were easily ambushed by his men later. A short battle took place in which Osman was victorious, and most of the Byzantines were killed. After that, Osman rode towards Yarhisar and took it by surprise; A large part of the fort's garrison was killed, while the rest were taken prisoners. The \"tekfur's\" daughter Holophira, was also captured in this action, she soon became Osman's daughter in law, having married his son Orhan sometime later, and her name was changed in Bayalun Afterwards, Osman and several of his men took over all towns and villages surrounding \u0130neg\u00f6l, before laying siege on the fort itself and taking it with ease. Osman ordered the execution of \u0130neg\u00f6l's \"tekfur\" since he was known for persecuting his Muslim neighbours, then placed a new garrison for the town, and distributed the loot among his men.\nFall of the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm, and the Osmanic Beylik's independence.\nOsman aspired, after his multiple victories, to expand on two axes, aiming to isolate the Byzantine cities he was looking to conquer. First, he blocked the road leading to \u0130znik from the eastern side. Then, he advanced from the west towards Lopadion and Evrenos. After that Osman turned around Mount Uluda\u011f from both north and south, avoiding the fortified city of Bursa, connecting with his Muslim neighbours in the southeast. During that time, the Byzantine Empire was preoccupied with ongoing clashes with its powerful enemies in Anatolia, such as the Germiyanids and the coastal beyliks, not to mention suppressing unrest and discord in Constantinople and the Balkans. The Empire was unable to face Osman's threats, thus, he felt free to expand at the Byzantines expense exploiting the current situation. At the same time, the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm was seeing its final days. The Sultanate grip was slowly weakened over its Turkoman Beyliks. Sultan Al\u00e2eddin Kayqubad III became deeply unpopular after he purged the Seljuk administration of his predecessor's men with extreme violence. This prompted the Mongol Ilkhan Mahmud Ghazan to call upon Kayqubad to appear before him, and once the latter did in 1302, he was executed and replaced with his predecessor Ghiy\u0101th ad-D\u012bn Mas'\u016bd bin Kayk\u0101w\u016bs to keep the peace in Anatolia. According to another account, Mongol and Tatar hordes raided Asia Minor in 1300, and killed Sultan Kayqubad in his capital Konya. It was also said that Kayk\u0101w\u016bs himself killed his rival, coveting his own return on the throne. Another story suggests that Kayqubad escaped and sought refuge in the Byzantine court where he remained until his death. In all cases, Kayk\u0101w\u016bs's rule was short-lived, lasting between 4 and 6 years at most, and when he died in 1308 CE, the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm was no more to be mentioned in the historical records, giving the way for the Turkoman beyliks to emerge as independent states.\nThe demise of the Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm gave Osman autonomy over his dominion, he soon dubbed himself \"Padi\u015fah \u0100l-\u0131\u02bfOsm\u0101n\" (sovereign of the house of Osman). After that, Osman set his sights towards conquering the last of the Byzantine cities, towns, and fortresses in Anatolia. According to one account, after Sultan Al\u00e2eddin Kayqubad III was killed by the Mongols, viziers and notable leaders met and decided that since the late Sultan had no offspring, one of the local Emirs should take his place, and they found Osman perfect fitting the candidacy. Thus, the leaders offered the Emir the position, and Osman accepted becoming a Sultan. It is likely that Kayqubad's and Kayk\u0101w\u016bs's deaths led to the Sultanate of R\u00fbm falling into chaos, and prompted many of its regular soldiers to join the armies of local Emirs, including Osman. This gave the latter a great momentum and important military experience enriching his army for the upcoming conquests.\nBattle of Bapheus.\nSoon after Osman secured his independence and established control over all fortresses he conquered, he sent messages to all remaining Byzantine \"tekfurs\" in Anatolia asking them to choose between accepting Islam, Ottoman sovereignty and paying \"jizyah\", or war. Some of these \"tekfurs\" ended up accepting Islam, including Osman's old friend K\u00f6se Mihal, who became the Turkic leader's companion, and would play a considerable part in the upcoming expansions of the Osmanic beylik. His descendants became known in Ottoman history as \"Mihalo\u011fullar\u0131\" (children of Michael, plural of \"Mihalo\u011flu\"). Other governors acknowledged Osman's sovereignty, while the rest kept their loyalty to the Byzantine Emperor. Thus, Osman started harassing their fortresses such as Bursa and Nicaea which was besieged in 1301. The Ottoman raids also threatened the port city of Nicomedia with famine, as the Ottomans roamed the countryside prohibiting peasants from harvesting wheat. This provoked Bursa's \"tekfur\" among others to unite their efforts to eliminate this new emerging Islamic power.\nIn the spring of 1302, Emperor Michael IX launched a campaign that reached south to Magnesia. The Ottomans, awed by his large army, avoided an open battle. The Emperor sought to confront The Ottomans, but he was dissuaded by his generals. Encouraged by that, The Ottomans resumed their raids, virtually isolating the Emperor at Magnesia. Soon, the imperial army started dissolving without engaging in a single battle, that is because the local troops left to defend their homes which were continuously raided by the Ottomans, and the Alan mercenaries left as well, aiming to rejoin with their families in Thrace. The Byzantine emperor was forced to withdraw by the sea, followed by a wave of refugees. To counter the threat to Nicomedia, Michael's father, Andronikos II, sent a Byzantine force of some 2,000 men (half of whom were recently hired Alan mercenaries), under the \"megas hetaireiarches\", Giorgios Mouzalon, to cross the Bosporus and relieve the city.\nThe Byzantine response was a warning for the Islamic border villages and towns. However, when the locals noticed Osman's leadership and military strength, as well as his devotion to Islam, they rallied to support and stand with him to consolidate a new Islamic state that would unite them and form an impenetrable wall against the Byzantines. Several Byzantine deserters joined Osman as well, some of which were liberated prisoners of war who chose to align with him, reportedly due to his good treatment during their custody. Many Islamic warrior brotherhoods also joined the Ottomans. For example, the Gazi R\u00fbm's (Raiders of the Romans), they were stationed on the borders of the Byzantine Empire and repelled its attacks on Muslim lands since the Abbasid era, gaining great experiences and knowledge in Byzantine strategies and tactics. Another example is the \u1e24ajjian R\u00fbm's (pilgrims of [the land of] the Romans), a brotherhood of Muslim clergy concerned with teaching local villagers and recent converts the basics and different aspects of Islam, and had a side objective of assisting the \"Mujahideen\" in combat.\nThe Byzantine and Ottoman armies eventually met on 27 July 1302 at the plain of Bapheus located between Nicomedia and Nicaea. The Ottoman army consisted of light cavalry under Osman himself, and they numbered around 5,000, while the Byzantines numbered around 2,000 men. The Muslim cavalry charged toward the Byzantines fast, whose Alan contingent did not participate in the battle. As a result of the attack, the Byzantine line was broken, forcing Giorgios Mouzalon to withdraw into Nicomedia under the cover of the Alan force.\nBapheus was the first major victory for the nascent Osmanic Beylik, and of major significance for its future expansion: the Byzantines effectively lost control of the countryside of Bithynia, withdrawing to their forts, which became isolated and fell one by one eventually. The Byzantine defeat also sparked a mass exodus of the Christian population from the area into the European parts of the empire, further altering the region's demographic balance. Coupled with the defeat at Magnesia, the Ottomans were able to reach the coasts of the Aegean Sea, threatening Byzantium with a final loss for their territory in Asia Minor. According to Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k, the battle allowed the Ottomans to achieve the characteristics and qualities of a true state.\nConquest of Yeni\u015fehir and Its Surroundings.\nAfter securing his northern borders by reaching the Black and Marmara seas, Osman turned his attention towards the southern borders of his beylik. Thus, he attacked the Byzantine towns, villages, and fortresses surrounding the city of Yeni\u015fehir preparing to conquer it. Osman sent a large campaign to the fortress of Y\u0101vandhisar and annexed it. Then, he attacked Yeni\u015fehir, took it with ease, and made it his temporary capital after fortifying and strengthening its defenses. Soon after that Osman started sending more campaigns against the remaining Byzantine cities conquering several fortresses including Lefke, Akhisar, Ko\u00e7hisar, Yenicehisar, Marmarac\u0131k, and K\u00f6pr\u00fchisar. In fact, conquering the aforementioned forts aimed at imposing a security belt around Yeni\u015fehir, thus Osman surrounded it with a series of front forts to ward off any invasions.\nConquest of Bursa.\nWith Yeni\u015fehir in his hands, Osman focused his efforts on isolated large cities starting with Bursa, unaware that this would be his last campaign. He gave the orders to start building two forts overseeing and surrounding the city, then, when the construction was completed, Osman provided the forts with large garrisons. This allowed his men to tighten the blockade and prevent any provisions reaching Bursa. The Ottoman siege lasted between six and nine years, this was due to the fact that the Ottomans had no Siege engines and they had never captured a large fortified city before.\nDuring the long siege, Osman and some of his military commanders conquered the smaller Byzantine fortresses on the vicinity of the beylik, in which Several \"tekfurs\" acknowledged Osman's sovereignty, and became among his subjects, some of them accepting Islam in the process. Soon after that, Osman started suffering from Gout, and couldn't accompany his men in any more campaigns or witness the Siege of Bursa, so he entrusted his son Orhan to complete this major task, while he retired in his capital. Orhan's continued the siege without any fighting, but he continued isolating Bursa from its surrounding forts, conquering Mudanya to cut off the city's connection to the sea. He also captured the city of Praenetos on the southern coast of \u0130zmit, changing its name to Karam\u00fcrsel, after the Muslim leader who took it \"Karam\u00fcrsel Bey\". The last fort to fall was Beyce, which was considered Bursa's key as it overlooked it, and it was renamed Orhaneli.\nOrhan tightened the blockade around Bursa till its garrison fell into despair. Soon, the Byzantine emperor realized that the fall of the city into Muslim hands was inevitable, thus, he made a difficult decision ordering his governor to evacuate the city. Orhan entered Bursa on 6 April 1326, its people were not subjected to any harm after they recognized Ottoman sovereignty and pledged to pay \"jizyah\". Saroz, the garrison's leader, surrendered to Orhan and pledged allegiance to his father Osman. He also converted to Islam and was given the title of \"Bey\" out of respect to his courage and patience during the long siege. According to some sources, Osman died just before the fall of the city, while others suggest that he lived long enough to hear about the victory on his death-bed.\nFamily.\nDue to the scarcity of sources about his life, very little is known about Osman's family relations. According to certain fifteenth-century Ottoman writers, Osman was descended from the Kay\u0131 branch of the Oghuz Turks, a claim which later became part of the official Ottoman genealogy and was eventually enshrined in the Turkish Nationalist historical tradition with the writings of M. F. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc. However, the claim to Kay\u0131 lineage does not appear in the earliest extant Ottoman genealogies. Thus many scholars of the early Ottomans regard it as a later fabrication meant to shore up dynastic legitimacy with regard to the empire's Turkish rivals in Anatolia. Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu Ali, in the early 15th century, constructed a genealogy for Osman, tracing it back to Oghuz Khagan, the mythical ancestor of the Western Turks, through the eldest grandson of his eldest son, thereby lending legitimacy to the Ottoman sultans' claim of primacy among Turkish monarchs.\nIt is very difficult for historians to determine what is factual and what is legendary about the many stories the Ottomans told about Osman and his exploits, and the Ottoman sources do not always agree with each other. According to one story, Osman had an uncle named D\u00fcndar with whom he had a quarrel early in his career. Osman wished to attack the local Christian lord of Bilecik, while D\u00fcndar opposed it, arguing that they already had enough enemies. Interpreting this as a challenge to his leadership position, Osman shot and killed his uncle with an arrow. This story first appears in Ne\u015fri's work but is missing in earlier Ottoman historical works. If it was true, it means that it was likely covered up to avoid tarnishing the reputation of the Ottoman dynasty's founder with the murder of a family member. It may also indicate an important change in the relationship of the Ottomans with their neighbors, shifting from relatively peaceful accommodation to a more aggressive policy of conquest.\nConsorts.\nOsman I had two known consorts, who were both his legal wives, and some unknown concubines:\nSons.\nOsman I had at least eight sons:\nDaughters.\nOsman I had at least one daughter:\nPersonality.\nOttoman historiography depicts Osman as a semi-holy person.\nIt is known that among the Turkoman tribes, the tribe or part of it was named after its leader. The fact that the Kayi tribe became known by the name of Osman, suggests that the tribe became powerful because of his excellent leadership. Orientalist R. Rakhmanaliev writes that the historical role of Osman was that of a tribal leader, who enjoyed enormous success in uniting his people around him.\nThe activities and personality of Osman as the founder of the state and dynasty are highly appreciated by historians of both the past and the present. The state and the dynasty of rulers are named after him. The population of the state was called Ottomans (Osmanlilar) until the beginning of the 20th century, that is until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Historian F. Uspensky notes that Osman relied not only on force, but also cunningness. Historian and writer Lord Kinross writes that Osman was a wise, patient ruler, whom people sincerely respected and were ready to serve him faithfully. He had a natural sense of superiority, but he never sought to assert himself with the help of power, and therefore he was respected not only by those who were equal in position, but also those who exceeded his abilities on the battlefield or on wisdom. Osman did not arouse feelings of rivalry in his people\u2014only loyalty. Herbert Gibbons believed that Osman was \"great enough to exploit masterful people\".\nAccording to Cemal Kafadar, Osman for the Ottomans was the same as Romulus for the Romans.\nDeath.\nAccording to the sources that say Osman lived to hear of the fall of Bursa, Orhan rushed back to S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct to inform his father of his great victory. Once he reached it, he was immediately summoned to Osman, who was on his death-bed. Soon after Osman heard the news, he died from natural causes. However, Osman managed to name Orhan to be his successor, although the latter was not Osman's first-born. Yet the dead Emir believed that Orhan was better fit to rule than his elder half-brother Al\u00e2eddin, who was more passive and pious than Orhan. As for the exact cause of Osman's death, it is well known that he suffered from gout for several years, which seemingly caused his eventual death. This is confirmed by what A\u015f\u0131kpa\u015fazade mentioned in \"Tevarih-i \u00c2l-i Osman\" when he talked about the late period of Osman's life, saying: \"Osman had a bad foot from which he experienced severe pain\". It is noted that A\u015f\u0131kpa\u015fazade used a similar expression when he talked about the death of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror: \"The cause of his death was the issue in his feet\". It is now known that gout is a genetic disease in the Ottoman dynasty, and many sultans suffered from it.\nThe exact date of Osman's death is debatable. It is said that he died on 21 August 1326 at 70 years old. The 15th-century Ottoman historian Rouhi \u00c7elebi, who wrote down the history of the Ottoman Empire until 1481, indicates that Osman died in 1320. However, Uru\u00e7 adilo\u011flu, another Ottoman historian who lived during the time of Sultans Mehmed the Conqueror and Bayezid II up until 1502, says that Osman died in 1327. Contemporary Turkish historian Necdet Sakao\u011flu states that, despite the absence of documents mentioning Osman's name after the year 1320, there are documents confirming Orhan's ascension to the throne in 1324. Based on this, Osman's death might have occurred in the same or previous year. It is also certain that Osman's death was after the death of his father-in-law, Sheikh Edebali, and after the death of his wife, Rabia Bala Hatun, because it is known that Osman buried the two in Bilecik.\nOnce Osman died, Orhan ordered the transfer of his body to Bursa, his new capital. Thus, Osman's body was laid there to rest. His grave is located today in the neighbourhood of Tophane. The reason behind the transferring Osman's body was due to a will Osman did tell his son about during the early years of besieging Bursa: \"My Son, when I die, bury me under that silver dome in Bursa\". However, Osman's current tomb dates back to the time of Sultan Abdulaziz (1861\u20131876), because the first tomb was completely destroyed in a severe earthquake that struck the region in 1855, it was rebuilt by the aforementioned Sultan. Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876\u20131909) also constructed a shrine in S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct where Osman was buried for a while before he was moved to Bursa.\nAccording to some sources, Osman left a written will to his son Orhan instructing him to move on with conquests and jihad against the Byzantines, that he abides by the teachings of Islam, accompany the \"\u02bfUlam\u0101\u02be\", amend his parish, and dedicates himself to spread the word of Islam.\nLegacy.\nOsman is considered the founder of the Ottoman dynasty who started an imperial line that would expand to include 35 sultans \u2013 rulers of one of the largest and most powerful empires in world history. The Ottoman Empire lasted until 1918, when it disintegrated after defeat alongside other Central Powers in World War I. Osman is often referred to as the first in the line of Ottoman Sultans, although he himself never carried this title in his life, and was instead called \"Bey\" or \"Emir\". One endowment written in Persian and dating back to 1324, indicates that Osman was given the titles \"Mu\u1e25iuddin\" (Reviver of the faith) and \"Fakhruddin\" (Pride of the faith).\nOsman's descendants are distributed today in several American, European and Arab countries after the royal Ottoman family was expelled from Turkey in 1924 shortly after the declaration of the Republic, by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. Eventually, several family members returned to Turkey, after the Turkish government allowed the females to return in 1951. However, male descendants had to wait until 1973 CE to be able to enter Turkey again. Other members remained in the countries where their ancestors had sought refuge, such as England, France, the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, among others. Osman's descendants are known today as the Osmano\u011flu (son of Osman) family.\nA Turkish navy landing ship is named after Osman.\nThe Sword of Osman.\nThe Sword of Osman () was an important sword of state used during the coronation ceremony of the Ottoman Sultans starting with Sultan Murad II. The practice started when Osman was girt with the sword of Islam by his father-in-law Sheik Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Ey\u00fcp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. The fact that the emblem by which a sultan was enthroned consisted of a sword was highly symbolic: it showed that the office with which he was invested was first and foremost that of a warrior. The Sword of Osman was girded on to the new sultan by the Sharif of Konya, a Mevlevi dervish, who was summoned to Constantinople for that purpose.\nIn popular culture.\nOsman and people close to him have been portrayed in the Turkish television series\n\"Kurulu\u015f \"Osmanc\u0131k\"\" (1988), adapted from a novel by the same name, ' (2014\u20132019) and ' (2019\u2013present).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He was born in S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct, as the son of Osman I.\nIn the early stages of his reign, Orhan focused his energies on conquering most of northwestern Anatolia. The majority of these areas were under Byzantine rule and he won his first battle at Pelekanon against the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. Orhan also occupied the lands of the Karasids of Bal\u0131kesir and the Ahis of Ankara.\nA series of civil wars surrounding the ascension of the nine-year-old Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos greatly benefited Orhan. In the Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347, the regent John VI Kantakouzenos married his daughter Theodora to Orhan and employed Ottoman warriors against the rival forces of the empress dowager, allowing them to loot Thrace. In the Byzantine civil war of 1352\u20131357, Kantakouzenos used Ottoman forces against John V, granting them the use of a European fortress at \u00c7impe around 1352. A major earthquake devastated Gallipoli (modern Gelibolu) two years later, after which Orhan's son, S\u00fcleyman Pasha, occupied the town, giving the Ottomans a strong bridgehead into mainland Europe.\nAccording to Muslim scholar Ibn Battuta, Orhan was \"the greatest of the Turcoman kings and the richest in wealth, lands, and military forces\".\nPassage of power.\nOsman Gazi died in either 1323 or 1324, and Orhan succeeded him. According to Ottoman tradition, when Orhan succeeded his father, he proposed to his brother, Alaeddin, that they should share the emerging empire. The latter refused on the grounds that their father had designated Orhan as sole successor, and that the empire should not be divided. He only accepted as his share the revenues of a single village near Bursa.\nGovernment.\nAccording to some authorities, it was in Alaeddin's time, and by his advice, that the Ottomans ceased acting like vassals to the Seljuk ruler: they no longer stamped money with his image or used his name in public prayers. These changes are attributed by others to Osman himself, but the vast majority of the oriental writers concur in attributing to Alaeddin the introduction of laws respecting the costume of the various subjects of the empire, and the creation and funding of a standing army of regular troops. It was by his advice and that of a contemporary Turkish statesman that the celebrated corps of Janissaries was formed, an institution which European writers erroneously fix at a later date, and ascribe to Murad I.\nJanissaries.\nAlaeddin, by his military legislation, may be truly said to have organized victory for the Ottoman dynasty. He organised for the Ottoman Beylik a standing army of regularly paid and disciplined infantry and horses, a full century before Charles VII of France established his fifteen permanent companies of men-at-arms, which are generally regarded as the first modern standing army.\nOrhan's predecessors, Ertu\u011frul and Osman I, had made war at the head of the armed vassals and volunteers. This army rode on horseback to their prince's banner when summoned for each expedition, and were disbanded as soon as the campaign was over. Alaeddin determined to ensure any future success by forming a corps of paid infantry, which was to be kept in constant readiness for service. These troops were called Yaya, or piyade. They were divided into tens, hundreds, and thousands with their commanders. Their pay was high, and their pride soon caused their sovereign some anxiety. Orhan wished to provide a check to them, and he took counsel for this purpose with his brother Alaeddin and Kara Khalil \u00c7andarl\u0131 (of House of Candar), who was connected with the royal house by marriage. \u00c7andarl\u0131 laid before his master and the vizier a project. Out of this arose the renowned corps of Janissaries, which was considered the scourge of the Balkans and Central Europe for a long time, until it was abolished by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826.\n\u00c7andarl\u0131 proposed to Orhan to create the Janissary corps, an army entirely composed of the children of conquered places. \u00c7andarl\u0131 argued that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The conquered are the responsibility of the conqueror, who is the lawful ruler of them, of their lands, of their goods, of their wives, and of their children. We have a right to do, same as what we do with our own; and the treatment which I propose is not only lawful, but benevolent. By enforcing the enrolling them in the ranks of the army, we consult both their temporal and eternal interests, as they will be educated and given better life conditions.\nHe also claimed that incorporating children of the conquered would induce other people to enlist: their friends and relations, who would come as volunteers to join the Ottoman ranks. Acting on this advice, Orhan selected a thousand of the finest boys from conquered Christian families. The recruits were trained according to their individual abilities, and employed in posts ranging from professional soldier to Grand Vizier. This practice continued for centuries, until the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV.\nPolitics.\nInitial expansion.\nOrhan invaded Byzantine territories in northwest Anatolia. First, in 1321, Orhan captured Mudanya, the port linking the city of Bursa to the Sea of Marmara coast. He then sent a column under Konur Alp towards the west Black Sea coast; another column under Ak\u00e7a Koca to capture Kocaeli, and finally a column under Abdurrahman Ghazi to capture the southeast coast of the Sea of Marmara. Then, he captured Bursa by persuading its Byzantine commander to defect. As Evrenos Bey, he became a commander of light cavalry, and he and his sons and grandsons led Ottoman troops in the Balkans. Once Bursa was captured, Orhan sent cavalry towards the Bosphorus, capturing Byzantine towns on the Marmara coast. There were even sightings of Ottoman light cavalry along the Bosphorus coast, and Ottoman forces laid siege to Nicaea (second only to Constantinople in the Byzantine Empire).\nIn 1329, Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III led a mercenary army to relieve Nicaea and regain Kocaeli. In the ensuing battle of Pelekanon (near Nicomedia, Bithynia.\nPresent day: Maltepe, Turkey), on 10 or 15 June, Orhan's disciplined troops routed the Byzantines. Thereafter Andronikos abandoned the idea of getting Kocaeli back and never again conducted a field battle against Ottoman forces.\nNicaea surrendered to Orhan after a three-year siege that concluded in 1331. Orhan captured Nicomedia in 1337. Orhan gave the command of Nicomedia to his eldest son, Suleyman Pasha, who had directed the operations of the siege.\nIn 1338, Orhan captured Scutari; most of northwest Anatolia was in Ottoman hands. The Byzantines still controlled the coastal strip from \u015eile on the Black Sea to Scutari and the city of Amastris (now Amasra) in Paphlagonia, but these were so scattered and isolated as to be no threat to the Ottomans.\nIn 1345, there was a change of strategy. Instead of aiming to gain land from non-Muslims, Orhan took over a Turkish principality, Karesi (present Bal\u0131kesir and surroundings). According to Islamic philosophy of war, the areas under Islamic rule were to be \"abodes of peace\" and the other areas \"abodes of war\". Conducting a war in \"abodes of war\" was considered a good deed. Karesi principality was a state governed by a Turkish emir and its main inhabitants were Turkish so it was an \"abode of peace\". The Ottomans had to have special justification for conquering fellow Muslim Turkish principalities.\nIn the case of Karesi, the ruler had died and had left two sons whose claims to the post of emir were equally valid. So there was a fight between the armed supporters of the two claimant princes. Orhan's pretext for invasion was that he was acting as a bringer of peace. In the end of the invasion by Ottoman troops the two brothers were pushed to the castle of their capital city of Pergamum (now Bergama). One was killed and the other was captured. The territories around Pergamum and Palaeocastro (Bal\u0131kesir) were annexed to Orhan's domains. This conquest was particularly important since it brought Orhan's territories to \u00c7anakkale, the Anatolian side of the Dardanelles Straits.\nWith the conquest of Karesi, nearly the whole of northwestern Anatolia was included in the Ottoman Beylik, and the four cities of Bursa, Nicomedia, Nicaea, and Pergamum had become strongholds of its power. At this stage of his conquests, Orhan's Ottoman Principality had four provinces:\nConsolidation period.\nA twenty-year period of peace followed the acquisition of Karesi. During this time, the Ottoman sovereign was actively occupied in perfecting the civil and military institutions which his brother had introduced, in securing internal order, in founding and endowing mosques and schools, and in the construction of vast public edifices, many of which still stand. Orhan did not continue with any other conquests in Anatolia except taking over Ankara from the commercial-religious fraternity guild of Ahis.\nThe general diffusion of Turkish populations over Anatolia, before Osman's time, was in main part a push from the Mongol conquest of Central Asia, Iran and then East Anatolia. Turkish peoples had founded a number of principalities after the demise of the Anatolian Sultanate of Rum, after its defeat by the Ilkhanate Mongols. Although they were all of Turkish stock, they were all rivals for dominant status in Anatolia.\nAfter the Byzantine defeat of the Battle of Pelekanon, Orhan developed friendly relations with Andronicus III Palaeologus, and maintained them with some of his successors. Therefore, the Ottoman power experienced a twenty-year period of general repose.\nHowever, as the Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347 dissipated the last resources of the Byzantine Empire, the auxiliary armies of the Emirs of Turkish principalities were frequently called over and employed in Europe. In 1346, Emperor John VI Cantacuzene recognised Orhan as the most powerful sovereign of the Turks. He aspired to attach the Ottoman forces permanently to his interests, and hoped to achieve this by giving his second daughter, Theodora, in marriage to their ruler, despite differences of creed and the disparity of age. However, in Byzantine and in Western European history, dynastic marriages were quite usual and there are many examples which were much more strange.\nThe splendour of the wedding between Orhan and Theodora at Selymbria (Silivri) is elaborately described by Byzantine writers. In the following year, Orhan and Theodora visited his imperial father-in-law at \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, (then Chrysopolis) the suburb of Constantinople on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus where there was a display of festive splendor. However, this close relationship soured when Byzantines suffered from marauding migrant Turcoman bands that had crossed the Marmara Sea and Dardanelles and pillaged several towns in Thrace. After a series of such raids, the Byzantines had to use superior forces to deal with them.\nIbn Battuta gave the following account of Orhan during his reign: {\nDecline of Byzantine Empire.\nDuring Orhan's reign as the Ottoman emir, the Byzantine Empire declined\u00a0\u2013 partly due to the ambitions of Italian maritime states and to the aggression of the Turcomans and other Turcoman states, but also due to civil wars within the empire.\nDuring these years the Byzantine Empire became so weak that commercial supremacy in the surrounding seas around it became a bone of contention for the Italian maritime commercial city states. The Republic of Genoa possessed Galata, a separate Genoese city across the Golden Horn from Constantinople itself. The Genoese had fought the Byzantines earlier in 1348 when the Byzantines had decreased their customs tariffs in order to attract trade to the Byzantine side of the Golden Horn. In 1352 the rivalry for trade led to a war between Genoa and Venice. The Genoese, in resisting a Venetian fleet attacking their ships in the Golden Horn, bombarded the sea walls of Constantinople and pushed the Byzantines to ally with the Venetians. The Venetians assembled a large naval force, including hired fleets from Peter IV of Aragon and from the Byzantine Empire of John VI Cantacuzene. The sea battle between the Venetian fleet under the command of Niccolo Pisani and the Genoese fleet under Paganino Doria led to defeat of Venetians and their Byzantine allies. Orhan opposed the Venetians, whose fleets and piratical raids were disrupting his seaward provinces, and who had met his diplomatic overtures with contempt. The Venetians were allies of John VI, so Orhan sent an auxiliary force across the straits to Galata, which there co-operated with the Genoese.\nIn the midst of the distress and confusion that the Byzantine Empire now suffered, Orhan's eldest son, Suleyman Pasha, captured the Castle of Tzympe (Cinbi) in a bold move which gave the Turks a permanent foothold on the European side of the Dardanelles Straits. He also started to settle migrant Turcomans and town-dwelling Turks in the strategic city and castle of Gelibolu (Gallipoli), which had been devastated by a severe earthquake and was therefore evacuated by its inhabitants. Suleyman refused various financial inducements offered by John VI to empty the castle and the city. The emperor pleaded with his son-in-law Orhan to meet personally and discuss the matter, but the request was either rejected or could not be carried out due to Orhan's age and ill-health.\nThis military situation remained unresolved, in part because of the eruption of hostilities between John VI and his co-emperor and son-in-law John V Palaeologus. John V was dismissed from his imperial post and exiled to Tenedos; Cantacuzene's son Matthew was crowned as the co-emperor. But very soon John V returned from exile with Venetian help and conducted a coup, taking over the government of Constantinople. Although the two men came to an agreement to share power, John VI resigned from his imperial post and became a monk. Each of these two contestants for power was continually soliciting Orhan's aid against the other, and Orhan supported whichever side would benefit the Ottomans.\nLast years.\nOrhan was the longest living and one of the longest reigning of the future Ottoman Sultans. In his last years he had left most of the powers of state in the hands of his second son Murad and lived a secluded life in Bursa.\nIn 1356 Orhan and Theodora's son, Halil, was abducted somewhere on the Bay of Izmit. A Genoese commercial boat captain, which was conducting acts of piracy alongside commercial activity, was able to capture the young prince and take him over to Phocaea on the Aegean Sea, which was under Genoese rule. Orhan was very much upset by this kidnapping and conducted talks with his brother-in-law and now sole Byzantine Emperor John V Palaeologos. As to the agreement, John V with a Byzantine naval fleet went to Phocaea, paid the ransom demanded of 100,000 \"hyperpyra\", and brought Halil back to Ottoman territory.\nIn 1357 Orhan's eldest and most experienced son and likely heir, Suleyman Pasha, died after injuries sustained from a fall from a horse near Bolayir on the coast of the sea of Marmara. The horse that Suleyman fell from was buried alongside him and their tombs can still be seen today. Orhan was said to have been greatly affected by the death of his son.\nOrhan died soon after, likely from natural causes. Orhan died in 1362, in Bursa, at the age of eighty, after a reign of thirty-six years. He is buried in the t\u00fcrbe (tomb) with his wife and children, called \"G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fc Kumbet\" in Bursa.\nFamily.\nConsorts.\nOrhan had at least seven consorts; \nSons.\nOrhan had at least six sons: \nDaughters.\nOrhan had at least four daughters:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to later traditions, at a young age, his mother had paid a great deal of attention to Osman's education, as a result of which Osman II became a known poet and was believed to have mastered many languages, including Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, and Italian; although this has since been refuted. Osman was born eleven months after his father Ahmed's transition to the throne. He was trained in the palace. According to foreign observers, he was one of the most cultured of Ottoman princes.\nOsman's failure to capture the throne at the death of his father Ahmed might have been caused by the absence of a mother to lobby in his favour; his own mother was probably already dead or in exile.\nReign.\nOsman II ascended the throne at the age of 14 as the result of a coup d'\u00e9tat against his uncle Mustafa I \"the Mad\" (1617\u20131618, 1622\u20131623). Despite his youth, Osman II soon sought to assert himself as a ruler, and after securing the empire's eastern border by signing a peace treaty (Treaty of Serav) with Safavid Persia, he personally led the Ottoman campaign against Poland and King Sigismund III during the Moldavian Magnate Wars, also having his younger brother Mehmed strangled just before he left Istanbul on campaign. Forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty with the Poles after the Battle of Khotyn (Chocim) in September\u2013October, 1621, Osman II returned home to Constantinople in shame, blaming the cowardice of the Janissaries and the insufficiency of his statesmen for his humiliation.\nThe basic and exceptional weakness from which Osman II suffered was the conspicuous absence of a female power basis in the harem. From 1620 until Osman's death, a governess (\"daye hatun\", lit. wet-nurse) was appointed as a stand-in valide, and she could not counterbalance the contriving of Mustafa I's mother in the Old Palace. Although he did have a loyal chief black eunuch at his side, this could not compensate for the absence of what in the politics of that period was a winning combination, valide sultan\u2013chief black eunuch, especially in the case of a young and very ambitious ruler. According to Piterberg, Osman II did not have haseki sultan, opposite with Peirce who claim that Ay\u015fe was Osman's haseki. But it is clear that Ay\u015fe was politically insignificant and she couldn't be a valide support for Osman's reign.\nIn the autumn of 1620, \u00d6zi Beylerbeyi \u0130skender Pasha seized the secret letter sent by Transylvanian Prince Bethlen Gabor to Istanbul and sent it to Poland, and Osman also became a veteran of the people around him. He decided to embark on a Polish expedition. Continuing preparations for the Polish campaign, neither cold nor famine nor the English ambassador John Eyre could deter Osman. The ambassador of Sigismund III, the King of Poland, was brought into Istanbul despite the severe colds. The janissaries and army were not willing to go on a campaign, regardless of their conditions.\nAttempted reforms.\nAfter the death of Suleiman I the empire, a period of hugely increased power of the Janissary corps, local leaders and jurists over the internal and external affairs of the empire had persisted, paired with a great decline in the power of the sultan, who by this point was little more than a figurehead. This was showcased in 1618, by the deposition of sultan Mustafa I after only three months in power by the chief harem eunuch, Mustafa Agha, showing another example of the vastly weakened sultanate. According to one Ottoman chronicler, the 'weak-mindedness and deranged nature' of the sultan was clear. In public he reportedly would gesture repeatedly as if throwing coins onto the ground, possibly meaning he was traumatized by throwing coins to the Janissaries. Sultans had become empty shells of power, whose deposition and execution had become legal, at least according to many scholars of the time.\nUpon Osman's return to the Ottoman capital of Istanbul, the young sultan hoped to retake power over the empire from the hands of the Janissaries and jurists, recentralising power in the sultan. He was aiming to dissolve the Janissary corps and replace it with a new, more loyal army equipped with muskets and recruited from peasants and nomads of Anatolia and Syria, as well as Arab, Kurdish and Druze mercenaries. He also wished to relocate the Ottoman capital to Damascus, and planned to take the Hajj to Mecca, which no other sultan had ever done. The Janissaries and jurists strongly opposed his 'turn to the East', and the Janissaries feared the threat of a new army replacing them. Osman's ideas had made him many enemies in the empire.\nGreat winter of 1621.\nFollowing the murder of \u015eehzade Mehmed on 12 January 1621, a heavy snow started falling in Istanbul. The people of Istanbul were drastically affected by the cold, which increased local violence on 24 January, more so than the palace murder. This is the biggest natural disaster that concerns the capital in Osman's four-year short reign. Bostanzade Yahya Efendi, one of those who lived through this cold, remarked that the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus were covered with ice from the end of January to beginning of February: \"Between \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and Be\u015fikta\u015f, the men walk around and go to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar. They came from Istanbul on foot. And the year became a gala (famine).\nIt was snowing for 15 days, that the frosts were frozen from the severity of the cold, but the river was open between Sarayburnu and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar. For this natural disaster, thirty thousand froze between \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and Istanbul from the cold,\" said Ha\u015fimi \u00c7elebi, \"The road became \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, the Mediterranean froze a thousand thirty\". As a result of the inconvenience of the Zahire ships, there was a complete famine in Istanbul, and 75 kurush of bread jumped to one akche, and the oak of the meat to 15 akches.\nDeath.\nDue to these reforms seeking a counterweight to Janissary influence, as well as Osman II closing the Janissary coffee shops (the gathering points for conspiracies against the throne), the very day Osman was due to set out recruiting his new, more loyal army a palace uprising by the janissaries began with the Janissaries killing the chief harem eunuch Suleiman Agha, then located and promptly imprisoned the young sultan in Yedikule Fortress in Istanbul, where Osman II was strangled to death. After Osman's death, his ear was cut off (and possibly his nose) and presented to Halime Sultan and Sultan Mustafa I to confirm his death and Mustafa would no longer need to fear his nephew. It was the first time in the Ottoman history that a sultan was executed by the janissaries.\nThis disaster is one of the most discussed topics in Ottoman history. Hasanbegzade, Kara\u00e7elebizade, Solakzade, Pe\u00e7evi, M\u00fcneccimba\u015f\u0131 and Naima dates, in the Fezleke of Katip \u00c7elebi, detailed and some of them were narrated in a story style.\nFamily.\nConsorts.\nOsman II had at least four consorts:\nSons.\nOsman II had at least two sons:\nDaughters.\nOsman II had at least a daughter:\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2015 Turkish television series \"\", Osman II was portrayed by actor Taner \u00d6lmez.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "22496", "revid": "48984234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22496", "title": "Oberon (programming language)", "text": "General-purpose programming language\nOberon is a general-purpose programming language first published in 1987 by Niklaus Wirth and the latest member of the Wirthian family of ALGOL-like languages (Euler, ALGOL W, Pascal, Modula, and Modula-2). Oberon was the result of a concentrated effort to increase the power of Modula-2, the direct successor of Pascal, and simultaneously to reduce its complexity. Its principal new feature is the concept of data type extension of record types. It permits constructing new data types on the basis of existing ones and to relate them, deviating from the dogma of strict static typing of data. Type extension is Wirth's way of inheritance reflecting the viewpoint of the parent site. Oberon was developed as part of the implementation of an operating system, also named Oberon at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. The name was inspired both by the Voyager space probe's pictures of the moon of the planet Uranus, named Oberon, and because Oberon is famous as the king of the elves.\nOberon was maintained by Wirth and the latest Project Oberon compiler update is dated 6 March 2020.\nDesign.\nOberon is designed with a motto attributed to Albert Einstein in mind: \"Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.\" The principal guideline was to concentrate on features that are basic and essential and to omit ephemeral issues. Another factor was recognition of the growth of complexity in languages such as C++ and Ada. In contrast to these, Oberon emphasizes the use of the library concept to extend the language. Enumeration and subrange types, which were present in Modula-2, were omitted, and set types are limited to sets of integers. All imported items must be qualified by the name of the module where they are declared. Low-level facilities are highlighted by only allowing them to be used in a module which includes the identifier codice_1 in its import list. Strict type checking, even across modules, and index checking at runtime, null pointer checking, and the safe type extension concept largely allow programming to rely on the language rules alone.\nThe intent of this strategy was to produce a language that is easier to learn, simpler to implement, and very efficient. Oberon compilers have been viewed as compact and fast, while providing code quality comparable to commercial compilers.\nCharacteristics.\nFeatures characterizing the Oberon language include:\nObject orientation.\nOberon supports extension of record types for the construction of abstractions and heterogeneous structures. In contrast to the later dialects, Oberon-2 and Active Oberon, the original Oberon lacks a dispatch mechanism as a language feature but has it as a programming technique or design pattern. This gives great flexibility in OOP. In the Oberon operating system, two programming techniques are used together for the dispatch call: Method suite and Message handler.\nMethod suite.\nIn this technique, a table of procedure variables is defined and a global variable of this type is declared in the extended module and assigned back in the generic module:\n MODULE Figures; \"(* Abstract module *)\"\n TYPE\n Figure* = POINTER TO FigureDesc;\n Interface* = POINTER TO InterfaceDesc;\n InterfaceDesc* = RECORD\n draw* : PROCEDURE (f : Figure);\n clear* : PROCEDURE (f : Figure);\n mark* : PROCEDURE (f : Figure);\n move* : PROCEDURE (f : Figure; dx, dy : INTEGER);\n END;\n FigureDesc* = RECORD\n if : Interface;\n END;\n PROCEDURE Init* (f : Figure; if : Interface);\n BEGIN\n f.if := if\n END Init;\n PROCEDURE Draw* (f : Figure);\n BEGIN\n f.if.draw(f)\n END Draw;\n \"(* Other procedures here *)\"\n END Figures.\nWe extend the generic type Figure to a specific shape:\n MODULE Rectangles;\n IMPORT Figures;\n TYPE\n Rectangle* = POINTER TO RectangleDesc;\n RectangleDesc* = RECORD\n (Figures.FigureDesc)\n x, y, w, h : INTEGER;\n END;\n VAR\n if : Figures.Interface;\n PROCEDURE New* (VAR r : Rectangle);\n BEGIN\n NEW(r);\n Figures.Init(r, if)\n END New;\n PROCEDURE Draw* (f : Figure);\n VAR\n r : Rectangle;\n BEGIN\n r := f(Rectangle); \"(* f AS Rectangle *)\"\n END Draw;\n (* Other procedures here *)\n BEGIN \"(* Module initialisation *)\"\n NEW(if);\n if.draw := Draw;\n if.clear := Clear;\n if.mark := Mark;\n if.move := Move\n END Rectangles.\nDynamic dispatch is only done via procedures in Figures module that is the generic module.\nMessage handler.\nThis technique consists of replacing the set of methods with a single procedure, which discriminates among the various methods:\n MODULE Figures; \"(* Abstract module *)\"\n TYPE\n Figure* = POINTER TO FigureDesc;\n Message* = RECORD END;\n DrawMsg* = RECORD (Message) END;\n ClearMsg* = RECORD (Message) END;\n MarkMsg* = RECORD (Message) END;\n MoveMsg* = RECORD (Message) dx*, dy* : INTEGER END;\n Handler* = PROCEDURE (f : Figure; VAR msg : Message);\n FigureDesc* = RECORD\n \"(* Abstract *)\"\n handle : Handler;\n END;\n PROCEDURE Handle* (f : Figure; VAR msg : Message);\n BEGIN\n f.handle(f, msg)\n END Handle;\n PROCEDURE Init* (f : Figure; handle : Handler);\n BEGIN\n f.handle := handle\n END Init;\n END Figures.\nWe extend the generic type Figure to a specific shape:\n MODULE Rectangles;\n IMPORT Figures;\n TYPE\n Rectangle* = POINTER TO RectangleDesc;\n RectangleDesc* = RECORD\n (Figures.FigureDesc)\n x, y, w, h : INTEGER;\n END;\n PROCEDURE Draw* (r : Rectangle);\n BEGIN\n END Draw;\n \"(* Other procedures here *)\"\n PROCEDURE Handle* (f: Figure; VAR msg: Figures.Message);\n VAR\n r : Rectangle;\n BEGIN\n r := f(Rectangle);\n IF msg IS Figures.DrawMsg THEN Draw(r)\n ELSIF msg IS Figures.MarkMsg THEN Mark(r)\n ELSIF msg IS Figures.MoveMsg THEN Move(r, msg(Figures.MoveMsg).dx, msg(Figures.MoveMsg).dy)\n ELSE (* ignore *)\n END\n END Handle;\n PROCEDURE New* (VAR r : Rectangle);\n BEGIN\n NEW(r);\n Figures.Init(r, Handle)\n END New;\n END Rectangles.\nIn the Oberon operating system both of these techniques are used for dynamic dispatch. The first one is used for a known set of methods; the second is used for any new methods declared in the extension module. For example, if the extension module Rectangles were to implement a new Rotate() procedure, within the Figures module it could only be called via a message handler.\nImplementations and variants.\nOberon.\nNo-cost implementations of Oberon (the language) and Oberon (the operating system) can be found on the Internet (several are from ETHZ itself).\nOberon-2.\nA few changes were made to the first released specification. For example, object-oriented programming (OOP) features were added, the codice_2 loop was reinstated. The result was \"Oberon-2\". One release, named \"Native Oberon\" which includes an operating system, and can directly boot on IBM PC compatible class hardware. A .NET implementation of Oberon with some added minor .NET-related extensions was also developed at ETHZ. In 1993, an ETHZ university spin-off company brought a dialect of Oberon-2 to the market named \"Oberon-L\". In 1997, it was renamed \"Component Pascal\".\nOberon-2 compilers developed by ETH include versions for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris, and classic Mac OS. Implementations from other sources exist for some other operating systems, including Atari TOS and AmigaOS.\nThere is an Oberon-2 Lex scanner and Yacc parser by Stephen J Bevan of Manchester University, UK, based on the one in the M\u00f6ssenb\u00f6ck and Wirth reference. It is at version 1.4.\nOther compilers include Oxford Oberon-2, which also understands Oberon-07, and Vishap Oberon. The latter is based on Josef Templ's Oberon to C language source-to-source compiler (transpiler) named Ofront, which in turn is based on the OP2 Compiler developed by Regis Crelier at ETHZ.\nOberon-07.\nOberon-07, defined by Niklaus Wirth in 2007 and revised in 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 is based on the original version of Oberon rather than Oberon-2. The main changes are: explicit numeric conversion functions (e.g., codice_3 and codice_4) must be used; the codice_5, codice_6 and codice_7 statements were omitted; codice_8 statements were extended; codice_9 statements can be used for type extension tests; codice_10 statements can only be connected to the end of a function; imported variables and structured value parameters are read-only; and, arrays can be assigned without using codice_11.\nOberon-07 compilers have been developed for use with many different computer systems. Wirth's compiler targets a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor of his own design that was used to implement the 2013 version of the Project Oberon operating system on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) Spartan-3 board. Ports of the RISC processor to FPGA Spartan-6, Spartan-7, Artix-7 and a RISC emulator for Windows (compilable on Linux and macOS, and binaries available for Windows) also exist. https:// compiles via C and can be used on any Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compatible operating system. The commercial http:// implementation targets STM ARM Cortex-M0, M3, M4, M7 and Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP2350 microcontrollers. The https:// compiler produces 64-bit Windows binaries. http:// produces 32-bit Windows binaries and implements revision 2008 of the language. https:// produces binaries for both Windows and Linux. http:// translates Oberon to JavaScript. There is https://. https:// is an implementation for the Java virtual machine.\nActive Oberon.\nActive Oberon is yet another variant of Oberon, which adds objects (with object-centered access protection and local activity control), system-guarded assertions, preemptive priority scheduling and a changed syntax for methods (named \"type-bound procedures\" in Oberon vocabulary). Objects may be active, which means that they may be threads or processes. Further, Active Oberon has a way to implement operators (including overloading), an advanced syntax for using arrays (see http:// and Proceedings of the 7th Joint Modular Languages Conference 2006 Oxford, UK), and knows about namespaces. The operating system A2 (formerly \"Active Object System\" (AOS), then \"Bluebottle\"), especially the kernel, synchronizes and coordinates different active objects.\nETHZ has released Active Oberon which supports active objects, and the operating systems based thereon (Active Object System (AOS), Bluebottle, A2), and environment (JDK, HTTP, FTP, etc.) for the language. As with many prior designs from ETHZ, versions of both are available for download on the Internet. As of 2003, supported central processing units (CPUs) include single and dual core x86, and StrongARM.\nRelated languages.\nDevelopment continued on languages in this family. A further extension of Oberon-2 was originally named Oberon/L but later renamed to Component Pascal (CP). CP was developed for Windows and classic Mac OS by Oberon microsystems, a commercial spin-off company from ETHZ, and for .NET by Queensland University of Technology. Further, the languages \"Lagoona\" and \"Obliq\" carry Oberon methods into specialized areas.\nLater .NET development efforts at ETHZ focused on a new language named Zonnon. This includes the features of Oberon and restores some from Pascal (enumerated types, built-in IO) but has some syntactic differences. Other features include support for active objects, operator overloading, and exception handling.\nOberon-V (originally named Seneca, after Seneca the Younger) is a descendant of Oberon designed for numerical applications on supercomputers, especially vector or pipelined architectures. It includes array constructors and an codice_12 statement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22497", "revid": "13403767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22497", "title": "OpenGL", "text": "Cross-platform graphics API\n \nOpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.\nSilicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) began developing OpenGL in 1991 and released it on June 30, 1992. It is used for a variety of applications, including computer-aided design (CAD), video games, scientific visualization, virtual reality, and flight simulation. Since 2006, OpenGL has been managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group.\nDesign.\nThe OpenGL specification describes an abstract application programming interface (API) for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. It is designed to be implemented mostly or entirely using hardware acceleration such as a GPU, although it is possible for the API to be implemented entirely in software running on a CPU.\nThe API is defined as a set of functions which may be called by the client program, alongside a set of named integer constants (for example, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D, which corresponds to the decimal number 3553). Although the function definitions are superficially similar to those of the programming language C, they are language-independent. As such, OpenGL has many language bindings, some of the most noteworthy being the JavaScript binding WebGL (API, based on OpenGL ES 2.0, for 3D rendering from within a web browser); the C bindings WGL, GLX and CGL; the C binding provided by iOS; and the Java and C bindings provided by Android.\nIn addition to being language-independent, OpenGL is also cross-platform. The specification says nothing on the subject of obtaining and managing an OpenGL context, leaving this as a detail of the underlying windowing system. For the same reason, OpenGL is purely concerned with rendering, providing no APIs related to input, audio, or windowing.\nDevelopment.\nOpenGL is no longer in active development; whereas between 2001 and 2014, OpenGL specification was updated mostly on a yearly basis, with two releases (3.1 and 3.2) taking place in 2009 and three (3.3, 4.0 and 4.1) in 2010. The latest OpenGL specification 4.6 was released in 2017 after a three-year break, and was limited to inclusion of eleven existing ARB and EXT extensions into the core profile.\nActive development of OpenGL was dropped in favor of the Vulkan API, released in 2016, and codenamed glNext during initial development. In 2017, Khronos Group announced that OpenGL ES would not have new versions\n and has since concentrated on development of Vulkan and other technologies. As a result, certain capabilities offered by modern GPUs, e.g. ray tracing, are not supported by the OpenGL standard. However, support for newer features might be provided through the vendor-specific OpenGL extensions.\nNew versions of the OpenGL specifications are released by the Khronos Group, each of which extends the API to support various new features. The details of each version are decided by consensus between the Group's members, including graphics card manufacturers, operating system designers, and general technology companies such as Mozilla and Google.\nIn addition to the features required by the core API, graphics processing unit (GPU) vendors may provide additional functionality in the form of \"extensions\". Extensions may introduce new functions and new constants, and may relax or remove restrictions on existing OpenGL functions. Vendors can use extensions to expose custom APIs without needing support from other vendors or the Khronos Group as a whole, which greatly increases the flexibility of OpenGL. All extensions are collected in, and defined by, the OpenGL Registry.\nThe features introduced by each new version of OpenGL are typically formed from the combined features of several widely implemented extensions, especially extensions of type ARB or EXT.\nDocumentation.\nThe OpenGL Architecture Review Board released a series of manuals along with the specification which have been updated to track changes in the API. These are commonly referred to by the colors of their covers:\nOpenGL Programming Guide, 9th Edition. \nThe Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.5 with SPIR-V\nOpenGL Shading Language, 3rd edition. \nA tutorial and reference book for GLSL.\nHistoric books (pre-OpenGL 2.0):\nOpenGL Programming for the X Window System. \nA book about X11 interfacing and OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).\nOpenGL Reference manual, 4th edition. \nEssentially a hard-copy printout of the Unix manual (man) pages for OpenGL.\nIncludes a poster-sized fold-out diagram showing the structure of an idealised OpenGL implementation.\nOpenGL Programming for Windows 95 and Windows NT. \nA book about interfacing OpenGL with Microsoft Windows.\nOpenGL's documentation is also accessible via its official webpage.\nAssociated libraries.\nThe earliest versions of OpenGL were released with a companion library called the OpenGL Utility Library (GLU). It provided simple, useful features which were unlikely to be supported in contemporary hardware, such as tessellating, and generating mipmaps and primitive shapes. The GLU specification was last updated in 1998 and depends on OpenGL features which are now deprecated.\nContext and window toolkits.\nGiven that creating an OpenGL context is quite a complex process, and given that it varies between operating systems, automatic OpenGL context creation has become a common feature of several game-development and user-interface libraries, including SDL, Allegro, SFML, FLTK, and Qt. A few libraries have been designed solely to produce an OpenGL-capable window. The first such library was OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT), later superseded by freeglut. GLFW is a newer alternative.\n* GLFW \u2013 A cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse-joystick handler; is more game-oriented\n* freeglut \u2013 A cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse handler; its API is a superset of the GLUT API, and it is more stable and up to date than GLUT\n* OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) \u2013 An old windowing handler, no longer maintained.\n* Allegro 5 \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API focused on game development\n* Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API\n* SFML \u2013 A cross-platform multimedia library with a C++ API and multiple other bindings to languages such as C#, Java, Haskell, and Go\n* FLTK \u2013 A small cross-platform C++ widget library\n* Qt \u2013 A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit. It provides many OpenGL helper objects, which even abstract away the difference between desktop GL and OpenGL ES\n* wxWidgets \u2013 A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit\nExtension loading libraries.\nGiven the high workload involved in identifying and loading OpenGL extensions, a few libraries have been designed which load all available extensions and functions automatically. Examples include OpenGL Easy Extension library (GLEE), OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) and glbinding. Extensions are also loaded automatically by most language bindings, such as Java OpenGL, PyOpenGL and WebGL.\nImplementations.\nMesa 3D is an open-source implementation of OpenGL. It can do pure software rendering, and it may also use hardware acceleration on BSD, Linux, and other platforms by taking advantage of the Direct Rendering Infrastructure. As of version 20.0, it implements version 4.6 of the OpenGL standard.\nHistory.\nIn the 1980s, developing software that could function with a wide range of graphics hardware was a challenge without a cross-platform library. Software developers wrote custom interfaces and drivers for each piece of hardware. This was expensive and resulted in multiplication of effort.\nBy the early 1990s, Silicon Graphics (SGI) was a leader in 3D graphics for workstations. Their IRIS GL API became the industry standard, as IRIS GL was considered easier to use, and it supported immediate mode rendering, therefore being faster than competitors like PHIGS.\nSGI's competitors (including Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM) were also able to bring to market 3D hardware supported by extensions made to the PHIGS standard, which pressured SGI to open source a version of IRIS GL as a public standard called OpenGL.\nHowever, SGI had many customers for whom the change from IRIS GL to OpenGL would demand significant investment. Moreover, IRIS GL had API functions that were irrelevant to 3D graphics. For example, it included a windowing, keyboard and mouse API, in part because it was developed before the X Window System and Sun's NeWS. IRIS GL libraries were heavily tied into SGI's proprietary graphics hardware and could not be open sourced as-is due to hardware patents and trade secrets. These factors required SGI to continue to support the advanced and proprietary Iris Inventor and Iris Performer programming APIs while market support for OpenGL matured.\nOne of the restrictions of IRIS GL was that it only provided access to features supported by the underlying hardware. If the graphics hardware did not support a feature natively, then the application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing software implementations of features unsupported by hardware, allowing applications to use advanced graphics on relatively low-powered systems. OpenGL standardized access to hardware, pushed the development responsibility of hardware interface programs (device drivers) to hardware manufacturers, and delegated windowing functions to the underlying operating system. With so many different kinds of graphics hardware, getting them all to speak the same language in this way had a remarkable impact by giving software developers a higher-level platform for 3D-software development.\nIn 1992, SGI led the creation of the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (OpenGL ARB), the group of companies that would maintain and expand the OpenGL specification in the future. Two years later, they also played with the idea of releasing something called \"OpenGL++\" which included elements such as a scene-graph API (presumably based on their Performer technology). The specification was circulated among a few interested parties \u2013 but never turned into a product.\nReleased in 1996, Microsoft's Direct3D eventually became the main competitor of OpenGL. Over 50 game developers signed an open letter to Microsoft, released on June 12, 1997, calling on the company to actively support OpenGL. On December 17, 1997, Microsoft and SGI initiated the Fahrenheit project, which was a joint effort with the goal of unifying the OpenGL and Direct3D interfaces (and adding a scene-graph API too). In 1998, Hewlett-Packard joined the project. It initially showed some promise of bringing order to the world of interactive 3D computer graphics APIs, but on account of financial constraints at SGI, strategic reasons at Microsoft, and a general lack of industry support, it was abandoned in 1999.\nIn July 2006, the OpenGL Architecture Review Board voted to transfer control of the OpenGL API standard to the Khronos Group.\nIndustry support.\nDespite the emergence of newer graphics APIs like its successor Vulkan or Metal, OpenGL continues to be a widely used standard. This continued relevance is supported by several factors: ongoing development with new extensions and driver optimizations, its cross-platform compatibility, and the availability of compatibility layers like ANGLE and Zink. These layers allow OpenGL to run efficiently on top of Vulkan and Metal, offering a pathway for continued use or gradual transitions for developers.\nHowever, the graphics API landscape has been shifting, where some companies are moving away from OpenGL. Back in June 2018, Apple has deprecated OpenGL APIs on all of their platforms (iOS, macOS and tvOS), strongly encouraging developers to use their proprietary Metal API, which was introduced in 2014.\nGame developers have also begun to adopt newer APIs. id Software, who has been using OpenGL in their games since the late 1990s in games such as GLQuake or some games of the Doom franchise, transitioned away to its successor Vulkan in its id Tech 7 engine in 2016. They first supported Vulkan in an update for their id Tech 6 engine. The company's first licensed use of OpenGL was in its Quake II engine, also known as id Tech 2. In March 2023, Valve removed OpenGL support from Dota 2 in favor of Vulkan. Atypical Games, with support from Samsung, updated their game engine to use Vulkan, rather than OpenGL, across all non-Apple platforms.\nThe Khronos Group, the consortium responsible for OpenGL's development, has stopped providing support for OpenGL. It has not received a number of modern graphics technologies, such as hardware accelerated Ray Tracing, on-GPU video decoding, and advanced anti-aliasing algorithms\nlike Nvidia DLSS and https://\nGoogle's Fuchsia OS, while using Vulkan natively and requiring a Vulkan-conformant GPU, still intends to support OpenGL on top of Vulkan via the ANGLE translation layer.\nVersion history.\nThe first version of OpenGL, version 1.0, was released on June 30, 1992, by Mark Segal and Kurt Akeley. Since then, OpenGL has occasionally been extended by releasing a new version of the specification. Such releases define a baseline set of features which all conforming graphics cards must support, and against which new extensions can more easily be written. Each new version of OpenGL tends to incorporate several extensions which have widespread support among graphics-card vendors, although the details of those extensions may be changed.\nOpenGL 2.0.\n\"Release date\": September 7, 2004\nOpenGL 2.0 was originally conceived by 3Dlabs to address concerns that OpenGL was stagnating and lacked a strong direction. 3Dlabs proposed a number of major additions to the standard. Most of these were, at the time, rejected by the ARB or otherwise never came to fruition in the form that 3Dlabs proposed. However, their proposal for a C-style shading language was eventually completed, resulting in the current formulation of the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL or GLslang). Like the assembly-like shading languages it was replacing, it allowed replacing the fixed-function vertex and fragment pipe with shaders, though this time written in a C-like high-level language.\nThe design of GLSL was notable for making relatively few concessions to the limits of the hardware then available. This harked back to the earlier tradition of OpenGL setting an ambitious, forward-looking target for 3D accelerators rather than merely tracking the state of currently available hardware. The final OpenGL 2.0 specification includes support for GLSL.\nLongs Peak and OpenGL 3.0.\nBefore the release of OpenGL 3.0, the new revision had the codename Longs Peak. At the time of its original announcement, Longs Peak was presented as the first major API revision in OpenGL's lifetime. It consisted of an overhaul to the way that OpenGL works, calling for fundamental changes to the API.\nThe draft introduced a change to object management. The GL 2.1 object model was built upon the state-based design of OpenGL. That is, to modify an object or to use it, one needs to bind the object to the state system, then make modifications to the state or perform function calls that use the bound object.\nBecause of OpenGL's use of a state system, objects must be mutable. That is, the basic structure of an object can change at any time, even if the rendering pipeline is asynchronously using that object. A texture object can be redefined from 2D to 3D. This requires any OpenGL implementations to add a degree of complexity to internal object management.\nUnder the Longs Peak API, object creation would become atomic, using templates to define the properties of an object which would be created with one function call. The object could then be used immediately across multiple threads. Objects would also be immutable; however, they could have their contents changed and updated. For example, a texture could change its image, but its size and format could not be changed.\nTo support backwards compatibility, the old state based API would still be available, but no new functionality would be exposed via the old API in later versions of OpenGL. This would have allowed legacy code bases, such as the majority of CAD products, to continue to run while other software could be written against or ported to the new API.\nLongs Peak was initially due to be finalized in September 2007 under the name OpenGL 3.0, but the Khronos Group announced on October 30 that it had run into several issues that it wished to address before releasing the specification. As a result, the spec was delayed, and the Khronos Group went into a media blackout until the release of the final OpenGL 3.0 spec.\nThe final specification proved far less revolutionary than the Longs Peak proposal. Instead of removing all immediate mode and fixed functionality (non-shader mode), the spec included them as deprecated features. The proposed object model was not included, and no plans have been announced to include it in any future revisions. As a result, the API remained largely the same with a few existing extensions being promoted to core functionality. Among some developer groups this decision caused something of an uproar, with many developers professing that they would switch to DirectX in protest. Most complaints revolved around the lack of communication by Khronos to the development community and multiple features being discarded that were viewed favorably by many. Other frustrations included the requirement of DirectX 10 level hardware to use OpenGL 3.0 and the absence of geometry shaders and instanced rendering as core features.\nOther sources reported that the community reaction was not quite as severe as originally presented, with many vendors showing support for the update.\nOpenGL 3.0.\n\"Release date\": August 11, 2008\nOpenGL 3.0 introduced a deprecation mechanism to simplify future revisions of the API. Certain features, marked as deprecated, could be completely disabled by requesting a \"forward-compatible context\" from the windowing system. OpenGL 3.0 features could still be accessed alongside these deprecated features, however, by requesting a \"full context\".\nDeprecated features include:\nHardware support: Nvidia GeForce 8 Series and newer, ATI Radeon HD 2000 series and newer.\nOpenGL 3.1.\n\"Release date\": March 24, 2009\nOpenGL 3.1 fully removed all of the features which were deprecated in version 3.0, with the exception of wide lines. From this version onwards, it's not possible to access new features using a \"full context\", or to access deprecated features using a \"forward-compatible context\". An exception to the former rule is made if the implementation supports the https:// extension, but this is not guaranteed.\nHardware support: Mesa supports ARM Panfrost with Version 21.0.\nOpenGL 3.2.\n\"Release date\": August 3, 2009\nOpenGL 3.2 further built on the deprecation mechanisms introduced by OpenGL 3.0, by dividing the specification into a \"core profile\" and \"compatibility profile\". Compatibility contexts include the previously removed fixed-function APIs, equivalent to the ARB_compatibility extension released alongside OpenGL 3.1, while core contexts do not. OpenGL 3.2 also included an upgrade to GLSL version 1.50.\nOpenGL 3.3.\n\"Release date:\" March 11, 2010\nMesa supports software Driver SWR, softpipe and for older Nvidia cards with NV50. Several minor additions were made, with the goal of retaining\nas much functionality as possible from OpenGL 4.0, while keeping support for older hardware. Support is also added for GLSL version 3.30, major and minor versions now match with OpenGL.\nOpenGL 4.0.\n\"Release date\": March 11, 2010\nOpenGL 4.0 was released alongside version 3.3. It was designed for hardware able to support Direct3D 11.\nAs in OpenGL 3.0, this version of OpenGL contains a high number of fairly inconsequential extensions, designed to thoroughly expose the abilities of Direct3D 11-class hardware, such as tessellation.\nHardware support: Nvidia GeForce 400 series and newer, AMD Radeon HD 5000 series and newer (FP64 shaders implemented by emulation on some TeraScale GPUs), Intel HD Graphics in Intel Ivy Bridge processors and newer.\nOpenGL 4.1.\n\"Release date\": July 26, 2010\nHardware support: Nvidia GeForce 400 series and newer, AMD Radeon HD 5000 series and newer (FP64 shaders implemented by emulation on some TeraScale GPUs), Intel HD Graphics in Intel Haswell processors and newer (Linux Mesa: Ivy Bridge and newer).

The latest version supported for OpenGL is 4.1 from 2011. A proprietary library from Molten \u2013 authors of MoltenVK \u2013 called MoltenGL, can translate OpenGL calls to Metal.\nThere are several projects that attempt to implement OpenGL on top of Vulkan. The Vulkan backend for Google's ANGLE achieved OpenGL ES 3.1 conformance in July 2020. The Mesa3D project also includes such a driver, called \"Zink\".\nMicrosoft's Windows 11 on Arm added support for OpenGL 3.3 via GLon12, an open source OpenGL implementation on top DirectX 12 via Mesa Gallium.\nVulkan.\nVulkan, formerly named the \"Next Generation OpenGL Initiative\" (glNext), is a ground-up redesign effort to unify OpenGL and OpenGL ES into one common API that will not be backwards compatible with existing OpenGL versions.\nThe initial version of Vulkan API was released on February 16, 2016.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known as an orbital revolution, examples include the trajectory of a planet around a star, a natural satellite around a planet, or an artificial satellite around an object or position in space such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or Lagrange point. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\nFor most situations, orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics, which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law. However, Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime, with orbits following geodesics, provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion.\nHistory.\nHistorically, the apparent motions of the planets were described by European and Arabic philosophers using the idea of celestial spheres. This model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stars and planets were attached. It assumed the heavens were fixed apart from the motion of the spheres and was developed without any understanding of gravity. This concept originated with Hellenistic astronomy, particularly Eudoxus and Aristotle. After the planets' motions were more accurately measured, theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added by Ptolemy. Although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets' positions in the sky, more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate, hence the model became increasingly unwieldy. Originally geocentric, it was modified by Copernicus to place the Sun at the centre to help simplify the model. The model was further challenged during the 16th century, as comets were observed traversing the spheres.\nThe basis for the modern description of orbits was first formulated by Johannes Kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion. First, he found that the orbits of the planets in the Solar System are elliptical, not circular (or epicyclic), as had previously been believed, and that the Sun is not located at the center of the orbits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously been thought, but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planets, the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods.\nJupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter:\n formula_1\nis practically equal to that for Venus,\n formula_2\nin accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits.\nIsaac Newton demonstrated that Kepler's laws were derivable from his theory of gravitation, and that, in general, the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections, under his assumption that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously. To satisfy Kepler's third law, Newton showed that, for a pair of bodies, the orbit size (\"a\"), orbital period (\"T\"), and their combined masses (\"M\") are related to each other by:\n formula_3\nand that those bodies orbit their common center of mass. Where one body is much more massive than the other (as is the case of an artificial satellite orbiting a planet), it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body.\nAdvances in Newtonian mechanics were then used to explore variations from the simple assumptions behind Kepler orbits, such as the perturbations due to other bodies, or the impact of spheroidal rather than spherical bodies. Joseph-Louis Lagrange developed a new approach to Newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than force, and made progress on the three-body problem, discovering the Lagrangian points with Euler. In a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics, in 1846 Urbain Le Verrier was able to predict the position of Neptune based on unexplained perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.\nAlbert Einstein in his 1916 paper \"The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\" explained that gravity was due to curvature of space-time and removed Newton's assumption that changes in gravity propagate instantaneously. This led astronomers to recognize that Newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in understanding orbits. In relativity theory, orbits follow geodesic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the Newtonian predictions (except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds) but the differences are measurable. Essentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy. The original vindication of general relativity is that it was able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in precession of Mercury's perihelion first noted by Le Verrier. However, Newton's solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate.\nPlanetary orbits.\nWithin a planetary system, various non-stellar objects follow elliptical orbits around the system's barycenter. These objects include planets, dwarf planets, asteroids and other minor planets, comets, meteoroids, and even space debris. A comet in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit about a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the star and therefore is not considered part of the star's planetary system. Bodies that are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary system, including natural satellites, artificial satellites, and the objects within ring systems, follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet.\nOwing to mutual gravitational perturbations, the eccentricities and inclinations of the planetary orbits vary over time. Mercury, the smallest planet in the Solar System, has the most eccentric orbit. At the present epoch, Mars has the next largest eccentricity while the smallest orbital eccentricities are seen with Venus and Neptune.\nAs two objects orbit each other, the periapsis is that point at which the two objects are closest to each other. Less properly, \"perifocus\" or \"pericentron\" are used. The apoapsis is that point at which they are the farthest, or sometimes apifocus or apocentron. A line drawn from periapsis to apoapsis is the \"line-of-apsides\". This is the major axis of the ellipse, the line through its longest part.\nMore specific terms are used for specific bodies. For example, \"perigee\" and \"apogee\" are the lowest and highest parts of an orbit around Earth, while \"perihelion\" and \"aphelion\" are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the Sun. Things orbiting the Moon have a perilune and apolune (or periselene and aposelene respectively). An orbit around any star, not just the Sun, has a periastron and an apastron.\nIn the case of planets orbiting a star, the mass of the star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The individual satellites of that star follow their own elliptical orbits with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and the sum of those two energies is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.\nPrinciples.\nAn orbit can be explained by combining Newton's laws of motion with his law of universal gravitation. The laws of motion are as follows:\nBy the first law of motion, in the absence of gravity, a physical object will continue to move in a straight line due to inertia. According to the second law, a force, such as gravity, pulls the moving object toward the body that is the source of the force and thus causes the object to follow a curved trajectory. If the object has enough tangential velocity, it will not fall into the gravitating body but can instead continue to follow the curved trajectory caused by the force indefinitely. The object is then said to be orbiting the body. According to the third law, each body applies an equal force on the other, which means the two bodies orbit around their center of mass, or barycenter.\nBecause of the law of universal gravitation, the strength of the gravitational force depends on the masses of the two bodies and their separation. As the gravity varies over the course of the orbit, it reproduces Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Depending on the evolving energy state of the system, the velocity relationship of two moving objects with mass can be considered in four practical classes, with subtypes:\nTo achieve orbit, conventional rockets are launched vertically at first to lift the rocket above the dense lower atmosphere (which causes frictional drag), and gradually pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbital injection. Once in orbit, their speed keeps them above the atmosphere. If an elliptical orbit dips into dense air, the object will lose speed and re-enter, falling to the ground. Occasionally a space craft will intentionally intercept the atmosphere, in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver.\nIllustration.\nAs an illustration of an orbit around a planet, the Newton's cannonball model may prove useful (see image). This is a 'thought experiment', in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle speed. The effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored (or perhaps the mountain is high enough that the cannon is above the Earth's atmosphere, which is the same thing).\nIf the cannon fires its ball with a low initial speed, the trajectory of the ball curves downward and hits the ground (A). As the firing speed is increased, the cannonball hits the ground farther (B) away from the cannon, because while the ball is still falling towards the ground, the ground is increasingly curving away from it (see first point, above). All these motions are actually \"orbits\" in a technical sense\u2014they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around the center of gravity\u2014but the orbits are interrupted by striking the Earth.\nIf the cannonball is fired with sufficient speed, the ground curves away from the ball at least as much as the ball falls\u2014so the ball never strikes the ground. It is now in what could be called a non-interrupted or circumnavigating, orbit. For any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet, there is one specific firing speed (unaffected by the mass of the ball, which is assumed to be very small relative to the Earth's mass) that produces a circular orbit, as shown in (C).\nAs the firing speed is increased beyond this, non-interrupted elliptic orbits are produced; one is shown in (D). If the initial firing is above the surface of the Earth as shown, there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed; these will come closest to the Earth at the point half an orbit beyond, and directly opposite the firing point, below the circular orbit.\nAt a specific horizontal firing speed called escape velocity, dependent on the mass of the planet and the distance of the object from the barycenter, an open orbit (E) is achieved that has a parabolic path. At even greater speeds the object will follow a range of hyperbolic trajectories. In a practical sense, both of these trajectory types mean the object is \"breaking free\" of the planet's gravity, and \"going off into space\" potentially never to return. However, the object remains under the influence of the Sun's gravity.\nNewton's laws.\nGravity and motion.\nIn most real-world situations, Newton's laws provide a reasonably accurate description of motion of objects in a gravitational field. The adjustments needed to accommodate the theory of relativity become appreciable in cases where the object is in the proximity of a significant gravitational source such as a star, or a high level of accuracy is needed.\nThe acceleration of a body is equal to the combination of the forces acting on it, divided by its mass. The gravitational force acting on a body is proportional to the product of the masses of the two attracting bodies and decreases inversely with the square of the distance between them. For a two-body problem, defined as an isolated system of two spherical bodies with known masses and sufficient separation, this Newtonian approximation of their gravitational interaction can provide a reasonably accurate calculation of their trajectories.\nIf the heavier body is much more massive than the smaller, as in the case of a satellite or small moon orbiting a planet or for the Earth orbiting the Sun, it is accurate enough and convenient to describe the motion in terms of a coordinate system that is centered on the heavier body, and we say that the lighter body is in orbit around the heavier. For the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable, an exact Newtonian solution is still sufficient and can be had by placing the coordinate system at the center of the mass of the system.\nEnergy and conic sections.\nEnergy is associated with gravitational fields. A stationary body far from another can do external work if it is pulled towards it, and therefore has gravitational \"potential energy\". Since work is required to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity, their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated, and decreases as they approach one another. For point masses, the gravitational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separation. It is convenient and conventional to assign the potential energy as having zero value when they are an infinite distance apart, and hence it has a negative value (since it decreases from zero) for smaller finite distances.\nWhen only two gravitational bodies interact, their orbits follow a conic section. The orbit can be open (implying the object never returns) or closed (returning). Which it is depends on the total energy (kinetic + potential energy) of the system. In the case of an open orbit, the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the escape velocity for that position, in the case of a closed orbit, the speed is always less than the escape velocity. Since the kinetic energy is never negative if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation, the bound orbits will have negative total energy, the parabolic trajectories zero total energy, and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy.\nAn open orbit will have a parabolic shape if it has the velocity of exactly the escape velocity at that point in its trajectory, and it will have the shape of a hyperbola when its velocity is greater than the escape velocity. When two bodies approach each other with escape velocity or greater (relative to each other), they will briefly curve around each other at the time of their closest approach, and then separate and fly apart.\nAll closed orbits have the shape of an ellipse. A circular orbit is a special case, wherein the foci of the ellipse coincide.\nKepler's laws.\nBodies following closed orbits repeat their paths with a certain time called the period. This motion is described by the empirical laws of Kepler, which can be mathematically derived from Newton's laws. These can be formulated as follows:\nLimitations of classical mechanics.\nIdeally, the bound orbits of a point mass or a spherical body with a Newtonian gravitational field form closed ellipses, which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely. However, any non-spherical or non-Newtonian effects will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the ellipse. Such effects can be caused by a slight oblateness of the body, mass anomalies, tidal deformations, or relativistic effects, thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance.\nThe two-body solutions were published by Newton in Principia in 1687. In 1912, Karl Fritiof Sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the general three-body problem; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. The restricted three-body problem, in which the third body is assumed to have negligible mass, has been extensively studied. The solutions to this case include the Lagrangian points. In the case of lunar theory, the 19th century work of Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Delaunay allowed the motions of the Moon to be predicted to within its own diameter over a 20-year period. No universally valid method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies.\nFormulation.\nNewtonian analysis of orbital motion.\nThe following derivation applies to an elliptical orbit. The assumption is that the central body is massive enough that it can be considered to be stationary and so the more subtle effects of general relativity can be ignored.\nForce and acceleration.\nThe Newtonian law of gravitation states that the gravitational acceleration of the second mass towards the central body is related to the inverse of the square of the distance between them, namely:\n formula_4\nwhere \"F\"2 is the force acting on the mass \"m\"2 caused by the gravitational attraction mass \"m\"1 has for \"m\"2, \"G\" is the universal gravitational constant, and \"r\" is the distance between the two masses centers.\nFrom Newton's second law, the summation of the forces acting on \"m\"2 related to that body's acceleration:\n formula_5\nwhere \"A\"2 is the acceleration of \"m\"2 caused by the force of gravitational attraction \"F\"2 of \"m\"1 acting on \"m\"2.\nCombining Eq. 1 and 2:\n formula_6\nSolving for the acceleration, \"A\"2:\n formula_7\nwhere formula_8 is the standard gravitational parameter, in this case formula_9. It is understood that the system being described is \"m\"2, hence the subscripts can be dropped.\nPolar coordinates.\nThe position of the orbiting object at the current time formula_10 is located in the orbital plane using vector calculus in polar coordinates, both with the standard Euclidean basis and with the polar basis with the origin coinciding with the center of force. Let formula_11 be the distance between the object and the center and formula_12 be the angle it has rotated. Let formula_13 and formula_14 be the standard Euclidean bases and let:\n formula_15\n formula_16\nbe the radial and transverse polar basis. The first is the unit vector pointing from the central body to the current location of the orbiting object and the second is the orthogonal unit vector pointing in the direction that the orbiting object would travel if orbiting in a counter clockwise circle. Then the vector to the orbiting object is:\n formula_17\nNewton's notation formula_18 and formula_19 denotes the standard derivatives of how this distance and angle change over time. Taking the derivative of a vector to see how it changes over a tiny increment of time, formula_20, subtracts its location at time formula_21 from that at time formula_10 and divides by formula_23. The result remains a vector.\nKepler's second law.\nBecause the basis vector formula_24 moves as the object orbits, the first step is to differentiate it to determine the radial rate of change with time. From time formula_10 to formula_21, the vector formula_24 keeps its beginning at the origin and rotates from angle formula_12 to formula_29, which moves its head a distance formula_30 in the perpendicular direction formula_31, giving a derivative of formula_32.\n formula_33\nThe velocity and acceleration of the orbiting object can now be determined.\n formula_34\nIn the last line, the coefficients of formula_24 and formula_31 give the accelerations in the radial and transverse directions. As said, Newton gives the first due to gravity as formula_37 and the second is zero per Newton's first law. Thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEquation (2) can be rearranged using integration by parts.\n formula_38\nBoth sides can now be multiplied through by formula_11 because it is not zero unless the orbiting object crashes. Having the derivative be zero indicates that the function is a constant.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhich is actually the theoretical proof of Kepler's second law (A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time). The constant of integration, \"h\", is the angular momentum per unit mass.\nKepler's first law.\nIn order to get an equation for the orbit from equation (1), the time variable needs to be eliminated. (See also Binet equation.)\nIn polar coordinates, this would express the distance formula_11 of the orbiting object from the center as a function of its angle formula_12. However, it is easier to introduce the auxiliary variable formula_42 and to express formula_43 as a function of formula_12. Derivatives of formula_45 with respect to time may be rewritten as derivatives of formula_46 with respect to angle.\n formula_47\n formula_48 (reworking (3))\n formula_49\nPlugging these into (1) gives\n formula_50\nHence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSo for the gravitational force \u2013 or, more generally, for \"any\" inverse square force law \u2013 the right hand side of the equation becomes a constant and the equation is seen to be the harmonic equation (up to a shift of origin of the dependent variable). The solution is:\nformula_51\nwhere \"A\" and \"\u03b8\"0 are arbitrary constants. This resulting equation of the orbit of the object is that of an ellipse in Polar form relative to one of the focal points. This is put into a more standard form by letting formula_52 be the eccentricity, which when rearranged we see:\nformula_53\nNote that by letting formula_54 be the semi-major axis and letting formula_55 so the long axis of the ellipse is along the positive \"x\" coordinate yields:\nformula_56\nWhen \"e\" is zero, the result is a circular orbit with \"r\" equal to \"a\".\nKepler's third law.\nIncorporating Newton's laws, the constant in Kepler's third law can be shown to be:\n formula_57\nwhere formula_58 is the mass of the Sun, \"G\" is the gravitational constant, formula_59 is the mass of the planet, formula_60 is the orbital period and formula_61 is the elliptical semi-major axis, and formula_62 is the astronomical unit, the average distance from earth to the sun. From this, the orbital period can be derived from the semi-major axis.\nApplying torque.\nA torque to a satellite can result, for example, due to perturbation from a non-sperical mass. When the two-body system is under the influence of torque, the angular momentum \"h\" is not a constant. After the following calculation:\nformula_63\nThe result is the Sturm-Liouville equation of two-body system. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRelativistic orbital motion.\nThe classical (Newtonian) analysis of orbital mechanics assumes that the more subtle effects of general relativity, such as frame dragging and gravitational time dilation are negligible. Relativistic effects cease to be negligible when near massive bodies (as with the precession of Mercury's orbit about the Sun), or when extreme precision is needed (as with calculations of the orbital elements and time signal references for GPS satellites.)\nBecause of general relativity, there exists a smallest possible radius for which a particle can stably orbit a black hole. Any inward perturbation to this orbit will lead to the particle spiraling into the black hole. The size of this innermost stable circular orbit depends on the spin of the black hole and the spin of the particle itself, but with no rotation the theoretical orbital radius is just three times the radius of the event horizon.\nSpecification.\nSix parameters are required to specify a Keplerian orbit about a body. For example, the three numbers that specify the body's initial position, and the three values that specify its velocity will define a unique orbit that can be calculated forwards (or backwards) in time.\nAn unperturbed orbit is two-dimensional in a plane fixed in space, known as the orbital plane. In three dimensions, the orientation of this plane relative to a plane of reference, such as the plane of the sky, can be determined by three angles. Extending the analysis to three dimensions requires simply rotating the two-dimensional plane to the required angles relative to the poles of the planetary body involved.\nBy tradition, the standard set of orbital elements is called the set of Keplerian elements, after Johannes Kepler and his laws. These six Keplerian elements are as follows:\nThe orbital period is simply how long an orbiting body takes to complete one orbit, which can be derived from the semimajor axis and the combined masses. In principle, once the orbital elements are known for a body, its position can be calculated forward and backward indefinitely in time. However, in practice, orbits are affected or perturbed, by other forces than simple gravity from an assumed point source, and thus the orbital elements change over time.\nNote that, unless the eccentricity is zero, \"a\" is not the average orbital radius. The time-averaged orbital distance is given by:\nformula_64\nwhich only equals \"a\" when \"e\" is zero, for a circular orbit.\nPerturbations.\nAn orbital perturbation is when a force or impulse causes an acceleration that changes the parameters of the orbit over time. This perturbation is much smaller than the overall force or average impulse of the main gravitating body. Potential sources of perturbation include departure from sphericity, third body contributions, radiation pressure, atmospheric drag, and tidal acceleration.\nRadial, transverse, and normal perturbations.\nFor a body in orbit, a perturbing force can be divided into three orthogonal components: radial, transverse, and normal. The first two are in the orbital plane (in the direction of the gravitating body and along the path of a circular orbit, respectively) and the third is away from the orbital plane. A small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the eccentricity, but not the orbital period (to first order). A prograde or retrograde transverse impulse (i.e. an impulse applied along the orbital motion) changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period. Notably, a prograde impulse at periapsis raises the altitude at apoapsis, and vice versa and a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A normal impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point.\nOrbital decay.\nFor an object in a sufficiently close orbit about a planetary body with a significant atmosphere, the orbit can decay because of drag. Particularly at each periapsis for an orbital with appreciable eccentricity, the object experiences atmospheric drag, losing energy. Each time, the orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum. This is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the highest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower. Eventually, the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect. When this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect the central body.\nThe region for experiencing atmospheric drag varies by planet; a re-entry vehicle needs to draw much closer to Mars than to Earth, for example, and the drag is negligible for Mercury. The bounds of an atmosphere vary significantly due to solar forcing and space weather. During a solar maximum, the Earth's atmosphere causes drag up to a hundred kilometres higher than during a solar minimum.\nOrbits can be artificially influenced through the use of rocket engines, which change the kinetic energy of the body at some point in its path. In this way, changes in the orbit shape or orientation can be facilitated. Solar sails or magnetic sails are forms of propulsion that require no propellant or energy input other than that of the Sun, and so can be used indefinitely for station keeping. (See statite for one such proposed use.) Satellites with long conductive tethers can experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the Earth's magnetic field. As the wire cuts the magnetic field it acts as a generator, moving electrons from one end to the other. The orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire.\nFor objects below the synchronous orbit for the body they're orbiting, orbital decay can occur due to tidal forces. The gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary, and since it is below the synchronous orbit, the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface so the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the direction of the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up, and as a result, the orbit decays.\nConversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the Solar System are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. Mars' innermost moon Phobos is a prime example and is expected to either impact Mars' surface or break up into a ring in 20 to 40 million years.\nOrbits can decay via the emission of gravitational waves. This mechanism is extremely weak for most stellar objects, only becoming significant in cases where there is a combination of extreme mass and extreme acceleration, such as compact objects that are orbiting each other closely.\nOblateness.\nThe standard analysis of orbiting bodies assumes that all bodies consist of uniform spheres, or more generally, concentric shells each of uniform density. Mathematically, such bodies are gravitationally equivalent to point sources per the shell theorem. However, in the real world, many bodies rotate, and this introduces oblateness; known as an equatorial bulge. This adds a quadrupole moment to the gravitational field, which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the body. In the general case, the gravitational potential of a rotating body such as a planet can be expanded in multipoles to account for the departure from spherical symmetry.\nFrom the point of view of satellite dynamics, of particular relevance are the so-called even zonal harmonic coefficients, or even zonals, since they induce secular orbital perturbations which are cumulative over time spans longer than the orbital period. They do depend on the orientation of the body's symmetry axis in the space, affecting, in general, the whole orbit, with the exception of the semimajor axis.\nTidal locking.\nTidal locking between a pair of co-orbiting astronomical bodies occurs when one of the objects reaches a state where there is no longer any net transfer of angular momentum over the course of a complete orbit. Their gravitational interaction forces steady changes to their orbits and rotation rates as a result of energy exchange and heat dissipation until the locked state is formed. The object tends to stay in this state because leaving it would require adding energy back into the system. An example is the planet Mercury, which is locked in a state of completing three rotations about its axis for every two orbits.\nIn the case where a tidally locked body possesses synchronous rotation, the object takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner. In this case, one side of the celestial body is permanently facing its host object. This is the case for the Earth's Moon and for both members of the Pluto-Charon system.\nMultiple gravitating bodies.\nThe effects of other gravitating bodies can be significant. For example, the orbit of the Moon cannot be accurately described without allowing for the action of the Sun's gravity as well as the Earth's. One approximate result is that bodies will usually have reasonably stable orbits around a heavier planet or moon, in spite of these perturbations, provided they are orbiting well within the heavier body's Hill sphere.\nA long-term impact of multi-body interactions can be apsidal precession, which is a gradual rotation of the line between the apsides. For an elliptical system, the result is a rosetta orbit. The ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus noted just such an apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit, as the revolution of the Moon's apogee with a period of approximately 8.85 years. Apsidal precession can result from tidal perturbation, rotational perturbation, general relativity, or a combination of these effects. The detection of apsidal precession in a distant binary star system can be an indicator of the purturbative effect of an unseen third stellar companion.\nWhen there are more than two gravitating bodies it is referred to as an n-body problem. Most n-body problems have no closed form solution, although some special cases have been formulated.\nApproaches to many-body problems.\nRather than an exact closed form solution, orbits with many bodies can be approximated with arbitrarily high accuracy. One method is to take the pure elliptic motion as a basis and add perturbation terms to account for the gravitational influence of multiple bodies. This is convenient for calculating the positions of astronomical bodies. The equations of motion of the moons, planets, and other bodies are known with great accuracy, and are used to generate tables for celestial navigation. Still, there are secular phenomena that have to be dealt with by post-Newtonian methods.\nAn incremental approach uses differential equations for scientific or mission-planning purposes. According to Newton's laws, each of the gravitational forces acting on a body will depend on the separation from the sources. Therefore accelerations can be expressed in terms of positions. The perturbation terms are much easier to describe in this form. Predicting subsequent positions and velocities from initial values of position and velocity corresponds to solving an initial value problem. Numerical methods calculate the positions and velocities of the objects a short time in the future, then repeat the calculation ad nauseam. However, tiny arithmetic errors from the limited accuracy of a computer's math are cumulative, which limits the long-term accuracy of this approach.\nDifferential simulations with large numbers of objects perform the calculations in a hierarchical pairwise fashion between centers of mass. Using this scheme, galaxies, star clusters and other large assemblages of objects have been simulated.\nRadiation and magnetic fields.\nFor smaller bodies particularly, light and stellar wind can cause significant perturbations to the attitude and direction of motion of the body, and over time can be significant. Objects with residual magnetic fields can interact with a planetary magnetosphere, perturbing their orbit. Of the planetary bodies, the motion of asteroids is particularly affected over large periods by the Yarkovsky effect when the asteroids are rotating relative to the Sun.\nStrange orbits.\nMathematicians have discovered that it is possible in principle to have multiple bodies in non-elliptical orbits that repeat periodically, although most such orbits are not stable regarding small perturbations in mass, position, or velocity. However, some special stable cases have been identified, including a planar figure-eight orbit occupied by three moving bodies. Further studies have discovered that nonplanar orbits are also possible, including one involving 12 masses moving in 4 roughly circular, interlocking orbits topologically equivalent to the edges of a cuboctahedron.\nFinding such orbits naturally occurring in the universe is thought to be extremely unlikely, because of the improbability of the required conditions occurring by chance.\nAstrodynamics.\nOrbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is a core discipline within space mission design and control. Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity, including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets. Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbit plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers. General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the Sun or planets).\nScaling in gravity.\nThe gravitational constant \"G\" has been calculated as:.\nThus the constant has dimension density\u22121 time\u22122. This corresponds to the following properties.\nScaling of distances (including sizes of bodies, while keeping the densities the same) gives similar orbits without scaling the time: if for example distances are halved, masses are divided by 8, gravitational forces by 16 and gravitational accelerations by 2. Hence velocities are halved and orbital periods and other travel times related to gravity remain the same. For example, when an object is dropped from a tower, the time it takes to fall to the ground remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the Earth.\nScaling of distances while keeping the masses the same (in the case of point masses, or by adjusting the densities) gives similar orbits; if distances are multiplied by 4, gravitational forces and accelerations are divided by 16, velocities are halved and orbital periods are multiplied by 8.\nWhen all densities are multiplied by 4, orbits are the same; gravitational forces are multiplied by 16 and accelerations by 4, velocities are doubled and orbital periods are halved.\nWhen all densities are multiplied by 4, and all sizes are halved, orbits are similar; masses are divided by 2, gravitational forces are the same, gravitational accelerations are doubled. Hence velocities are the same and orbital periods are halved.\nIn all these cases of scaling. if densities are multiplied by 4, times are halved; if velocities are doubled, forces are multiplied by 16.\nThese properties are illustrated in the formula (derived from the formula for the orbital period)\nformula_65\nfor an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis \"a\", of a small body around a spherical body with radius \"r\" and average density \"\u03c1\", where \"T\" is the orbital period.

A bowler who uses this technique is called an off spinner. Off spinners bowl with their right-arm and a finger spin action. Their normal delivery is called an off break, which spins from left to right (from the bowler's perspective) when the ball bounces on the pitch. For a right-handed batter, the ball breaks towards them from the off side, hence the name 'off break'.\nOff spinners bowl mostly off breaks, varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries. Off spinners also bowl other types of delivery, which spin differently. Aside from these variations in spin, varying the speed, length and flight of the ball are also important for the off spinner.\nThe bowler with the most wickets in the history of both Test matches and ODIs, Muttiah Muralitharan, was an off spinner.\nHistory.\nAlthough rare now, in the past there were bowlers who used the off-break action who deliberately did not impart any considerable spin on the ball but relied on line and length (or even speed variations) to frustrate batters. They endeavoured to pitch the ball in an area that the batter was unable to play a scoring shot, even making last moment adjustments to \"follow\" a batter should they move within the crease to negate the bowlers tactics. Whilst this is primarily a defensive style, wickets were achieved by forcing a batsman to make a rash stroke or even bowling at the stumps instead of the retreating batter. Another wicket taking method was to impart more spin on the ball than usual, and surprise the batsman. An exponent of this style of bowling was \"Flat\" Jack Simmons who played for Lancashire and Tasmania in the 1970s and 1980s. With the advent of limited overs cricket promoting more adventurous batting styles and the use of ever heavier bats this style of bowling has declined, although some off-spinners will still use this tactic when the pitch is offering very little or no \"turn\". It is a tactic often used by Kane Williamson when he bowls occasionally in limited overs format because his bowling style tends to be flatter and faster.\nComparison with other types of spin bowling.\nOff spin contrasts with leg spin, in which the ball spins from leg to off and which is bowled with a very different action (wrist spin). Off spin is generally considered less difficult to play than leg spin, as off breaks typically spin less than leg breaks, and do not generally possess the same loopy, potentially deceptive flight. In addition, off spinners tend to have a smaller repertoire of deliveries to choose from. For a right-handed batter, the ball moves in towards the batter's body, meaning the batter's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batter out bowled or caught from an off break, but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket, assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump. However, the off spinner often bowls faster and more accurately than a leg spinner, and can therefore deceive the batter with changes in the pace of the ball. A left-handed batter has more difficulty facing off break bowling, because the ball moves away from their body. This means that any miscalculation can more easily result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders.\nA left-handed bowler who bowls with the same (finger spin) action as an off spinner is known as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler. While the orthodox spinner has the same action as an off-spinner, the ball itself spins in the opposite direction (akin to a right arm leg spinner). Such a ball is not normally called an off break, but a \"left-arm orthodox spinner\".\nTerminology.\nOff spin: Sometimes the term off spin is used to mean the off break delivery. At other times the term off spin has a wider meaning, to include all deliveries bowled by an off spinner, including non-off break deliveries.\nOff spinner: The term off spinner can be used to mean either the bowler or the off break delivery.\nOffie: The term offie can also be used to mean either the bowler or the off break delivery.\nTechnique.\nAn off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the fingers roll down the right side of the ball (for a right-handed bowler), giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind.\nNotable off spinners.\nNotable off spinners include:\nand more...\nOther deliveries bowled by off spin bowlers.\nAnother common weapon of the off spinner is the arm ball, which does not spin but goes straight on \"with the arm\". More skilled off-spinners also have the topspinner.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The song was originally commissioned by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Th\u00e9odore Robitaille for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony; Calixa Lavall\u00e9e composed the music, after which French-language words were written by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. \nThe original French lyrics were translated to English in 1906. Multiple English versions ensued, with Robert Stanley Weir's 1908 version (which was not a translation of the French lyrics) gaining the most popularity; the Weir lyrics eventually served as the basis for the official lyrics enacted by Parliament. Weir's English-language lyrics have been revised three times, most recently when \"An Act to amend the National Anthem Act (gender)\" was enacted in 2018. The French lyrics remain unaltered. \n\"O Canada\" had served as a \"de facto\" national anthem since 1939, officially becoming the country's national anthem in 1980 when Canada's \"National Anthem Act\" received royal assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year's Dominion Day (today's Canada Day) celebrations.\nMelody.\n\"O Canada\" is a 28-bar song originally written in the key of F major for four voices and piano, as a march in 4/4 time to be played \"\" (\"majestic and resolved\").

At that time, the \"Chant National\", also by Routhier, was popular amongst Francophones as an anthem, while \"God Save the Queen\" and \"The Maple Leaf Forever\" had, since 1867, been competing as unofficial national anthems in English Canada. \"O Canada\" joined that fray when a group of school children sang it for the 1901 tour of Canada by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall (later King George V and Queen Mary). This was the first known performance of the song outside Quebec.\nFive years later, the Whaley and Royce company in Toronto published the music with the French text and a first translation into English by Thomas Bedford Richardson and, in 1908, \"Collier's Weekly\" magazine held a competition to write new English lyrics for \"O Canada\". The competition was won by Mercy E. Powell McCulloch, but her version never gained wide acceptance. In fact, many made English translations of Routhier's words; however, the most popular version was created in 1908 by Robert Stanley Weir, a lawyer and Recorder of the City of Montreal. Weir's lyrics from 1908 contained no religious references and used the phrase \"thou dost in us command\" before they were changed by Weir in 1913 to read \"in all thy sons command\". In 1926, a fourth verse of a religious nature was added. A slightly modified version was officially published for the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation in 1927, and gradually it became the most widely accepted and performed version of this song.\nThe tune was thought to have become the \"de facto\" national anthem after King George VI remained at attention during its playing at the dedication of the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Ontario, on May 21, 1939; though George was actually following a precedent set by his brother, Edward, the previous king of Canada, when he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France in 1936. By-laws and practices governing the use of song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"God Save the King\" or \"God Save the Queen\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"O Canada\".\nMusicologist Ross Duffin has argued that Lavall\u00e9e constructed the melody for \"O Canada\" by adapting material by Mozart (\"March of the Priests\", measures 1\u20138), Wagner (\"Wach auf, es nahet gen den Tag\", measures 9\u201316), Liszt (\"Festkl\u00e4nge\", measures 17\u201320), and Matthias Keller (\"The American Hymn\", measures 21\u201328).\nAdoption.\nPrime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and the government resolved to form a joint committee to review the status of the two musical works. The next year, Pearson put to the House of Commons a motion that \"the government be authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to provide that 'O Canada' shall be the National Anthem of Canada while 'God Save the Queen' shall be the Royal Anthem of Canada\", of which parliament approved. In 1967, the Prime Minister advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems; the group first met in February and, within two months, on April 12, 1967, presented its conclusion that \"O Canada\" should be designated as the national anthem and \"God Save the Queen\" as the royal anthem of Canada, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song. For \"O Canada\", the Robert Stanley Weir version of 1908 was recommended for the English words, with a few minor changes: two of the \"stand on guard\" phrases were replaced with \"from far and wide\" and \"God keep our land\".\nIn 1970, the Queen in Right of Canada purchased the right to the lyrics and music of \"O Canada\" from Gordon V. Thompson Music for $1. The song finally became the official national anthem in 1980 with the passage of the \"National Anthem Act.\" The Act replaced two of the repetitions of the phrase \"We stand on guard\" in the English lyrics, as had been proposed by the Senate Special Joint Committee. This change was controversial with traditionalists and, for several years afterwards, it was not uncommon to hear people still singing the old lyrics at public events. In contrast, the French lyrics are unchanged from the original version.\nInclusive language debates.\nIn June 1990, Toronto City Council voted 12 to 7 in favour of recommending to the Canadian government that the phrase \"our home and native land\" be changed to \"our home and cherished land\" and that \"in all thy sons command\" be partly reverted to \"in all of us command\". Councillor Howard Moscoe said that the words \"native land\" were not appropriate for the many Canadians who were not native-born and that the word \"sons\" implied \"that women can't feel true patriotism or love for Canada\". Senator Vivienne Poy similarly criticized the English lyrics of the anthem as being sexist and she introduced a bill in 2002 proposing to change the phrase \"in all thy sons command\" to \"in all of us command\". In the late 2000s, the anthem's religious references (to God in English and to the Christian cross in French) were criticized by secularists.\nIn the speech from the throne delivered by Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean on March 3, 2010, a plan to have parliament review the \"original gender-neutral wording of the national anthem\" was announced. However, three-quarters of Canadians polled after the speech objected to the proposal and, two days later, the prime minister's office announced that the cabinet had decided not to change the original lyrics.\nIn another attempt to make the anthem gender-neutral, Liberal MP Mauril B\u00e9langer introduced a private member's bill in September 2014. His Bill C-624, \"An Act to amend the National Anthem Act (gender)\", was defeated at second reading in April 2015. Following the 2015 federal election, B\u00e9langer reintroduced the bill in the new parliament as Bill C-210 in January 2016. In June 2016, the bill passed its third reading with a vote of 225 to 74 in the House of Commons. The bill passed its third reading in the Senate with a voice vote on January 31, 2018, and received royal assent on February 7, 2018.\nPerformances.\n\"O Canada\" is routinely played before sporting events involving Canadian teams. Singers at such public events often mix the English and French lyrics to represent Canada's linguistic duality. Other linguistic variations have also been performed: During the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, \"O Canada\" was sung in the southern Tutchone language by Yukon native Daniel Tlen. At a National Hockey League (NHL) game in Calgary, in February 2007, Cree singer Akina Shirt became the first person to perform \"O Canada\" in the Cree language at such an event.\nMajor League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the NHL all require venues to perform both the Canadian and American national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (including all-star games), with the away team's anthem being performed first, followed by the host country. The NHL's Buffalo Sabres play both anthems before every home game, regardless of the opponent, in recognition of the team's significant Canadian fanbase. Major League Baseball teams have played the song at games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos, and National Basketball Association teams do so for games involving the Toronto Raptors, and previously, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Major League Soccer has the anthem performed at matches involving Toronto FC, CF Montr\u00e9al, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. In addition, in recognition of their Canadian fanbase, the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League plays \"O Canada\" before \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at their home games, despite there being no Canadian-based NFL team. \"O Canada\" has also been performed during NHL Global Series games involving Canadian teams as well as NBA Global Games involving the Raptors and MLB World Tour games involving the Blue Jays.\nLaws and etiquette.\nThe \"National Anthem Act\" specifies the lyrics and melody of \"O Canada\", placing both of them in the public domain, allowing the anthem to be freely reproduced or used as a base for derived works, including musical arrangements. There are no regulations governing the performance of \"O Canada\", leaving citizens to exercise their best judgment. When it is performed at an event, traditional etiquette is to either start or end the ceremonies with the anthem, including situations when other anthems are played and for the audience to stand during the performance. Civilian men usually remove their hats, while women and children are not required to do so. Military men and women in uniform traditionally keep their hats on and offer the military salute during the performance of the anthem, with the salute offered in the direction of the Canadian Flag if one is present, and if not present it is offered standing at attention.\nPresently, provincial regulations and policies in Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island mandate the national anthem to be played daily in public elementary and secondary schools. \"O Canada\" is to be played in British Columbia schools at least three times a year at assemblies. Other provinces and territories do not have provincially-mandated regulations and policies for playing the national anthem in schools.\nAdaptations.\nIn the 1950s, the melody of \"O Canada\" was adapted for the school anthem of the Ateneo de Manila University. Titled \"A Song for Mary\" or simply \"The Ateneo de Manila Graduation Hymn\", the lyrics were written by James B. Reuter, SJ, and the original tune adapted by Col. Jos\u00e9 Manela Campa\u00f1a, bandmaster of the defunct Philippine Constabulary Band.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded as the Oberlin Collegiate Institute in 1833, it is the oldest coeducational liberal arts college in the United States and the second-oldest continuously operating coeducational institute of higher learning in the world. The Oberlin Conservatory of Music is the oldest continuously operating conservatory in the United States.\nIn 1835, Oberlin became one of the first colleges in the United States to admit African Americans, and in 1837, the first to admit women (other than Franklin College's brief experiment of 1787\u201389). It has been known since its founding for progressive student activism.\nThe College of Arts &amp; Sciences offers more than 60 majors, minors, and concentrations. Oberlin is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Five Colleges of Ohio consortium.\nHistory.\nThe Oberlin Collegiate Institute (name changed later to Oberlin College in 1850) was founded in 1833. The college's founders wrote voluminously and were featured prominently in the press, especially the abolitionist newspaper \"The Liberator\", in which the name Oberlin occurred 352 times by 1865. Original documents and correspondence survive and are readily available. There is a \"wealth of primary documents and scholarly works\". Robert Samuel Fletcher (class of 1920) published a history in 1943, that is a landmark and the point of departure of all subsequent studies of Oberlin's history. His disciple Geoffrey Blodgett (1953) continued Fletcher's work.\nFounding.\n\"'Oberlin' was an idea before it was a place.\" It began in revelation and dreams: Yankees' motivation to emigrate west, attempting perfection in God's eyes, \"educating a missionary army of Christian soldiers to save the world and inaugurate God's government on earth, and the radical notion that slavery was America's most horrendous sin that should be instantly repented of and immediately brought to an end.\" Its immediate background was the wave of Christian revivals in western New York State, in which Charles Finney was very much involved. \"Oberlin was the offspring of the revivals of 1830, '31, and '32.\" Oberlin founder John Jay Shipherd was an admirer of Finney, and visited him in Rochester, New York, when en route to Ohio for the first time. Finney invited Shipherd to stay with him as an assistant, but Shipherd \"felt that he had his own important part to play in bringing on the millennium, God's triumphant reign on Earth. Finney's desires were one thing, but Shipherd believed that the Lord's work for him lay farther west.\" Shipherd attempted to convince Finney to accompany him west, which he did in 1835.\nOberlin was to be a pious, simple-living community in a sparsely populated area, of which the school, training ministers and missionaries, would be the centerpiece. The Oberlin Collegiate Institute was founded in 1833 by Shipherd and another Presbyterian minister, Philo Stewart, \"formerly a missionary among the Cherokees in Mississippi, and at that time residing in Mr. Shipherd's family,\" who was studying Divinity with Shipherd. The institute was built on of land donated by Titus Street, founder of Streetsboro, Ohio, and Samuel Hughes, who lived in Connecticut.\nShipherd and Stewert named their project after Alsatian minister Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oberlin, about whom a book had just been published, which Stewart was reading to Shipherd. Oberlin had brought social Christianity to an isolated region of France, just as they hoped to bring to the remote Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio.\nTheir vision was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOberlin was very much a part of the Utopian perfectionist enthusiasm that swept the country in the 1830s. \"Shipherd came close to being a Christian communist, and as he traveled about the country signing up recruits for the Oberlin colony, he carried with him a copy of the Oberlin covenant, which each colonist was required to sign.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe terms of the Oberlin covenant, as summarized by Shipherd, were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPredecessor: The Oneida Institute.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Lane Rebels are commonly mentioned in the early history of Oberlin. These original Oberlin students, who had little to do with Lane other than walking out on it, were carrying on a tradition that began at the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry, in Oneida County, New York, near Utica. Oneida was \"a hotbed of anti-slavery activity\", \"abolitionist to the core, more so than any other American college.\" A fundraising trip to England sought funds for both colleges. Oberlin's anti-slavery activities supplanted those of Oneida, which fell on hard times and closed in 1843. Funding previously provided by the philanthropist brothers Lewis and Arthur Tappan was transferred to Oberlin. Oberlin became the new \"academic powder keg for abolitionism.\"\nOneida was founded by George Washington Gale, of whom Oberlin President Charles Grandison Finney was a disciple. The institute's second and final President, Beriah Green, moved to Oneida after he proved too abolitionist for Western Reserve College, Oberlin's early competitor in the Ohio Western Reserve.\nThe Lane Rebels enroll at Oberlin.\nThe historian Roland Baumann described the early situation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the Oberlin Collegiate Institute was formed in 1833 the founders did not anticipate including black Americans in the student body. Additionally, the slavery question did not play any part in the college's or colony's establishment. Such matters arose only when Oberlin's trustees agreed to admit the Lane Seminary Rebels from Cincinnati to Oberlin. The Lane Rebels collectively demanded that students at the seminary have the right to freely debate antislavery issues, and that the seminary's faculty members manage the affairs of the institution.\nThe charismatic Theodore Dwight Weld, after three years (1827\u20131830) studying with Gale at Oneida, was hired by the new Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions, a project of the Tappans. (By \"literary institutions\" what is meant is non-religious schools, as in \"In every literary institution there are a number of hours daily, in which nothing is required of the student.\") He was charged with finding a site for \"a great national manual labor institution where training for the Western ministry could be provided for poor but earnest young men who had dedicated their lives to the home missionary cause in the vast valley of the Mississippi.\" By coincidence, the administrators of new and barely-functioning Lane Seminary, a manual labor school located just outside Cincinnati, were looking for students. Weld visited Cincinnati in 1832, determined that the school would do, got the approval of the Tappans, and by providing recommendations to them took over as \"de facto\" head of the Seminary, to the point of choosing the president (Lyman Beecher, after Finney turned it down) and telling the trustees whom to hire. He organized and led a group exodus of Oneida students, and others from upstate New York, to come to Lane. \"Lane was Oneida moved west.\"\nThis coincided with the emergence of \"immediatism\": the call for immediate and uncompensated freeing of all slaves, which at the time was a radical idea, and the rejection of \"colonization\", sending freed slaves to Africa by the American Colonization Society. \"The anti-slavery and the colonization questions had become exciting ones throughout the whole country, and the students deemed it to be their duty thoroughly to examine them, in view of their bearing upon their future responsibilities as ministers of the gospel.\" Shortly after their arrival at Lane, the Oneida contingent held a lengthy, well-publicized series of debates, over 18 days during February 1834, on the topic of abolition versus colonization, concluding with the endorsement of the former and rejection of the latter. (Although announced as debate, no one spoke in favor of colonization on any of the evenings.) The trustees and administrators of Lane, fearful of violence like the Cincinnati riots of 1829, prohibited off-topic discussions, even at meals. The Lane Rebels, including almost all of Lane's theological students, among them the entire Oneida contingent, resigned \"en masse\" in December, and published a pamphlet explaining their decision. A trustee, Asa Mahan, resigned also, and the trustees fired John Morgan, a faculty member who supported the students.\nA chance encounter with Shipherd, who was travelling around Ohio recruiting students for his new Collegiate Institute, led to the proposal that they come to Oberlin, along with Mahan and the fired Lane professor. They did so, but only after Oberlin agreed to their conditions:\nThis measure caused the trustees \"a great struggle to overcome their prejudices\". Moving their meeting to Elyria on January 1, 1835, at the Temperance House instead of Oberlin, so as to avoid a hostile and possibly disruptive audience, the trustees agreed to hire Mahan and Morgan, but took no action on the black question. They tabled it, until it was made clear that if they did not agree, they would lose the Tappans' money, the cadre of students, Mahan, Finney, and Shipherd himself, who threatened to quit and set forth at length the reasons Oberlin should educate blacks. The Trustees, meeting on February 9 in Shipherd's house, reexamined the question, and it passed after Trustee Chairman John Keep broke a 3\u20133 tie vote.\n\"In the summer of 1835, they all arrived in Oberlin\u2014President Mahan, Father Finney, Professor Morgan, the Lane rebels, the first black students, and the Tappans' money.\" The Oberlin Anti-Slavery Society, calling for \"immediate emancipation\", was founded in June 1835. The names of Shipherd, Mahan, and Finney are first on its founding document, followed by names of the Oneida contingent.\nOberlin replaced Oneida as \"the hot-bed of Abolitionism\", \"the most progressive college in the United States\". Oberlin sent forth cadres of minister-abolitionists every year:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n19th century \u2013 post founding.\nAsa Mahan (1799\u20131889) accepted the position of first president of the Oberlin Collegiate Institute in 1835, simultaneously serving as the chair of intellectual and moral philosophy and professor of theology. Mahan's strong advocacy of immediatism\u2014the immediate and complete freeing of all slaves\u2014greatly influenced the philosophy of the college. The same year, two years after its founding, the school began admitting African Americans. The college experienced financial distress, and Rev. John Keep and William Dawes were sent to England to raise funds in 1839\u201340. A nondenominational seminary, Oberlin's Graduate School of Theology (first called the undergraduate Theological Department), was established alongside the college in 1833. In 1965, the board of trustees voted to discontinue graduate instruction in theology at Oberlin, and in September 1966, six faculty members and 22 students merged with the Divinity School of Vanderbilt University. Oberlin's role as an educator of African-American students prior to the Civil War and thereafter was significant. In 1844, Oberlin Collegiate Institute graduated its first black student, George Boyer Vashon, who later became one of the founding professors of Howard University and the first black lawyer admitted to the Bar in New York State.\nThe college's treatment of African Americans was inconsistent. Although intensely anti-slavery, and admitting black students from 1835, the school began segregating its black students by the 1880s with the fading of evangelical idealism. Nonetheless, Oberlin graduates accounted for a significant percentage of African-American college graduates by the end of the 19th century. One such black alumnus was William Howard Day, who would go on to found Cleveland's first black newspaper, \"The Aliened American\". The college was listed as a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, for its significance in admitting African Americans and women.\nOberlin is the oldest coeducational college in the United States, having admitted four women in 1837 to its two-year \"women's program\". These four women, who were the first to enter as full students, were Mary Kellogg (Fairchild), Mary Caroline Rudd, Mary Hosford, and Elizabeth Prall. All but Kellogg graduated. Mary Jane Patterson graduated with honors in 1862, the first black woman to earn a B.A. degree. Soon, women were fully integrated into the college, and comprised from a third to half of the student body. The religious founders, especially evangelical theologian Charles Grandison Finney, saw women as morally superior to men. Oberlin ceased operating for seven months in 1839 and 1840 due to lack of funds, making it the second-oldest continuously operating coeducational liberal arts college in the United States.\nMahan, who was often in conflict with faculty, resigned his position as president in 1850. Replacing him was famed abolitionist and preacher Charles Grandison Finney, a professor at the college since its founding, who served until 1866. At the same time, the institute was renamed \"Oberlin College\", and in 1851 received a charter with that name. Under Finney's leadership, Oberlin's faculty and students increased their abolitionist activity. They participated with the townspeople in efforts to assist fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad, where Oberlin was a stop, as well as to resist the Fugitive Slave Act. One historian called Oberlin \"the town that started the Civil War\" due to its reputation as a hotbed of abolitionism. In 1858, both students and faculty were involved in the controversial Oberlin\u2013Wellington Rescue of a fugitive slave, which received national press coverage. Two participants in this raid, Lewis Sheridan Leary and John Anthony Copeland, along with another Oberlin resident, Shields Green, also participated in John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry. This heritage was commemorated on campus by the 1977 installation of sculptor Cameron Armstrong's \"Underground Railroad Monument\", a railroad track rising from the ground toward the sky, and monuments to the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue and the Harper's Ferry Raid, which followed an 1841 incident in which a group of \"fanatical abolition anarchists\" from Oberlin, using saws and axes, freed two captured fugitive slaves from the Lorain County jail.\nIn 1866, James Fairchild became Oberlin's third president, and first alumnus to lead it. A committed abolitionist, Fairchild, at that point chair of theology and moral philosophy, had played a role in the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, hiding fugitive slave John Price in his home. During Fairchild's tenure, the faculty and physical plant of the college expanded dramatically. In 1889, he resigned as president but remained as chair of systematic theology. In 1896, Fairchild returned as acting president until 1898.\nOberlin College was prominent in sending Christian missionaries abroad. In 1881, students at Oberlin formed the Oberlin Band to journey as a group to remote Shanxi province in China. A total of 30 members of the Oberlin Band worked in Shanxi as missionaries over the next two decades. Ten died of disease, and in 1900, fifteen of the Oberlin missionaries, including wives and children, were killed by Boxers or Chinese government soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion. The Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association, an independent foundation, was established in their memory. The Association, with offices on campus, sponsors Oberlin graduates to teach in China, India, and Japan. It also hosts scholars and artists from Asia to spend time on the Oberlin campus.\n20th century.\nHenry Churchill King became Oberlin's sixth president in 1902. At Oberlin from 1884 onward, he taught in mathematics, philosophy, and theology. Robert K. Carr served as Oberlin College president from 1960 to 1970, during the tumultuous period of student activism. Under his presidency, the school's physical plant added 15 new buildings. Under his leadership, student involvement in college affairs increased, with students serving on nearly all college committees as voting members (including the board of trustees). \nIn 1970, Oberlin made the cover of \"Life\" as one of the first colleges in the country to have co-ed dormitories. Despite these accomplishments, Carr clashed repeatedly with the students over the Vietnam War, and he left office in 1969. History professor Ellsworth C. Carlson became acting president. \nRobert W. Fuller had left Oberlin without graduating to pursue graduate work in physics, but had shown commitment to educational reform as a Trinity College dean. He was unanimous choice of the selection committee in November 1970. At 33 years old, Fuller became tenth president of the college, one of the youngest college presidents in U.S. history. His Oberlin presidency was a turbulent time at Oberlin and in higher education generally. Fuller called for reforming the curriculum, reducing the role of faculty, and addressed the status of women, expanded programs in the arts, and enlarged the role of students in governance. He tripled the enrollment of minorities. In what was called the Oberlin Experiment, he hired Jack Scott as Athletic Director, who recruited and hired the first four African-American athletic coaches at a predominantly white American college or university, including Tommie Smith, the gold medalist sprinter from the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. \nFuller was succeeded by the longtime Dean of the Conservatory, Emil Danenberg, who served as president from 1975 to 1982, and died in office. In 1983, following a nationwide search, Oberlin hired S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Russian and Eurasian affairs and skilled musician, as its 12th president. Starr's academic and musical accomplishments boded well for his stewardship of both the college and the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music. Despite increasing minority hiring, Starr's tenure was marked by clashes with students over divestment from South Africa and the dismissal of a campus minister, as well as Starr's reframing Oberlin as the \"Harvard of the Midwest\". A particularly vitriolic clash with students on the front lawn of his home in April 1990 led Starr to take a leave of absence from July 1991 to February 1992. He resigned in March 1993, effective in June of that year.\n21st century.\nNancy Dye became the 13th president of Oberlin College in July 1994, succeeding the embattled Starr. Oberlin's first female president, she oversaw the construction of new buildings, increased admissions selectivity, and helped increase the endowment with the largest capital campaign to that point. Dye was known for her accessibility and inclusiveness. Especially in her early years, she was a regular attendee at football games, concerts, and dorm parties. Dye served as president for nearly 13 years, resigning on June 30, 2007. Marvin Krislov served as president of the college from 2007 to 2017, moving on to assume the presidency of Pace University. On May 30, 2017, Carmen Twillie Ambar was announced as the 15th president of Oberlin College, becoming the first African-American person and second woman to hold the position.\nOberlin's first and only hired trade union expert, Chris Howell, argued that the college engaged in \"illegal\" tactics to attempt to decertify its service workers' July 1999 vote to become members of United Automobile Workers union. Howell wrote that college workers sought the union's representation in response to the administration's effort to \"speed up work\" to meet a \"mounting budget crisis\".\nIn February 2013, the college received significant press concerning its so-called \"No Trespass List\", a secret list maintained by the college of individuals barred from campus without due process. Student activists and members of the surrounding town joined to form the One Town Campaign, which challenged this policy. On February 13, 2013, a forum at the Oberlin Public Library that attracted over 200 people, including members of the college administration, the Oberlin city council and national press, saw speakers compare the atmosphere of the college to \"a gated community\".\nIn September 2014, on Rosh Hashanah, Oberlin Students for Free Palestine placed 2,133 black flags in the main square of the campus as a \"call to action\" in honor of the 2,133 Palestinians who died in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict. In January 2016, hundreds of Oberlin alumni signed a letter to the Oberlin administration stating that this protest was an example of anti-Semitism on the campus. Oberlin SFP responded with their own letter, detailing why protest of Israel does not constitute anti-semitism. They wrote, \"Feeling discomfort because one must confront the realities of Operation Protective Edge carried out in the name of the safety of the Jewish people does not amount to anti-Semitism.\"\nIn early 2016, an Oberlin professor, Joy Karega, suggested Israel was behind 9/11 and blamed it for the Charlie Hebdo attacks and for ISIS, prompting a rebuke from faculty and administration. After five-and-a-half months of discussion, the school suspended and then fired her. The following week, the home of a Jewish professor at Oberlin was vandalized and a note that read \"Gas Jews Die\" was left on his front door.\nOberlin came under federal investigation in late 2023 by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights for alleged breach of Title VI, which protects students from discrimination because of their religion. The focus of the investigation was on past statements of Professor Mohammad Jafar Mahallati, which some viewed as antisemitic.\n\"Gibson's Bakery v. Oberlin College\".\nIn 2016, a black Oberlin student was caught shoplifting two bottles of wine from Gibson's Bakery and Market, a downtown Oberlin business. A scuffle ensued between Oberlin students and Gibson's staff, and the students involved pled guilty to misdemeanor charges. Oberlin faculty and students subsequently staged large demonstrations urging a boycott of Gibson's on the grounds that the store was racist, and Gibson's sued alleging libel and other charges. In June 2019, the college was found liable for libel and tortious interference in a lawsuit initiated by the store; the bakery was awarded damages of $44 million by the jury, but a legal cap on damages reduced the award to $31.5 million. In October 2019, the college appealed the case to the Ohio District Courts of Appeals in Akron, Ohio. On March 31, 2022, the Court of Appeals unanimously dismissed both appeals, Oberlin and Gibson, upholding the jury verdict and Judge Miraldi's decisions. The Supreme Court of Ohio chose to not accept the appeal and cross-appeal on August 29, 2022. In December 2022, Oberlin College paid Gibson's Bakery $36.59 million, the entire amount due. \"We hope that the end of the litigation will begin the healing of our entire community\", said the college.\nAcademics.\nOberlin was ranked tied for the 55th-best national liberal arts college in the 2025 edition of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s \"Best Colleges\" ranking.\n\"Forbes\" ranked Oberlin 197th out of the top 500 rated private and public colleges and universities in America for the 2024-25 report. Oberlin was also ranked 46th among liberal arts universities and 29th in the Midwest.\nOf Oberlin's nearly 3,000 students, nearly 2,400 are enrolled in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, a little over 400 in the Conservatory of Music, and the remaining 180 or so in both College and Conservatory under the five-year Double-Degree program.\nThe College of Arts &amp; Sciences offers over 50 majors, minors, and concentrations. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2023 graduates, were:\nMusic Performance (89)\nPsychology (50)\nBiology (41)\nEconomics (39)\nPolitics (39)\nEnvironmental Studies (38)\nHistory (26)\nNeuroscience (26)\nThe Conservatory of Music is located on the college campus. Conservatory admission is selective, with over 1400 applicants worldwide auditioning for 120 seats. There are 500 performances yearly, most free of charge, with concerts and recitals almost daily. The Conservatory was one of the recipients of the 2009 National Medal of Arts. The Allen Memorial Art Museum, with over 13,000 holdings, was the first college art museum west of the Alleghenies.\nCollege Libraries.\nThe Oberlin College Libraries has branches for art, music, and science, a central storage facility, and the Mary Church Terrell Main Library. The libraries have collections of print and media materials and provide access to various online databases and journals. Beyond the 2.4 million-plus items available on campus, Oberlin students have access to more than 46 million volumes from over 85 Ohio institutions through the OhioLINK consortium. In the summer of 2007, the main level of the main library was converted into an Academic Commons that provides integrated learning support and is a hub of both academic and social activity.\nExperimental College.\nThe college's \"Experimental College\" or ExCo program, a student-run department, allows any student or interested person to teach their own class for a limited amount of college credit. ExCo classes by definition focus on material not covered by existing departments or faculty.\nWinter term.\nOberlin's Winter term, occurring each January, is described as \"a time for students to pursue interests outside of regular course offerings through immersive learning experiences.\" Students may work alone or in groups, either on or off campus, and may design their own project or pick from a list of projects and internships set up by the college each year. Students must complete a winter term project three years out of their four in the College of Arts and Sciences. Projects range from serious academic research with co-authorship in scientific journals, humanitarian projects, making films about historic Chicago neighborhoods, and learning how to bartend. A full-credit project is suggested to involve five to six hours per weekday.\nCreativity and Leadership.\nCreated in 2005 as a part of the Northeast Ohio Collegiate Entrepreneurship Program (NEOCEP), a Kauffman Campuses Initiative, and sponsored by the Burton D. Morgan and Ewing Marion Kauffman, the department is focused on supporting and highlighting entrepreneurship within the student body. This is done through a series of classes, symposia, Winter Term programs, grants, and fellowships available at no cost to current students and in some cases, recent alumni. One such opportunity is the Creativity and Leadership Fellowship, a one-year fellowship for graduating seniors that includes a stipend of up to $30,000 to advance an entrepreneurial venture.\nIn 2012, the Creativity and Leadership department announced LaunchU, a business accelerator open to Oberlin College students and alumni who are pursuing an entrepreneurial venture. The selective, three-week intensive program connects the participants with other entrepreneurs and business leaders chosen from the surrounding northeast Ohio region as well as the extensive Oberlin College alumni network. LaunchU culminates in a public pitch competition before a guest panel of investors, where the participants have the opportunity to be awarded up to $15,000 in funding. The winner of the 2014 LaunchU pitch competition was Chai Energy, a Los Angeles-based green energy startup focused on modernizing and personalizing home energy monitoring. In 2014, LaunchU announced the creation of an online network in order to build stronger connections between entrepreneurs within the Oberlin College students and alumni network with a focus on attracting younger alumni.\nCampus culture.\nPolitical activism.\nThe Oberlin student body has a long history of activism and a reputation for being notably liberal. The college was ranked among The Princeton Review's list of \"Colleges with a Conscience\" in 2005.\nIn the 1960s, Memorial Arch became a rallying point for the college's civil rights activists and its anti-war movement. Oberlin supplied a disproportionate number of participants in Mississippi Freedom Summer, rebuilt the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in the Carpenters for Christmas project, supported NAACP sponsored sit-ins in Cleveland to integrate the building-trades, and with the SCLC participated in demonstrations at Hammermill Paper. In 1995, Emeritus Professor of Sociology (1966\u20132007) James Leo Walsh told \"The Oberlin Review\" that students \"carried out dozens of protests against the Vietnam war ranging from peaceful picketing to surrounding a local naval recruiter's car\". In November 2002, 100 college workers, students, and faculty held a \"mock funeral 'for the spirit of Oberlin'\" in response to the administration's laying off 11 workers and reducing the work hours of five other workers without negotiation with college unions. Oberlin Students have protested instances of fracking in Ohio such as \"the first natural gas and fracturing industry conference in the state,\" in 2011.\nIn 2004, student activism led to a campus-wide ban on sales of Coca-Cola products due to the company's human and labor rights violations. However, the ban was revoked in spring 2014, and students may now buy Coca-Cola products from the student union.\nIn 2013, after the discovery of hateful messages and the alleged sighting of a person wearing KKK robes, president Marvin Krislov cancelled classes and called for a day of reflection and change. In a public statement, he stated that an investigation had identified two students believed to be largely responsible, who had been removed from campus. One of the students responsible said to police that he was \"doing it as a joke to see the college overreact to it\".\nDuring the fall 2014 semester, Oberlin's Student Labor Action Coalition organized a petition to permit dining hall temporary workers working four-hour shifts to eat one meal from food the college throws out each day. The petition garnered over 1,000 signatures and resulted in workers obtaining the opportunity to put food into a management-given styrofoam container to eat after their shifts.\nIn May 2015, students temporarily took over their school's administration building to protest a $2,300 increase in tuition cost between the 2015 and 2016 academic school years. Students initially proposed, \"... moving from providing merit aid to need-based scholarships, loosening on-campus dining and housing requirements, reducing food waste and temporary workers in Campus Dining Services\u00a0... \" to the school's Vice President of Finance Mike Frandsen on Monday, April 27, 2015, in which their demands were declined for issue. $10,931,088 were allocated to management salaries for the 2013\u20132014 school year, much of which came from student tuition.\nIn December 2015, Oberlin's Black Student Union issued a series of 50 specific demands of the college and conservatory including promoting certain black faculty to tenured positions, hiring more black faculty, firing other faculty members, and obtaining a $15 an hour minimum wage for all campus workers and guaranteed health care in their contracts. The board of trustees responded by appointing some of the individual faculty and by, \"reviewing the allocation of faculty positions with consideration of how they will contribute to interactional diversity in the curriculum\" in the college's 2016\u20132021 strategic plan. The college opposed firing any employees in response and neglected to issue formal responses to many of the other demands, though it has sought to cut wages and health care funds for administrators, office workers and library support staff during contract negotiations with the Office and Professional Employees International Union. Many campus workers still earn the minimum wage. Over 75 students protested the college's attempt to alter administrator, office worker and library support staff contracts during spring 2016 contract negotiations.\nThe pro-Israel advocacy group Alums for Campus Fairness has called on Oberlin to address alleged anti-Semitic hate speech directed at Jewish students.\nStudent Cooperative Association.\nThe Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, or OSCA, is a non-profit corporation that houses 174 students in four housing co-ops and feeds 594 students in eight dining co-ops. Its budget is more than $2 million, making it the third-largest of its kind in North America behind the Berkeley Student Cooperative and the Inter-Cooperative Council of Ann Arbor.\nOSCA is entirely student-run, with all participating students working as cooks, buyers, administrators, and coordinators. Every member is required to do at least one hour per week of cleaning if they are able, encouraging accountability for the community and the space. Most decisions within OSCA are made by modified consensus. Oberlin bans all fraternities and sororities, making the co-ops the largest student-organized social system at the college. In addition to OSCA's four housing/dining and three dining-only cooperatives, Brown Bag Co-op is an OSCA-backed grocery that sells personal servings of food at bulk prices. OSCA also funds the Nicaragua Sister Partnership (NICSIS), a \"sister cooperative\" with Nicaragua's National Union of Farmers and Ranchers (UNAG). Outside of OSCA, other Oberlin co-ops include the Bike Co-op, Pottery Co-op, and SWAP: The Oberlin Book Co-op.\nIn the spring of 2013, the Board of Directors of OSCA made a decision in a closed-door meeting to remove the Kosher-Halal Co-op from the Association after disputes over budgets and kitchen inspections. Although KHC served both Kosher and Halal food, the membership was predominantly Jewish, and some alumni wrote that they believed the expulsion to be anti-Semitic in nature.\nMusic.\nIn addition to Oberlin Conservatory, Oberlin has musical opportunities available for amateur musicians and students in the college. Oberlin Steel, a steel pan ensemble founded around 1980, plays calypso/soca music from Trinidad and Tobago and has been performing at Oberlin's Commencement Illumination event for over 30 years. Oberlin College Taiko, founded in 2008, explores and shares Japanese taiko drumming as both a traditional and contemporary art form. The entirely student-run Oberlin College Marching Band (OCMB), founded in 1998, performs at various sporting events including football games, women's rugby, and pep rallies throughout the year. There are a number of a cappella groups, including: Pitch Please (all gender, all genre), the Obertones (men and nonbinary), Nothing But Treble (women and nonbinary), the Acapelicans (women and nonbinary), 'Round Midnight (all gender, jazz/folk). Other notable music organizations include the Black Musicians Guild and the Arts and Sciences Orchestra. Students in the college can form chamber groups and receive coaching through the Conservatory. Student composers also provide a demand for musicians to perform their work.\nFilm.\nFilm in Oberlin began with Thomas Edison's moving picture being shown in February 1900. Just seven years later, the Apollo Theater opened, and installed sound equipment for the 1928 \"The Jazz Singer\", the first \"talkie\". In 2012 (after a year of renovations) the building became the centerpiece for the Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman Cinema Studies Center for Media Education and Production. The area above the theatre includes editing labs, an animation area, a recording studio and small projection screening room.\nSustainability.\nIn 2006, Oberlin became one of the charter institutions to sign the ACUPCC and set a target climate neutrality date for 2025. Oberlin's innovative Adam Joseph Lewis Center For Environmental Studies, a building the Department of Energy labeled as one of the \"milestone\" buildings of the 20th century, incorporates a photovoltaic array, the biggest of its kind in Ohio at the time. The AJLC also features a Living Machine, garden, orchard, and parking-lot solar array.\nThe school utilizes biodiesel, hybrid, and electric vehicles for various purposes, offers financial support to a local transit company providing public transportation to the school, and has been home to the Oberlin Bike Co-op, a cooperatively run bicycle center, since 1986. Each residence hall monitors and displays real time and historic electricity and water use. Some dorms also have special lamps which display a color depending on how real time energy use compares to the average historic energy use. The school's Campus Committee on Shareholder Responsibility provides students, faculty, and staff with the opportunity to make suggestions and decisions on proxy votes. A student board, the Oberlin College Green EDGE Fund, manages a set of accounts to support local sustainability, resource efficiency, and carbon offsetting projects. The Green EDGE Fund, created in 2007, allocates grants for environmental sustainability projects and verifiable carbon offsetting projects within the Oberlin community, as well as loans from a revolving fund for projects at Oberlin College that reduce resource consumption and have calculable financial savings for the college.\nCampus publications and media.\nOberlin students publish a wide variety of periodicals. The college's largest publications are \"The Oberlin Review\" and \"The Grape\". \"The Oberlin Review\" is a traditional weekly newspaper, focusing on current events, with a circulation of around 1,700. There is also a newspaper pertaining to the interests of students of color, called \"BIPOC Lenses\".\nMagazines on campus include \"Wilder Voice\", a magazine for creative nonfiction and long-form journalism, \"The Plum Creek Review\", a literary review containing student-written fiction, poetry, translations, and visual art, \"Headwaters Magazine\", an environmental magazine, and \"The Synapse\", a science magazine. \"Spiral\" is a magazine focused on genre fiction. The college also produces a quarterly alumni magazine, while the Conservatory publishes its own magazine once a year.\nThe WOBC News Corps, a news division of WOBC-FM created in February 2010, produces local news segments that air bi-hourly. WOBC, a large student organization with significant non-student membership, also maintains an online blog that focuses on music and local events.\nAthletics.\nThe school's varsity sports teams are the Yeomen and Yeowomen. Early on, athletes were known simply as Oberlin Men or \"O\" Men. The name \"Yeomen\" arose in the early 1900s, drawing on the phonetic sound of \"O\" Men and the school's motto, \"Learning and Labor\". As women's sports arose, \"Yeowomen\" came to represent women athletes. In 2014, the school announced that the albino squirrel would be its official mascot, although teams would continue to be referred to as \"yeomen\" and \"yeowomen\".\nOberlin participates in the NCAA's Division III and the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC), a conference which includes Kenyon College, Denison University, Wooster College, Wabash College and others. Kenyon has traditionally been Oberlin's biggest rival. In 2022, leaders of the Athletic Department and various club sports spoke out in favor of increased institutional support for the teams, requesting that the college provide access to professional sports trainers and team transportation. The college also hosts several private sports teams, including the Oberlin Ultimate team.\nOberlin also has 17 club sports, including ice hockey, fencing, ultimate frisbee, soccer, rugby, equestrian, tennis, volleyball, badminton, bowling, and in martial arts such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu and aikido.\nBaseball.\nOn May 8, 2015, the Oberlin baseball team won the championship of the NCAC. The championship was the first for Oberlin as a baseball team since it joined the NCAC in 1984.\nFootball.\nOberlin's football team was the first team coached by John Heisman, later honored by the Heisman Trophy. Heisman led the team to a 7\u20130 record in 1892. Oberlin is the last college in Ohio to beat Ohio State (winning 7\u20136 in 1921). Though in modern times, the football team was more famous for losing streaks of 40 games (1992\u20131996) and 44 games (1997\u20132001), the Yeomen have enjoyed limited success in recent years.\nCheerleading.\nIn 2011, Oberlin began its most recent attempt to feature a cheerleading squad. In 2006, a cheerleader fell from atop a pyramid at a football game. That injury prompted the school to restrict the club's activities, prohibiting stunting and tumbling, after which participation fizzled out. The club's charter, however, remained intact and was used to bring the squad back in 2011. Tryouts were held in the spring of 2011, and the cheerleading team went active at Oberlin's first home football game that Fall, a 42\u20130 win over Kenyon College. The squad also cheers for the basketball team and participates in spirit building and service events across campus and in the community.\nFencing.\nOberlin has a club fencing team known as the Flaming Blades that practices and competes in foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e, and saber. They compete in the Midwestern Fencing Conference, Club Fencing Championships, USFA tournaments, and USCFC tournaments.\nUltimate.\nOberlin has both men's and a women's Ultimate club teams, known as the Flying Horsecows and the Preying Manti, respectively. The Manti won the Division III national championship on May 19, 2019, defeating the top-ranked Bates Cold Front by a score of 13\u20137. The Horsecows placed 5th nationally in 2022, the highest finish in program history.\nNotable people.\nSince its founding, Oberlin alumni and faculty include 16 Rhodes Scholars, 20 Truman Scholars, 15 MacArthur fellows, 4 Rome Prize winners, and 4 Nobel Prize laureates. As of 2024, Oberlin was associated with more MacArthur fellows than any other liberal arts college. Additionally, it is the third highest producer of Fulbright scholars among undergraduate institutions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It involved the illegal sale of weapons to the Khomeini regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran to encourage the release of American hostages then held in Lebanon. North formulated the second part of the plan, which was to divert proceeds from the arms sales to support the Contra rebel groups in Nicaragua, official funding for which had been specifically prohibited under the Boland Amendment. North was granted limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying before Congress about the scheme. He was initially convicted on three felony charges, but the convictions were vacated and reversed and all charges against him dismissed in 1991, on the grounds of immunity.\nNorth unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by Chuck Robb from Virginia in 1994. In a three-way race, North narrowly lost to Robb by a margin of 2.73%. He then hosted a talk show on Radio America from 1995 to 2003, and hosted \"War Stories with Oliver North\" on Fox News from 2001 to 2016. In May 2018, North was elected as president of the National Rifle Association. On April 27, 2019, he resigned amidst a dispute with the organization's chief executive Wayne LaPierre, and was succeeded by Carolyn D. Meadows.\nEarly life.\nNorth was born in San Antonio, Texas, on October 7, 1943, the son of Ann Theresa (n\u00e9e Clancy) and Oliver Clay North, a U.S. Army major. He grew up in Philmont, New York, and graduated from Ockawamick Central High School in 1961. He attended the State University of New York at Brockport for two years.\nWhile at Brockport, North spent a summer at the United States Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia, and gained an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in 1963. He received his commission as second lieutenant in 1968, having missed a year due to serious back and leg injuries from an auto accident in which a classmate was killed. One of North's classmates at the academy was future secretary of the Navy and U.S. senator Jim Webb, whom he beat in a middleweight championship boxing match at Annapolis. (North had shown films of this match to Marine Medical Corps officials to prove that he had fully recovered from his serious accident and could endure the rigors of midshipman training.) Their graduating class included Dennis C. Blair, Michael Mullen, Jay L. Johnson, Charles Bolden and Michael Hagee.\nU.S. Marine Corps career.\nVietnam.\nNorth served as a platoon commander during the Vietnam War, where during his combat service, he was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal with Combat V, and two Purple Heart medals. At the time of his being awarded the Silver Star, North was a platoon commander leading his Marines in Operation Virginia Ridge. North led a counter-assault against the People's Army of Vietnam, as his platoon took on heavy machine gun fire and rocket propelled grenades. Throughout the battle, North displayed \"courage, dynamic leadership and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of grave personal danger\".\nPost-Vietnam.\nIn 1970, North returned to South Vietnam to testify as a character witness at the trial of Lance Corporal Randall Herrod, a U.S. Marine formerly under his command who, along with four others, had been charged with the murder of sixteen Vietnamese civilians in the village of Son Thang. North claims Herrod had previously saved his life. Herrod and one other Marine were acquitted.\nNorth's post-Vietnam career included: instructor at the Marine Basic School from 1969 to 1974; director of the Northern Training Area in Okinawa, Japan (1973\u20131974); plans and policy analyst with the manpower division at Headquarters Marine Corps from 1975 to 1978; and operations officer (S3) for 3rd Battalion, 8th Regiment, 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune (1978\u201380). He graduated from the College of Naval Command and Staff at the Navy War College in 1981.\nNational Security Council staff.\nIn 1981, North began his assignment to the National Security Council staff in Washington, D.C., where he served as a lobbyist from 1981 to 1983; and deputy director for political\u2013military affairs from 1983 until his reassignment in 1986. In 1983, North was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\nDuring his tenure at the National Security Council, North managed a number of missions. This included leading the hunt for those responsible for the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing that killed 299 American and French military personnel, an effort that saw North arrange a mid-air interception of an EgyptAir jet carrying those responsible for the Achille Lauro hijacking. While at the National Security Council, he also helped plan the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the 1986 bombing of Libya.\nDuring his Iran-Contra trial, North spent his last two years on active duty assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps in Arlington County, Virginia. He submitted his request to retire from the Marine Corps effective May 1, 1988, following his indictment for conspiring to defraud the United States by channeling the profits from US arms sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. After his trial and felony convictions, all convictions were reversed on appeal.\nMilitary awards.\nNorth received the following military awards and decorations:\nIran\u2013Contra affair.\nNorth came into the public spotlight as a result of his participation in the Iran\u2013Contra affair, a political scandal during the Reagan administration, in which he claimed partial responsibility for the sale of weapons through intermediaries to Iran, with the profits being channeled to the Contras in Nicaragua. It was alleged that he was responsible for the establishment of a covert network which subsequently funneled those funds to the Contras. Congress passed the Boland Amendment (to the House Appropriations Bill of 1982 and following years), which prohibited the appropriation of U.S. funds by intelligence agencies for the support of the Contras.\nNorth solicited $10 million from the Sultan of Brunei to skirt U.S. prohibitions on funding the Contras. However, he gave the wrong number of the Swiss bank account intended to launder the money, and it went instead to a Swiss businessman. A Senate committee investigating the transaction tracked it down so it could be returned to Brunei.\nIn an August 23, 1986, e-mail to National Security Advisor John Poindexter, North described a meeting with a representative of Panamanian General Manuel Noriega: \"You will recall that over the years Manuel Noriega in Panama and I have developed a fairly good relationship,\" North writes before explaining Noriega's proposal. If U.S. officials can \"help clean up his image\" and lift the ban on arms sales to the Panamanian Defense Force, Noriega will \"'take care of' the Sandinista leadership for us.\"\nNorth told Poindexter that General Noriega could assist with sabotage against the ruling party of Nicaragua, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. North supposedly suggested that Noriega be paid $1 million in cash from Project Democracy funds raised from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran for the Panamanian leader's help in destroying Nicaraguan economic installations.\nIn November 1986, as the sale of weapons was made public, North was dismissed by President Ronald Reagan. In an interview with \"Cigar Aficionado\" magazine, North said that on February 11, 1987, the Federal Bureau of Investigation detected an attack on North's family from the Peoples Committee for Libyan Students, with an order to kill North. Although government officials later expressed skepticism of this claim, and no charges for this alleged plot were brought, his family was moved to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and lived with federal agents until North retired from the Marine Corps the following year.\nIn July 1987, North was summoned to testify before televised hearings of a joint congressional committee that was formed to investigate the Iran\u2013Contra scandal. During the hearings, North admitted that he had misled Congress, for which, along with other actions, he was later charged. He defended his actions by stating that he believed in the goal of aiding the Contras, whom he saw as freedom fighters against the Sandinistas and said that he viewed the Iran\u2013Contra scheme as a \"neat idea.\" North admitted shredding government documents related to these activities at William Casey's suggestion when the Iran\u2013Contra scandal became public. He also testified that Robert McFarlane had asked him to alter official records to delete references to direct assistance to the Contras and that he had helped.\nNorth was indicted in March 1988 on 16 felony counts. His trial opened in February 1989, and on May 4, 1989, he was initially convicted of three: accepting an illegal gratuity, aiding and abetting in the obstruction of a congressional inquiry, and ordering the destruction of documents through his secretary, Fawn Hall. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell on July 5, 1989, to a three-year suspended prison term, two years probation, $150,000 in fines, and 1,200 hours of community service. North performed some of his community service within Potomac Gardens, a public housing project in southeast Washington, DC. However, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, North appealed his conviction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On July 20, 1990, the D.C. Circuit vacated North's convictions on the ground that witnesses in his trial might have been impermissibly affected by his immunized congressional testimony.\nThe individual members of the prosecution team had isolated themselves from news reports and discussion of North's testimony, and while the defense could show no specific instance in which North's congressional testimony was used in his trial, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge had made an insufficient examination of the issue. Consequently, North's convictions were reversed. After further hearings on the immunity issue, Judge Gesell dismissed all charges against North on September 16, 1991.\nPolitics.\nIn the 1994 election, North unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate as the Republican Party candidate in Virginia. Republican senator John Warner of Virginia endorsed Marshall Coleman, a Republican who ran as an independent, instead of North. North lost, garnering 43 percent of votes, while incumbent Democrat Charles Robb, a son-in-law of President Lyndon B. Johnson, won reelection with 46 percent. Coleman received 11 percent. North's candidacy was documented in the 1996 film \"A Perfect Candidate\".\nIn his failed bid to unseat Robb, North raised $20.3 million in a single year through nationwide direct-mail solicitations, telemarketing, fundraising events, and contributions from major donors. About $16 million of that amount was from direct mail alone. This was the biggest accumulation of direct-mail funds for a statewide campaign to that date, and it made North the top direct-mail political fundraiser in the country in 1994.\nFreedom Alliance.\nIn 1990, North founded the Freedom Alliance, a 501(c)(3) foundation \"to advance the American heritage of freedom by honoring and encouraging military service, defending the sovereignty of the United States, and promoting a strong national defense.\" The foundation's primary activities include providing support for wounded combat soldiers and providing scholarships for the children of service members killed in action.\nBeginning in 2003, Sean Hannity has raised over $10 million for the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund through Freedom Concerts and donations from \"The Sean Hannity Show\" and its listeners. The charity has been criticized by conservative blogger Debbie Schlussel for distributing too little of its funds for charitable purposes. Hannity, North, and other charity spokespersons say that all of the \"net\" proceeds from the Freedom Concerts are donated to the fund.\nNational Rifle Association.\nOn May 7, 2018, the National Rifle Association (NRA) announced that North would become the organization's next president within the following weeks. He succeeded Pete Brownell, the incumbent. North is a board member in the NRA and appeared at NRA national conventions in 2007 and 2008. North began his term as president in September 2018.\nIn April 2019, in the midst of a wide-ranging dispute involving the NRA's chief executive Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's advertising agency Ackerman McQueen, and the NRA's law firm Brewer Attorneys &amp; Counselors, North announced that he would not serve a second term as president, ostensibly against his wishes. On April 24, 2019, North asked LaPierre to resign. On April 16, 2019, North and NRA first vice president Richard Childress wrote to the chairman of the NRA audit committee and the NRA's secretary and general counsel calling for an independent audit of the billing from the NRA's law firm, Brewer Attorneys &amp; Counselors. In an April 24, 2019 letter to the executive committee of the NRA board, North said that he was forming a committee to investigate alleged financial improprieties, allegations which he said threatened the NRA's non-profit status. In an April 25, 2019 letter to the NRA board, LaPierre said that North was threatening to release damaging information about him. On April 27, 2019, in a letter read on his behalf at the NRA's annual convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, North announced he would not serve a second term. North's term ended on April 29, 2019, when he was replaced by Carolyn D. Meadows. On May 3, 2019, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, members of the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to North, LaPierre, and the NRA's advertising agency Ackerman McQueen requesting copies of the letters to the NRA board by North and LaPierre, seeking documents related to the allegations, and directing records preservation.\nMedia and books.\nFilm, television, radio, and videogames.\nNorth became increasingly known for his media career and appearances. In 1991, he appeared on the first season of \"The Jerry Springer Show\". From 1995 to 2003, North was host of his own nationally syndicated talk radio show on Radio America, which was known as the \"Oliver North Radio Show\" or \"Common Sense Radio With Oliver North\". He also served as co-host of \"Equal Time\" on MSNBC from 1999 to 2000. North was the host of the television show \"War Stories with Oliver North\" from 2001 to 2016 and is a regular commentator on \"Hannity\", both on the Fox News Channel.\nNorth appeared as himself on many television shows, including the sitcom \"Wings\" in 1991, and three episodes of the TV military drama \"JAG\" in 1995, 1996, and 2002 as \"Ollie\", a close friend of the deceased father of Tracey Needham's character Meg Austin. He has also appeared as himself in several film documentaries.\nIn addition, he regularly speaks at both public and private events. North appears in an episode of \"Auction Kings\" to have his Marine Corps sword returned after it was lost and presumably stolen in 1980. North was credited as a military consultant in the 2012 video game \"\" and voiced himself in a cutscene. In Season 4, Episode 15 \"Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold\" of the TV series \"American Dad!\" Stan Smith searches under his house for Oliver North's hidden gold. In 2014, he received story credit for an episode of the TV series \"The Americans\" where the Soviet spy protagonists infiltrate a Contra training base in the United States.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1967, North married Betsy Stuart; the couple had four children. Although raised in the Roman Catholic faith of his mother, North attended Protestant or evangelical services with his wife and children. The Norths lived in McLean, Virginia.\nBetsy North died on November 16, 2024 of corticobasal syndrome.\nOn August 27, 2025, North married Fawn Hall, his former secretary, in a private ceremony in rural Virginia.\nIn popular culture.\nA double-page comic strip satire, \"Col. Ollie,\" appreared in the long-defunct \"Clinton Street Quarterly\", in the summer of 1987.\nIn a 1995 episode of the TV series \"Sliders\", Cornel North [\"sic\"] is President of the United States on a parallel Earth.\nOliver North is the focus of episode 15, Season 4 of the animated series \"American Dad!\" It is rumored North buried a treasure under the main family's home, protagonist Stan Smith trying to find the treasure for himself. A musical recounting the Iran-Contra affair also appears in the episode.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 1 January 2025, the city proper had a population of 185,480 while Odense Municipality had a population of 210,803, making it the fourth largest municipality in Denmark (behind Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg municipalities). Eurostat and OECD have used a definition for the Metropolitan area of Odense (referred to as a \"Functional urban area\"), which includes all municipalities in the Province (Danish: \"landsdel\") of Funen (Danish: \"Fyn\"), with a total population of 504,066 as of 1 July 2022.\nBy road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of the capital Copenhagen. The city was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. \nThere has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years, although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988, and by 1070, it had already grown into a thriving city. Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 10 July 1086. Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry, it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages. After a period of decline, large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century, which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense, facilitating trade. In 1865, one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built, further increasing the population and commerce, and by 1900, Odense had reached a population of 35,000. Odense's Odinst\u00e5rnet was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built in 1935 but was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II. The University of Southern Denmark was established in 1966.\nToday, Odense remains the commercial hub of Funen, and is recognized internationally as a leading robotics city due to a cluster of cobot companies. Several other major industries are located in the city including the Albani Brewery and GASA, Denmark's major dealer in vegetables, fruits and flowers. The city is home to Odense Palace, erected by King Frederik IV who died there in 1730, the Odense Theatre, the Odense Symphony Orchestra, and the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. In 2021 the Hans Christian Andersen House designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma opened. It incorporates parts of the earlier museum like Andersen's birthplace and a domed memorial hall featuring frescos by Niels Larsen Stevns. In sports, Odense has a number of football clubs including OB, BM, B1909, and B1913, the Odense Bulldogs professional ice hockey team, and the city also hosts the H.C. Andersen Marathon. Odense is served by Hans Christian Andersen Airport and Odense station, which lies on the line between Copenhagen and the Jutland peninsula.\nEtymology.\nThe name Odense is derived from \"\u00d3\u00f0ins v\u00e9\", meaning \"Odin's sanctuary\", as the area was known as a sanctuary for worshippers of the Nordic god, Odin.\n \"For the Catholic ecclesiastical history, see Roman Catholic bishopric of Odense\"\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nOdense is one of Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological excavations in the vicinity show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years since at least the Stone Age. The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, one of Denmark's former Viking ring fortresses, lay to the south of the river. Today, Odense's M\u00f8nterg\u00e5rden Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area. The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to defend it against invaders coming in from the coast.\nThe city celebrated its thousandth anniversary in 1988, commemorating the first mention of the town's name in a letter dated 18 March 988 from the German emperor Otto III which granted rights to Odense and neighbouring settlements. The first church in Odense appears to have been St Mary's, probably built in the late 12th century. The territory, previously part of the vast Archbishopric of Hamburg, was created a Catholic diocese in 988. The first recorded bishops of Odense were Odinkar Hvide and Reginbert, who was consecrated by Archbishop \u00c6thelnoth of Canterbury, in 1022.\nRecent excavations have shown that from the early 11th century, the town developed in the area around Albani Torv, Fisketorvet, Overgade and Vestergade. By 1070, Odense had already grown into a city of stature in Denmark. Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants, discontent with the high taxes he imposed on the town, in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 10 July 1086. He was canonized in 1100. The priory no longer exists, although a church has been situated on the site since about 900. At the beginning of the 12th century, Benedictine monks from England founded St Canute's Abbey. It was here the English monk \u00c6lnoth wrote Denmark's first literary work, \"Vita et Passio S. Canuti\" (The Life and Passion of St Canute). Canute's shrine in Odense Cathedral (which was attached to the priory) attracted pilgrims throughout the Middle Ages and can still be viewed today.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the Middle Ages, a number of churches and monasteries were built in the town. St Canute's Church (\"Skt. Knuds Kirke\"), now the cathedral, dates from the end of the 13th century and was closely connected to the Benedictine Order. The town's other old churches are St Mary's (\"Vor Frue Kirke\") and St John's (\"Skt. Hans Kirke\") with its adjacent monastery. Greyfriars Monastery (\"Gr\u00e5br\u00f8dre Kloster\") was founded by the Franciscans in 1279.\nIn 1247 Odense was burned by Abel of Denmark during conflicts with his brother King Erik IV. The cathedral had to be completely rebuilt. Nevertheless, the town continued to flourish as a commercial centre, and was charted in 1335. The city thrived economically during the Middle Ages, attracting many merchants and craftsman who traded their goods.\nIn 1482 Bishop Karl R\u00f8nnov brought the German printer Johann Snell to Odense to print a short prayer book, \"Breviarium Ottoniense\", considered to be the first work to be printed in Scandinavia. In parallel Snell printed \"De obsidione et bello Rhodiano\", an account of the Turkish siege of the island of Rhodes.\nAfter the Danish Reformation, involving the suppression of the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed after the end of the Swedish Wars. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century.\nFrom the 16th century the town was the meeting-place of several parliaments, and until 1805 Odense was the seat of the provincial assembly of Funen. By 1700 Odense's population was about 4,000.\nDevelopment.\nDramatic changes began in Odense in the 18th century to modernise the city and a great plan was drawn up for development. In 1720, Frederick IV ordered the rebuilding of Odense Palace, partly on the foundations of the 13th century St. Hans's Monastery, and the construction of St Hans's Church by the Knights Hospitallers. An 8 kilometre (5.0\u00a0mi) long, 7.5 metre (25\u00a0ft) deep canal from Odense Harbour to Odense Fjord was built between 1796 and 1806 to facilitate the growth of Odense as a port city, radically increasing its level of trade and population. Founded in 1796, Odense Teater is the first provincial theatre in Denmark and the country's second oldest. Odense Central Library was established in 1924 and removed to Odense station in 1995. The Odense Music Library contains Denmark's largest collection of phonograms.\nFrom the 1840s, the city enjoyed a period of rapid expansion beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed into one of the most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion, and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.\nModern history.\nOdense's most famous landmark was Odinst\u00e5rnet (\"The Odin Tower\") constructed in 1935, as the second-tallest tower in Europe, only surpassed by the Eiffel Tower with its 177 meters. \"Odinst\u00e5rnet\" was blown up by a Danish Nazi group in 1944 and has never been rebuilt. However, a miniature model now stands in Odinsparken in the area where the original was located. During the German occupation in the Second World War, Odense's general strike in August 1943 contributed to terminating collaboration with the Germans.\nUntil the beginning of the Danish industrial revolution, Odense was also the second-largest city in modern Denmark, but has in recent times been overtaken by Aarhus. From the 1960s Odense increasingly became a cultural hub, with the establishment of a university in 1966 and the launching of trade shows, including the large Odense Congress Centre. In 1988 a major national television network, TV2, was established in Odense.\nIn celebration of the thousandth anniversary in 1988, a forest, Tusind\u00e5rsskoven (meaning \"The Thousand Year Forest\") was planted. The forest now hosts the annual music festival Tinderbox. In 2005 the city celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen and in 2025 the 150th anniversary of his death.\nThe Odense Steel Shipyard (\"Staalskibsv\u00e6eft\"), which since 1996 had been Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, closed in 2012 as a result of international competition. Opened in 1919 by A.P. M\u00f8ller, it latterly produced container ships for M\u00e6rsk, the parent company. The Lind\u00f8 site was sold to the Port of Odense (\"Odense Havn\") who are developing the Lind\u00f8 Industrial Park.\nGeography.\nOdense is situated in the northeastern centre of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus, to the southwest of Copenhagen, east of Esbjerg and southeast of Kolding. Suburbs of Odense include Stige to the north, Seden, Bullerup and Agedrup to the northeast, Blommenslyst to the west, Bellinge to the southwest, and Neder Holluf and H\u00f8jby to the south.\nThe Odense River flows through Odense, to the south of the main shopping quarter. To the north of the city is the Odense Fjord, and to the northeast, along the 165 road to Kerteminde is Kerteminde Fjord. The fjord is accessed through the narrow passage of Gabets, between Hals and Skoven, and is connected by canal to the Port of Odense. The small fishing village of Bregn\u00f8r lies to the southeast of the passage. A controlling depth of is reported in the northern part of channel between the entrance to the fjord and Lindo Terminal Quay. The bight of Fyns Hoved to the northeast of the harbour curves south to form the approach to Odense Fjord. The eastern side of the bight between Fyns Hoved and Skoven, to the south, is irregular, with a beach and hills behind it, and to the south of the bight is the small, shallow Korshavn Bay, with the Korshavn Light in the vicinity. Skoven is a bare, rugged peninsula, with Dalby Bay (Dalby Bugt) to the east.\nIn the southwestern part of the Odense Fjord are the islands of Vigels\u00f8 and the 21 hectare Torn\u00f8, although the latter is connected to the mainland by a 300-metre (980\u00a0ft)-long causeway. Vigels\u00f8 is the largest island in the fjord at 132 hectares and is an important breeding ground for migratory birds. It is part of the Special Area of Conservation \"No. SPC 94, Odense Fjord\" under the EU Habitat and Birds Directives and has been subject to close monitoring, with the target to reach at least \"good\" ecological status by 2015. The island is low-lying, the highest point of \u00d8sterhoved only reaching six metres above the sea. There is a 25 hectare forest on the northern part of the island while the southern part consists of coastal meadows.\nClimate.\nOdense has a temperate oceanic climate, classified as K\u00f6ppen zone \"Cfb\". Mild summers feature average maximum temperatures exceeding 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F), while winters are characterised by minimum temperatures dropping just below freezing. The hottest months on average are July and August with highs of 21\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u00a0\u00b0F) and daily mean temperatures of 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) and 16\u00a0\u00b0C (61\u00a0\u00b0F) respectively. These are also the wettest months, with August receiving and July of rain on average. Extratropical cyclones frequently affect the region, contributing to abundant precipitation. The coldest months are January and February, with a daily mean temperature of 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F), and lows of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F) and \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (26\u00a0\u00b0F) respectively. It is common for Odense Fjord to contain ice between January and March, and the entrance is kept clear by icebreakers. The tidal range in the fjord varies up to , and winds from the west and northeast may raise the water level by up to and winds from the east and southwest may lower it by up to . Climate data for the city are recorded at Hans Christian Andersen Airport (ICAO: EKOD).\nDemographics.\nOdense has long been a populated town, and in 1670 it had a population of 3,808 people. By 1787 the population had grown to 5,363 to and 5,782 in 1801. The population grew markedly during the 19th century, reaching 8,709 inhabitants in 1834, 10,238 in 1845, 12,932 in 1855, 16,970 in 1870, 20,804 in 1880 and 30,268 in 1890.\nWith improvements in communications by rail and via the port, the population of Odense grew dramatically in the early 20th century. The 1901 census recorded 40,138 people, growing to 47,224 in 1911, 61,969 in 1921 and 87,090 in 1935. During the Second World War, the population passed the 100,000 mark, reaching 103,107 in 1945. It continued to grow in the post war years, with 120,570 recorded in 1955 and 133,384 in 1965; the city reached a population of 139,490 people in 1970, a time when it was developing as a university city after Odense University was established in 1966.\nResidents began to move out of the centre into the suburban areas which were included in Odense Municipality after boundaries were redefined in 1970. As a result, the population declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s, falling to 136,646 in 1981. It began climbing again in the late 1980s, and steadily grew to 144,518 in 1996 and 145,554 in 2004. In 2025 Odense had a population of 185,480 people. \nMunicipal administration.\nOdense Municipality is the administrative unit which covers not only the city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages. Odense City Council consists of 29 members, including a mayor. The former mayor of Odense, Anker Boye, is a member of the Social Democratic Party. His first term was from 1993 to 2005 when he was defeated by Jan Boye, a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, forming a coalition with the Red\u2013Green Alliance, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats. Boye and his administration have been criticised for mismanaging the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen in 2005, above all for allegedly signing a contract with Tina Turner for a show which resulted in a deficit of 13 million kroner.\nIn the 2013 municipal elections, Boye was successful in obtaining sufficient support from the Liberals and the left to ensure his continuation as mayor from the beginning of 2014.\nBoye announced in December 2016 that he would resign as mayor on 1 January 2017. The new mayor of Odense would be Peter Rahb\u00e6k Juel, also a member of the Social Democrats. Rahb\u00e6k Juel succeeded Boye as announced and continues to serve as mayor after the municipal elections in 2017 and 2021.\nEconomy.\nOdense is Funen's most important industrial and commercial centre, and the city's central location in Denmark makes it one of the national convention and congress centres. Enterprises include the Albani Brewery, ABB (Asea Brown Boveri), Kansas Workwear (clothing), Plus Pack (canning and containers) as well as manufacturers in the electrical sector such as Riegens / SG Lighting. In recent years there has been a general trend from manufacturing into the service sector. By 2002, 51% of the workforce was employed by the service sector while only 13% were working in industry. Lind\u00f8 Wharf, once Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, has now been converted into Lind\u00f8 Industrial Park specialising in the production and storage of components for the offshore industries, creating a variety of new tenants. GASA, a large horticultural centre, supplies fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants to most of the country as well as for export. Established in 1988, Denmark's major commercial television channel TV 2 is based in Odense.\nThe Roseng\u00e5rdcentret shopping centre is located in the south-eastern part of Odense. The centre dates from 1971 and is the largest in Denmark with floor space and more than 150 shops as well as restaurants, a cinema and a fitness centre. Denmark's second-largest IKEA outlet is the biggest neighbour. A wide variety of shops can be found in the city centre, especially on Kongensgade and Vestergade and adjacent pedestrian streets.\nTourism is an important source of income for the city. In 2008 Odense Municipality was listed seventh in Denmark for turnover on tourism, reaching 1.6 million Danish kroner for the year. In 2011, Odense Zoo was Funen's most popular tourist attraction and the eleventh most popular in Denmark with 405,913 visitors. The zoo was founded in 1930 and covers an area of and has roughly 2,000 animals, covering 147 species. In 2001, Odense Zoo inaugurated a DKK 60 million \"Oceanium\" featuring South American animal life.\nNightlife in the city culminates in Brandts Passage, which contains numerous restaurants, bars and cafes. Hotels of note include the Comwell H.C. Andersen Hotel, the First Hotel Grand with its brasserie bar, the 68-room Old English-style Milling Hotel Plaza, City Hotel Nattergalen, which is in close proximity to the Hans Christian Andersen museum, and the 140-room Danhostel Odense City.\nOdense has become an internationally https://, particularly following the success of companies such as Universal Robots and Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR). The city hosts numerous startups, leading academic institutions in robotics at the University of Southern Denmark, the national drone test center at Hans Christian Andersen Airport, and the national Danish cluster for the robot industry, Odense Robotics, with more than 300 robotics, drone and automation companies, employing nearly 20,000 people. Odense is especially known for its advancements in collaborative robots, or \"co-bots.\"\nLandmarks.\nNonnebakken, a hill in the Odense area, is the site of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard, who had forced his father Harold Bluetooth to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings in Wollin (modern Poland) in around 975. The fort provided its occupier the command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.\nChurches.\nOdense is the see of the bishop of Funen. Saint Canute's Cathedral () was formerly connected with the great Benedictine monastery of the same name, and is one of the largest and finest buildings of its kind in Denmark. Originally dating from 1081 to 1093, the church was rebuilt in the 13th century in brick in a pure Gothic style. Under the altar lies Canute (Danish: \"Knud\"), the patron saint of Denmark and his brother on public display. A large fragment of Byzantine cloth is displayed next to the two skeletons. The cathedral also boasts one of Denmark's most remarkable altarpieces, a magnificent triptych by Claus Berg. Kings Hans and Christian II are buried in the city.\nSt Alban's Church, built in the Neogothic style and consecrated in 1908, is the Roman Catholic church of Odense. Its steeple is high. St Mary's Church (\"Vor Frue Kirke\" or Our Lady's Church), built in the 13th century and restored in 1851\u20131852 and again in 1864, contains a carved 16th-century altarpiece by Claus Berg of L\u00fcbeck. St John's Church (\"Sankt Hans Kirke\"), first mentioned in 1295, was built by the Knights Hospitaller, also known as the Order of Saint John. Not much of the original building remains as it was rebuilt in 1636 and subsequently restored. Built of red brick with horizontal decorations on the chancel wall, it has large Gothic windows. The date of 1496 on one of the bells in the step-ribbed tower may well be the year the church was completed. The tower is adjacent to Odense Palace which was originally built as a monastery.\nAnsgars Church was the first church to be built in Odense since the Middle Ages. Completed in 1902, it was designed by Niels Jacobsen in the late Romanesque style in red brick on granite foundations. The cross-shaped interior is complemented by a spired bell-tower, high. The Peace Church (\"Fredenskirke\") consecrated in 1920 was so named in gratitude for the end of the First World War. The church was the work of Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint who went on to design Copenhagen's Grundtvig's Church.\nCity Hall.\nOdense's City Hall (\"Odense R\u00e5dhus\"), with its medieval Italian look, was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and Carl Lendorf in the Historicist style. Completed in 1883, it combines red masonry with sandstone decorations, stepped gables and a saw-tooth course. It stands on the site of a smaller building from 1480. In 1937 Bent Helveg-M\u00f8ller won the competition for the building's enlargement. The tower over the main entrance was torn down in 1942 but was not rebuilt. As work was delayed during the war, the extension was not completed until 1955. In conjunction with Hans Christian Andersen's 200th anniversary in 2005, comprehensive renovation work was completed on the building's interiors, including the entrance halls, meeting rooms, banqueting hall and council chamber.\nPalaces and theatres.\nOdense Palace was erected by Frederick IV, who died there in 1730. Now an administrative building, it stands on the site of \"Sankt Hans Kloster\", a 15th-century monastery which was transferred to the Crown in 1536. The main white Baroque wing with 13 bays was designed by J.C. Krieger for Frederick IV and completed in 1723. Set in a park, the King's Garden was constructed to a French design by Johan Cornelius Krieger.\nOdense Teater, first established in 1796, is Denmark's second oldest theatrical enterprise and one of the country's three main theatres. The original building was on Sortebr\u00f8dre Torv was used until 1914 when a new building designed by Jacobsen was opened on Jernbanegade. It has three stages: \"Store Scene\", \"V\u00e6rkstedet\", and \"Foyerscenen\". The theatre also has stages in the former sugar factory \"Sukkerkogeriet\", where it runs the first drama school outside Copenhagen established in 1941. It is notable in theatrical history for staging the premi\u00e8re of Henrik Ibsen's first contemporary realist drama \"The Pillars of Society\" on 14 November 1877. Teater Momentum or Teater uden Rygl\u00e6n, publicly funded by the municipal government and the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, is also of note. Established in 2005, it signs on a new director each year who is charged with creating the \"volume\" of the year with a set of plays and performers. It also puts on other cultural entertainment including concerts, debates, lectures and poetry.\nOdense Symphony Orchestra (Odense Symfoniorkester), one of Denmark's five regional orchestras, was formally established in 1946. The orchestra is based in Odense Concert Hall, which was inaugurated in 1982. Most of the orchestra's concerts are given in the Carl Nielsen Hall, a seating capacity of 1,212 and a large 46-stops organ built by Marcussen &amp; Son. First established in 1948, Funen Opera (\"Den Fynske Opera\") was reopened in 1996 after a period of closure. It specializes in presenting contemporary operas in Danish.\nHans Christian Andersen connections.\nRemembered above all for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house on the corner of Hans Jensens Str\u00e6de and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It documents his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkem\u00f8llestr\u00e6de not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.\nThroughout the city there are numerous statues and sculptures representing characters from the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. They include the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Mermaid, the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep, the Toad, the Darning Needle, the Emperor's New Clothes, the Sea Horse, the Paper Boat, the Flying Trunk and the Wild Swans. A statue of Andersen stands in \"Eventyrhaven\" (The Fairy Tale Park), beside the cathedral. Sculpted by Louis Hasselriis in 1888, it shows the storyteller with a book in his hand, ready to entertain onlookers with his fairy tales.\nMuseums.\nThe museums in Odense are mainly governed by the Odense City Museums, a department of the municipal government. Funen's Art Museum (Fyns Kunstmuseum), formerly The Museum of Funen Diocese, was one of Denmark's oldest art museums, dating to 1885. It contained the principal works by Jens Juel, Dankvart Dreyer, P.S. Kr\u00f8yer and H. A. Brendekilde. The museum is now closed and all works transferred to the https://.The open-air The Funen Village museum (\"Den Fynske Landsby\") tries to emulate what country life was like in Denmark at the time of Andersen's life and contains houses of historical Odense. Another focus area is sustainability and circular economy and what that entailed in the 1800s.\nThe Carl Nielsen Museum is dedicated to the life of Carl Nielsen and his wife, the sculptor Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen. It documents his life from his childhood in the town of Nr. Lyndelse, to his career and success on the European music scene, with his violins, his bugle and his grand piano on display, as well as a number of his musical scores, including six symphonies, three concertos, two operas, and chamber music and numerous songs.\nThe M\u00f8nterg\u00e5rden - now Museum TID - cultural history museum of Odense is one of the most notable remaining Renaissance buildings of the city, built in 1646 by the nobleman Falk G\u00f8ye. It has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in Odense, and was named after the narrow street M\u00f8ntestr\u00e6de adjacent to the building, where a coin workshop once operated in around 1420. Located in a courtyard of half-timbered houses, the museum also has exhibits on Funen's ancient history, as well as Odense in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\nThe Danish Railway Museum is the national railway museum of Denmark, the largest such museum in Scandinavia. It was established in 1975 in a former engine shed adjacent to the city's main railway station and has an area of over , with some 50 locomotives and railway carriages on 20 rail tracks from all periods of Danish rail history. The oldest steam engine dates back to 1869.\nKunstmuseum Brandts is situated in the old industrial quarter and showcases Danish and international art. Over the years it has housed various semi-permanent exhitions like the Brandts Museum of Photographic Art, The Media Museum, and the classic collection from the former Fyns Kunstmuseum. It was founded on 13 September 1985 as part of the Brandts International Centre for Art and Culture and opened its own exhibition space in 1987. \nhttps:// (HANDS-ON Museum of fashion and interior 1900-1999) shows Danish design and fashion from the 20th century. Decade after decade you can walk through the recent past,\u00b4.\nEducation.\nOdense University.\nOdense University, established by law in 1964, was the first of three new provincial universities created to relieve pressure on the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus. Teaching began in 1966. By the end of the 20th century, there were 11,000 students and some 5,000 employees. Before it became part of the University of Southern Denmark in 1998, it had four faculties covering arts, medicine, and natural and social sciences. The university building which opened in 1971 was designed by KHR Arkitekter.\nUniversity of Southern Denmark.\nThe University of Southern Denmark (\"Syddansk Universitet\") was established in 1998 as a merger of Odense University, the Southern Denmark Business School (\"Handelsh\u00f8jskole Syd\"), the Southern Engineering School (\"Ingeni\u00f8rh\u00f8jskole Syd\") and the South Jutland University Centre (\"Sydjysk Universitetscenter\"). The main campus is in Odense but there are also departments in Copenhagen, Esbjerg, Kolding, Slagelse and S\u00f8nderborg. With some 26,000 students (2012), the establishment is Denmark's third largest university. The Faculty of Engineering (\"Det Tekniske Fakultet\") combines several institutions: \"Odense Maskinteknikum\" (a mechanical engineering college which was established in 1905 and in 1962 became the Southern Engineering School), the Mads Clausen Institute and the M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute.\nThe Odense campus of the University of Southern Denmark is known to host all faculties and study programs at the same place, contrary to, for instance, University of Copenhagen where the institutes and disciplines have been spread out in the city. This, too, is reflected in the strategy of the university which stresses cross-disciplinary research. In 2024, The University of Southern Denmark campus and Nyt OUH \u2013 the new buildings for Odense University Hospital \u2013 will be physically connected to promote cooperations between the two institutions. The combined university and hospital will cover 500,000 square meters, making it one of the largest buildings in Europe.\nOther educational institutions.\nOdense also includes departments of the UCL University College headquartered in Vejle. The university is the result of a merger between several further education institutions on Funen and in Jelling, Vejle and Svendborg. UCL is currently undertaking comprehensive renovation of the buildings on Niels Bohrs All\u00e9 from the 1960s where it will concentrate its Odense interests. It intends to open University College Lilleb\u00e6lt Campus Odense in August 2014.\nAimed at improving employment opportunities in business, the Lillebaelt Academy of Professional Higher Education (\"Erhvervsakademiet Lilleb\u00e6lt\") was established in 2009 as a result of a merger between Tietgen Business College, SDE college, Kold College and Vejle Business College. In 2014, it had 3,200 students and a staff of 300. Its programmes are offered at various locations in Odense and Vejle. Under the auspices of the municipality, the Odense School of Music (\"Odense Musikskole\") offers educational courses with an emphasis on music to children and young people up to the age of 25.\nKold College is a privately run institution offering vocational courses in food, agriculture and gardening. Founded in 2004, after a merger between Datum Tekniske Skole and Gartnerskolen S\u00f8hus, it changed its name to Kold College in 2008. It also offers secondary education courses in the natural sciences. The college is named after Christen Kold who founded vocational schools on Funen in the mid-19th century.\nFunen Art Academy is an independent, nationally recognized educational institution centrally located at the premises of Odense's first museum and former Funen Museum of Art. The academy offers a 5-year course in the visual arts, as well as various exhibitions, workshops, and artist talks.\nOdense is home to eight gymnasiums (Grammar schools), 21 state grade schools as well as a number of private schools.\nSports.\nOdense's most important football clubs are Odense Boldklub (OB), BK Marienlyst (BM), B1909, and B1913. OB has a history going back to 1887 when it was founded as \"Odense Kricketklub\" (Odense Cricket Club). It changed its name to Odense Boldklub in 1893 after football was included in its activities. The club has won three national championships, and five cup titles. The club play their home matches at Odense Stadium, also known as Odense Stadion. BK Marienlyst, founded in 1922, are in the Danish 2nd Division, and play their home matches at Marienlystcentret, which has a capacity of 1,200. The club also has a notable volleyball team. RC Odense represents the city at rugby in combination with Lind\u00f8 RSC.\nThe Odense Bulldogs are a professional ice hockey team based in Odense. They play in the top Danish League Metal Ligaen, as the only team from Funen. In tennis, Tennis Club Odense is located near the Odense River. The country's largest tennis centre is due to open in Marienlyst in 2014.\nThe H.C. Andersen Marathon is held annually in Odense. On Ascension Sunday, the locals participate in Eventyrl\u00f8bet (the Fairy Tale Run) with circuits from 2.5 to 10\u00a0km.\nThere are many smaller sports clubs in Odense covering athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, climbing, cycling, rowing, fencing, football, golf, gymnastics, handball, jujitsu, karate, riding, roller-skating, shooting, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, yoga and wrestling as well as several specialising in facilities for people with disabilities.\nEsports.\nIn early December 2017, the ESL Pro League Season 6 finals were held in the 4,000-seat Arena Fyn. The event would return to Odense for its Season 8 finals, won by the hometown heroes Astralis, in December 2018. The season 10 offline finals of ESL Pro League were also held in the city.\nTransport.\nBoat.\nThe Port of Odense consists of three main basins and a number of facilities along the canal, with quays measuring roughly in length in total. Vessels up to a length of and a draft of are facilitated in the port. The wharf for tankers is situated outside the harbour on the southern side of the canal, with facilities for tankers, general cargo ships, bulk, and LPG ships, and has a depth of .\nGreat Belt Bridge.\nAccessibility to Odense was greatly increased when the ferry service between the two main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, was replaced by the Great Belt Bridge \u2013 opened for rail traffic in 1997, for road traffic in 1998. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.\nRail, bus and tram.\nOdense's main railway station Odense Station lies on the railway line between Copenhagen and Jutland, Denmark's peninsular mainland. International trains connect the town with Hamburg in Germany. Local and regional trains link Odense to the rest of Denmark. A separate passenger railway line, Svendborgbanen, operates between Odense and Svendborg. Formerly, railways connected Odense to most of Funen's coastal cities, but these links were closed down in the 1950s and 1960s. Today, these regional routes are served by buses operated by the public company FynBus, which also operates the town's municipal bus service, connecting the town's suburbs to the city centre. On 28 May 2022, Odense's new tram line entered service. A 14.5\u00a0km double-track line runs from Tarup in the northwest to the station, Syddansk Universitet, a hospital, and Hjallese in the south, with 26 stops. Possible extensions are under consideration.\nRoad.\nBy road, Odense connects to Zealand and Jutland with the Funen Motorway (\"Fynske Motorvej\"), a section of the E20, and to Svendborg on the southern part of Funen by way of the Svendborg Motorway (\"Svendborgmotorvejen\"), which comprises the Danish national road 9. Other, smaller routes connect Odense to the rest of Funen, with direct links to all coastal towns.\nIn 2015 plannings were established on Denmark's first Diverging diamond interchange (DDI), called \"Dynamisk Ruderanl\u00e6g\", upgrading the diamond interchange number 52 on Fynske Motorvej (E20), crossing the roadways of Assensvej by following the American design of DDIs at On 17 September 2017, the redesigned interchange opened for traffic. Computer aided simulation and land usage resulted the DDI as the adequate solution.\nAir.\nOdense is served by Odense Airport, which operates flights to tourist resorts, mainly in the summer months.\nCycling Initiatives in Odense.\nIn 2016, the city of Odense, Denmark implemented a new form of technology to allow for more efficient bike travel. Often, when it is raining heavily, cyclists have had to sit in the rain for long periods of time at traffic lights, and this disincentives them to cycle to work that day. To fix this problem, Odense has placed rain sensors in traffic lights along their super bike highways. These sensors interact with motion detectors which \"allow the system to register when bikes are within 70 meters of the intersection.\" They then automatically prolong the green light. The intersection includes a small sign that explains the system to the cyclists, and when a light goes on, they can see the system is functioning. This technology allows cyclists to experience up to 20 seconds longer of green light, and makes their overall journey more efficient, safer, and dryer.\nThe Cycling Embassy of Denmark is the organization spearheading this research and initiatives. While there is not much criticism due to the cycling culture that is already fairly prevalent in Odense, those who commute in cars would be naturally upset by the longer red lights. However, the embassy believes that there should not be too much pushback because of the equity issue involved with being exposed to the rain versus being sheltered in a car. It will also only be utilized up to 3 times a month.\nThis initiative does not only optimize the corridor flow and speed for cyclists, but reinforces the \"green wave\". The green wave is known as the ability to cycle through several intersections without having to stop. This is the overall thought the Cycling Embassy had in installing rain sensors, as they hope to implement the technology in other intersections of the city, creating an efficient city-wide system of sustainable transit. Eventually, riding a bike will be easier than riding a car.\nHealthcare.\nThe Odense University Hospital (OUH), established in 1912, is of major regional importance, not only for healthcare, but for conducting research in collaboration with the Institute of Clinical Research of the University of Southern Denmark. OUH is the largest hospital unit in Denmark and the largest employer in Odense, and as of 2006 it had 1200 beds and a staff of 7700 people, of which 1300 people were doctors. Today there are about 10,000 employees covering all fields of medicine. The hospital tower block is high, has 15 floors and is Odense's tallest building.

It is maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation and is free and open, unrestricted by software patents. Its name is derived from \"ogging,\" jargon from the computer game \"Netrek\", alluding to the high processing cost of early versions of the software.\nThe Ogg container format can multiplex a number of independent streams for audio, video, text (such as subtitles), and metadata. In the Ogg multimedia framework, Theora provides a lossy video layer. The audio layer is most commonly provided by the music-oriented Vorbis format or its successor Opus. Lossless audio compression formats include FLAC, and OggPCM.\nUntil 2007, the codice_1 filename extension was used for all files whose content used the Ogg container format. Since then, the Xiph.Org Foundation recommends that codice_1 only be used for Ogg Vorbis audio files. Xiph.Org decided to create a new set of file extensions and media types to describe different types of content such as codice_3 for audio only files, codice_4 for video with or without sound (including Theora), and codice_5 for multiplexed Ogg.\nOgg's various codecs have been incorporated into a number of different free and proprietary media players, both commercial and non-commercial, as well as portable media players and GPS receivers from different manufacturers.\nAs of November 7, 2017, the current version of the Xiph.Org Foundation's reference implementation is libogg 1.3.3. Another version, libogg2, has been in development, but is awaiting a rewrite as of 2018. Both software libraries are free software, released under the New BSD License. Ogg reference implementation was separated from Vorbis on September 2, 2000.\nNaming.\nThe Ogg Vorbis project started in 1993. It was originally named \"Squish\" but that name was already trademarked, so the project underwent a name change. The new name, \"OggSquish\", was used until 2001 when it was changed again to \"Ogg\". Ogg has since come to refer to the container format, which is now part of the larger Xiph.org multimedia project. Today, \"Squish\" (now known as \"Vorbis\") refers to a particular audio coding format typically used with the Ogg container format.\nOgg is derived from \"ogging\", jargon from the computer game \"Netrek\", which came to mean doing something forcefully, possibly without consideration of the drain on future resources. At its inception, the Ogg project was thought by the authors to be somewhat ambitious given the limited power of the PC hardware of the time. Although the name Ogg is unrelated to the character Nanny Ogg in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, \"Vorbis\" is named after another Terry Pratchett character from the book \"Small Gods\".\nFile format.\nThe \"Ogg\" bitstream format, designed principally by the Xiph.Org Foundation, has been developed as the framework of a larger initiative aimed at producing a set of components for the coding and decoding of multimedia files, which are available free of charge and freely re-implementable in software and hardware.\nThe format consists of chunks of data each called an \"Ogg page\". Each page begins with the characters \"OggS\" to identify the file as Ogg format.\nA \"serial number\" and \"page number\" in the page header identifies each page as part of a series of pages making up a bitstream. Multiple bitstreams may be multiplexed in the file where pages from each bitstream are ordered by the seek time of the contained data. Bitstreams may also be appended to existing files, a process known as \"chaining\", to cause the bitstreams to be decoded in sequence.\nA BSD-licensed library, called \"libvorbis\", is available to encode and decode data from \"Vorbis\" streams. Independent Ogg implementations are used in several projects such as RealPlayer and a set of DirectShow filters.\nMogg, the \"Multi-Track-Single-Logical-Stream Ogg-Vorbis\", is the multi-channel or multi-track Ogg file format.\nPage structure.\nThe following is the field layout of an Ogg page header:\nThe capture pattern or sync code is a magic number used to ensure synchronization when parsing Ogg files. Every page starts with the four ASCII character sequence, \"OggS\". This assists in resynchronizing a parser in cases where data has been lost or is corrupted, and is a sanity check before commencing parsing of the page structure.\nThis field indicates the version of the Ogg bitstream format, to allow for future expansion. It is currently mandated to be 0.\nThis is an 8 bit field of flags, which indicates the type of page that follows.\nA granule position is the time marker in Ogg files. It is an abstract value, whose meaning is determined by the codec. It may, for example, be a count of the number of samples, the number of frames or a more complex scheme.\nThis field is a serial number that identifies a page as belonging to a particular logical bitstream. Each logical bitstream in a file has a unique value, and this field allows implementations to deliver the pages to the appropriate decoder. In a typical Vorbis and Theora file, one stream is the audio (Vorbis), and the other is the video (Theora)\nThis field is a monotonically increasing field for each logical bitstream. The first page is 0, the second 1, etc. This allows implementations to detect when data has been lost.\nThis field provides a CRC-32 checksum of the data in the entire page (including the page header, calculated with the checksum field set to 0). This allows verification that the data has not been corrupted since it was authored. Pages that fail the checksum should be discarded. The checksum is generated using a polynomial value of 0x04C11DB7.\nThis field indicates the number of segments that exist in this page. It also indicates how many bytes are in the segment table that follows this field. There can be a maximum of 255 segments in any one page.\nThe segment table is an array of 8-bit values, each indicating the length of the corresponding segment within the page body. The number of segments is determined from the preceding page segments field. Each segment is between 0 and 255 bytes in length.\nThe segments provide a way to group segments into packets, which are meaningful units of data for the decoder. When the segment's length is indicated to be 255, this indicates that the following segment is to be concatenated to this one and is part of the same packet. When the segment's length is 0\u2013254, this indicates that this segment is the final segment in this packet. Where a packet's length is a multiple of 255, the final segment is length 0.\nWhere the final packet continues on the next page, the final segment value is 255, and the continuation flag is set on the following page to indicate that the start of the new page is a continuation of last page.\nMetadata.\nVorbisComment is a base-level Metadata format initially authored for use with Ogg Vorbis. It has since been adopted in the specifications of Ogg encapsulations for other Xiph.Org codecs including Theora, Speex, FLAC and Opus. \"VorbisComment\" is the simplest and most widely supported mechanism for storing metadata with Xiph.Org codecs.\nNotably, one or more METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE=... in a \"VorbisComment\" for thumbnails and cover art have Base64-encoded values of the corresponding FLAC METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE. In other words, FLAC stores thumbnails and cover art in binary blocks\u2014outside of the FLAC tags in a little-endian METADATA_BLOCK_VORBIS_COMMENT.\nOther existing and proposed mechanisms are:\nHistory.\n The \"Play Ogg\" web button\nThe Ogg project began with a simple audio compression package as part of a larger project in 1993. The software was originally named \"Squish\" but due to an existing trade mark it was renamed to \"OggSquish\". This name was later used for the whole Ogg project. In 1997, the Xiphophorus OggSquish was described as \"an attempt both to create a flexible compressed audio format for modern audio applications as well as to provide the first audio format that is common on any and every modern computer platform\". The OggSquish was in 2000 referred to as \"a group of several related multimedia and signal processing projects\". In 2000, two projects were in active development for planned release: Ogg Vorbis format and libvorbis\u2014the reference implementation of Vorbis. Research also included work on future video and lossless audio coding. In 2001, OggSquish was renamed to \"Ogg\" and it was described as \"the umbrella for a group of several related multimedia and signal processing projects\". Ogg has come to stand for the file format, as part of the larger Xiph.org multimedia project. Squish became just the name of one of the Ogg codecs. In 2009, Ogg is described as \"a multimedia container format, and the native file and stream format for the Xiph.org multimedia codecs\".\nThe Ogg reference implementation was separated from Vorbis on September 2, 2000.\nIn May 2003, two Internet RFCs were published relating to the format. The Ogg bitstream was defined in (which is classified as 'informative') and its Internet content type (codice_6) in (which is, as of 2006[ [update]], a proposed standard protocol). In September 2008, RFC 3534 was obsoleted by , which added content types codice_7, codice_8 and filename extensions .ogx, .ogv, .oga, .spx.\nOGM.\nIn 2002, the lack of formal video support in Ogg resulted in the development of the \"OGM\" file format, a hack on Ogg that allowed embedding of video from the Microsoft DirectShow framework into an Ogg-based wrapper. OGM was initially supported only by closed source Windows-only tools, but the codebase was subsequently opened. Later, video (and subtitle) support were formally specified for Ogg but in a manner incompatible with OGM. Independently, the Matroska container format reached maturity and provided an alternative for people interested in combining Vorbis audio and arbitrary video codecs. As a result, OGM is no longer supported or developed and is formally discouraged by Xiph.org. Today, video in Ogg is found with the .ogv file extension, which is formally specified and officially supported. Software and codecs that support .ogm files are available without charge.\n2006.\nAlthough Ogg had not reached anywhere near the ubiquity of the MPEG standards (e.g., MP3/MP4), as of 2006[ [update]], it was commonly used to encode free content (such as free music, multimedia on Wikimedia Foundation projects and Creative Commons files) and had started to be supported by a significant minority of digital audio players. Also supporting the Ogg format were many popular video game engines, including \"Doom 3\", \"Unreal Tournament 2004\", ', \"Jets'n'Guns\", ', ', \"StepMania\", ', \"Lineage 2\", \"Vendetta Online\", \"Battlefield 2\", and the \"Grand Theft Auto\" engines, as well as the audio files of the Java-based game, \"Minecraft\". The more popular Vorbis codec had built-in support on many software players, and extensions were available for nearly all the rest.\n2007.\nOn May 16, 2007, the Free Software Foundation started a campaign to increase the use of Vorbis \"as an ethically, legally and technically superior audio alternative to the proprietary MP3 format\". People were also encouraged to support the campaign by adding a web button to their website or blog. For those who did not want to download and use the FSF's suggested Ogg player (VLC), the Xiph.Org Foundation had an official codec for QuickTime-based applications in Windows and Mac OS X, such as iTunes players and iMovie applications; and Windows users could install a Windows Media Player Ogg codec.\n2009.\nBy June 30, 2009, the Ogg container, through the use of the Theora and Vorbis, was the only container format included in Firefox 3.5 web browser's implementation of the HTML5 codice_9 and codice_10 elements. This was in accordance with the original recommendation outlined in, but later removed from, the HTML5 draft specification (see Ogg controversy).\n2010.\nOn March 3, 2010, a technical analysis by an FFmpeg developer was critical about the general purpose abilities of Ogg as a multimedia container format. The author of Ogg later responded to these claims in an article of his own.\nOgg codecs.\nOgg is only a container format. The actual audio or video encoded by a codec is stored inside an Ogg container. Ogg containers may contain streams encoded with multiple codecs; for example, a video file with sound contains data encoded by both an audio codec and a video codec.\nBeing a container format, Ogg can embed audio and video in various formats (such as Dirac, MNG, CELT, MPEG-4, MP3 and others) but Ogg was intended to be, and usually is, used with the following Xiph.org free codecs:\nMedia types.\nOgg audio media is registered as IANA media type audio/ogg with file extensions .oga, .ogg, and .spx. It is a proper subset of the Ogg video media type video/ogg with file extension .ogv. Other Ogg applications use media type application/ogg with file extension .ogx; this is a superset of video/ogg. The Opus media type audio/opus with file extension .opus was registered later in RFC and .\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He works as a menhir sculptor and deliveryman as well as one of the primary defenders of the Gaulish village, and is Asterix's best friend. Obelix is noted for his obesity, the menhirs he carries around on his back and his superhuman strength. He fell into a cauldron of the Gauls' magic potion when he was a baby, causing him to be the only Gaul in Asterix's village who is in a permanent state of superhuman strength. Because of this already enormous strength, Obelix is not allowed to drink the magic potion ever again, a ban he regards as being tremendously unfair. Other characteristics are his simplemindedness, his love and care for his dog Dogmatix, his anger when someone refers to him as being \"fat\", his enthusiasm for hunting and eating wild boars, and beating up Romans. His catchphrase is: \"Ils sont fous ces romains\", which translates into \"These Romans are crazy!\", although he considers nearly every other nationality, even other Gauls, to be just as strange.\nThe character was portrayed by actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu in every \"Asterix\" live-action film until 2023's \"\".\nCharacter.\nObelix is Asterix's closest friend (they even have the same birthday\u2014although this is inconsistent with the comic \"Obelix and Co.\", where only Obelix's birthday is celebrated). He generally works as a menhir delivery man. His passions in life are hanging around with Asterix, fighting, hunting and eating wild boar, making and carrying his menhirs, and beating up Roman legionaries (and occasionally collecting their helmets as trophies). Obelix has a little dog named Dogmatix (Fr. \"Id\u00e9fix\"), whom he adores. His parents live now in Condate (as seen in \"Asterix and the Actress\") and his distant cousin Metallurgix, a famous golden sickle maker, lives in Lutetia (as seen in \"Asterix and the Golden Sickle\").\nObelix's favourite food is roast wild boar which he usually hunts with Asterix, but he has a voracious appetite, and will try eating nearly anything with few exceptions; in \"Asterix and Obelix All at Sea\" and \"Asterix in Britain\" he seems not to like boiled boar. In fact, he eats nuts and oysters in the shell, and is completely oblivious to drugs, spicy food and poison, possibly due to the permanent effects of the magic potion. However, when he consumes alcohol, he gets very drunk very quickly, as seen for example in \"Asterix in Britain\" where he enjoys sampling different barrels of wine trying to find a barrel containing magic potion, or in \"Asterix and the Laurel Wreath\", where both he and chief Vitalstatistix get drunk during a banquet, much to the shame of the latter's wife Impedimenta. Although he has his own house, Obelix is occasionally shown staying overnight at Asterix's.\nObelix owns the quarry where he chisels the menhirs himself. It is never directly stated what the menhirs are mostly used for aside from being Obelix\u2019s personal blunt weapons. It is hinted that they are also just oversized knick-knacks; however they are probably a running-gag regarding the origins of the mystery surrounding Menhirs in ancient Europe, with the joke being that Obelix delivered them. Obelix usually trades the stones away for whatever he needs, resulting in the village having a literal field of menhirs.\nObelix is kind-hearted, but socially inept\u2014possibly because his strength means that others have had to adapt to him instead of vice versa. He is still not completely aware of his own strength and almost invariably breaks any door he \"gently\" knocks on, making him a human battering ram. He is frequently used as a \"human battering ram\" for opening locked doors or breaking through walls. Similarly, he is unaware that others do not share his superhuman strength, and shows great surprise when others are crushed by what he calls \"a little menhir\", or when Asterix attempts to explain to him that a small dog like Dogmatix cannot lift a menhir. He also has little interest in subjects of formal education or intellectual pursuits, since sheer strength usually solves his problems; he generally leaves any decisions to Asterix. However, Obelix is not completely stupid. In \"Asterix and the Normans\" he deduces from various clues that Cacofonix the bard has gone to Lutetia to pursue a career in popular music: this unusual display of intelligence on Obelix's part surprises Getafix. He also surprises Asterix in \"Asterix and the Black Gold\" by reeling off a dictionary definition of wild boar in conversation (including the Latin taxonomical classification). He can also be quite dangerous when angered.\nWhile cheerfully violent and enjoying a good fight, Obelix is far from brutal or sadistic: he tends to view fighting as a game and is generally friendly and polite (to the point of inappropriate courtesy) towards his opponents. He extends this benevolence even towards the Romans, whom he rarely seems to view as oppressors but more as less-willing participants in his rough-housing (The Romans themselves seem to view him as a terrifying ogre, whose infamy has spread across the entire Roman army). His other favored pastimes are dancing (which he apparently is very good at), and occasionally drinking goat's milk to excess (as he rarely imbibes in alcohol).\nLike Asterix, Obelix is a bachelor, but he is easily smitten by a pretty face. He harbours a hopeless crush on Panacea, the daughter of Soporifix (one of the other villagers), and occasionally other young women, most notably Mrs. Geriatrix (which enrages her husband). However, one may think that he will eventually find a mate and have children since in \"Asterix and the Class Act\", he is shown to be the founder of a long dynasty of French warriors that lasted well into the 20th century.\nObelix's trademark phrase is \"These Romans are crazy\" (\"Ils sont fous ces romains\": in the Italian translation, it is \"Sono pazzi questi Romani\", which can be shortened to S.P.Q.R., Rome's motto), although he has applied a variant of it to nearly every group he's met in his travels: \"These Britons are crazy\", \"These Corsicans are crazy\", etc. This remark is followed by him tapping his forehead. It is a parody of the quote \"These Gauls are crazy\", which Julius Caesar famously said while describing the Gauls' fighting style during his conquest of the region.\nStrength.\nUnlike the other villagers, Obelix has no need to drink the druid Getafix's magic potion that gives superhuman strength, because he fell into the cauldron as a baby and its effect on him became permanent. Obelix is tall and massive. He is about tall and he weighs more than . The story of that incident is told in \"How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy.\" Since this effect was not intended or expected, Getafix refuses to allow him even one more drop except under the most dire circumstances (either out of fear for his life, or fear for the lives of others should the inattentive and uncoordinated strongman become any stronger), which annoys Obelix greatly. (In \"Asterix and Obelix All at Sea\", it is revealed that too much of the potion can turn the drinker to stone; exactly how much is not known, but a whole cauldron will certainly do the trick. This appears to only work on grown people as Obelix did not turn to stone as a baby, or may simply occur after drinking an excessive amount while still under the effects of a previous dose). However, in \"Asterix and Cleopatra,\" Getafix gives him a few drops to open a door in the Great Pyramid's Labyrinth but he comments that he does not see much difference between \"before and after the potion\" though this is presumably because Obelix is used to accomplishing any physical task with ease.\nAlthough it has been clearly stated by both Getafix (in \"Asterix the Gaul\") and Asterix (in \"Asterix and the Laurel Wreath\") that the magic potion does NOT grant invulnerability (Getafix has a potion for that but it is only mentioned in Asterix the Gaul), meaning that they \"could\" be injured by the Romans in their fights but their raw strength generally prevents the Romans getting the chance to do so, the same does not seem to be true of Obelix. He does not even notice when attackers attempt to knock him unconscious with blows to the head, when Roman spearheads are stuck in his bottom in \"Asterix in Corsica\" or when anyone else attempts to harm him in any way. This may imply that Obelix, either by stupidity or ignorance, simply does not notice or react to the pain that should be inflicted, or that the potion has enhanced his overall strength, since it has been shown to increase the drinker's endurance allowing them to run faster, to such a point where his muscles allow him to effortlessly absorb the attacks in question. Most of the occasions where Obelix demonstrates invulnerability include him being attacked physically rather than with sharp objects, as in Asterix and the Magic Carpet, when an arrow accidentally hits his bottom and he yells in agony, and thus showing that Obelix is not above physical pain.\nObelix does sometimes display twisted views, especially when it comes to the relationship between the Gauls and the Romans. As far as he is concerned the more Romans he can beat up the better and nobody should deny him this, not even the \"selfish\" Roman victims themselves:\nPortrayal.\nAlbert Augier voiced Obelix in a 1960 radio play. For the animated films, he has been voiced by Jacques Morel in the first three, Pierre Tornade in all films during the '80s and '90s, as well as the videogames \"Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL\" and ', Jacques Frantz in the 2006 film \"Asterix and the Vikings\" and the videogame \"Asterix at the Olympic Games\", and currently Guillaume Briat since the 2014 film '. In the English dubs of the animated films, he has been voiced by Hal Brav, Michael Kilgarriff, Billy Kearns, Bernard Bresslaw, Rosey Grier, Howard Lew Lewis, Brad Garrett, C. Ernst Harth, and Nick Frost.\nIn the live action films, G\u00e9rard Depardieu played Obelix until Gilles Lellouche took over the role for \"\". The English dubs for these films have featured Obelix's voice being provided by Terry Jones, Dominic Fumusa, and Paul Bandey.\nName.\nObelix's name is a pun on the Greek-derived word \"ob\u00e9lisque\" (obelisk, an ancient Greek stone pillar), suggested by his rotund physique and his habit of casually carrying heavy stone monuments (Menhir) around with him. The word \"obelisk\" is also (in both French and English) a variant of the word obelus (\"ob\u00e8le\"), a typographical mark (\"\u2020\") often found in a companion role to that of the asterisk, after which his friend Asterix is named.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Theologically, it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah, both Written and Oral, as literally revealed by God on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since.\nOrthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish law, or \"halakha\", which is to be interpreted and determined only according to traditional methods and in adherence to the continuum of received precedent through the ages. It regards the entire \"halakhic\" system as ultimately grounded in immutable revelation, essentially beyond external and historical influence. More than any theoretical issue, obeying the dietary, purity, ethical and other laws of \"halakha\" is the hallmark of Orthodoxy. Practicing members are easily distinguishable by their lifestyle, refraining from doing numerous routine actions on the Sabbath and holidays, consuming only \"kosher\" food, praying thrice a day, studying the Torah often, donning head covering and tassels for men and modest clothing for women, and so forth. Other key doctrines include belief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead, divine reward and punishment for the righteous and the sinners, the Election of Israel as a people bound by a covenant with God, and an eventual reign of a salvific Messiah who will restore the Temple in Jerusalem and gather the people to Zion.\nOrthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are often strained, and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between the \"Haredi\" (ultra-Orthodox) branch, which is more conservative and reclusive, and the Modern Orthodox, which is relatively open to outer society and partakes in secular life and culture. Each of those is itself formed of independent communities. These are almost uniformly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy as the only legitimate form of Judaism.\nWhile adhering to traditional beliefs, the movement is a modern phenomenon. It arose as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewish community since the late 18th century, and was much shaped by a conscious struggle against the pressures of secularization, acculturation and rival alternatives. The strictly observant Orthodox are a definite minority among all Jews, but there are also numerous semi- and non-practicing persons who are affiliated or personally identify with Orthodox communities and organizations. In total, Orthodox Judaism is the largest Jewish religious group, estimated to have over 2 million practicing adherents, and at least an equal number of nominal members or self-identifying supporters.\nDefinitions.\nThe earliest known mention of the term \"Orthodox Jews\" was made in the \"Berlinische Monatsschrift\" in 1795. The word \"Orthodox\" was borrowed from the general German Enlightenment discourse, and used to denote those Jews who opposed Enlightenment. During the early and mid-19th century, with the advent of the progressive movements among German Jews, and especially early Reform Judaism, the title \"Orthodox\" became the epithet of traditionalists who espoused conservative positions on the issues raised by modernization. They themselves often disliked the Christian term, preferring titles such as \"Torah-true\" (\"gesetztreu\"). They often declared that they used it only as a convenience. German Orthodox leader Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch referred to \"the conviction commonly designated as Orthodox Judaism\"; in 1882, when Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer became convinced that the public understood that his philosophy and Liberal Judaism were radically different, he removed the word \"Orthodox\" from the name of his Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary. By the 1920s, the term had become common and accepted even in Eastern Europe.\nOrthodoxy perceives itself as the only authentic continuation of Judaism as it was until the crisis of modernity. Its progressive opponents often shared this view, regarding it as a remnant of the past and lending credit to their own rivals' ideology. Thus, the term \"Orthodox\" is often used generically to refer to traditional (even if only in the sense that it is unrelated to the modernist movements) synagogues, rites, and observances.\nAcademic research noted that the formation of Orthodox ideology and organizations was itself influenced by modernity. This was brought about by the need to defend the very concept of tradition in a world where that was no longer self-evident. When secularization and the dismantlement of communal structures uprooted the old order of Jewish life, traditionalist elements united to form groups that had a specific self-understanding. This, and all that it entailed, constituted a notable change, for the Orthodox had to adapt to modern society no less than anyone else; they developed novel, sometimes radically so, means of action and modes of thought. \"Orthodoxization\" was a contingent process, drawing from local circumstances and dependent on the threat sensed by its proponents: a sharply delineated Orthodox identity appeared in Central Europe, in Germany and Hungary, by the 1860s; a less stark one emerged in Eastern Europe during the Interwar period. Among the Jews of the Muslim lands, similar processes on a large scale began only around the 1970s, after they immigrated to Israel. Orthodoxy is often described as extremely conservative, ossifying a once-dynamic tradition due to the fear of legitimizing change. While this was sometimes true, its defining feature was not forbidding change and \"freezing\" Jewish heritage, but rather the need to adapt to being but a segment of Judaism in a modern world inhospitable to traditional practice, often employing much accommodation and leniency. In the mid-1980s, research on Orthodox Judaism became a scholarly discipline, examining how the need to confront modernity shaped and changed its beliefs, ideologies, social structure, and \"halakhic\" rulings, separating it from traditional Jewish society.\nHistory.\nModernity crisis.\nUntil the latter half of the 18th century, Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe were autonomous entities, with distinct privileges and obligations. They were led by the affluent wardens' class judicially subject to rabbinical courts, which governed most civil matters. Jewish Law was considered normative and enforced upon transgressors (common sinning was rebuked, but tolerated) invoking all communal sanctions: imprisonment, taxation, flogging, pillorying, and, especially, excommunication. Cultural, economic, and social exchange with non-Jewish society was limited and regulated.\nThis state of affairs came to an end with the rise of the modern, centralized state, which appropriated all authority. The nobility, clergy, urban guilds, and all other corporate estates were gradually stripped of privileges, inadvertently creating a more equal and secularized society. The Jews were one of the groups affected: excommunication was banned, and rabbinic courts lost almost all their jurisdiction. The state, especially following the French Revolution, was more and more inclined to tolerate Jews as a religious sect, but not as an autonomous entity, and sought to reform and integrate them as \"useful subjects\". Jewish emancipation and equal rights were discussed. The Christian (and especially Protestant) separation of \"religious\" and \"secular\" was applied to Jewish affairs, to which these concepts were alien. The rabbis were bemused when the state expected them to assume pastoral care, foregoing their principal judicial role. Of secondary importance, much less than the civil and legal transformations, were the ideas of Enlightenment that chafed at the authority of tradition and faith.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the weakened rabbinic establishment was facing a new kind of transgressor: they could not be classified as tolerable sinners overcome by their urges (\"khote le-te'avon\"), or as schismatics like the Sabbateans or Frankists, against whom sanctions were levied. Their attitudes did not fit the criteria set when faith was a normative and self-evident part of worldly life, but rested on the realities of the new, secularized age. The wardens' class, which wielded most power within the communities, was rapidly acculturating and often sought to oblige the state's agenda. \nRabbi Elazar Fleckeles, who returned to Prague from the countryside in 1783, recalled that he first faced there \"new vices\" of principled irreverence towards tradition, rather than \"old vices\" such as gossip or fornication. In Hamburg, Rabbi Raphael Cohen attempted to reinforce traditional norms. Cohen ordered the men in his community to grow a beard, forbade holding hands with one's wife in public, and decried women who wore wigs, instead of visible headgear, to cover their hair; Cohen taxed and otherwise persecuted members of the priestly caste who left the city to marry divorcees, men who appealed to state courts, those who ate food cooked by Gentiles, and other transgressors. Hamburg's Jews repeatedly appealed to the civil authorities, which eventually justified Cohen. However, the unprecedented meddling in his jurisdiction profoundly shocked him and dealt a blow to the prestige of the rabbinate.\nAn ideological challenge to rabbinic authority, in contrast to prosaic secularization, appeared in the form of the \"Haskalah\" (Jewish Enlightenment) movement which came to the fore in 1782. Hartwig Wessely, Moses Mendelssohn, and other \"maskilim\" called for a reform of Jewish education, abolition of coercion in matters of conscience, and other modernizing measures. They bypassed rabbinic approval and set themselves, at least implicitly, as a rival intellectual elite. A bitter struggle ensued. Reacting to Mendelssohn's assertion that freedom of conscience must replace communal censure, Rabbi Cohen of Hamburg commented: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The very foundation of the Law and commandments rests on coercion, enabling to force obedience and punish the transgressor. Denying this fact is akin to denying the sun at noon.\nHowever, \"maskilic\"-rabbinic rivalry ended in most of Central Europe, as governments imposed modernization upon their Jewish subjects. Schools replaced traditional \"cheders\", and standard German began to supplant Yiddish. Differences between the establishment and the Enlightened became irrelevant, and the former often embraced the views of the latter (now antiquated, as more aggressive modes of acculturation replaced the Haskalah program). In 1810, when philanthropist Israel Jacobson opened what was later identified as the first Reform synagogue in Seesen, with modernized rituals, he encountered little protest.\nHamburg Temple dispute.\nThe founding of the Hamburg Temple in 1818 mobilized the conservative elements. The organizers of the synagogue wished to appeal to acculturated Jews with a modernized ritual. They openly defied not just the local rabbinic court that ordered them to desist, but published learned tracts that castigated the entire rabbinical elite as hypocritical and obscurant. The moral threat they posed to rabbinic authority, as well as \"halakhic\" issues such as having a gentile play an organ on the Sabbath, were combined with theological issues. The Temple's revised prayer book omitted or rephrased petitions for the coming of the Messiah and renewal of sacrifices (\"post factum\", it was considered to be the first Reform liturgy). More than anything else, this doctrinal breach alarmed the traditionalists. Dozens of rabbis from across Europe united in support of the Hamburg rabbinic court, banning the major practices enacted there and offering \"halakhic\" grounds for forbidding any changes. Most historians concur that the 1818\u20131821 Hamburg Temple dispute, with its concerted backlash against Reform and the emergence of a self-aware conservative ideology, marks the beginning of Orthodox Judaism.\nThe leader and organizer of the Orthodox camp during the dispute, and the most influential figure in early Orthodoxy, was Rabbi Moses Sofer of Pressburg, Hungary. Historian Jacob Katz regarded him as the first to grasp the realities of the modern age. Sofer understood that what remained of his political clout would soon disappear, and that he had largely lost the ability to enforce observance; as Katz wrote, \"obedience to \"halakha\" became dependent on recognizing its validity, and this very validity was challenged by those who did not obey.\" He was deeply troubled by reports from his native Frankfurt and the arrival from the west of dismissed rabbis, ejected by progressive wardens, or pious families, fearing for the education of their children. These \u00e9migr\u00e9s often became ardent followers.\nSofer's response to the crisis of traditional Jewish society was unremitting conservatism, canonizing every detail of prevalent norms in the observant community lest any compromise legitimize the progressives' claim that the law was fluid or redundant. He was unwilling to trade \"halakhic\" opinions for those he considered to be pretending to honor the rules of rabbinic discourse, while intending to undermine them. Sofer regarded traditional customs as equivalent to vows; he warned in 1793 that even the \"custom of ignoramuses\" (one known to be rooted solely in a mistake of the common masses) was to be meticulously observed and revered. Sofer was frank and vehement about his stance, stating during the Hamburg dispute that prayers in the vernacular were not problematic \"per se\", but he forbade them because they constituted an innovation. He succinctly expressed his attitude in wordplay he borrowed from the Talmud: \"The new (\"Chadash\", originally meaning new grain) is forbidden by the Torah anywhere.\" Regarding the new, ideologically-driven sinners, Sofer commented in 1818 that they should have been anathemized and banished from the People of Israel like earlier heretical sects.\nUnlike most, if not all, rabbis in Central Europe, who had little choice but to compromise, Sofer enjoyed unique circumstances. He, too, had to tread carefully during the 1810s, tolerating a modernized synagogue in Pressburg and other innovations, and his \"yeshiva\" was nearly closed by warden Wolf Breisach. But in 1822, three poor (and therefore traditional) community members, whose deceased apostate brother bequeathed them a large fortune, rose to the wardens' board. Breisach died soon after, and the Pressburg community became dominated by the conservatives. Sofer also possessed a strong base in the form of his \"yeshiva\", the world's largest at the time, with hundreds of students. And crucially, the large and privileged Hungarian nobility blocked most imperial reforms in the backward country, including those relevant to the Jews. Hungarian Jewry retained its pre-modern character well into the 19th century, allowing Sofer's disciples to establish a score of new \"yeshivas\", at a time when these institutions were rapidly closing in the west, and a strong rabbinate to appoint them. A generation later, a self-aware Orthodoxy was well entrenched in the country. Hungarian Jewry gave rise both to Orthodoxy in general, in the sense of a comprehensive response to modernity, and specifically to the traditionalist, militant ultra-Orthodoxy.\nThe 1818\u20131821 controversy also elicited a different response, which first arose in its very epicenter. Severe protests did not affect Temple congregants, eventually leading the wardens of Hamburg's Jewish community to a comprehensive compromise for the sake of unity. They replaced the elderly, traditional Chief Dayan Baruch Oser with Isaac Bernays. The latter was a university graduate, clean-shaven, and modern, who could appeal to the acculturated and the young. Bernays signified a new era, and historians marked him as the first modern rabbi, fitting the demands of emancipation: his contract forbade him to tax, punish, or coerce, and he lacked political or judiciary power. He was forbidden from interfering in the Temple's conduct. Conservative in the principal issues of faith, in aesthetic, cultural, and civil matters, Bernays was a reformer and the Temple leaders. He introduced secular studies for children, wore a cassock like a Protestant clergyman, and delivered vernacular sermons. He forbade the spontaneous, informal character of synagogue conduct typical of Ashkenazi tradition, and ordered prayers to be somber and dignified. Bernays' style re-unified the Hamburg community by accommodating their aesthetic demands (but not theological ones, raised by only a learned few).\nThe combination of religious conservatism and modernity in everything else was emulated elsewhere, earning the label \"Neo-Orthodoxy\". Bernays and his like-minded followers, such as Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, fully accepted the platform of the moderate \"Haskalah\", taking away its progressive edge. While old-style traditional life continued in Germany until the 1840s, secularization and acculturation turned Neo-Orthodoxy into the strict right-wing of German Jewry. It was fully articulated by Bernays' mid-century disciples Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer. Hirsch, a Hamburg native who was ten during the Temple dispute, combined Orthodox dogmatism and militancy against rival interpretations of Judaism, granting leniency on many cultural issues and embraced German culture. The novel mixture termed Neo-Orthodoxy spread.\nWhile insisting on strict observance, the movement both tolerated and advocated modernization: Traditionally rare formal religious education for girls was introduced; modesty and gender separation were relaxed to match German society; men went clean-shaven and dressed like Gentiles; and exclusive Torah study virtually disappeared. Basic religious studies incorporating German provided children with practical \"halakhic\" knowledge for thriving in modern society. Ritual was reformed to match prevalent aesthetic conceptions, much like non-Orthodox synagogues though without the ideological undertone, and the liturgy was often abbreviated. Neo-Orthodoxy mostly did not attempt to reconcile its conduct and \"halakhic\" or moral norms. Instead it adopted compartmentalization, de facto limiting Judaism to the private and religious spheres, while otherwise yielding to outer society. While conservative Rabbis in Hungary still thought in terms of the now-lost communal autonomy, the Neo-Orthodox turned Judaism from an all-encompassing practice into a private religious conviction.\n\"Wissenschaft des Judentums\".\nIn the late 1830s, modernist pressures in Germany shifted from the secularization debate, moving into the \"purely religious\" sphere of theology and liturgy. A new generation of university-trained rabbis (many German states required communal rabbis to possess such education) sought to reconcile Judaism with the historical-critical study of scripture and the dominant philosophies of the day, especially Kant and Hegel. Influenced by the critical \"Science of Judaism\" (\"Wissenschaft des Judentums\") pioneered by Leopold Zunz, and often in emulation of the Liberal Protestant milieu, they reexamined and undermined beliefs held as sacred in traditional circles, especially the notion of an unbroken chain from Sinai to the Sages. The more radical among the \"Wissenschaft\" rabbis, unwilling to limit critical analysis or its practical application, coalesced around Rabbi Abraham Geiger to establish Reform Judaism. Between 1844 and 1846, Geiger organized three rabbinical synods in Braunschweig, Frankfurt and Breslau, to determine how to refashion Judaism for present times.\nThe Reform conferences were met with uproar by the Orthodox. Warden Hirsch Lehren of Amsterdam and Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger of Altona both organized anti-Reform manifestos, denouncing the new initiatives, signed by scores of rabbis from Europe and the Middle East. The tone of the signatories varied considerably along geographic lines: letters from traditional societies in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire implored local leaders to petition the authorities and have them ban the movement. Signers from Central and Western Europe used terms commensurate with the liberal age. All were implored by the petitioners to be brief and accessible; complex \"halakhic\" arguments, intended to convince the rabbinic elite in past generations, were replaced by an appeal to the secularized masses.\nThe struggle with \"Wissenschaft\" criticism shaped the Orthodox. For centuries, Ashkenazi rabbinic authorities espoused Nahmanides' position that the Talmudic exegesis, which derived laws from the Torah's text by employing hermeneutics, was binding \"d'Oraita\". Geiger and others presented exegesis as an arbitrary, illogical process, and consequently defenders of tradition embraced Maimonides' claim that the Sages merely buttressed already received laws with biblical citations, rather than actually deriving them. \nJay Harris commented, \"An insulated orthodox, \"or, rather, traditional\" rabbinate, feeling no pressing need to defend the validity of the Oral Law, could confidently appropriate the vision of most medieval rabbinic scholars; a defensive German Orthodoxy, by contrast, could not. ... Thus began a shift in understanding that led Orthodox rabbis and historians in the modern period to insist that the \"entire\" Oral Law was revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.\" 19th-Century Orthodox commentaries, like those authored by Malbim, attempted to amplify the notion that the Oral and Written Law were intertwined and inseparable.\n\"Wissenschaft\" posed a greater challenge to the modernized neo-Orthodox than to the traditionalist. Hirsch and Hildesheimer divided on the matter, anticipating modernist Orthodox attitudes to the historical-critical method. Hirsch argued that analyzing minutiae of tradition as products of their historical context was akin to denying its divine origin and timeless relevance. Hildesheimer consented to research under limits, subjugating it to the predetermined sanctity of the subject matter and accepting its results only when they accorded with the latter. More importantly, while he was content to engage academically, he opposed its practical application in religious questions, requiring traditional methods to be used. Hildesheimer's approach was emulated by his disciple Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann, a scholar and apologetic. His polemic against the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis formed the classical Orthodox response to Higher Criticism. Hoffman declared that for him, the unity of the Pentateuch was a given, regardless of research. Hirsch often lambasted Hoffman for contextualizing rabbinic literature.\nAll of them stressed the importance of dogmatic adherence to \"Torah min ha-Shamayim\", which led them to conflict with Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. Unlike the Reform camp, Frankel insisted on strict observance and displayed great reverence towards tradition. But though appreciated by conservatives, his practice of \"Wissenschaft\" left him suspect to Hirsch and Hildesheimer. They demanded again and again that he state his beliefs concerning the nature of revelation. In 1859, Frankel published a critical study of the Mishnah, and added that all commandments classified as \"Law given to Moses at Sinai\" were merely customs (he broadened Asher ben Jehiel's opinion). Hirsch and Hildesheimer seized the opportunity and launched a public campaign against him, accusing him of heresy. Concerned that public opinion regarded both neo-Orthodoxy and Frankel's \"Positive-Historical School\" centered at Breslau as similarly observant and traditionalist, the two stressed that the difference was dogmatic and not \"halakhic\". They managed to tarnish Frankel's reputation in the traditional camp and delegitimized him for many. The Positive-Historical School is regarded by Conservative Judaism as an intellectual forerunner. While Hildesheimer distinguished Frankel's observant disciples from Reform proponents, he wrote in his diary: \"how meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer\".\nCommunal schism.\nDuring the 1840s in Germany, as traditionalists became a clear minority, some Orthodox rabbis, such as Salomo Eger of Posen, urged the adoption of Moses Sofer's position and to anathemize the principally nonobservant. Eating, worshipping or marrying with them were to be banned. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, whose journal \"Treue Zionsw\u00e4chter\" was the first regular Orthodox newspaper (signifying the coalescence of a distinct Orthodox mindset), rejected their call. Ettlinger, and German neo-Orthodoxy in his wake, chose to regard the modern secularized Jew as a transgressor rather than a schismatic. He adopted Maimonides' interpretation of the Talmudic concept \"tinok shenishba\" (captured infant), a Jew by birth who was not raised as such and therefore could be absolved for not practicing, and greatly expanded it to serve the Orthodox need to tolerate the nonobservant majority (many of their own congregants ignored strict practice). For example, he allowed congregants to drink wine poured by Sabbath desecrators, and to ignore other \"halakhic\" sanctions. Yet German neo-Orthodoxy could not legitimize nonobservance, and adopted a hierarchical approach, softer than traditional sanctions, but no less intent on differentiating sinners and righteous. Reform rabbis or lay leaders, considered ideological opponents, were castigated, while the common mass was to be carefully handled.\nSome German neo-Orthodox believed that while doomed to minority status in their native country, their ideology could successfully confront modernity and unify Judaism in more traditional communities to the east. In 1847, Hirsch was elected Chief Rabbi of Moravia, where old rabbinic culture and \"yeshiva\"s operated. His expectations were dashed as traditionalist rabbis scorned him for his European manners and lack of Talmudic acumen. They became enraged by his attempts to reform synagogues and to establish a rabbinical seminary including secular studies. The progressives viewed him as too conservative. After four years of constant strife, he lost faith in the possibility of reuniting the Jewish public. In 1851, a group in Frankfurt am Main that opposed the Reform character of the Jewish community turned to Hirsch. He led them for the remainder of his life, finding Frankfurt a hospitable site for his unique ideology, which amalgamated acculturation, dogmatic theology, thorough observance, and strict secession from the non-Orthodox.\nThat year, Hildesheimer visited Hungary. Confounded by urbanization and acculturation \u2013 and the rise of Neology, a nonobservant laity served by rabbis who mostly favoured the Positive-Historical approach \u2013 the elderly local rabbis at first welcomed Hildesheimer. He opened a modern school in Eisenstadt that combined secular and religious studies. Traditionalists such as Moshe Schick and Yehudah Asz\u00f3d sent their sons to study there. Samuel Benjamin Sofer, the heir of late Hatam Sofer, considered appointing Hildesheimer as his assistant-rabbi in Pressburg and instituting secular studies in the city's great \"yeshiva\". The rabbi of Eisenstadt believed that only a full-fledged modern rabbinical seminary could fulfill his neo-Orthodox agenda. In the 1850s and 1860s, however, a radical reactionary Orthodox party coalesced in the northeastern regions of Hungary. Led by Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein, his son-in-law Akiva Yosef Schlesinger and decisor Chaim Sofer, the \"zealots\" were shocked by the demise of the traditional world into which they had been born. Like Moses Sofer a generation before them, these Orthodox \u00e9migr\u00e9s moved east, to a pre-modern environment that they were determined to safeguard. Lichtenstein ruled out any compromise with modernity, insisting on maintaining Yiddish and traditional dress. They considered the Neologs as moving outside of Judaism, and were more concerned with neo-Orthodoxy, which they regarded as a thinly veiled gateway for a similar fate. Chaim Sofer summarized their view of Hildesheimer: \"The wicked Hildesheimer is the horse and chariot of the Evil Inclination... All the heretics in the last century did not seek to undermine the Law and the Faith as he does.\"\nIn their struggle against acculturation, the Hungarian ultra-Orthodox struggled to provide strong \"halakhic\" arguments. Michael Silber wrote: \"These issues, even most of the religious reforms, fell into gray areas not easily treated within Halakha. It was often too flexible or ambiguous, at times silent, or worse yet, embarrassingly lenient.\" Schlesinger was forced to venture outside of normative law, into mystical writings and other fringe sources, to buttress his ideology. Most Hungarian Orthodox rabbis, while sympathetic to the \"zealots\"' cause, dismissed their legal arguments. In 1865, the ultra-Orthodox convened in Nagymih\u00e1ly and issued a ban on various synagogue reforms, intended not against the Neologs but against developments in the Orthodox camp, especially after Samuel Sofer violated his father's expressed ban and instituted vernacular sermons in Pressburg. Schick, the country's most prominent decisor, and other leading rabbis refused to sign, though they did not publicly oppose the decree. Hildesheimer's planned seminary was too radical for the mainstream rabbis, and he became marginalized and isolated by 1864.\nThe internal Orthodox division was complicated by growing tension with the Neologs. In 1869, the Hungarian government convened a General Jewish Congress that was aimed at creating a national representative body. Fearing Neolog domination, the Orthodox seceded from the Congress and appealed to Parliament in the name of religious freedom. This demonstrated the internalization of the new circumstances. In 1851, Orthodox leader Meir Eisenstaedter petitioned the authorities to restore the coercive powers of the communities. In 1871 the government recognized a separate Orthodox national committee. Communities that refused to join either side, labeled \"Status Quo\", were subject to Orthodox condemnation. However, the Orthodox tolerated nonobservant Jews as long as they affiliated with the national committee: Adam Ferziger claimed that membership and loyalty, rather than beliefs and ritual behavior, emerged as the definitive manifestation of Jewish identity. The Hungarian schism was the most radical internal separation among the Jews of Europe. Hildesheimer returned to Germany soon after, disillusioned though not as pessimistic as Hirsch. He was appointed rabbi of the Orthodox sub-community in Berlin (which had separate religious institutions but was not formally independent of the Liberal majority), where he finally established his seminary.\nIn 1877, a law enabling Jews to secede from their communities without conversion was passed in Germany. It was a stark example that Judaism was now confessional, not corporate. Hirsch withdrew his congregation from the Frankfurt community and decreed that all Orthodox should do the same. However, unlike the heterogeneous communities of Hungary, which often consisted of recent immigrants, Frankfurt and most German communities were close-knit. The majority of Hirsch's congregants enlisted Rabbi Seligman Baer Bamberger, who was older and more conservative. Bamberger was concerned with the principal of unity among the People Israel and dismissive of Hirsch, whom he regarded as unlearned and overly assimilated. He decreed that since the mother community was willing to finance Orthodox services and allow them religious freedom, secession was unwarranted. Eventually, less than 80 families from Hirsch's 300-strong congregation followed their rabbi. The vast majority of the 15%\u201320% of German Jews affiliated with Orthodox institutions cared little for the polemics. They did not secede over reasons of finance and familial relations. Only a handful of Secessionist, \"Austrittorthodox\", communities were established in the Reich; almost everyone remained Communal Orthodox, \"Gemeindeortodox\", within Liberal mother congregations. The Communal Orthodox argued that their approach was true to Jewish unity and decisive in maintaining public standards of observance and traditional education in Liberal communities. They claimed that Secessionists viewed them as hypocritical middle-of-the-roaders.\nThe conflicts in Hungary and Germany, and the emergence of distinctly Orthodox communities and ideologies, were the exception rather than the rule in Central and Western Europe. France, Britain, Bohemia, Austria and other countries saw both a virtual disappearance of observance and serious interest in bridging Judaism and modernity. The official rabbinate remained technically traditional, not introducing ideological change. The organ \u2013 a symbol of Reform in Germany since 1818, so much that Hildesheimer seminarians had to sign a declaration that they would never serve in a synagogue that introduced one \u2013 was accepted with little qualm by the French Consistoire in 1856. It was part of a series of synagogue regulations passed by Chief Rabbi Salomon Ulmann. Even Rabbi Solomon Klein of Colmar, the leader of Alsatian conservatives who partook in the castigation of Zecharias Frankel, allowed the instrument in his community. In England, Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler's United Synagogue shared a similar approach: It was vehemently conservative in principle and combated ideological reformers, yet served a nonobservant public \u2013 as Todd Endelman noted, \"While respectful of tradition, most English-born Jews were not orthodox in terms of personal practice. Nonetheless they were content to remain within an orthodox congregational framework\" \u2013 and introduced considerable synagogue reforms.\nEastern Europe.\nThe much belated pace of modernization in Russia, Congress Poland and the Romanian principalities, where harsh discrimination and active persecution of the Jews continued until 1917, delayed the crisis of traditional society for decades. Old-style education in the \"heder\" and \"yeshiva\" remained the norm, retaining Hebrew as the language of the elite and Yiddish as the vernacular. The defining fault-line of Eastern European Jews was between the Hasidim and the \"Misnagdic\" reaction against them. Reform attempts by the Czar's government, like the school modernization under Max Lilienthal or the foundation of rabbinical seminaries and the mandating of communities to appoint clerks known as \"official rabbis\", all had little influence. Communal autonomy and the rabbinic courts' jurisdiction were abolished in 1844, but economic and social seclusion remained, ensuring the authority of Jewish institutions and traditions de facto. In 1880, there were only 21,308 Jewish pupils in government schools, out of some 5\u00a0million Jews in total; In 1897, 97% of the 5.2\u00a0million Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland declared Yiddish their mother tongue, and only 26% possessed any literacy in Russian. Though the Eastern European \"Haskalah\" challenged the traditional establishment \u2013 unlike its western counterpart, no acculturation process turned it irrelevant; it flourished from the 1820s until the 1890s \u2013 the latter's hegemony over the vast majority was self-evident. The leading rabbis maintained the old conception of communal unity: In 1882, when an Orthodox party in Galicia appealed for the right of secession, the Netziv and other Russian rabbis declared it forbidden and contradicting the idea of Israel's oneness.\nWhile slow, change was by no means absent. In the 1860s and 1870s, anticipating a communal disintegration like the one in the west, moderate \"maskilic\" rabbis like Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and Yechiel Michel Pines called for inclusion of secular studies in the \"heder\"s and \"yeshiva\"s, a careful modernization, and an ecumenical attempt to form a consensus on necessary adaptation of \"halakha\" to novel times. Their initiative was thwarted by a combination of strong anti-traditional invective on behalf of the radical, secularist \"maskilim\" and conservative intransigence from the leading rabbis, especially during the bitter polemic which erupted after Moshe Leib Lilienblum's 1868 call for a reconsideration of Talmudic strictures. Reines, Pines and their associates would gradually form the nucleus of Religious Zionism, while their conservative opponents would eventually adopt the epithet \"Haredim\" (then, and also much later, still a generic term for the observant and the pious).\nThe attitude toward Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism, and its nonobservant if not staunchly secularist leaders and partisans, was the key question facing the traditionalists of Eastern Europe. Closely intertwined were issues of modernization in general: As noted by Joseph Salmon, the future religious Zionists (organized in the Mizrahi since 1902) were not only supportive of the national agenda per se, but deeply motivated by criticism of the prevalent Jewish society, a positive reaction to modernity and a willingness to tolerate nonobservance while affirming traditional faith and practice. Their proto-\"Haredi\" opponents sharply rejected all of the former positions and espoused staunch conservatism, which idealized existing norms. Any illusion that differences could be blanded and a united observant pro-Zionist front would be formed, were dashed between 1897 and 1899, as both the Eastern European nationalist intellectuals and Theodor Herzl himself revealed an uncompromising secularist agenda, forcing traditionalist leaders to pick sides. In 1900, the anti-Zionist pamphlet \"Or la-Yesharim\", endorsed by many Russian and Polish rabbis, largely demarcated the lines between the proto-\"Haredi\" majority and the Mizrahi minority, and terminated dialogue; in 1911, when the 10th World Zionist Congress voted in favour of propagating non-religious cultural work and education, a large segment of the Mizrahi seceded and joined the anti-Zionists.\nIn 1907, Eastern European proto-\"Haredi\" elements formed the Knesseth Israel party, a modern framework created in recognition of the deficiencies of existing institutions. It dissipated within a year. German Neo-Orthodoxy, in the meantime, developed a keen interest in the traditional Jewish masses of Russia and Poland; if at the past they were considered primitive, a disillusionment with emancipation and enlightenment made many young assimilated German Orthodox youth embark on journeys to East European \"yeshivot\", in search of authenticity. The German secessionists already possessed a platform of their own, the \"Freie Vereinigung f\u00fcr die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums\", founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch in 1885. In 1912, two German FVIOJ leaders, Isaac Breuer and Jacob Rosenheim, managed to organize a meeting of 300 seceding Mizrahi, proto-\"Haredi\" and secessionist Neo-Orthodox delegate in Katowice, creating the \"Agudath Israel\" party. While the Germans were a tiny minority in comparison to the Eastern Europeans, their modern education made them a prominent elite in the new organization, which strove to provide a comprehensive response to world Jewry's challenges in a strictly observant spirit. The Agudah immediately formed its Council of Torah Sages as supreme rabbinic leadership body. Many ultra-traditionalist elements in Eastern Europe, like the Belz and Lubavitch Hasidim, refused to join, viewing the movement as a dangerous innovation; and the organized Orthodox in Hungary rejected it as well, especially after it did not affirm a commitment to communal secession in 1923.\nIn the Interwar period, sweeping secularization and acculturation deracinated old Jewish society in Eastern Europe. The October Revolution granted civil equality and imposed anti-religious persecutions, radically transforming Russian Jewry within a decade; the lifting of formal discrimination also strongly affected the Jews of independent Poland, Lithuania and other states. In the 1930s, it was estimated that no more than 20%\u201333% of Poland's Jews, the last stronghold of traditionalism where many were still living in rural and culturally secluded communities, could be considered strictly observant. Only upon having become an embattled (though still quite large) minority, did the local traditionalists complete their transformation into Orthodox, albeit never as starkly as in Hungary or Germany. Eastern European Orthodoxy, whether Agudah or Mizrahi, always preferred cultural and educational independence to communal secession, and maintained strong ties and self-identification with the general Jewish public. Within its ranks, the 150-years-long struggle between Hasidim and Misnagdim was largely subsided; the latter were even dubbed henceforth as \"Litvaks\", as the anti-Hasidic component in their identity was marginalized. In the interwar period, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan emerged as the popular leader of the Eastern European Orthodox, particularly the Agudah-leaning.\nUnited States.\nAmerican Jewry of the 19th century was small and immigrant-based, lacking traditional institutions or strong rabbinic presence. Voluntary congregations, rather than corporate communities, were the norm; separation of church and state, and dynamic religiosity of the independent Protestant model, shaped synagogue life. In the mid-19th century, Reform Judaism spread rapidly, advocating a formal relinquishment of traditions very few in the secularized, open environment observed anyhow; the United States would be derisively named the \"Treife Medina\", or \"Profane Country\", in Yiddish. Conservative elements, concerned mainly with public standards of observance in critical fields like marriage, rallied around Isaac Leeser. Lacking a rabbinic ordination and little knowledgeable by European standards, Leeser was an ultra-traditionalist in his American milieu. In 1845 he introduced the words \"Orthodox\" and \"Orthodoxy\" into the American Jewish discourse, in the sense of opposing Reform; while admiring Samson Raphael Hirsch, Leeser was an even stauncher proponent of Zecharias Frankel, whom he considered the \"leader of the Orthodox party\" at a time when Positive-Historical and Orthodox positions were barely discernible from each other to most observers (in 1861, Leeser defended Frankel in the polemic instigated by Hirsch).\nA broad non-Reform camp slowly coalesced as the minority within American Jewry; while strict in relation to their progressive opponents, they served a nonobservant public and instituted thorough synagogue reforms \u2013 omission of \"piyyutim\" from the liturgy, English-language sermons and secular education for the clergy were the norm in most, and many Orthodox synagogues in America did not partition men and women. In 1885, the antinomian Pittsburgh Platform moved a broad coalition of conservative religious leaders to found the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. They variously termed their ideology, which was never consistent and mainly motivated by a rejection of Reform, as \"Enlightened Orthodoxy\" or \"Conservative Judaism\". The latter term would only gradually assume a clearly distinct meaning.\nTo their right, strictly traditionalist Eastern European immigrants formed the Union of Orthodox Rabbis in 1902, in direct opposition to the Americanized character of the OU and JTS. The UOR frowned upon English-language sermons, secular education, and acculturation in general. Even before that, in 1897, an old-style \"yeshiva\", RIETS, was founded in New York. Eventually, its students rebelled in 1908, demanding a modern rabbinic training much like that of their peers in JTS. In 1915, RIETS was reorganized as a decidedly Modern Orthodox institution, and a merger with the JTS was discussed. In 1923, the Rabbinical Council of America was established as the clerical association of the OU.\nOnly in the postwar era, did the vague traditional coalition come to a definite end. During and after the Holocaust, a new wave of strictly observant refugees arrived from Eastern and Central Europe. They often regarded even the UOR as too lenient and Americanized. Typical of these was Rabbi Aaron Kotler, who established Lakewood Yeshiva in New Jersey during 1943. Alarmed by the enticing American environment, Kotler turned his institution into an enclave, around which an entire community slowly evolved. It was very different from his prewar \"yeshiva\" at Kletsk, Poland, the students of which were but a segment of the general Jewish population and mingled with the rest. Lakewood pioneered the homogeneous, voluntary and enclavist model of postwar \"Haredi\" communities, which were independent entities with their own developing subculture. The new arrivals soon dominated the traditionalist wing of American Jewry, forcing the locals to adopt more rigorous positions. Concurrently, the younger generation in the JTS and the Rabbinical Assembly demanded greater clarity, theological unambiguity and \"halakhic\" independence from the Orthodox veto on serious innovations \u2014 in 1935, for example, the RA yielded to such pressures and shelved its proposal for a solution to the agunah predicament. \"Conservative Judaism\", now adopted as an exclusive label by most JTS graduates and RA members, became a truly distinct movement. In 1950, the Conservatives signaled their break with Orthodox \"halakhic\" authorities, with the acceptance of a far-reaching legal decision, which allowed one to drive to the synagogue and to use electricity on Sabbath.\nBetween the ultra-Orthodox and Conservatives, Modern Orthodoxy in America also coalesced, becoming less a generic term and more a distinct movement. Its leader in the postwar era, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, left Agudas Israel to adopt both pro-Zionist positions and a positive, if reserved, attitude toward Western culture. As dean of RIETS and honorary chair of RCA's \"halakha\" committee, Soloveitchik shaped Modern Orthodoxy for decades. While principled differences with the Conservatives were clear, as the RCA stressed the divinely revealed status of the Torah and a strict observance of \"halakha\", sociological boundaries were less so. Many members of the Modern Orthodox public were barely observant, and a considerable number of communities did not install a gender partition in their synagogues \u2013 physically separate seating became the distinguishing mark of Orthodox/Conservative affiliation in the 1950s, and was strongly promulgated by the RCA \u2013 for many years. As late as 1997, seven OU congregations still lacked a partition.\nTheology.\nOrthodox attitudes.\nJudaism never formulated a conclusive credo; whether it reflects a dogma remains controversial. Some researchers argued that the importance of daily practice and adherence to \"halakha\" (Jewish law) mooted theoretical issues. Others dismissed this view entirely, citing ancient rabbinic debates that castigated various heresies with little reference to observance. However, even without a uniform doctrine, Orthodox Judaism is basically united in its core beliefs. Disavowing them is a major blasphemy..\nSeveral medieval authorities attempted to codify these beliefs, including Saadia Gaon and Joseph Albo. Each composed a creed, although the 13 principles expounded by Maimonides in his 1160s \"Commentary on the Mishna\", remained the most widely accepted. Various points were contested by many of Maimonides' contemporaries and later sages, such as the exact formulation and the status of disbelievers (either misinformed or expelled heretics). Similarly, Albo listed only three fundamentals, and did not regard the Messiah as a key tenet. Many who objected argued that the entire corpus of the Torah and the sayings of ancient sages were of canonical stature, rather than a few selected points. In later centuries, the 13 Principles became considered universally binding and cardinal by Orthodox authorities.\nDuring the Middle Ages, two systems of thought competed for primacy. The rationalist-philosophic school endeavored to present all commandments as serving higher moral and ethical purposes, while the mystical tradition, exemplified in Kabbalah, assigned each rite with a role in hidden dimensions of reality. Sheer obedience, derived from faithfulness to one's community and ancestry, was believed sufficient for the common people, while the educated chose one of the two schools. In the modern era, the prestige of both declined, and \"naive faith\" became popular. At a time when contemplation in matters of belief was associated with secularization, luminaries such as Yisrael Meir Kagan stressed the importance of simple, unsophisticated commitment to the precepts passed down from the Beatified Sages. This became standard in the Haredi world.\nGod.\nJudaism adheres to monotheism, the belief in one God. The basic tenets of Orthodoxy, drawn from ancient sources like the Talmud and later sages, chiefly include the attributes of God in Judaism: one and indivisible, preceding all creation, which God alone brought into being, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely incorporeal, and beyond human reason. This basis is evoked in many foundational texts, and is repeated often in daily prayers, such as in Judaism's creed-like \"Shema Yisrael\": \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.\"\nMaimonides delineated this understanding of a personal God in his opening six articles. The six concern God's status as the sole creator, his oneness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone, and no other being, may be worshipped, and that he is omniscient. The supremacy of the God of Israel is even applied to non-Jews. According to most rabbinic opinions, non-Jews are banned from the worship of other deities. However, they are allowed to \"associate\" lower divine beings with their faith in God (mostly to allow contact with Christians, accepting that they were not idolaters with whom business dealings and the like are forbidden.)\nThe utter imperceptibility of God, considered as beyond human reason and only reachable through what he chooses to reveal, was emphasized among others in the ancient ban on making any image of him. Maimonides and virtually all sages in his time and thereafter stressed that the creator is incorporeal, lacking \"any semblance of a body\". While incorporeality has almost been taken for granted since the Middle Ages, Maimonides and his contemporaries reported that anthropomorphic conceptions of God were quite common in their time.\nThe medieval tension between God's transcendence and equanimity, and his contact and interest in his creation, found its most popular resolution in the \"Kabbalah\". Kabbalists asserted that while God himself is beyond the universe, he progressively unfolds into the created realm via a series of emanations, or \"sefirot\", each a refraction of the perfect godhead. While widely received, this system proved contentious and some authorities lambasted it as a threat to God's unity. In modern times it is upheld, at least tacitly, in many traditionalist Orthodox circles, while Modern Orthodoxy mostly simply ignores it.\nRevelation.\nThe defining doctrine of Orthodox Judaism is the belief that God revealed the Torah (\"Teaching\" or \"Law\") to Moses on Mount Sinai, both the written scripture of the Torah and the Oral Torah explicating it, and that sages promulgated it faithfully from Sinai in an unbroken chain. One of the foundational texts of rabbinic literature is the list opening the \"Pirkei Avot\", enumerating the sages, from Moses through Joshua, the Seventy Elders, and Prophets, and then onward until Hillel the Elder and Shammai. This core belief is referred to in classical sources as \"The Law/Teaching is from the Heavens\" (\"Torah min HaShamayim\").\nOrthodoxy holds that the body of revelation is total and complete. Its interpretation and application under new circumstances, required of every generation's scholars, is an act of inferring and elaborating, not of innovation or addition. One clause in the Jerusalem Talmud asserts that anything that a veteran disciple shall teach was given at Sinai: a story in the Babylonian Talmud claims that Moses was taken aback upon seeing the immensely intricate deduction of future Rabbi Akiva in a vision, until Akiva proclaimed that Moses had received everything he was teaching. The Written and Oral Torah are held to be intertwined and mutually reliant. The latter is a source of many divine commandments, and the text of the Pentateuch is seen as incomprehensible. God's will may be surmised only by appealing to the Oral Torah, which revealed the text's allegorical, anagogical, or tropological meaning, rather than by a literal reading.\nLacunae in received tradition or disagreements between early sages are attributed to disruptions, especially persecutions such that \"the Torah was forgotten in Israel.\" According to rabbinic lore, these eventually compelled the legists to write down the Oral Law in the Mishna and Talmud. The wholeness of the original divine message and the reliability of those who transmitted it are axiomatic. One of the primary intellectual exercises of Torah scholars is to locate discrepancies between Talmudic or other passages and then demonstrate by complex logical steps (presumably proving each passage referred to a slightly different situation, etc.) that no contradiction is obtained. Orthodox Judaism considers revelation as propositional, explicit, verbal, and unambiguous. Revelation serves as a firm source of authority for religious commandments. Modernist understandings of revelation as a subjective, humanly conditioned experience are rejected. Some thinkers at the liberal end of the liberal wing promoted such views, although they found virtually no acceptance from the establishment.\nAn important ramification of \"Torah min HaShamayim\" in modern times is the reserved, and often totally rejectionist, attitude of Orthodoxy toward the historical-critical method, particularly higher Biblical criticism. The refusal by rabbis to employ such tools, insisting on traditional methods and the need for consensus and continuity with past authorities, separates the most liberal-leaning Orthodox rabbinic circles from the most conservative non-Orthodox ones.\nWhile the Sinai event is held to be the supreme act of revelation, rabbinic tradition acknowledges matters addressed by the Prophets and God's later announcements. The Kabbalah, as revealed to illustrious past figures and passed on through elitist circles, is widely (albeit not universally) esteemed. While some prominent rabbis considered Kabbalah a late forgery, most generally accepted it as legitimate. However, its status in determining normative halakhic decision-making, which is binding for the entire community, and not just for spiritualists who voluntarily adopt kabbalistic strictures, was always controversial. Leading decisors openly applied criteria from Kabbalah in their rulings, while others did so only inadvertently, and many denied it any normative role. A closely related mystical phenomenon is the belief in \"Magidim\", supposed dreamlike apparitions or visions, that may inform those who experience them with certain divine knowledge.\nEschatology.\nBelief in a future Messiah is central to Orthodox Judaism. According to this doctrine, a king will arise from King David's lineage, and will bring with him signs such as the restoration of the Temple, peace, and universal acceptance of the God of Israel. The Messiah will embark on a quest to gather all Jews to the Holy Land, will proclaim prophethood, and will restore the Davidic Monarchy.\nClassical Judaism incorporated a tradition of belief in the resurrection of the dead. The scriptural basis for this doctrine, as quoted by the Mishnah is: \"All Israelites have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is written: \"And your people, all of them righteous, Shall possess the land for all time; They are the shoot that I planted, My handiwork in which I glory.\". The Mishnah also brands as heretics any Jew who rejects the doctrine of resurrection or its Torah origin. Those who deny the doctrine are deemed to receive no share in the World-to-Come. The Pharisees believed in both a bodily resurrection and an immortal soul. They also believed that acts in this world would affect the state of life in the next world. Mishnah \"Sahedrin\" 10 clarifies that only those who follow the correct theology have a place in the World to Come.\nOther passing references to the afterlife appear in Mishnaic tractates. \"Berakhot\" informs that the Jewish belief in the afterlife was established long before the compilation of the Mishnah. Biblical tradition mentions Sheol sixty-five times. It is described as an underworld containing the gathering of the dead with their families. states that Korah went into Sheol alive to describe his death in divine retribution. The deceased who reside in Sheol have a \"nebulous\" existence. No reward or punishment comes in Sheol, which is represented as a dark and gloomy place. But a distinction is made for kings who are said to be greeted by other kings when entering Sheol. Biblical poetry suggests that resurrection from Sheol is possible. Prophetic narratives of resurrection in the Bible have been labelled as an external cultural influence by some scholars.\nTalmudic discourse expanded on the details of the World to Come. This was to motivate Jewish compliance with religious codes. In brief, the righteous will be rewarded with a place in Gan Eden, the wicked will be punished in Gehinnom, and the resurrection will take place in the Messianic age. The sequence of these events is unclear. Rabbis support the concept of resurrection with Biblical citations and show it as a sign of God's omnipotence.\nPractice.\nIntensity.\nA relatively thorough observance of \"halakha\" \u2013 rather than theological and doctrinal matters, which produce diverse opinions \u2013 is the concrete demarcation line separating Orthodoxy from other Jewish movements. As noted by researchers and communal leaders, Orthodox subgroups have a sense of commitment towards the Law, perceiving it as seriously binding, which is rarely visible outside the movement.\nLaw, custom, and tradition.\nThe \"halakha\", like any jurisprudence, is not a definitive set of rules, but rather an expanding discourse. Its authority is derived from the belief in divine revelation, but rabbis interpret and apply it, basing their mandate on biblical verses such as \"and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee\". From ancient to modern times, rabbinic discourse was wrought with controversy (\"machloket\") and sages disagreeing over various points of law. The Talmud itself is mainly a record of such disputes. The Orthodox continue to believe that such disagreements flow naturally from the divinity of Jewish Law, which is presumed to contain a solution for any possible question. As long as both contesting parties base their arguments on received hermeneutics and precedents and are driven by sincere faith, \"both these and those are the words of the Living God\" (Talmudic statement originally attributed to a divine proclamation during a dispute between the House of Hillel and House of Shammai). Majority opinions were accepted and reified, though many disagreements remain unresolved as new ones appear. This plurality of opinion allows decisors, rabbis tasked with determining the legal stance in subjects without precedent, to weigh a range of options, based on methods derived from earlier authorities. The most basic form of \"halakhic\" discourse is the responsa literature, in which rabbis answered questions directed from commoners or other rabbis, thus setting precedent.\nThe system's oldest and most basic sources are the Mishna and the Talmuds, augmented by the Geonim. Those were followed by the great codes which sought to assemble and standardize the laws, including Rabbi Isaac Alfasi's \"Hilchot HaRif\", Maimonides' \"Mishneh Torah\", and Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel's work (colloquially called \"the Rosh\"). These three works were the main basis of Rabbi Jacob ben Asher's \"Arba'ah Turim\", which in turn became the basis of one of the latest and most authoritative codifications \u2013 the 1565 \"Shulchan Aruch\", or \"Set Table\", by Rabbi Joseph Karo. This work gained canonical status and became almost synonymous, with the \"halakhic\" system. However, no later authority accepted it in its entirety (for example, Orthodox Jews wear phylacteries in a manner different from the one advocated there), and it was immediately contested or re-interpreted by various commentaries, most prominently the gloss written by Rabbi Moses Isserles named \"HaMapah (\"The Tablecloth\")\". \"Halakhic\" literature continued to expand and evolve. New authoritative guides continued to be compiled and canonized, until the popular 20th century works such as the \"Mishnah Berurah\" arrived.\nThe most important distinction within \"halakha\" is between all laws derived from God's revelation (\"d'Oraita\") and those enacted by human authorities (\"d'Rabanan\"), who are believed to have been empowered by God to legislate as necessary. The former are either directly understood, derived via various hermeneutics or attributed to commandments handed down to Moses. The authority to pass measures \"d'Rabanan\" is itself subject to debate \u2013 Maimonides stated that absolute obedience to rabbinic decrees is stipulated by the verse \"and thou shalt observe\", while Nachmanides argued that such severity is unfounded, while accepting such enactments as binding, albeit less so than the divine commandments. A Talmudic maxim states that when in doubt regarding a matter \"d'Oraita\", one must rule strenuously, but leniently when it concerns \"d'Rabanan\". Many arguments in \"halakhic\" literature revolve over whether a detail is derived from the former or the latter source, and under which circumstances. Commandments or prohibitions \"d'Rabanan\", though less stringent than \"d'Oraita\", are an important facet of Jewish law. They range from the 2nd century BCE establishment of Hanukkah, to bypassing the Biblical ban on charging interest via the \"Prozbul\", and up to the 1950 marital rules standardized by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which forbade polygamy and levirate marriage even in communities that still practiced them.\nA third major component buttressing Orthodox and other practice is local or familial custom, \"Minhag\". The development and acceptance of customs as binding, more than disagreements between decisors, is the main source of diversity in matters of practice across geographic or ethnic boundaries. While the reverence accorded to \"Minhag\" across rabbinic literature covers the extremes, including \"a custom may uproot \"halakha\"\" and wholly dismissive attitudes, it was generally accepted as binding by scholars, and drew its power from popular adherence and routine. Ashkenazim, Sephardim, Teimanim, and others have distinct prayer rites, kosher emphases (for example, by the 12th century, it became an Ashkenazi custom to avoid legumes in Passover) and other distinctions. The influence of custom upset scholars who noted that the common masses observe \"Minhag\", yet ignore important divine decrees.\nRabbinic authority.\nRabbinic leadership, assigned with implementing and interpreting tradition, changed considerably over the centuries, separating Orthodox from pre-modern Judaism. Since the demise of the Geonim, who led the Jewish world up to 1038, \"halakha\" was adjudicated locally, and the final arbiter was mostly the local rabbi, the \"Mara d'Athra\" (Master of the Area). He was responsible to judicially instruct his community. Emancipation and modern transport and communication made this model untenable. While Orthodox communities, especially the more conservative ones, have rabbis who technically fill this capacity, the public generally follows more broadly known authorities who are not limited by geography, and based on reverence and peer pressure more than coercion. These may be either popular chairs of Talmudic academies, renowned decisors, and, in the Hasidic world, hereditary \"rebbe\"s.\nTheir influence varies considerably: In conservative Orthodox circles, mainly Haredi, rabbis possess strong authority, and often exercise leadership. Bodies such as the Council of Torah Sages, Council of Torah Luminaries, the Central Rabbinical Congress, and the Orthodox Council of Jerusalem are all held as the arbiters in their respective communities. In the more liberal Orthodox sectors, rabbis are revered and consulted, but rarely exert direct control.\nDaily life.\nOrthodox Judaism emphasizes practicing rules of \"kashrut\", Shabbat, family purity, and \"tefilah\" (daily prayer).\nMany Orthodox can be identified by their dress and family lifestyle. Orthodox men and women dress modestly covering most of their skin. Married women cover their hair, with scarves (\"tichel\"), \"snoods\", turbans, hats, berets, or wigs.\nOrthodox men wear a ritual fringe called \"Tzitzit\", and wear a head-covering for males. Many men grow beards, and Haredi men wear suits with black hats over a skullcap. Modern Orthodox Jews may adopt the dress of general society, although they, too, wear \"kippahs\" and \"tzitzit.\" On Shabbat, Modern Orthodox men wear suits (or at least a dress shirt) and dress pants, while women wear clothing.\nOrthodox Jews follow the laws of \"negiah\" (touch). The Orthodox do not engage in physical contact with those of the opposite sex other than their spouse, or immediate family members. \"Kol Isha\" prohibits a woman's singing to a man (except as per \"negiah\").\nDoorposts have a \"mezuzah.\" Separate sinks for meat and dairy have become increasingly common.\nDiversity.\nOrthodox Judaism lacks a central framework and a common leadership. It is not a \"denomination\" in the structural sense, but a spectrum of groups, united in broadly affirming matters of belief and practice, which share a consciousness and a common discourse. Individual rabbis often gain respect across boundaries, particularly recognized decisors, but each community largely elevates its own leaders (for example, the Haredi world shares a sense of common identity, while distinct subgroups include hundreds of independent communities with their own rabbis). The limits and boundaries of Orthodoxy are also controversial. No encompassing definition has found acceptance. Moderately conservative subgroups hotly criticize more liberal groups for deviation, while strict hard-liners dismiss the latter as non-Orthodox. Contentious topics range from the abstract and theoretical, such as the attitude toward the study of scripture, to the mundane and pressing, such as modesty rules.\nAs in any other broad religious movement, an intrinsic tension connects the ideological and the sociological dimensions of Orthodox Judaism \u2013 while elites and intellectuals define adherence in theoretical terms, the masses use societal, familial, and institutional affiliation. The latter may be neither strictly observant nor fully accept the tenets of faith.\nDemographics.\nProfessors Daniel Elazar and Rela Mintz Geffen, according to calculations in 1990, found there to be at least 2,000,000 observant Orthodox Jews worldwide in 2012, and at least 2,000,000 additional members and supporters who identified as such. This estimate held Orthodoxy to be the largest Jewish group.\nIn the State of Israel, where the total Jewish population is about 6.5\u00a0million, 22% of all Jewish respondents to a 2016 Pew survey declared themselves as observant Orthodox (9% \"Haredim\", 13% \"Datiim\", \"religious\"). 29% described themselves as \"traditional\", a label implying less observance, but identification with Orthodoxy.\nThe Orthodox community of the United States is the second-largest in the world, concentrated in the Northeast and specifically in New York and New Jersey. A 2013 Pew survey found that 10% of respondents identified as Orthodox, among a total Jewish population of at least 5.5\u00a0million. 3% were Modern Orthodox, 6% were Haredi, and 1% were \"other\" (Sephardic, liberal Orthodox, etc.)\nIn the United Kingdom, of 79,597 households with at least one Jewish member that held synagogue membership in 2016, 66% affiliated with Orthodox synagogues: 53% in \"centrist Orthodox\", and 13% in \"strictly Orthodox\" (further 3% were Sephardi, which technically eschews the title \"Orthodox\").\nThe Orthodox have higher birth rates than others. Haredi communities have some of the world's highest birth rates, averaging six children per household. A nearly non-existent rate of intermarriage with members of other faiths (Orthodox vehemently oppose the phenomenon) contributes to their growing share of the world's Jewish population. Among American Jewish children, the Orthodox share is an estimated 61% in New York, including 49% Haredi. Similar patterns are observed in other countries. With present trends sustained, Orthodox Jews are projected to numerically dominate British Jewry by 2031, and American Jewry by 2058. However, large numbers of members leave their communities and observant lifestyle. Among the 2013 Pew respondents, 17% of those under 30 who were raised Orthodox disaffiliated (in earlier generations, this trend was far more prevalent, and 77% of those over 65 left).\nGroups.\nHaredim.\nThe most recognizable sub-group is the \"Haredim\" (literally, 'trembling' or 'fervent'), also known as \"strictly Orthodox\", and the like. They are the most traditional part of the Orthodox. \"Haredim\" have minimal engagement with/wholesale rejection of modern society, avow precedence to religious values, and accept a high degree of rabbinic involvement in daily life. \"Haredi\" rabbis and communities generally accept each other, and accord them legitimacy. They are organized in large political structures, mainly Agudath Israel of America and the Israeli United Torah Judaism party. Other organized groups include the Anti-Zionist Central Rabbinical Congress and the Edah HaChareidis. They are easily discerned by their mode of dress, often mostly black for men and very modest, by religious standards, for women (including hair covering, long skirts, etc.).\nThe \"Haredim\" may be roughly classified into three sub-groups:\nHasidic.\nHasidic Jews originated in 18th-century Eastern Europe, where they formed as a revival movement that defied the rabbinical establishment. The threat of modernity turned the movement towards conservatism and reconciled it with traditionalist elements. Hasidism espouses a mystical interpretation of religion. Each Hasidic community aligned with a hereditary leader known as \"rebbe\" (who is almost always an ordained rabbi). While the spiritualist element of Hasidism declined through the centuries, the \"rebbe\"s' authority stems from the mystical belief that the holiness of their ancestors is inborn. They exercise tight control over their followers. Each of the hundreds of independent Hasidic groups/sects (also called \"courts\" or \"dynasties\") has its own line of \"rebbes\". Groups range in size from large ones with thousands of member households to very small. Courts often possess unique customs, religious emphases, philosophies, and styles of dress. Hasidic men, especially on the Sabbath, don long garments and fur hats, which were once a staple of Eastern European Jews, but are now associated almost exclusively with them. As of 2016, 130,000 Hasidic households were counted.\nLitvaks.\nThe second \"Haredi\" group are the Litvaks, or Yeshivish. They originated, loosely, with the Misnagdim, the opponents of Hasidism, who were mainly concentrated in old Lithuania. The confrontation with the Hasid bred distinct ideologies and institutions, especially great \"yeshivas\", learning halls, where the study of Torah for its own sake and admiration for the scholars who headed these schools was enshrined. With the advent of secularization, the Misnagdim largely abandoned their hostility towards Hasidism. They became defined by affiliation with their \"yeshiva\"s, and their communities were sometimes composed of alumni. The prestige ascribed to them as centers of Torah study (after they were rebuilt in Israel and America, bearing the names of Eastern European \"yeshiva\"s destroyed in the Holocaust) persuaded many who were not Misnagdic, and the term \"Litvak\" lost its original ethnic connotation. It is granted to all non-Hasidic Haredim of Ashkenazi descent. The Litvak sector is led mainly by heads of \"yeshiva\"s.\nSephardic.\nThe third \"Haredi\" movement consists of the Sephardic \"Haredim\", who live mostly in Israel. There they are linked to the Shas party and the legacy of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Originating in the Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and North African Jews) immigrants to the country who arrived in the 1950s, most of the Sephardi Haredim were educated in Litvak yeshivas. They adopted their educators' mentality. Their identity developed in reaction to the racism they encountered. Shas arose in the 1980s, with the aim of reclaiming Sephardi religious legacy, in opposition to both secularism and the hegemony of European-descended \"Haredim\". While living in strictly observant circles, they maintain a strong bond with non-Haredi masses of Israeli Mizrahi society.\nModern Orthodoxy.\nIn the West, especially in the United States, Modern Orthodoxy, or \"Centrist Orthodoxy\", is an umbrella term for communities that seek an observant lifestyle and traditional theology, while at the same time ascribing positive value to engagement (if not \"synthesis\") with the modern world.\nIn the United States, the Modern Orthodox form a cohesive community, influenced by the legacy of leaders such as Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and concentrated around Yeshiva University and institutions such as the OU or National Council of Young Israel. They affirm strict obedience to Jewish Law, the centrality of Torah study, and the importance of positive engagement with modern culture.\nReligious Zionism.\nIn Israel, Religious Zionism represents the largest Orthodox public and are fervent Zionists. Religious Zionism supports Israel and ascribes an inherent religious value to it. The dominant ideological school, influenced by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook's thought, regards the state in messianic terms. Religious Zionism is not a uniform group, and the split between its conservative flank (often named \"Chardal\", or \"National-\"Haredi\"\") and more liberal elements has increased since the 1990s. The National Religious Party, once the single political platform, dissolved, and the common educational system became torn on issues such as gender separation in elementary school or secular studies.\nEuropean Centrist Orthodoxy.\nIn Europe, \"Centrist Orthodoxy\" is represented by organizations such as the British United Synagogue and the Israelite Central Consistory of France, both the dominant official rabbinates in their respective countries. The laity is often non-observant, retaining formal affiliation due to familial piety or a sense of Jewish identity.\nIsraeli Masorti (traditional).\nAnother large demographic usually considered Orthodox are the Israeli \"Masortim\", or \"traditionals\". This moniker originated with Mizrahi immigrants who were secularized and reverent toward their communal heritage. However, Mizrahi intellectuals, in recent years, developed a more reflective, nuanced understanding of this term, eschewing its shallow image and not necessarily agreeing with the formal deference to Orthodox rabbis. Self-conscious \"Masorti\" identity is limited to small, elitist circles.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a virtuoso who is considered to be one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time, Peterson released more than 200 recordings, won eight Grammy Awards, as well as a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy, and received numerous other awards and honours. He played thousands of concerts worldwide in a career lasting more than 60 years. He was called the \"Maharaja of the keyboard\" by Duke Ellington, simply \"O.P.\" by his friends, and was informally known in the jazz community as \"the King of inside swing\".\nPeterson worked in duos with Sam Jones, Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen, Joe Pass, Irving Ashby, Count Basie, and Herbie Hancock. He considered the trio with Ray Brown and Herb Ellis \"the most stimulating\" and productive setting for public performances and studio recordings. In the early 1950s, he began performing with Brown and drummer Charlie Smith as the Oscar Peterson Trio. Shortly afterward Smith was replaced by guitarist Irving Ashby, who had been a member of the Nat King Cole Trio. Ashby, who was a swing guitarist, was soon replaced by Barney Kessel. Their last recording, \"On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Trio\" (1958), recorded live at the Town Tavern in Toronto, was said to have captured a remarkable degree of emotional as well as musical understanding among three players.\nPeterson won eight Grammy Awards during his lifetime between 1975 and 1997. He is considered among the best jazz pianists and jazz improvisers of the twentieth century.\nEarly life and education.\nOscar Peterson was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to immigrants from the West Indies (Saint Kitts and Nevis and the British Virgin Islands): his mother, Kathleen, was a domestic worker; his father, Daniel, worked as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway and was an amateur musician who taught himself to play the organ, trumpet and piano. Peterson grew up in the neighbourhood of Little Burgundy in Montreal. It was in this predominantly black neighbourhood that he encountered the jazz culture. At the age of five, Peterson began honing his skills on trumpet and piano, but a bout of tuberculosis when he was seven years old prevented him from playing the trumpet again, so he directed all his attention to the piano. His father was one of his first music teachers, and his sister Daisy taught him classical piano. Peterson was persistent at practicing scales and classical \u00e9tudes.\nAs a child, Peterson studied with Hungarian-born pianist Paul de Marky, a student of Istv\u00e1n Thom\u00e1n, who was himself a pupil of Franz Liszt, so his early training was predominantly based on classical piano. However, Peterson was captivated by traditional jazz and boogie-woogie and learned several ragtime pieces. He was called \"the Brown Bomber of the Boogie-Woogie\".\nAt the age of nine, Peterson played piano with a degree of control that impressed professional musicians. For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of daily practice. Only in his later years did he decrease his practice to one or two hours daily. In 1940, at fourteen years of age, he won the national music competition organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After that victory, he dropped out of the High School of Montreal, where he played in a band with Maynard Ferguson. Peterson became a professional pianist, starring in a weekly radio show and playing at hotels and music halls. In his teens, he was a member of the Johnny Holmes Orchestra. From 1945 to 1949, he worked in a trio and recorded for Victor Records. He gravitated toward boogie-woogie and swing with a particular fondness for Nat King Cole and Teddy Wilson. By the time Peterson was in his 20s, he had developed a reputation as a technically brilliant and melodically inventive pianist.\nCareer.\nDuos, trios, and quartets.\nAccording to an interview with Norman Granz, Granz heard a radio program broadcasting from a local club while taking a cab to the Montreal airport. He was so impressed that he told the driver to take him to the club so he could meet the pianist. Granz had seen Peterson before this but was underwhelmed. In 1949, he introduced Peterson in New York City at a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert at Carnegie Hall. He remained Peterson's manager for most of his career. This was more than a managerial relationship; Peterson praised Granz for standing up for him and other black jazz musicians in the segregationist south US of the 1950s and 1960s. In the documentary video \"Music in the Key of Oscar\", Peterson tells how Granz stood up to a gun-toting Southern policeman who wanted to stop the trio from using whites-only taxis.\nIn 1950, Peterson worked in a duo with double bassist Ray Brown. Two years later, they added guitarist Barney Kessel. Then Herb Ellis stepped in after Kessel grew weary of touring. The trio remained together from 1953 to 1958, often touring with Jazz at the Philharmonic. By 1956, Peterson's performances were also showcased on national radio networks by Ben Selvin within the RCA Thesaurus transcriptions library.\nPeterson also worked in duos with Sam Jones, Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen, Joe Pass, Irving Ashby, Count Basie, and Herbie Hancock.\nHe considered the trio with Brown and Ellis \"the most stimulating\" and productive setting for public performances and studio recordings. In the early 1950s, he began performing with Brown and drummer Charlie Smith as the Oscar Peterson Trio. Shortly afterwards, Smith was replaced by guitarist Irving Ashby, who had been a member of the Nat King Cole Trio. Ashby, who was a swing guitarist, was soon replaced by Kessel. Their last recording, \"On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Trio\", recorded live at the Town Tavern in Toronto, captured a remarkable degree of emotional as well as musical understanding among three players.\nWhen Ellis departed in 1958, they hired drummer Ed Thigpen because they felt no guitarist could compare to Ellis. Brown and Thigpen worked with Peterson on his albums \"Night Train\" (1963) and \"Canadiana Suite\" (1965). Both Brown and Thigpen left in 1965 and were replaced by bassist Sam Jones and drummer Louis Hayes (and later, drummer Bobby Durham). The trio performed together until 1970. In 1969, Peterson recorded \"Motions and Emotions\" with orchestral arrangements of \"Yesterday\" and \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles. In the fall of 1970, Peterson's trio released the album \"Tristeza on Piano\". Jones and Durham left in 1970.\nIn the 1970s. Peterson formed a trio with guitarist Joe Pass and bassist Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen. This trio emulated the success of the 1950s trio with Brown and Ellis and gave acclaimed performances at festivals. Their album \"The Trio\" won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group. On April 22, 1978, Peterson performed in the interval act for the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 that was broadcast live from the Palais des congr\u00e8s de Paris. In 1974, he added British drummer Martin Drew. This quartet toured and recorded extensively worldwide. Pass said in a 1976 interview: \"The only guys I've heard who come close to total mastery of their instruments are Art Tatum and Peterson.\"\nPeterson was open to experimental collaborations with jazz musicians such as saxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Clark Terry, and vibraphonist Milt Jackson. In 1961, the Peterson trio with Jackson recorded the album \"Very Tall\". Solo recordings by Peterson were rare until \"Exclusively for My Friends\" (MPS), a series of albums that were his response to pianists such as Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner. He recorded for Pablo, led by Norman Granz, after the label was founded in 1973, including the soundtrack for the 1978 thriller \"The Silent Partner\". In the 1980s, Peterson played in a duo with pianist Herbie Hancock. In the late 1980s and 1990s, after a stroke, Peterson made performances and recordings with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Benny Green. In the 1990s and 2000s, Peterson recorded several albums accompanied by a combo for Telarc.\nIll health and later years.\nPeterson had arthritis from his youth, and in later years he had trouble buttoning his shirt. He had never been slender, and his weight increase to hindered his mobility. He had hip replacement surgery in the early 1990s. Although the surgery was successful, his mobility was still hampered. He then mentored the York University jazz program and was the Chancellor of the university for several years in the early 1990s. He published jazz piano etudes for practice.\nIn 1993, a stroke weakened his left side and removed him from work for two years. During the same year, incoming prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Peterson's friend and fan, offered him the position of Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. According to Chr\u00e9tien, Peterson declined the job due to ill health related to the stroke.\nAlthough he recovered some dexterity in his left hand, his piano playing was diminished, and his style relied principally on his right hand. In 1995, he returned to occasional public performances and recorded for Telarc. In 1997, he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award. His friend, Canadian politician and amateur pianist Bob Rae, said: \"a one-handed Oscar was better than just about anyone with two hands.\"\nIn 2003, Peterson recorded the DVD \"A Night in Vienna\" for Verve with Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen, Ulf Wakenius, and Martin Drew. He continued to tour the U.S. and Europe, though at most one month a year, with rest between concerts. In 2007, his health declined. He canceled his plans to perform at the Toronto Jazz Festival and a Carnegie Hall all-star concert that was to be given in his honour. Peterson died on December 23, 2007, of kidney failure at his home in Mississauga, Ontario.\nPersonal life.\nPeterson was married four times. He had seven children with three of his wives. He smoked cigarettes and a pipe and often tried to break the habit, but he gained weight every time he stopped. He loved to cook and remained overweight throughout his life.\nPeterson taught piano and improvisation in Canada, mainly in Toronto. With associates, he started and headed the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto for five years during the 1960s, but it closed because touring called him and his associates away, and it did not have government funding.\nMusical style and influences.\nPeterson was influenced by Teddy Wilson, Nat King Cole, James P. Johnson, and Art Tatum, to whom many compared Peterson in later years. After his father played a record of Tatum's \"Tiger Rag\", he was intimidated and disillusioned, quitting the piano for several weeks. \"Tatum scared me to death,\" said Peterson, adding that he was \"never cocky again\" about his ability at the piano. Tatum was a model for Peterson's musicianship during the 1940s and 1950s. Tatum and Peterson became good friends, although Peterson was always shy about being compared to Tatum and rarely played the piano in Tatum's presence.\nPeterson also credited his sister\u2014a piano teacher in Montreal who also taught several other Canadian jazz musicians\u2014with being an important teacher and influence on his career. Under his sister's tutelage, Peterson expanded into classical piano training and broadened his range while mastering the core classical pianism from scales to preludes and fugues by Johann Sebastian Bach. He asked his students to study the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, especially \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", the \"Goldberg Variations\", and \"The Art of Fugue\", considering these piano pieces essential for every serious pianist. Among his students were pianists Benny Green and Oliver Jones.\nBuilding on Tatum's pianism and aesthetics, Peterson also absorbed Tatum's musical influences, notably from piano concertos by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff's harmonizations, as well as direct quotations from his 2nd Piano Concerto, are scattered throughout many recordings by Peterson, including his work with the most familiar formulation of the Oscar Peterson Trio, with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. During the 1960s and 1970s Peterson made numerous trio recordings highlighting his piano performances; they reveal more of his eclectic style, absorbing influences from various genres of jazz, popular, and classical music.\nAccording to pianist and educator Mark Eisenman, some of Peterson's best playing was as an understated accompanist to singer Ella Fitzgerald and trumpeter Roy Eldridge.\nLegacy.\nPeterson is considered one of history's great jazz pianists. He was called the \"Maharaja of the keyboard\" by Duke Ellington, simply \"O.P.\" by his friends, and was informally known in the jazz community as \"the King of inside swing\".\nPeterson was honoured on two postage stamps: one from Austrian Post in 2003, and another from Canada Post in 2005.\nIn 2021, Barry Avrich produced a documentary on Peterson's life titled \"\" that had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. In the same year, he was the subject of a Heritage Minute for Canadian television, with contemporary jazz pianist Thompson Egbo-Egbo playing the young Peterson.\nOscar Peterson was featured on a circulating commemorative one dollar coin (a \"loonie\") from the Canadian mint in 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
