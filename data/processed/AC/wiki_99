It is the first installment in the \"Matrix\" film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. Believing computer hacker Neo to be \"the One\" prophesied to defeat them, Morpheus recruits him into a rebellion against the machines.\nFollowing the success of \"Bound\" (1996), Warner Bros. gave the go-ahead for \"The Matrix\" after the Wachowskis sent an edit of the film's opening minutes. Action scenes were influenced by anime and martial arts films, particularly fight choreography and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema. Other influences include Plato's cave and 1990s Telnet hacker communities. The film popularized terms such as the red pill, and popularised a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which a character's heightened perception is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.\n\"The Matrix\" opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value. The film was a box office success, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of that year. The film received nominations at the 72nd Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing, winning all four categories. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards.\n\"The Matrix\" is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time, and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\". The film's success led to two sequels by the Wachowskis, both released in 2003, \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\". The \"Matrix\" franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and an animated anthology film, \"The Animatrix\", with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled \"The Matrix Resurrections\" and directed solely by Lana Wachowski, was released in 2021.\nPlot.\nIn 1999, in an unnamed city, Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer known as \"Neo\" in hacking circles, delves into the mystery of the \"Matrix\", bringing him to the attention of hacker Trinity. She tells him that the enigmatic Morpheus can answer Neo's questions. At his workplace, Neo is pursued by Agents led by Agent Smith, while Morpheus, able to somehow observe their movements, guides him by phone, but Neo ultimately surrenders.\nThe Agents interrogate Neo about Morpheus, but he refuses to cooperate. In response, they seal his mouth shut and implant a robotic tracking device in his abdomen. Neo awakens at home, believing the encounter to have been a nightmare until Trinity and her allies remove the device and take him to Morpheus. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to return to his normal life. Taking the red pill, Neo awakens in the real world, submerged in a mechanical pod and connected to invasive cables. He sees countless humans similarly encased and tended by machines before being ejected from the structure and rescued by Morpheus aboard the hovercraft \"Nebuchadnezzar\".\nMorpheus reveals that the year is approximately 2199. In the 21st century, humanity lost a war against its artificially intelligent creations, leaving Earth a devastated ruin. Humans blackened the sky to deprive the machines of solar power, but the machines retaliated by creating vast fields of artificially grown humans, harvesting their bioelectric energy. To keep their captives pacified, they built the Matrix, a simulated reality modeled on human civilization at its peak. The remaining free humans founded an underground refuge called Zion, surviving on scarce resources. Morpheus and his crew hack into the Matrix to liberate others, exploiting its rules to gain superhuman abilities within it. Even so, they remain outmatched by the Agents\u2014sentient programs that protect the system\u2014and death in the Matrix means death in the real world. Morpheus freed Neo because he believes him to be \"the One\", a prophesied figure destined to free humanity.\nThe crew enter the Matrix to seek guidance from the Oracle, who foretold the coming of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns him of an imminent choice between his life and Morpheus's. The crew are ambushed by Agents after being betrayed by Cypher, a disillusioned crew member who longs to return to the virtual comforts of the Matrix. Convinced of Neo's importance, Morpheus sacrifices himself to confront Smith and is captured. Meanwhile, Cypher exits the Matrix and begins disconnecting the others, killing them. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank, a wounded crew member, regains consciousness, kills Cypher, and safely extracts the survivors.\nSmith interrogates Morpheus to obtain access codes for Zion's mainframe, which would enable the machines to destroy the human resistance. Determined to rescue him, Neo reenters the Matrix with Trinity. They free Morpheus, who escapes the Matrix with Trinity, but Smith intercepts Neo. Realizing his potential, Neo fights Smith as an equal and kills him. However, Smith resurrects in a new body and kills Neo.\nIn the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the \"Nebuchadnezzar\". Standing by Neo's body, Trinity confesses her love for him and reveals that the Oracle prophesied she would fall in love with the One. In the Matrix, Neo revives with the ability to perceive and manipulate its code. He effortlessly destroys Smith and escapes the Matrix just as the \"Nebuchadnezzar\"'s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels. Later, within the Matrix, Neo communicates with the system, vowing to show humanity a world of limitless possibilities, before flying away.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film \"Assassins\" to Warner Bros. Pictures. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, \"Bound\" and \"The Matrix\", in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, \"Bound\", then became a critical success. Using this momentum, they later asked to direct \"The Matrix\". Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a \"different sex than the Zion reality\" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version.\nIn 1996, the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo to Will Smith. Smith explained on his YouTube channel that the idea was for him to be Neo, while Morpheus was to be played by Val Kilmer. He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead film \"Wild Wild West\". Madonna also turned down an undisclosed role, a decision she would later regret.\nProducer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters, including Silver and Di Bonaventura, to influence the company, \"The Matrix\" was still a huge investment for Warner Bros., which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with prominent actors and difficult special effects. The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film. The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget. Soon, \"The Matrix\" became a co-production of Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures. According to editor Zach Staenberg on the DVD audio commentary track, the production team sent an edit of the film's first minutes (featuring Trinity's encounter with police and Agents) to Warner Bros. executives, and secured Warner Bros.' \"total support of the movie\" from then on.\nPre-production.\nThe cast were required to be able to understand and explain \"The Matrix\". French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's \"Simulacra and Simulation\" was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew. In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves and Moss read \"Simulacra and Simulation\", Kevin Kelly's \"\", and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script. Eventually, Reeves was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.\nThe directors had long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema, so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu, the actors had to train hard for several months. The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training, beginning in October 1997. Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.\nYuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves's diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision and Moss's grace. Yuen designed Moss's moves to suit her deftness and lightness. Prior to the pre-production, Reeves underwent a two-level fusion of his cervical (neck) spine due to spinal cord compression from a herniated disc (\"I was falling over in the shower in the morning\"). He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film. Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process.\nFilming.\nAll but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center. Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days. Some filming also occurred at Culver Studios.\nDue to Reeves's neck injury (see above), some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion, such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room, or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, halfway between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. The bullet-time fight scene was filmed on the roof of Symantec Corporation building in Kent Street, opposite Sussex Street.\nMoss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of \"Dark City\", which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.\nThe dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to filming meant he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.\nThe filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station, but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves's stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot in which Neo was slammed into a booth. The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale, light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had a real minigun side-mounted to it, which was set to cycle at half its regular (3,000 rounds per minute) firing rate.\nTo prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography. According to \"The Art of the Matrix\", at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film.\nSound effects and music.\nDane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together.\nThe film's score, \"\", was composed by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.\nIn addition to Davis' score, also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Lunatic Calm, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto and Marilyn Manson.\nProduction design.\nIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals. In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\". \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors\". Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall. The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, \"Ghost in the Shell\", which had a strong influence on the \"Matrix\" series. It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game \"\", and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the \"Matrix\" series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.\n\"The Matrix\"'s production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the \"real world\" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the \"real world\". In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the \"real world\", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.\nThe \"Nebuchadnezzar\" was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on productions such as \"Star Trek\". The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as \"a marriage between Man and Machine\". For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.\nKym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume. For example, Reeves's office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled and out of place. Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses. For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character. For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film \"JFK\" and classic men in black.\nThe sunglasses, a staple of the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglasses maker Blinde Design.\nVisual effects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directed \"Akira\", which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry. His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around\u2014rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves.\nThe film is known for popularizing a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", which allows a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed. Bullet time has been described as \"a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix\", and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space. The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Mass.Illusion to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor.\nThe method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera captures a still picture, contributing one frame to the video sequence, which creates the effect of \"virtual camera movement\"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.\nThe bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.\nThe photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene, and algorithms based on optical flow were used to interpolate between the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion; the computer-generated \"lead in\" and \"lead out\" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene. Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film's visual effects.\nManex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.\nThe photogrammetric and image-based computer-generated background approaches in \"The Matrix\"'s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\". The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.\nRelease.\nHome media.\n\"The Matrix\" was released on DVD and Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of on September 21, 1999, in the US from Warner Home Video as well as in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in Hong Kong from ERA Home Entertainment. It was also released on VHS in both full screen and widescreen formats on December 7, 1999. After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US. By 2000, the film went on to become the first to sell more than three million copies in the US. At that point, it became the top-selling DVD release of all time, holding this record for a few months before being surpassed by \"Gladiator\". By November 10, 2003, one month after \"The Matrix Reloaded\" DVD was released, the sales of \"The Matrix\" DVD had exceeded 30 million copies. It then debuted on both VHS and DVD formats in the UK on November 29, 1999. \"The Matrix\" sold more than 107,000 DVD copies in just two weeks, breaking \"Armageddon\"'s record for being the country's best-selling DVD title. The Ultimate Matrix Collection was released on HD DVD on May 22, 2007, and on Blu-ray on October 14, 2008. The film was also released standalone in a 10th-anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format on March 31, 2009, ten years to the day after the film was released theatrically. In 2010, the film had another DVD release along with the two sequels as \"The Complete Matrix Trilogy\". It was also released on 4K HDR Blu-ray on May 22, 2018. The film as part of \"The Matrix Trilogy\" was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 30, 2018.\nOther media.\nThe franchise also contains four video games: \"Enter the Matrix\" (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during \"The Matrix Reloaded\"; \"The Matrix Online\" (2004), an MMORPG which continued the story beyond \"The Matrix Revolutions\"; \"\" (2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films; and \"The Matrix Awakens\" (2021), an interactive technology demonstration developed by \"Epic Games\" using \"Unreal Engine 5\".\nThe franchise also includes \"The Matrix Comics\", a series of comics and short stories set in the world of \"The Matrix\", written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the official \"Matrix\" website; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes, called \"The Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2\".\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"The Matrix\" grossed $27.8 million during its opening weekend, as well as earning $37.4 million in its first five days. It surpassed \"Lost in Space\" and \"Indecent Proposal\" simultaneously for having the biggest April and Easter opening weekends. The film also had the second-highest opening weekend for a spring starter film, trailing behind \"Liar Liar\". Three years later in 2002, \"The Matrix\"'s records for having the largest April and Easter opening weekends would be taken by \"The Scorpion King\" and \"Panic Room\" respectively. Upon its opening, it had the highest opening weekend of any 1999 film until that point, easily topping \"Payback\". Additionally, this was the biggest opening weekend for a Keanu Reeves film since \"Speed\" in 1994. It would go on to rank number one at the box office during its first weekend, beating out \"Forces of Nature\", \"10 Things I Hate About You\", \"The Out-of-Towners\", \"Analyze This\" and \"EDtv\". The film would remain at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was overtaken by \"Life\". During its fourth weekend, \"The Matrix\" briefly returned to the number one spot. The following week, the film would be displaced by \"Entrapment\".\nIn the UK, \"The Matrix\" earned $4.9 million in its first three days, ranking it as the third-highest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film, behind \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman &amp; Robin\", while also delivering the third-highest opening weekend of the year, after \"A Bug's Life\" and \"Notting Hill\". The film grossed $1.8 million in Taiwan, making the third-highest opening there, behind \"Armageddon\" and \"\". Additionally, it managed to surpass \"Lethal Weapon 4\" for having the market's highest opening for Warner Bros. It also surpassed \"Eraser\" to secure the distributor's highest opening weekend in Germany, collecting $592,000.\nIn its original run, the film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in the United States and Canada and $292,037,453 (63.0%) in other countries, for a worldwide total of $463,517,383. In North America, it went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film of 1999 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of that year. Worldwide, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year, after ', \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Toy Story 2\". \"The Matrix\" became the second-highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time, behind \"Twister\". Overall, it was the third-highest-grossing R-rated film at the time, just after \"Saving Private Ryan\" and '. Following re-releases, the worldwide gross of the film is $466,621,824. In 2012, it was placed 122nd on the list of highest-grossing films of all time, and the second-highest-grossing film in the \"Matrix\" franchise after \"The Matrix Reloaded\" ($742.1\u00a0million).\nCritical response.\n\"The Matrix\" was praised by many critics, as well as filmmakers, and authors of science fiction, especially for its \"spectacular action\" scenes and its \"groundbreaking special effects\". Some have described \"The Matrix\" as one of the best science fiction films of all time; \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"The Matrix\" \"the most influential action movie of the generation\". There have also been those, including philosopher William Irwin, who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 210 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, \"The Matrix\" is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\". At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made.\nPhilip Strick commented in \"Sight &amp; Sound\", if the Wachowskis \"claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,\" praising the film's details and its \"broadside of astonishing images\". Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four: he praised the film's visuals and premise, but disliked the third act's focus on action. Similarly, \"Time Out\" praised the \"entertainingly ingenious\" switches between different realities, Hugo Weaving's \"engagingly odd\" performance, and the film's cinematography and production design, but concluded, \"the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic\u00a0... yet another slice of overlong, high-concept hokum.\"\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as \"simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.\"\nIan Nathan of \"Empire\" described Carrie-Anne Moss as \"a major find\", praised the \"surreal visual highs\" enabled by the bullet time (or \"flo-mo\") effect, and described the film as \"technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool\". Nathan remarked that although the film's \"looney plot\" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because \"\"The Matrix\" is about pure experience\". Maitland McDonagh said in her review for \"TV Guide\", the Wachowskis' \"through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits.\"\n\"Salon\"'s reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that although \"The Matrix\" is in his view a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (\"It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the over-ramped onslaught of special effects\u2014some of them quite amazing\u2014will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside\"), he concluded, \"as in \"Bound\", there's an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for \"movies\"\u2014for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world\u2014is pure and deep.\"\nFilmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of \"The Matrix\". William Gibson, a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film \"an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time\", and stated, \"Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.\" Joss Whedon called the film \"my number one\" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, \"It works on whatever level you want to bring to it\". Darren Aronofsky commented, \"I walked out of \"The Matrix\"\u00a0... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured.\" M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for the Wachowskis, stating, \"Whatever you think of \"The Matrix\", every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!\". Simon Pegg said that \"The Matrix\" provided \"the excitement and satisfaction that \"The Phantom Menace\" failed to inspire. \"The Matrix\" seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen.\" Quentin Tarantino counted \"The Matrix\" as one of his twenty favorite movies from 1992 to 2009. James Cameron called it \"one of the most profoundly fresh science fiction films ever made\". Christopher Nolan described it as \"an incredibly palpable mainstream phenomenon that made people think, Hey, what if this isn't real?\"\nAccolades.\n\"The Matrix\" received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, like \"\", yet they won all four of their nominations. \"The Matrix\" also received BAFTA awards for Best Sound and Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in the cinematography, production design and editing categories. In 1999, it won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. In February 2022, the film was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, for the \"bullet time\" scene, finishing in fifth place.\nThematic analysis.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The Matrix\" is arguably the ultimate cyberpunk artifact.\n\u2014William Gibson\n\"The Matrix\" draws from and alludes to numerous cinematic and literary works, and concepts from mythology, religion and philosophy, including the ideas of Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Hinduism and Judaism.\nFilm and television.\nThe pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in \"Metropolis\", and the work of M. C. Escher. A resemblance to the eerie worlds of Swiss artist H. R. Giger was also recognized. The pods can be seen in \"Welcome to Paradox\" Episode 4 \"News from D Street\" from a 1986 short story of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998, on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept. In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by \"the code man\" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's \"\" as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making \"The Matrix\". Reviewers have also commented on similarities between \"The Matrix\" and other late-1990s films such as \"Strange Days\", \"Dark City\" and \"The Truman Show\". The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series \"Doctor Who\" has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial \"The Deadly Assassin\") is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality. The action scenes of \"The Matrix\" were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo. The martial arts sequences were inspired by \"Fist of Legend\", a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in \"Fist of Legend\" led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.\nThe Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as \"Ninja Scroll\" and \"Akira\". Director Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film \"Ghost in the Shell\" was a particularly strong influence; producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for \"The Matrix\" by showing him that anime and saying, \"We wanna do that for real\". Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced \"Ghost in the Shell\", noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, \"...cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that \"The Matrix\" is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios\". He stated that since \"Ghost in the Shell\" had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a \"promotional tool\".\nLiterary works.\nThe film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series \"The Invisibles\", with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\". Comparisons have also been made between \"The Matrix\" and the books of Carlos Castaneda.\n\"The Matrix\" belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson. For example, the film's use of the term \"Matrix\" is adopted from Gibson's novel, though L. P. Davies had already used the term \"Matrix\" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novel \"The White Room\" (\"It had been tried in the States some years earlier, but their 'matrix' as they called it hadn't been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place\"). After watching \"The Matrix\", Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was \"exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from \"Neuromancer\", and believed that \"The Matrix\" was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick, particularly Dick's speculative \"Exegesis\". Other writers have also commented on the similarities between \"The Matrix\" and Dick's work; one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick's 1977 conference, in which he stated: \"We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs\".\nPhilosophy.\nIn \"The Matrix\", a copy of Jean Baudrillard's philosophical work \"Simulacra and Simulation\", which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as \"the book used to conceal disks\", and Morpheus quotes the phrase \"desert of the real\" from it. \"The book was required reading\" for the actors prior to filming. However, Baudrillard himself said that \"The Matrix\" misunderstands and distorts his work. Some interpreters of \"The Matrix\" mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim \"that the [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\". The influence of \"The Matrixial Gaze\", the philosophical-psychoanalytical concept of Bracha L. Ettinger on the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra, \"was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\". In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's \"\", and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology.\nPhilosopher William Irwin suggests that the idea of the \"Matrix\" \u2013 a generated reality invented by malicious machines \u2013 is an allusion to Descartes' \"First Meditation\", and his idea of an evil demon. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. A connection between the premise of \"The Matrix\" and Plato's Allegory of the Cave has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.\nThe philosophy of Immanuel Kant has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his \"Critique of Pure Reason\" that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.\nReligion and mythology.\nAndrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ, including Neo's \"virgin birth\", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many other Christian references. Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity's doctrine of the Trinity. It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, \"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?\"\nMatrixism is a fan-based possibly satirical religion created as \"the matrix religion\".\nTransgender themes.\nYears after the release of \"The Matrix\", both of the Wachowskis came out as transgender women. The red pill has been likened to red estrogen pills. Morpheus's description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, \"like a splinter in your mind\", has been likened to gender dysphoria. In the original script, Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was removed.\nIn a 2016 GLAAD Media Awards speech, Lilly Wachowski said: \"There's a critical eye being cast back on Lana and I's [\"sic\"] work through the lens of our transness. This is a cool thing because it's an excellent reminder that art is never static.\" In 2020, Lilly said \"The Matrix\" was intended as an allegory for gender transition, but that \"the corporate world wasn't ready\". She said it was \"all about the desire for transformation but it was all coming from a closeted point of view\", but that she did not know \"how present my transness was in the background of my brain\" when the Wachowskis were writing it. In an interview with \"Variety\" in 2020, Reeves said the idea that the Matrix was an allegory for transgender identity \"wasn't introduced to me when we started for production on the films.\"\nLegacy.\nFilmmaking.\nFollowing \"The Matrix\", films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them. The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including \"Max Payne\", in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\". It was also the defining game mechanic of the game \"Superhot\" and its sequels. \"The Matrix\"'s signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, in comedy films such as ' (1999), \"Scary Movie\" (2000), \"Shrek\" (2001), \"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\" (2002), \"Lastikman\" (2003); \"Marx Reloaded\" in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; and in video games such as \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\". It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air; these included \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; \"Equilibrium\" (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; \"Night Watch\" (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by \"The Matrix\" and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made \"Wanted\" (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and \"Inception\" (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people's dreams by \"wiring in\". The original \"Tron\" (1982) paved the way for \"The Matrix\", and \"The Matrix\", in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a \"Tron\" sequel, ' (2010). Also, the film's lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedy \"Awara Paagal Deewana\".\nChoreographers and actors.\n\"The Matrix\" had a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by some subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of \"The Matrix\" created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in \"X-Men\" (2000) and \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-yan was choreographer on \"Daredevil\" (2003). \"The Matrix\"'s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.\nChad Stahelski, who had been a stunt double on \"The Matrix\" prior to directing Reeves in the \"John Wick\" series, acknowledged the film's strong influence on the \"Wick\" films, and commented, \"\"The Matrix\" literally changed the industry. The influx of martial-arts choreographers and fight coordinators now make more, and are more prevalent and powerful in the industry, than stunt coordinators. \"The Matrix\" revolutionized that. Today, action movies want their big sequences designed around the fights.\"\nCarrie-Anne Moss asserted that prior to being cast in \"The Matrix\", she had \"no career\". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a \"New York Daily News\" interview, she stated, \"\"The Matrix\" gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much\". The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since \"Star Wars\". The combined success of the \"Matrix\" trilogy, the \"Lord of the Rings\" films and the \"Star Wars\" prequels made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies. Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that \"The Matrix\"'s success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.\nCultural impact.\n\"The Matrix\" was also influential for its impact on superhero films. John Kenneth Muir in \"The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television\" called the film a \"revolutionary\" reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to \"make comic-book superheroes hip\" and effectively demonstrating the concept of \"faster than a speeding bullet\" with its bullet time effect. Adam Sternbergh of \"Vulture.com\" credits \"The Matrix\" with reinventing and setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters, and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.\nModern reception.\nIn 2001, \"The Matrix\" placed 66th in the American Film Institute's \"100 Years...100 Thrills\" list. In 2007, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"The Matrix\" the best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years. In 2009, the film was ranked 39th on \"Empire\"'s reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". \"The Matrix\" was voted as the fourth best science fiction film in the 2011 list \"Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time\", based on a poll conducted by ABC and \"People\". In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"\nRed pill and blue pill.\nHistorians of film note that the trope of a \"red pill\" as decisive in a return to reality made its first appearance in the 1990 film \"Total Recall\", which has a scene where the hero (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is asked to swallow a red pill in order to symbolize his desire to return to reality from a dream-like fantasy.\nThe premise of \"The Matrix\" has been repurposed for multiple conspiracy theories and alt-right fringe groups. For example, some online men's rights groups use the term \"redpill\" to mean men realizing that they are supposedly being subjugated by feminism. The term has been used in discussion forums for right-wing topics such as Gamergate, white supremacy, incel subculture and QAnon. As of 2021, the verb \"pill\" and suffix \"-pilled\" had entered more mainstream use and had come to mean developing a sudden interest in something.\nSequels and adaptations.\nThe film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\", both directed by the Wachowskis. These were filmed back-to-back in one shoot and released on separate dates in 2003. The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army. The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.\nAlso released was \"The Animatrix\", a collection of nine animated short films, many of which were created in the same Japanese animation style that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy. \"The Animatrix\" was overseen and approved by the Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them; much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime.\nIn March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\" neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis. On August 20, 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich officially announced that a fourth Matrix film was in the works, with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss set to reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively. \"The Matrix Resurrections\" was released in theaters and on HBO Max on December 22, 2021.\nIn September 2022, Danny Boyle was announced to be directing and producing a live immersive dance production of the film, entitled \"Free Your Mind\", which debuted in October 2023 at the \"Aviva Studios\" in Manchester, England.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30010", "revid": "50933638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30010", "title": "Telegraphy", "text": "Long distance transmission of text\nTelegraphy is the long-distance transmission of messages where the sender uses symbolic codes, known to the recipient, rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message. Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy, whereas pigeon post is not. Ancient signalling systems, although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China, were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages. Possible messages were fixed and predetermined, so such systems are thus not true telegraphs.\nThe earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the Chappe telegraph, an optical telegraph invented by Claude Chappe in the late 18th century. The system was used extensively in France, and European nations occupied by France, during the Napoleonic era. The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century. It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling. This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse. The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system, but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph. The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865, using a modified Morse code developed in Germany in 1848.\nThe heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling. It was mainly used in areas where the electrical telegraph had not been established and generally used the same code. The most extensive heliograph network established was in Arizona and New Mexico during the Apache Wars. The heliograph was standard military equipment as late as World War II. Wireless telegraphy developed in the early 20th century became important for maritime use, and was a competitor to electrical telegraphy using submarine telegraph cables in international communications.\nTelegrams became a popular means of sending messages once telegraph prices had fallen sufficiently. Traffic became high enough to spur the development of automated systems\u2014teleprinters and punched tape transmission. These systems led to new telegraph codes, starting with the Baudot code. However, telegrams were never able to compete with the letter post on price, and competition from the telephone, which removed their speed advantage, drove the telegraph into decline from 1920 onwards. The few remaining telegraph applications were largely taken over by alternatives on the internet towards the end of the 20th century.\nTerminology.\nThe word \"telegraph\" (from Ancient Greek: () 'at a distance' and () 'to write') was coined by the French inventor of the semaphore telegraph, Claude Chappe, who also coined the word \"semaphore\".\nA telegraph is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. The word \"telegraph\" alone generally refers to an electrical telegraph. Wireless telegraphy is transmission of messages over radio with telegraphic codes.\nContrary to the extensive definition used by Chappe, Morse argued that the term \"telegraph\" can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit \"and\" record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from \"semaphore\", which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to Morse, telegraph dates only from 1832 when Pavel Schilling invented one of the earliest electrical telegraphs.\nA telegraph message sent by an electrical telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a printing telegraph operator using plain text) was known as a telegram. A cablegram was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable, often shortened to \"cable\" or \"wire\". The suffix -gram is derived from ancient Greek: (), meaning something written, i.e. telegram means something written at a distance and cablegram means something written via a cable, whereas telegraph implies the process of writing at a distance.\nLater, a Telex was a message sent by a Telex network, a switched network of teleprinters similar to a telephone network.\nA wirephoto or wire picture was a newspaper picture that was sent from a remote location by a facsimile telegraph. A diplomatic telegram, also known as a diplomatic cable, is a confidential communication between a diplomatic mission and the foreign ministry of its parent country. These continue to be called telegrams or cables regardless of the method used for transmission.\nHistory.\nEarly signalling.\nPassing messages by signalling over distance is an ancient practice. One of the oldest examples is the signal towers of the Great Wall of China. By 400\u00a0BC, signals could be sent by beacon fires or drum beats, and by 200\u00a0BC complex flag signalling had developed. During the Han dynasty (202\u00a0BC\u00a0\u2013 220\u00a0AD), signallers mainly used flags and wood fires\u2014via the light of the flames swung high into the air at night, and via dark smoke produced by the addition of wolf dung during the day\u2014to send signals. By the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) a message could be sent in 24 hours. The Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) used artillery as another possible signalling method. While the signalling was complex (for instance, flags of different colours could be used to indicate enemy strength), only predetermined messages could be sent. The Chinese signalling system extended well beyond the Great Wall. Signal towers away from the wall were used to give early warning of an attack. Others were built even further out as part of the protection of trade routes, especially the Silk Road.\nSignal fires were widely used in Europe and elsewhere for military purposes. The Roman army made frequent use of them, as did their enemies, and the remains of some of the stations still exist. Few details have been recorded of European/Mediterranean signalling systems and the possible messages. One of the few for which details are known is a system invented by Aeneas Tacticus (4th century BC). Tacticus's system had water filled pots at the two signal stations which were drained in synchronisation. Annotation on a floating scale indicated which message was being sent or received. Signals sent by means of torches indicated when to start and stop draining to keep the synchronisation.\nNone of the signalling systems discussed above are true telegraphs in the sense of a system that can transmit arbitrary messages over arbitrary distances. Lines of signalling relay stations can send messages to any required distance, but all these systems are limited to one extent or another in the range of messages that they can send. A system like flag semaphore, with an alphabetic code, can certainly send any given message, but the system is designed for short-range communication between two persons. An engine order telegraph, used to send instructions from the bridge of a ship to the engine room, fails to meet both criteria; it has a limited distance and very simple message set. There was only one ancient signalling system described that \"does\" meet these criteria. That was a system using the Polybius square to encode an alphabet. Polybius (2nd century BC) suggested using two successive groups of torches to identify the coordinates of the letter of the alphabet being transmitted. The number of said torches held up signalled the grid square that contained the letter. There is no definite record of the system ever being used, but there are several passages in ancient texts that some think are suggestive. Holzmann and Pehrson, for instance, suggest that Livy is describing its use by Philip V of Macedon in 207 BC during the First Macedonian War. Nothing else that could be described as a true telegraph existed until the 17th century. Possibly the first alphabetic telegraph code in the modern era is due to Franz Kessler who published his work in 1616. Kessler used a lamp placed inside a barrel with a moveable shutter operated by the signaller. The signals were observed at a distance with the newly invented telescope.\nOptical telegraph.\nAn optical telegraph is a telegraph consisting of a line of stations in towers or natural high points which signal to each other by means of shutters or paddles. Signalling by means of indicator pointers was called \"semaphore\". Early proposals for an optical telegraph system were made to the Royal Society by Robert Hooke in 1684 and were first implemented on an experimental level by Sir Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1767. The first successful optical telegraph network was invented by Claude Chappe and operated in France from 1793. The two most extensive systems were Chappe's in France, with branches into neighbouring countries, and the system of Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz in Sweden.\nDuring 1790\u20131795, at the height of the French Revolution, France needed a swift and reliable communication system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies. In 1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. On 2 March 1791, at 11 am, they sent the message \"si vous r\u00e9ussissez, vous serez bient\u00f4t couverts de gloire\" (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory) between Brulon and Parce, a distance of . The first means used a combination of black and white panels, clocks, telescopes, and codebooks to send their message.\nIn 1792, Claude was appointed \"Ing\u00e9nieur-T\u00e9l\u00e9graphiste\" and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and Lille, a distance of . It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred. A decision to replace the system with an electric telegraph was made in 1846, but it took a decade before it was fully taken out of service. The fall of Sevastopol was reported by Chappe telegraph in 1855.\nThe Prussian system was put into effect in the 1830s. However, they were highly dependent on good weather and daylight to work and even then could accommodate only about two words per minute. The last commercial semaphore link ceased operation in Sweden in 1880. As of 1895, France still operated coastal commercial semaphore telegraph stations, for ship-to-shore communication.\nElectrical telegraph.\nThe early ideas for an electric telegraph included in 1753 using electrostatic deflections of pith balls, proposals for electrochemical bubbles in acid by Campillo in 1804 and von S\u00f6mmering in 1809. The first experimental system over a substantial distance was by Ronalds in 1816 using an electrostatic generator. Ronalds offered his invention to the British Admiralty, but it was rejected as unnecessary, the existing optical telegraph connecting the Admiralty in London to their main fleet base in Portsmouth being deemed adequate for their purposes. As late as 1844, after the electrical telegraph had come into use, the Admiralty's optical telegraph was still used, although it was accepted that poor weather ruled it out on many days of the year. France had an extensive optical telegraph system dating from Napoleonic times and was even slower to take up electrical systems.\nEventually, electrostatic telegraphs were abandoned in favour of electromagnetic systems. An early experimental system (Schilling, 1832) led to a proposal to establish a telegraph between St Petersburg and Kronstadt, but it was never completed. The first operative electric telegraph (Gauss and Weber, 1833) connected G\u00f6ttingen Observatory to the Institute of Physics about 1\u00a0km away during experimental investigations of the geomagnetic field.\nThe first commercial telegraph was by Cooke and Wheatstone following their English patent of 10 June 1837. It was demonstrated on the London and Birmingham Railway in July of the same year. In July 1839, a five-needle, five-wire system was installed to provide signalling over a record distance of 21\u00a0km on a section of the Great Western Railway between London Paddington station and West Drayton. However, in trying to get railway companies to take up his telegraph more widely for railway signalling, Cooke was rejected several times in favour of the more familiar, but shorter range, steam-powered pneumatic signalling. Even when his telegraph was taken up, it was considered experimental and the company backed out of a plan to finance extending the telegraph line out to Slough. However, this led to a breakthrough for the electric telegraph, as up to this point the Great Western had insisted on exclusive use and refused Cooke permission to open public telegraph offices. Cooke extended the line at his own expense and agreed that the railway could have free use of it in exchange for the right to open it up to the public.\nMost of the early electrical systems required multiple wires (Ronalds' system was an exception), but the system developed in the United States by Morse and Vail was a single-wire system. This was the system that first used the soon-to-become-ubiquitous Morse code. By 1844, the Morse system connected Baltimore to Washington, and by 1861 the west coast of the continent was connected to the east coast. The Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, in a series of improvements, also ended up with a one-wire system, but still using their own code and needle displays.\nThe electric telegraph quickly became a means of more general communication. The Morse system was officially adopted as the standard for continental European telegraphy in 1851 with a revised code, which later became the basis of International Morse Code. However, Great Britain and the British Empire continued to use the Cooke and Wheatstone system, in some places as late as the 1930s. Likewise, the United States continued to use American Morse code internally, requiring translation operators skilled in both codes for international messages.\nRailway telegraphy.\nRailway signal telegraphy was developed in Britain from the 1840s onward. It was used to manage railway traffic and to prevent accidents as part of the railway signalling system. On 12 June 1837 Cooke and Wheatstone were awarded a patent for an electric telegraph. This was demonstrated between Euston railway station\u2014where Wheatstone was located\u2014and the engine house at Camden Town\u2014where Cooke was stationed, together with Robert Stephenson, the London and Birmingham Railway line's chief engineer. The messages were for the operation of the rope-haulage system for pulling trains up the 1 in 77 bank. The world's first permanent railway telegraph was completed in July 1839 between London Paddington and West Drayton on the Great Western Railway with an electric telegraph using a four-needle system.\nThe concept of a signalling \"block\" system was proposed by Cooke in 1842. Railway signal telegraphy did not change in essence from Cooke's initial concept for more than a century. In this system each line of railway was divided into sections or blocks of varying length. Entry to and exit from the block was to be authorised by electric telegraph and signalled by the line-side semaphore signals, so that only a single train could occupy the rails. In Cooke's original system, a single-needle telegraph was adapted to indicate just two messages: \"Line Clear\" and \"Line Blocked\". The signaller would adjust his line-side signals accordingly. As first implemented in 1844 each station had as many needles as there were stations on the line, giving a complete picture of the traffic. As lines expanded, a sequence of pairs of single-needle instruments were adopted, one pair for each block in each direction.\nWigwag.\nWigwag is a form of flag signalling using a single flag. Unlike most forms of flag signalling, which are used over relatively short distances, wigwag is designed to maximise the distance covered\u2014up to in some cases. Wigwag achieved this by using a large flag\u2014a single flag can be held with both hands unlike flag semaphore which has a flag in each hand\u2014and using motions rather than positions as its symbols since motions are more easily seen. It was invented by US Army surgeon Albert J. Myer in the 1850s who later became the first head of the Signal Corps. Wigwag was used extensively during the American Civil War where it filled a gap left by the electrical telegraph. Although the electrical telegraph had been in use for more than a decade, the network did not yet reach everywhere and portable, ruggedized equipment suitable for military use was not immediately available. Permanent or semi-permanent stations were established during the war, some of them towers of enormous height and the system was extensive enough to be described as a communications network.\nHeliograph.\nA heliograph is a telegraph that transmits messages by flashing sunlight with a mirror, usually using Morse code. The idea for a telegraph of this type was first proposed as a modification of surveying equipment (Gauss, 1821). Various uses of mirrors were made for communication in the following years, mostly for military purposes, but the first device to become widely used was a heliograph with a moveable mirror (Mance, 1869). The system was used by the French during the 1870\u201371 siege of Paris, with night-time signalling using kerosene lamps as the source of light. An improved version (Begbie, 1870) was used by British military in many colonial wars, including the Anglo-Zulu War (1879). At some point, a morse key was added to the apparatus to give the operator the same degree of control as in the electric telegraph.\nAnother type of heliograph was the heliostat or heliotrope fitted with a Colomb shutter. The heliostat was essentially a surveying instrument with a fixed mirror and so could not transmit a code by itself. The term \"heliostat\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"heliograph\" because of this origin. The Colomb shutter (Bolton and Colomb, 1862) was originally invented to enable the transmission of morse code by signal lamp between Royal Navy ships at sea.\nThe heliograph was heavily used by Nelson A. Miles in Arizona and New Mexico after he took over command (1886) of the fight against Geronimo and other Apache bands in the Apache Wars. Miles had previously set up the first heliograph line in the US between Fort Keogh and Fort Custer in Montana. He used the heliograph to fill in vast, thinly populated areas that were not covered by the electric telegraph. Twenty-six stations covered an area . In a test of the system, a message was relayed in four hours. Miles' enemies used smoke signals and flashes of sunlight from metal, but lacked a sophisticated telegraph code. The heliograph was ideal for use in the American Southwest due to its clear air and mountainous terrain on which stations could be located. It was found necessary to lengthen the morse dash (which is much shorter in American Morse code than in the modern International Morse code) to aid differentiating from the morse dot.\nUse of the heliograph declined from 1915 onwards, but remained in service in Britain and British Commonwealth countries for some time. Australian forces used the heliograph as late as 1942 in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II. Some form of heliograph was used by the mujahideen in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War (1979\u20131989).\nTeleprinter.\nA teleprinter is a telegraph machine that can send messages from a typewriter-like keyboard and print incoming messages in readable text with no need for the operators to be trained in the telegraph code used on the line. It developed from various earlier printing telegraphs and resulted in improved transmission speeds. The Morse telegraph (1837) was originally conceived as a system marking indentations on paper tape. A chemical telegraph making blue marks improved the speed of recording (Bain, 1846), but was delayed by a patent challenge from Morse. The first true printing telegraph (that is printing in plain text) used a spinning wheel of types in the manner of a daisy wheel printer (House, 1846, improved by Hughes, 1855). The system was adopted by Western Union.\nEarly teleprinters used the Baudot code, a five-bit sequential binary code. This was a telegraph code developed for use on the French telegraph using a five-key keyboard (Baudot, 1874). Teleprinters generated the same code from a full alphanumeric keyboard. A feature of the Baudot code, and subsequent telegraph codes, was that, unlike Morse code, every character has a code of the same length making it more machine friendly. The Baudot code was used on the earliest ticker tape machines (Calahan, 1867), a system for mass distributing information on current price of publicly listed companies.\nAutomated punched-tape transmission.\nIn a punched-tape system, the message is first typed onto punched tape using the code of the telegraph system\u2014Morse code for instance. It is then, either immediately or at some later time, run through a transmission machine which sends the message to the telegraph network. Multiple messages can be sequentially recorded on the same run of tape. The advantage of doing this is that messages can be sent at a steady, fast rate making maximum use of the available telegraph lines. The economic advantage of doing this is greatest on long, busy routes where the cost of the extra step of preparing the tape is lower than the cost of providing more telegraph lines. The first machine to use punched tape was Bain's teleprinter (Bain, 1843), but the system saw only limited use. Later versions of Bain's system achieved speeds up to 1000 words per minute, far faster than a human operator could achieve.\nThe first widely used system (Wheatstone, 1858) was first put into service with the British General Post Office in 1867. A novel feature of the Wheatstone system was the use of bipolar encoding. That is, both positive and negative polarity voltages were used. Bipolar encoding has several advantages, one of which is that it permits duplex communication. The Wheatstone tape reader was capable of a speed of 400 words per minute.\nOceanic telegraph cables.\nA worldwide communication network meant that telegraph cables would have to be laid across oceans. On land, cables could be run uninsulated suspended from poles. Underwater, a good insulator that was both flexible and capable of resisting the ingress of seawater was required. A solution presented itself with gutta-percha, a natural rubber from the \"Palaquium gutta\" tree, after William Montgomerie sent samples to London from Singapore in 1843. The new material was tested by Michael Faraday and in 1845 Wheatstone suggested that it should be used on the cable planned between Dover and Calais by John Watkins Brett. The idea was proved viable when the South Eastern Railway company successfully tested a gutta-percha insulated cable with telegraph messages to a ship off the coast of Folkestone. The cable to France was laid in 1850 but was almost immediately severed by a French fishing vessel. It was relaid the next year and connections to Ireland and the Low Countries soon followed.\nGetting a cable across the Atlantic Ocean proved much more difficult. The Atlantic Telegraph Company, formed in London in 1856, had several failed attempts. A cable laid in 1858 worked poorly for a few days, sometimes taking all day to send a message despite the use of the highly sensitive mirror galvanometer developed by William Thomson (the future Lord Kelvin) before being destroyed by applying too high a voltage. Its failure and slow speed of transmission prompted Thomson and Oliver Heaviside to find better mathematical descriptions of long transmission lines. The company finally succeeded in 1866 with an improved cable laid by SS \"Great Eastern\", the largest ship of its day, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\nAn overland telegraph from Britain to India was first connected in 1866 but was unreliable, prompting a submarine telegraph cable to be connected in 1870. Several telegraph companies were combined to form the \"Eastern Telegraph Company\" in 1872. Australia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.\nFrom the 1850s until well into the 20th century, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line. In 1896, there were thirty cable-laying ships in the world and twenty-four of them were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world's cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent. During World War I, Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.\nFacsimile.\nIn 1843, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain invented a device that could be considered the first facsimile machine. He called his invention a \"recording telegraph\". Bain's telegraph was able to transmit images by electrical wires. Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. In 1855, an Italian priest, Giovanni Caselli, also created an electric telegraph that could transmit images. Caselli called his invention \"Pantelegraph\". Pantelegraph was successfully tested and approved for a telegraph line between Paris and Lyon.\nIn 1881, English inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the \"scanning phototelegraph\" that was the first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. Around 1900, German physicist Arthur Korn invented the \"\" widespread in continental Europe especially since a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908 used until the wider distribution of the radiofax. Its main competitors were the \"B\u00e9linographe\" by \u00c9douard Belin first, then since the 1930s, the \"Hellschreiber\", invented in 1929 by German inventor Rudolf Hell, a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission.\nWireless telegraphy.\nThe late 1880s through to the 1890s saw the discovery and then development of a newly understood phenomenon into a form of wireless telegraphy, called \"Hertzian wave\" wireless telegraphy, radiotelegraphy, or (later) simply \"radio\". Between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published the results of his experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory of electromagnetic radiation. Many scientists and inventors experimented with this new phenomenon but the consensus was that these new waves (similar to light) would be just as short range as light, and, therefore, useless for long range communication.\nAt the end of 1894, the young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began working on the idea of building a commercial wireless telegraphy system based on the use of Hertzian waves (radio waves), a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing. Building on the ideas of previous scientists and inventors Marconi re-engineered their apparatus by trial and error attempting to build a radio-based wireless telegraphic system that would function the same as wired telegraphy. He would work on the system through 1895 in his lab and then in field tests making improvements to extend its range. After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted. Having failed to interest the Italian government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met William Preece, a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the General Post Office. A series of demonstrations for the British government followed\u2014by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about across Salisbury Plain.\nOn 13 May 1897, Marconi, assisted by George Kemp, a Cardiff Post Office engineer, transmitted the first wireless signals over water to Lavernock (near Penarth in Wales) from Flat Holm. His star rising, he was soon sending signals across the English Channel (1899), from shore to ship (1899) and finally across the Atlantic (1901). A study of these demonstrations of radio, with scientists trying to work out how a phenomenon predicted to have a short range could transmit \"over the horizon\", led to the discovery of a radio reflecting layer in the Earth's atmosphere in 1902, later called the ionosphere.\nRadiotelegraphy proved effective for rescue work in sea disasters by enabling effective communication between ships and from ship to shore. In 1904, Marconi began the first commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907. Notably, Marconi's apparatus was used to help rescue efforts after the sinking of . Britain's postmaster-general summed up, referring to the \"Titanic\" disaster, \"Those who have been saved, have been saved through one man, Mr. Marconi...and his marvellous invention.\"\nNon-radio wireless telegraphy.\nThe successful development of radiotelegraphy was preceded by a 50-year history of ingenious but ultimately unsuccessful experiments by inventors to achieve wireless telegraphy by other means.\nGround, water, and air conduction.\nSeveral wireless electrical signaling schemes based on the (sometimes erroneous) idea that electric currents could be conducted long-range through water, ground, and air were investigated for telegraphy before practical radio systems became available.\nThe original telegraph lines used two wires between the two stations to form a complete electrical circuit or \"loop\". In 1837, however, Carl August von Steinheil of Munich, Germany, found that by connecting one leg of the apparatus at each station to metal plates buried in the ground, he could eliminate one wire and use a single wire for telegraphic communication. This led to speculation that it might be possible to eliminate both wires and therefore transmit telegraph signals through the ground without any wires connecting the stations. Other attempts were made to send the electric current through bodies of water, to span rivers, for example. Prominent experimenters along these lines included Samuel F. B. Morse in the United States and James Bowman Lindsay in Great Britain, who in August 1854, was able to demonstrate transmission across a mill dam at a distance of .\nUS inventors William Henry Ward (1871) and Mahlon Loomis (1872) developed electrical conduction systems based on the erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. They thought atmosphere current, connected with a return path using \"Earth currents\" would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries. A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear's 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.\nIn the 1890s inventor Nikola Tesla worked on an air and ground conduction wireless electric power transmission system, similar to Loomis', which he planned to include wireless telegraphy. Tesla's experiments had led him to incorrectly conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy and his 1901 large scale application of his ideas, a high-voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, lost funding and was abandoned after a few years.\nTelegraphic communication using earth conductivity was eventually found to be limited to impractically short distances, as was communication conducted through water, or between trenches during World War I.\nElectrostatic and electromagnetic induction.\nBoth electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were used to develop wireless telegraph systems that saw limited commercial application. In the United States, Thomas Edison, in the mid-1880s, patented an electromagnetic induction system he called \"grasshopper telegraphy\", which allowed telegraphic signals to jump the short distance between a running train and telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks. This system was successful technically but not economically, as there turned out to be little interest by train travelers in the use of an on-board telegraph service. During the Great Blizzard of 1888, this system was used to send and receive wireless messages from trains buried in snowdrifts. The disabled trains were able to maintain communications via their Edison induction wireless telegraph systems, perhaps the first successful use of wireless telegraphy to send distress calls. Edison would also help to patent a ship-to-shore communication system based on electrostatic induction.\nThe most successful creator of an electromagnetic induction telegraph system was William Preece, chief engineer of Post Office Telegraphs of the General Post Office (GPO) in the United Kingdom. Preece first noticed the effect in 1884 when overhead telegraph wires in Grays Inn Road were accidentally carrying messages sent on buried cables. Tests in Newcastle succeeded in sending a quarter of a mile using parallel rectangles of wire. In tests across the Bristol Channel in 1892, Preece was able to telegraph across gaps of about . However, his induction system required extensive lengths of antenna wires, many kilometers long, at both the sending and receiving ends. The length of those sending and receiving wires needed to be about the same length as the width of the water or land to be spanned. For example, for Preece's station to span the English Channel from Dover, England, to the coast of France would require sending and receiving wires of about along the two coasts. These facts made the system impractical on ships, boats, and ordinary islands, which are much smaller than Great Britain or Greenland. Also, the relatively short distances that a practical Preece system could span meant that it had few advantages over underwater telegraph cables.\nTelegram services.\nA telegram service is a company or public entity that delivers telegraphed messages directly to the recipient. Telegram services were not inaugurated until electric telegraphy became available. Earlier optical systems were largely limited to official government and military purposes.\nHistorically, telegrams were sent between a network of interconnected telegraph offices. A person visiting a local telegraph office paid by the word to have a message telegraphed to another office and delivered to the addressee on a paper form. Messages (i.e. telegrams) sent by telegraph could be delivered by telegraph messenger faster than mail, and even in the telephone age, the telegram remained popular for social and business correspondence. At their peak in 1929, an estimated 200 million telegrams were sent.\nIn 1919, the Central Bureau for Registered Addresses was established in the financial district of New York City. The bureau was created to ease the growing problem of messages being delivered to the wrong recipients. To combat this issue, the bureau offered telegraph customers the option to register unique code names for their telegraph addresses. Customers were charged $2.50 per year per code. By 1934, 28,000 codes had been registered.\nTelegram services still operate in much of the world (see worldwide use of telegrams by country), but e-mail and text messaging have rendered telegrams obsolete in many countries, and the number of telegrams sent annually has been declining rapidly since the 1980s. Where telegram services still exist, the transmission method between offices is no longer by telegraph, but by telex or IP link.\nTelegram length.\nAs telegrams have been traditionally charged by the word, messages were often abbreviated to pack information into the smallest possible number of words, in what came to be called \"telegram style\".\nThe average length of a telegram in the 1900s in the US was 11.93 words; more than half of the messages were 10 words or fewer. According to another study, the mean length of the telegrams sent in the UK before 1950 was 14.6 words or 78.8 characters. For German telegrams, the mean length is 11.5 words or 72.4 characters. At the end of the 19th century, the average length of a German telegram was calculated as 14.2 words.\nTelex.\nTelex (telegraph exchange) was a public switched network of teleprinters. It used rotary-telephone-style pulse dialling for automatic routing through the network. It initially used the Baudot code for messages. Telex development began in Germany in 1926, becoming an operational service in 1933 run by the (the German imperial postal service). It had a speed of 50 baud\u2014approximately 66 words per minute. Up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using voice frequency telegraphy multiplexing, making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication. Telex was introduced into Canada in July 1957, and the United States in 1958. A new code, ASCII, was introduced in 1963 by the American Standards Association. ASCII was a seven-bit code and could thus support a larger number of characters than Baudot. In particular, ASCII supported upper and lower case whereas Baudot was upper case only.\nDecline.\nTelegraph use began to permanently decline around 1920. The decline began with the growth of the use of the telephone. Ironically, the invention of the telephone grew out of the development of the harmonic telegraph, a device which was supposed to increase the efficiency of telegraph transmission and improve the profits of telegraph companies. Western Union gave up its patent battle with Alexander Graham Bell because it believed the telephone was not a threat to its telegraph business. The Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1877 and had 230 subscribers which grew to 30,000 by 1880. By 1886 there were a quarter of a million phones worldwide, and nearly 2 million by 1900. The decline was briefly postponed by the rise of special occasion congratulatory telegrams. Traffic continued to grow between 1867 and 1893 despite the introduction of the telephone in this period, but by 1900 the telegraph was definitely in decline.\nThere was a brief resurgence in telegraphy during World War I but the decline continued as the world entered the Great Depression years of the 1930s. After the Second World War new technology improved communication in the telegraph industry. Telegraph lines continued to be an important means of distributing news feeds from news agencies by teleprinter machine until the rise of the internet in the 1990s. For Western Union, one service remained highly profitable\u2014the wire transfer of money. This service kept Western Union in business long after the telegraph had ceased to be important. In the modern era, the telegraph that began in 1837 has been gradually replaced by digital data transmission based on computer information systems.\nSocial implications.\nOptical telegraph lines were installed by governments, often for a military purpose, and reserved for official use only. In many countries, this situation continued after the introduction of the electric telegraph. Starting in Germany and the UK, electric telegraph lines were installed by railway companies. Railway use quickly led to private telegraph companies in the UK and the US offering a telegraph service to the public using telegraph along railway lines. The availability of this new form of communication brought on widespread social and economic changes.\nThe electric telegraph freed communication from the time constraints of postal mail and revolutionized society and the global economy. By the end of the 19th century, the telegraph was becoming an increasingly common medium of communication for ordinary people. The telegraph isolated the message (information) from the physical movement of objects or the process.\nThere was some fear of the new technology. According to author Allan J. Kimmel, some people \"feared that the telegraph would erode the quality of public discourse through the transmission of irrelevant, context-free information.\" Henry David Thoreau thought of the Transatlantic cable \"...perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\" Kimmel says these fears anticipate many of the characteristics of the modern internet age.\nInitially, the telegraph was expensive, but it had an enormous effect on three industries: finance, newspapers, and railways. Telegraphy facilitated the growth of organizations \"in the railroads, consolidated financial and commodity markets, and reduced information costs within and between firms\". In the US, there were 200 to 300 stock exchanges before the telegraph, but most of these were unnecessary and unprofitable once the telegraph made financial transactions at a distance easy and drove down transaction costs. This immense growth in the business sectors influenced society to embrace the use of telegrams once the cost had fallen.\nWorldwide telegraphy changed the gathering of information for news reporting. Journalists were using the telegraph for war reporting as early as 1846 when the Mexican\u2013American War broke out. News agencies were formed, such as the Associated Press, for the purpose of reporting news by telegraph. Messages and information would now travel far and wide, and the telegraph demanded a language \"stripped of the local, the regional; and colloquial\", to better facilitate a worldwide media language. Media language had to be standardized, which led to the gradual disappearance of different forms of speech and styles of journalism and storytelling.\nThe spread of the railways created a need for an accurate standard time to replace local standards based on local noon. The means of achieving this synchronisation was the telegraph. This emphasis on precise time has led to major societal changes such as the concept of the time value of money.\nDuring the telegraph era there was widespread employment of women in telegraphy. The shortage of men to work as telegraph operators in the American Civil War opened up the opportunity for women of a well-paid skilled job. In the UK, there was widespread employment of women as telegraph operators even earlier \u2013 from the 1850s by all the major companies. The attraction of women for the telegraph companies was that they could pay them less than men. Nevertheless, the jobs were popular with women for the same reason as in the US; most other work available for women was very poorly paid.\nThe economic impact of the telegraph was not much studied by economic historians until parallels started to be drawn with the rise of the internet. In fact, the electric telegraph was as important as the invention of printing in this respect. According to economist Ronnie J. Phillips, the reason for this may be that institutional economists paid more attention to advances that required greater capital investment. The investment required to build railways, for instance, is orders of magnitude greater than that for the telegraph.\nIn popular culture.\nThe optical telegraph was quickly forgotten once it went out of service. While it was in operation, it was very familiar to the public across Europe. Examples appear in many paintings of the period. Poems include \"\" by Victor Hugo, and the collection by Elias Sehlstedt is dedicated to the telegraph. In novels, the telegraph is a major component in \"Lucien Leuwen\" by Stendhal, and it features in \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", by Alexandre Dumas. Joseph Chudy's 1796 opera, , was written to publicise Chudy's telegraph (a binary code with five lamps) when it became clear that Chappe's design was being taken up.\nRudyard Kipling wrote a poem in praise of submarine telegraph cables; \"And a new Word runs between: whispering, 'Let us be one!'\" Kipling's poem represented a widespread idea in the late nineteenth century that international telegraphy (and new technology in general) would bring peace and mutual understanding to the world. When a submarine telegraph cable first connected America and Britain, the \"New York Post\" declared:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is the harbinger of an age when international difficulties will not have time to ripen into bloody results, and when, in spite of the fatuity and perveseness of rulers, war will be impossible.\nNewspaper names.\nNumerous newspapers and news outlets in various countries, such as \"The Daily Telegraph\" in Britain, \"The Telegraph\" in India, in the Netherlands, and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in the US, were given names which include the word \"telegraph\" due to their having received news by means of electric telegraphy. Some of these names are retained even though different means of news acquisition are now used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more in miniature form are found embedded in integrated circuits. Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics, many people consider them one of the 20th century's greatest inventions.\nPhysicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor (FET) in 1925, but it was not possible to construct a working device at that time. The first working device was a point-contact transistor invented in 1947 by physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement. The most widely used type of transistor, the metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960. Transistors revolutionized the field of electronics and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios, calculators, computers, and other electronic devices.\nMost transistors are made from very pure silicon, and some from germanium, but certain other semiconductor materials are sometimes used. A transistor may have only one kind of charge carrier in a field-effect transistor, or may have two kinds of charge carriers in bipolar junction transistor devices. Compared with the vacuum tube, transistors are generally smaller and require less power to operate. Certain vacuum tubes have advantages over transistors at very high operating frequencies or high operating voltages, such as traveling-wave tubes and gyrotrons. Many types of transistors are made to standardized specifications by multiple manufacturers.\nHistory.\nThe thermionic triode, a vacuum tube invented in 1907, enabled amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony. The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed a substantial amount of power. In 1909, physicist William Eccles discovered the crystal diode oscillator. Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a field-effect transistor (FET) in Canada in 1925, intended as a solid-state replacement for the triode. He filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928. However, he did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built. In 1934, inventor Oskar Heil patented a similar device in Europe.\nBipolar transistors.\nFrom November 17 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input. Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term \"transistor\" was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term \"transresistance\". According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch, Shockley proposed that Bell Labs' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Lilienfeld's patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a \"grid\" was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor. To acknowledge this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain jointly received the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect\".\nShockley's team initially attempted to build a field-effect transistor (FET) by trying to modulate the conductivity of a semiconductor, but was unsuccessful, mainly due to problems with the surface states, the dangling bond, and the germanium and copper compound materials. Trying to understand the mysterious reasons behind this failure led them instead to invent the bipolar point-contact and junction transistors.\nIn 1948, the point-contact transistor was independently invented by physicists Herbert Matar\u00e9 and Heinrich Welker while working at the \"Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse\", a Westinghouse subsidiary in Paris. Matar\u00e9 had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the German radar effort during World War II. With this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of \"interference\" in 1947. By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, he produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947. Realizing that Bell Labs' scientists had already invented the transistor, the company rushed to get its \"transistron\" into production for amplified use in France's telephone network, filing his first transistor patent application on August 13, 1948.\nThe first bipolar junction transistors were invented by Bell Labs' William Shockley, who applied for patent (2,569,347) on June 26, 1948. On April 12, 1950, Bell Labs chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks successfully produced a working bipolar NPN junction amplifying germanium transistor. Bell announced the discovery of this new \"sandwich\" transistor in a press release on July 4, 1951.\nThe first high-frequency transistor was the surface-barrier germanium transistor developed by Philco in 1953, capable of operating at frequencies up to 60 MHz. They were made by etching depressions into an n-type germanium base from both sides with jets of indium(III) sulfate until it was a few ten-thousandths of an inch thick. Indium electroplated into the depressions formed the collector and emitter.\nAT&amp;T first used transistors in telecommunications equipment in the No.\u00a04A Toll Crossbar Switching System in 1953, for selecting trunk circuits from routing information encoded on translator cards. Its predecessor, the \nWestern Electric No.\u00a03A phototransistor, read the mechanical encoding from punched metal cards.\nThe first prototype pocket transistor radio was shown by INTERMETALL, a company founded by Herbert Matar\u00e9 in 1952, at the \"Internationale Funkausstellung D\u00fcsseldorf\" from August 29 to September 6, 1953. The first production-model pocket transistor radio was the Regency TR-1, released in October 1954. Produced as a joint venture between the Regency Division of Industrial Development Engineering Associates, I.D.E.A. and Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas, the TR-1 was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was a near pocket-sized radio with four transistors and one germanium diode. The industrial design was outsourced to the Chicago firm of Painter, Teague and Petertil. It was initially released in one of six colours: black, ivory, mandarin red, cloud grey, mahogany and olive green. Other colours shortly followed.\nThe first production all-transistor car radio was developed by Chrysler and Philco corporations and was announced in the April 28, 1955, edition of \"The Wall Street Journal\". Chrysler made the Mopar model 914HR available as an option starting in fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which reached dealership showrooms on October 21, 1955.\nThe Sony TR-63, released in 1957, was the first mass-produced transistor radio, leading to the widespread adoption of transistor radios. Seven million TR-63s were sold worldwide by the mid-1960s. Sony's success with transistor radios led to transistors replacing vacuum tubes as the dominant electronic technology in the late 1950s.\nThe first working silicon transistor was developed at Bell Labs on January 26, 1954, by Morris Tanenbaum. The first production commercial silicon transistor was announced by Texas Instruments in May 1954. This was the work of Gordon Teal, an expert in growing crystals of high purity, who had previously worked at Bell Labs.\nField-effect transistors.\nThe basic principle of the field-effect transistor (FET) was first proposed by physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld when he filed a patent for a device similar to MESFET in 1926, and for an insulated-gate field-effect transistor in 1928. The FET concept was later also theorized by engineer Oskar Heil in the 1930s and by William Shockley in the 1940s.\nIn 1945, JFET was patented by Heinrich Welker. Following Shockley's theoretical treatment on JFET in 1952, a working practical JFET was made in 1953 by George C. Dacey and Ian M. Ross.\nIn 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented the progenitor of MOSFET at Bell Labs, an insulated-gate FET (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Bardeen's patent, and the concept of an inversion layer, forms the basis of CMOS and DRAM technology today.\nIn the early years of the semiconductor industry, companies focused on the junction transistor, a relatively bulky device that was difficult to mass-produce, limiting it to several specialized applications. Field-effect transistors (FETs) were theorized as potential alternatives, but researchers could not get them to work properly, largely due to the surface state barrier that prevented the external electric field from penetrating the material.\nMOSFET (MOS transistor).\nIn 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects. By 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field-effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer. After this, J.\u00a0R. Ligenza and W.\u00a0G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high-quality Si/SiO2 stack and published their results in 1960.\nFollowing this research, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960. Their team included E.\u00a0E. LaBate and E.\u00a0I. Povilonis, who fabricated the device; M.\u00a0O. Thurston, L.\u00a0A. D'Asaro, and J.\u00a0R. Ligenza, who developed the diffusion processes, and H.\u00a0K. Gummel and R.\u00a0Lindner, who characterized the device. With its high scalability, much lower power consumption, and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits, allowing the integration of more than 10,000 transistors in a single IC.\nBardeen and Brattain's 1948 inversion-layer concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. The CMOS (complementary MOS) was invented by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963. The first report of a floating-gate MOSFET was made by Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze in 1967.\nIn 1967, Bell Labs researchers Robert Kerwin, Donald Klein and John Sarace developed the self-aligned gate (silicon-gate) MOS transistor, which Fairchild Semiconductor researchers Federico Faggin and Tom Klein used to develop the first silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit.\nA double-gate MOSFET was first demonstrated in 1984 by Electrotechnical Laboratory researchers Toshihiro Sekigawa and Yutaka Hayashi. The FinFET (fin field-effect transistor), a type of 3D non-planar multi-gate MOSFET, originated from the research of Digh Hisamoto and his team at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in 1989.\nImportance.\nBecause transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics, many people consider them one of the 20th century's greatest inventions.\nThe invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009. Other Milestones include the inventions of the junction transistor in 1948 and the MOSFET in 1959.\nThe MOSFET is by far the most widely used transistor, in applications ranging from computers and electronics to communications technology such as smartphones. It has been considered the most important transistor, possibly the most important invention in electronics, and the device that enabled modern electronics. It has been the basis of modern digital electronics since the late 20th century, paving the way for the digital age. The US Patent and Trademark Office calls it a \"groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world\". Its ability to be mass-produced by a highly automated process (semiconductor device fabrication), from relatively basic materials, allows astonishingly low per-transistor costs. MOSFETs are the most numerously produced artificial objects in history, with more than 13 sextillion manufactured by 2018. \nAlthough several companies each produce over a billion individually packaged (known as \"discrete\") MOS transistors every year, the vast majority are produced in integrated circuits (also known as \"ICs\", \"microchips,\" or simply \"chips\"), along with diodes, resistors, capacitors and other electronic components, to produce complete electronic circuits. A logic gate consists of up to about 20 transistors, whereas an advanced microprocessor, as of 2023, may contain as many as 134 billion transistors (and for exceptional chips, 2.6 trillion transistors, as of 2020). Transistors are often organized into logic gates in microprocessors to perform computation.\nThe transistor's low cost, flexibility and reliability have made it ubiquitous. Transistorized mechatronic circuits have replaced electromechanical devices in controlling appliances and machinery. It is often easier and cheaper to use a standard microcontroller and write a computer program to carry out a control function than to design an equivalent mechanical system.\nSimplified operation.\nA transistor can use a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals, a property called gain. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, proportional to a weaker input signal, acting as an amplifier. It can also be used as an electrically controlled switch, where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.\nThere are two types of transistors, with slight differences in how they are used:\nThe top image in this section represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. A charge flows between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base. Because the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between them. The amount of this drop, determined by the transistor's material, is referred to as \"V\"BE. (Base Emitter Voltage)\nTransistor as a switch.\nTransistors are commonly used in digital circuits as electronic switches which can be either in an \"on\" or \"off\" state, both for high-power applications such as switched-mode power supplies and for low-power applications such as logic gates. Important parameters for this application include the current switched, the voltage handled, and the switching speed, characterized by the rise and fall times.\nIn a switching circuit, the goal is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of an open circuit when off, the short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the \"off\" output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry, the resistance of the transistor in the \"on\" state is too small to affect circuitry, and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect.\nIn a grounded-emitter transistor circuit, such as the light-switch circuit shown, as the base voltage rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from the collector to the emitter. If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called \"saturation\" because the current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch is said to be \"on\".\nThe use of bipolar transistors for switching applications requires biasing the transistor so that it operates between its cut-off region in the off-state and the saturation region (\"on\"). This requires sufficient base drive current. As the transistor provides current gain, it facilitates the switching of a relatively large current in the collector by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example of a light-switch circuit, as shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor is saturated. The base resistor value is calculated from the supply voltage, transistor C-E junction voltage drop, collector current, and amplification factor beta.\nTransistor as an amplifier.\nThe common-emitter amplifier is designed so that a small change in voltage (\"V\"in) changes the small current through the base of the transistor whose current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit means that small swings in \"V\"in produce large changes in \"V\"out.\nVarious configurations of single transistor amplifiers are possible, with some providing current gain, some voltage gain, and some both.\nFrom mobile phones to televisions, vast numbers of products include amplifiers for sound reproduction, radio transmission, and signal processing. The first discrete-transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts, but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved.\nModern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred watts are common and relatively inexpensive.\nComparison with vacuum tubes.\nBefore transistors were developed, vacuum (electron) tubes (or in the UK \"thermionic valves\" or just \"valves\") were the main active components in electronic equipment.\nAdvantages.\nThe key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace vacuum tubes in most applications are\nLimitations.\nTransistors may have the following limitations:\nTypes.\nClassification.\nTransistors are categorized by\nHence, a particular transistor may be described as \"silicon, surface-mount, BJT, NPN, low-power, high-frequency switch\".\nMnemonics.\nConvenient mnemonic to remember the type of transistor (represented by an electrical symbol) involves the direction of the arrow. For the BJT, on an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor symbol, the arrow will \"Not Point iN\". On a p\u2013n\u2013p transistor symbol, the arrow \"Points iN Proudly\". However, this does not apply to MOSFET-based transistor symbols as the arrow is typically reversed (i.e. the arrow for the n\u2013p\u2013n points inside).\nField-effect transistor (FET).\nThe \"field-effect transistor\", sometimes called a \"unipolar transistor\", uses either electrons (in \"n-channel FET\") or holes (in \"p-channel FET\") for conduction. The four terminals of the FET are named \"source\", \"gate\", \"drain\", and \"body\" (\"substrate\"). On most FETs, the body is connected to the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.\nIn a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the \"source\" region to the \"drain\" region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals, hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate\u2013source voltage (VGS) is increased, the drain\u2013source current (IDS) increases exponentially for VGS below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate: (\"IDS\" \u221d (\"VGS\" \u2212 \"VT\")2, where VT is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins) in the space-charge-limited region above threshold. A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices, for example, at the 65 nm technology node.\nFor low noise at narrow bandwidth, the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous.\nFETs are divided into two families: \"junction FET\" (JFET) and \"insulated gate FET\" (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a \"metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor FET\" (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a p\u2013n diode with the channel which lies between the source and drains. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the \"depletion-mode\", they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.\nMetal\u2013semiconductor FETs (MESFETs) are JFETs in which the reverse biased p\u2013n junction is replaced by a metal\u2013semiconductor junction. These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (several GHz).\nFETs are further divided into \"depletion-mode\" and \"enhancement-mode\" types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can \"enhance\" the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can \"deplete\" the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices, while most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.\nMetal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor FET (MOSFET).\nThe metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET), also known as the metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS), is a type of field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled oxidation of a semiconductor, typically silicon. It has an insulated gate, whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor, and the basic building block of most modern electronics. The MOSFET accounts for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.\nBipolar junction transistor (BJT).\nBipolar transistors are so named because they conduct by using both majority and minority carriers. The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, is a combination of two junction diodes and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p\u2013n\u2013p transistor). This construction produces two p\u2013n junctions: a base\u2013emitter junction and a base\u2013collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region. (Two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor.)\nBJTs have three terminals, corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor\u2014an \"emitter\", a \"base\", and a \"collector\". They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current. In an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter\u2013base junction is forward-biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and the base\u2013collector junction is reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from, the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased base\u2013collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. Since the base is doped lightly (in comparison to the emitter and collector regions), recombination rates are low, permitting more carriers to diffuse across the base region. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately \u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\nUnlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base\u2013emitter voltage (\"V\"BE) is increased, the base\u2013emitter current and hence the collector\u2013emitter current (\"I\"CE) increase exponentially according to the Shockley diode model and the Ebers\u2013Moll model. Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher transconductance than the FET.\nBipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light because the absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current; the collector current is approximately \u03b2 times the photocurrent. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called phototransistors.\nUsage of MOSFETs and BJTs.\nThe MOSFET is by far the most widely used transistor for both digital circuits as well as analog circuits, accounting for 99.9% of all transistors in the world. The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) was previously the most commonly used transistor during the 1950s to 1960s. Even after MOSFETs became widely available in the 1970s, the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity, up until MOSFET devices (such as power MOSFETs, LDMOS and RF CMOS) replaced them for most power electronic applications in the 1980s. In integrated circuits, the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits in the 1970s. Discrete MOSFETs (typically power MOSFETs) can be applied in transistor applications, including analog circuits, voltage regulators, amplifiers, power transmitters, and motor drivers.\nDevice identification.\nThree major identification standards are used for designating transistor devices. In each, the alphanumeric prefix provides clues to the type of the device.\nJoint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC).\nThe JEDEC part numbering scheme evolved in the 1960s in the United States. The JEDEC \"EIA-370\" transistor device numbers usually start with \"2N\", indicating a three-terminal device. Dual-gate field-effect transistors are four-terminal devices, and begin with 3N. The prefix is followed by a two-, three- or four-digit number with no significance as to device properties, although early devices with low numbers tend to be germanium devices. For example, 2N3055 is a silicon n\u2013p\u2013n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p\u2013n\u2013p germanium switching transistor. A letter suffix, such as A, is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.\nJapanese Industrial Standard (JIS).\nIn Japan, the JIS semiconductor designation (|JIS-C-7012), labels transistor devices starting with \"2S\", e.g., 2SD965, but sometimes the 2S prefix is not marked on the package\u2013a 2SD965 might only be marked \"D965\" and a 2SC1815 might be listed by a supplier as simply \"C1815\". This series sometimes has suffixes, such as R, O, BL, standing for red, orange, blue, etc., to denote variants, such as tighter \"h\"FE (gain) groupings.\nEuropean Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA).\nThe European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA) uses a numbering scheme that was inherited from Pro Electron when it merged with EECA in 1983. This scheme begins with two letters: the first gives the semiconductor type (A for germanium, B for silicon, and C for materials like GaAs); the second letter denotes the intended use (A for diode, C for general-purpose transistor, etc.). A three-digit sequence number (or one letter and two digits, for industrial types) follows. With early devices this indicated the case type. Suffixes may be used, with a letter (e.g. C often means high \"h\"FE, such as in: BC549C) or other codes may follow to show gain (e.g. BC327-25) or voltage rating (e.g. BUK854-800A). The more common prefixes are:\nProprietary.\nManufacturers of devices may have their proprietary numbering system, for example CK722. Since devices are second-sourced, a manufacturer's prefix (like MPF in MPF102, which originally would denote a Motorola FET) now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device. Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes, for example, a PN2222A is a (possibly Fairchild Semiconductor) 2N2222A in a plastic case (but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108, not a 2N108, while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices).\nMilitary part numbers sometimes are assigned their codes, such as the British Military CV Naming System.\nManufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with \"house numbers\", identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number. For example, an HP part 1854,0053 is a (JEDEC) 2N2218 transistor which is also assigned the CV number: CV7763\nNaming problems.\nWith so many independent naming schemes, and the abbreviation of part numbers when printed on the devices, ambiguity sometimes occurs. For example, two different devices may be marked J176 (one the J176 low-power JFET, the other the higher-powered MOSFET 2SJ176).\nAs older through-hole transistors are given surface-mount packaged counterparts, they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their systems to cope with the variety in pinout arrangements and options for dual or matched n\u2013p\u2013n + p\u2013n\u2013p devices in one pack. So even when the original device (such as a 2N3904) may have been assigned by a standards authority, and well known by engineers over the years, the new versions are far from standardized in their naming.\nConstruction.\nSemiconductor material.\nThe first BJTs were made from germanium (Ge). Silicon (Si) types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high-performance versions now employ the \"compound semiconductor\" material gallium arsenide (GaAs) and the \"semiconductor alloy\" silicon\u2013germanium (SiGe). Single-element semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as \"elemental\".\nRough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the adjacent table. These parameters will vary with an increase in temperature, electric field, impurity level, strain, and sundry other factors.\nThe \"junction forward voltage\" is the voltage applied to the emitter-base junction of a BJT to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1\u00a0mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to drive the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with an increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction, the change is \u22122.1\u00a0mV/\u00b0C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes.\nThe density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel. Some impurities, called dopants, are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET, to control the MOSFET electrical behavior.\nThe \"electron mobility\" and \"hole mobility\" columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an electric field of 1\u00a0volt per meter applied across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect. However, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide:\nBecause the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n\u2013p\u2013n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p\u2013n\u2013p transistor. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the \"high-electron-mobility transistor\" (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12\u00a0GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.\nMaximum junction temperature values represent a cross-section taken from various manufacturers' datasheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged.\n\"Al\u2013Si junction\" refers to the high-speed (aluminum-silicon) metal\u2013semiconductor barrier diode, commonly known as a Schottky diode. This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a parasitic reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process. This diode can be a nuisance, but sometimes it is used in the circuit.\nPackaging.\nDiscrete transistors can be individually packaged transistors or unpackaged transistor chips.\nTransistors come in many different semiconductor packages (see image). The two main categories are \"through-hole\" (or \"leaded\"), and \"surface-mount\", also known as \"surface-mount device\" (SMD). The \"ball grid array\" (BGA) is the latest surface-mount package. It has solder balls on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power ratings.\nTransistor packages are made of glass, metal, ceramic, or plastic. The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics. Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to heat sinks for enhanced cooling. Additionally, most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure. At the other extreme, some surface-mount \"microwave\" transistors are as small as grains of sand.\nOften a given transistor type is available in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor's functions to the terminals is not: other transistor types can assign other functions to the package's terminals. Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).\nNowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages. In comparison, the list of available through-hole packages is relatively small. Here is a short list of the most common through-hole transistors packages in alphabetical order:\nATV, E-line, MRT, HRT, SC-43, SC-72, TO-3, TO-18, TO-39, TO-92, TO-126, TO220, TO247, TO251, TO262, ZTX851.\nUnpackaged transistor chips (die) may be assembled into hybrid devices. The IBM SLT module of the 1960s is one example of such a hybrid circuit module using glass passivated transistor (and diode) die. Other packaging techniques for discrete transistors as chips include \"direct chip attach\" (DCA) and \"chip-on-board\" (COB).\nFlexible transistors.\nResearchers have made several kinds of flexible transistors, including organic field-effect transistors. Flexible transistors are useful in some kinds of flexible displays and other flexible electronics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30012", "revid": "382591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30012", "title": "Time", "text": "Continuous progression from past to future\nTime is the continuous progression of existence that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future. Time dictates all forms of action, age, and causality, being a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events (or the intervals between them), and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.\nTime is primarily measured in linear spans or periods, ordered from shortest to longest. Practical, human-scale measurements of time are performed using clocks and calendars, reflecting a 24-hour day collected into a 365-day year linked to the astronomical motion of the Earth. Scientific measurements of time instead vary from Planck time at the shortest to billions of years at the longest. Measurable time is believed to have effectively begun with the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, encompassed by the chronology of the universe. Modern physics understands time to be inextricable from space within the concept of spacetime described by general relativity. Time can therefore be dilated by velocity and matter to pass faster or slower for an external observer, though this is considered negligible outside of extreme conditions, namely relativistic speeds or the gravitational pulls of black holes.\nThroughout history, time has been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science. Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and has been a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day (\"carpe diem\") and in human life spans.\nDefinition.\nThe concept of time can be complex. Multiple notions exist, and defining time in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars. Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems. Traditional definitions of time involved the observation of periodic motion such as the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, and the passage of a free-swinging pendulum. More modern systems include the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. Although these systems differ from one another, with careful measurements they can be synchronized.\nIn physics, time is a fundamental concept to define other quantities, such as velocity. To avoid a circular definition, time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\", specifically a count of repeating events such as the SI second. Although this aids in practical measurements, it does not address the essence of time. Physicists developed the concept of the spacetime continuum, where events are assigned four coordinates: three for space and one for time. Events like particle collisions, supernovas, or rocket launches have coordinates that may vary for different observers, making concepts like \"now\" and \"here\" relative. In general relativity, these coordinates do not directly correspond to the causal structure of events. Instead, the spacetime interval is calculated and classified as either space-like or time-like, depending on whether an observer exists that would say the events are separated by space or by time. Since the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers\u2014a fact first publicly demonstrated by the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment\u2014all observers will consistently agree on this definition of time as a causal relation.\nGeneral relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. In quantum mechanics, time is treated as a universal and absolute parameter, differing from general relativity's notion of independent clocks. The problem of time consists of reconciling these two theories. As of 2025, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.\nMeasurement.\nMethods of temporal measurement, or chronometry, generally take two forms. The first is a calendar, a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time on Earth, consulted for periods longer than a day. The second is a clock, a physical mechanism that indicates the passage of time, consulted for periods less than a day. The combined measurement marks a specific moment in time from a reference point, or \"epoch\".\nTime is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms.\nHistory of the calendar.\nArtifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago. Lunar calendars were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 lunar months (either 354 or 384 days). Without intercalation to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years.\nOther early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization, in which they developed the Maya calendar, consisting of multiple interrelated calendars. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based; the Haab' calendar has 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five epagomenal days at the end of the year. In conjunction, the Maya also used a 260-day sacred calendar called the Tzolk'in.\nThe reforms of Julius Caesar in 45\u00a0BC put the Roman world on a solar calendar. This Julian calendar was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical solstices and equinoxes to advance against it by about 11\u00a0minutes per year. Pope Gregory XIII introduced a correction in 1582; the Gregorian calendar was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world.\nDuring the French Revolution, a new clock and calendar were invented as part of the dechristianization of France and to create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The French Republican Calendar's days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 (duodecimal) system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.\nHistory of other devices.\nA large variety of devices have been invented to measure time. The study of these devices is called horology. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means.\nA sundial is any device that uses the direction of sunlight to cast shadows from a gnomon onto a set of markings calibrated to indicate the local time, usually to the hour. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night. Obelisks made as a gnomon were built as early as c.\u20093500 BC. An Egyptian device that dates to c.\u20091500 BC, similar in shape to a bent T-square, also measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a nonlinear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.\nAlarm clocks reportedly first appeared in ancient Greece c.\u2009250 BC with a water clock made by Plato that would set off a whistle. The hydraulic alarm worked by gradually filling a series of vessels with water. After some time, the water emptied out of a siphon. Inventor Ctesibius revised Plato's design; the water clock uses a float as the power drive system and uses a sundial to correct the water flow rate.\nIn medieval philosophical writings, the atom was a unit of time referred to as the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known occurrence in English is in Byrhtferth's \"Enchiridion\" (a science text) of 1010\u20131012, where it was defined as 1/564 of a \"momentum\" (1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u00a0minutes), and thus equal to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the \"computus\", the process of calculating the date of Easter. The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock, or \"clepsydra\", one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I. They could be used to measure the hours even at night but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The ancient Greeks and the people from Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers, in particular, made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Chinese inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism.\nIncense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in temples and churches across the globe. Water clocks, and, later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. The passage of the hours at sea can also be marked by bell. The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea. Richard of Wallingford (1292\u20131336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical orrery about 1330. The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were also used in navigation. Ferdinand Magellan used 18 glasses on each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522). The English word clock probably comes from the Middle Dutch word \"klocke\" which, in turn, derives from the medieval Latin word \"clocca\", which ultimately derives from Celtic and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean bell.\nGreat advances in accurate time-keeping were made by Galileo Galilei and especially Christiaan Huygens with the invention of pendulum-driven clocks along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi. There is also a clock that was designed to keep time for 10,000 years called the Clock of the Long Now. Alarm clock devices were later mechanized. Levi Hutchins's alarm clock has been credited as the first American alarm clock, though it can only ring at 4 a.m. Antoine Redier was also credited as the first person to patent an adjustable mechanical alarm clock in 1847. Digital forms of alarm clocks became more accessible through digitization and integration with other technologies, such as smartphones.\nThe most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years, and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments. Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the atoms used is caesium; most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations. Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. A portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards is called a chronometer. Initially, the term was used to refer to the marine chronometer, a timepiece used to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation, a precision first achieved by John Harrison. More recently, the term has also been applied to the chronometer watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency COSC.\nIn modern times, the Global Positioning System in coordination with the Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe. As of May 2010[ [update]], the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 12 attoseconds (1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221217 seconds), about 3.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01026 Planck times. The time measured was the delay caused by out-of-sync electron waves' interference patterns.\nUnits.\nThe second (s) is the SI base unit. A minute (min) is 60 seconds in length (or, rarely, 59 or 61 seconds when leap seconds are employed), and an hour is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length. A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to daylight saving time and leap seconds.\nStandards.\nA time standard is a specification for measuring time: assigning a number or calendar date to an instant (point in time), quantifying the duration of a time interval, and establishing a chronology (ordering of events). In modern times, several time specifications have been officially recognized as standards, where formerly they were matters of custom and practice. The invention in 1955 of the caesium atomic clock has led to the replacement of older and purely astronomical time standards such as sidereal time and ephemeris time, for most practical purposes, by newer time standards based wholly or partly on atomic time using the SI second.\nInternational Atomic Time (TAI) is the primary international time standard from which other time standards are calculated. Universal Time (UT1) is mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude, computed from astronomical observations. It varies from TAI because of the irregularities in Earth's rotation. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is an atomic time scale designed to approximate Universal Time. UTC differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9\u00a0second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the leap second. The Global Positioning System broadcasts a very precise time signal based on UTC time.\nThe surface of the Earth is split into a number of time zones. Standard time or civil time in a time zone deviates a fixed, round amount, usually a whole number of hours, from some form of Universal Time, usually UTC. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from UTC. For example, time zones at sea are based on UTC. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to daylight saving time transitions.\nSome other time standards are used mainly for scientific work. Terrestrial Time is a theoretical ideal scale realized by TAI. Geocentric Coordinate Time and Barycentric Coordinate Time are scales defined as coordinate times in the context of the general theory of relativity, with TCG applying to Earth's center and TCB to the solar system's barycenter. Barycentric Dynamical Time is an older relativistic scale related to TCB that is still in use.\nPhilosophy.\nReligion.\nCyclical views of time.\nMany ancient cultures, particularly in the East, had a cyclical view of time. In these traditions, time was often seen as a recurring pattern of ages or cycles, where events and phenomena repeated themselves in a predictable manner. One of the most famous examples of this concept is found in Hindu philosophy, where time is depicted as a wheel called the \"Kalachakra\" or \"Wheel of Time.\" According to this belief, the universe undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction.\nSimilarly, in other ancient cultures such as those of the Mayans, Aztecs, and Chinese, there were also beliefs in cyclical time, often associated with astronomical observations and calendars. These cultures developed complex systems to track time, seasons, and celestial movements, reflecting their understanding of cyclical patterns in nature and the universe.\nThe cyclical view of time contrasts with the linear concept of time more common in Western thought, where time is seen as progressing in a straight line from past to future without repetition.\nTime in Abrahamic religions.\nIn general, the Islamic and Judeo-Christian world-view regards time as linear and directional, beginning with the act of creation by God. The traditional Christian view sees time ending, teleologically, with the eschatological end of the present order of things, the \"end time\". Though some Christian theologians (such as Augustine of Hippo and Aquinas) believe that God is outside of time, seeing all events simultaneously, that time did not exist before God, and that God created time.\nIn the Old Testament book Ecclesiastes, traditionally ascribed to Solomon (970\u2013928 BC), time is depicted as cyclical and beyond human control. The book wrote that there is an appropriate season or time for every activity.\nTime in Greek mythology.\nThe Greek language denotes two distinct principles, Chronos and Kairos. The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally \"the right or opportune moment\", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.\nIn Greek mythology, Chronos (ancient Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) is identified as the personification of time. His name in Greek means \"time\" and is alternatively spelled Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos. Chronos is usually portrayed as an old, wise man with a long, gray beard, such as \"Father Time\". Some English words whose etymological root is khronos/chronos include \"chronology\", \"chronometer\", \"chronic\", \"anachronism\", \"synchronise\", and \"chronicle\".\nTime in Kabbalah &amp; Rabbinical thought.\nRabbis sometimes saw time like \"an accordion that was expanded and collapsed at will.\" According to Kabbalists, \"time\" is a paradox and an illusion.\nTime in Advaita Vedanta.\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, time is integral to the phenomenal world, which lacks independent reality. Time and the phenomenal world are products of \"maya\", influenced by our senses, concepts, and imaginations. The phenomenal world, including time, is seen as impermanent and characterized by plurality, suffering, conflict, and division. Since phenomenal existence is dominated by temporality (\"kala\"), everything within time is subject to change and decay. Overcoming pain and death requires knowledge that transcends temporal existence and reveals its eternal foundation.\nIn Western philosophy.\nTwo contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers. One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe\u2014a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time.\nThe opposing view is that \"time\" does not refer to any kind of \"container\" that events and objects \"move through\", nor to any entity that \"flows\", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events. This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant, holds that \"time\" is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled. Furthermore, it may be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether or not time itself is \"felt\", as a sensation, or is a judgment, is a matter of debate.\nIn philosophy, time was questioned throughout the centuries; what time is and if it is real or not. Ancient Greek philosophers asked if time was linear or cyclical and if time was endless or finite. These philosophers had different ways of explaining time; for instance, ancient Indian philosophers had something called the Wheel of Time. It is believed that there was repeating ages over the lifespan of the universe. This led to beliefs like cycles of rebirth and reincarnation. The Greek philosophers believe that the universe was infinite, and was an illusion to humans. Plato believed that time was made by the Creator at the same instant as the heavens. He also says that time is a period of motion of the heavenly bodies. Aristotle believed that time correlated to movement, that time did not exist on its own but was relative to motion of objects. He also believed that time was related to the motion of celestial bodies; the reason that humans can tell time was because of orbital periods and therefore there was a duration on time.\nThe \"Vedas\", the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy dating to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320\u00a0million years. Ancient Greek philosophers, including Parmenides and Heraclitus, wrote essays on the nature of time. Plato, in the \"Timaeus\", identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies. Aristotle, in Book IV of his \"Physica\" defined time as 'number of movement in respect of the before and after'. In Book 11 of his \"Confessions\", St. Augustine of Hippo ruminates on the nature of time, asking, \"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.\" He begins to define time by what it is not rather than what it is, an approach similar to that taken in other negative definitions. However, Augustine ends up calling time a \"distention\" of the mind (Confessions 11.26) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in memory, the present by attention, and the future by expectation.\nPhilosophers in the 17th and 18th century questioned if time was real and absolute, or if it was an intellectual concept that humans use to understand and sequence events. These questions lead to realism vs anti-realism; the realists believed that time is a fundamental part of the universe, and be perceived by events happening in a sequence, in a dimension. Isaac Newton said that we are merely occupying time, he also says that humans can only understand relative time. Isaac Newton believed in absolute space and absolute time; Leibniz believed that time and space are relational. The differences between Leibniz's and Newton's interpretations came to a head in the famous Leibniz\u2013Clarke correspondence. Relative time is a measurement of objects in motion. The anti-realists believed that time is merely a convenient intellectual concept for humans to understand events. This means that time was useless unless there were objects that it could interact with, this was called relational time. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, John Locke, and David Hume said that one's mind needs to acknowledge time, in order to understand what time is. Immanuel Kant believed that we can not know what something is unless we experience it first hand.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTime is not an empirical concept. For neither co-existence nor succession would be perceived by us, if the representation of time did not exist as a foundation \"a priori\". Without this presupposition, we could not represent to ourselves that things exist together at one and the same time, or at different times, that is, contemporaneously, or in succession.\nImmanuel Kant, \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781), trans. Vasilis Politis (London: Dent., 1991), p. 54.\nImmanuel Kant, in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\", described time as an \"a priori\" intuition that allows us (together with the other \"a priori\" intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, \"time\" does not refer to any kind of entity that \"flows,\" that objects \"move through,\" or that is a \"container\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category.\nHenri Bergson believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as \"Duration\". Duration, in Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.\nAccording to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we \"are\" time. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of \"having been\", which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \"being ahead of oneself\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future; we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.\nModern era philosophers asked: is time real or unreal, is time happening all at once or a duration, is time tensed or tenseless, and is there a future to be? There is a theory called the tenseless or B-theory; this theory says that any tensed terminology can be replaced with tenseless terminology. For example, \"we will win the game\" can be replaced with \"we do win the game\", taking out the future tense. On the other hand, there is a theory called the tense or A-theory; this theory says that our language has tense verbs for a reason and that the future can not be determined. There is also something called imaginary time, this was from Stephen Hawking, who said that space and imaginary time are finite but have no boundaries. Imaginary time is not real or unreal, it is something that is hard to visualize. Philosophers can agree that physical time exists outside of the human mind and is objective, and psychological time is mind-dependent and subjective.\nUnreality.\nIn 5th century BC Greece, Antiphon the Sophist, in a fragment preserved from his chief work \"On Truth\", held that: \"Time is not a reality (hypostasis), but a concept (no\u00eama) or a measure (metron).\" Parmenides went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the paradoxes of his follower Zeno. Time as an illusion is also a common theme in Buddhist thought.\nThese arguments often center on what it means for something to be \"unreal\". Modern physicists generally believe that time is as \"real\" as space\u2014though others, such as Julian Barbour, argue quantum equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless realm containing every possible \"now\" or momentary configuration of the universe. J. M. E. McTaggart's 1908 article \"The Unreality of Time\" argues that, since every event has the characteristic of being both present and not present (i.e., future or past), that time is a self-contradictory idea.\nAnother modern philosophical theory called presentism views the past and the future as human-mind interpretations of movement instead of real parts of time (or \"dimensions\") which coexist with the present. This theory rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present as tangible. This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel. This contrasts with eternalism (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the growing block theory (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).\nPhysical definition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUntil Einstein's reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space in 1907, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event. Non-relativistic classical mechanics is based on this Newtonian idea of time. Einstein, in his special theory of relativity, postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers. He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.\nThe theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in Minkowski spacetime, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a light-year is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two events in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an \"invariant interval\", which can be either space-like, light-like, or time-like. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any frame of reference, there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the \"invariant interval\" between the events is independent of the observer and their velocity.\nArrow of time.\nUnlike space, where an object can travel in the opposite directions (and in 3 dimensions), time appears to have only one dimension and only one direction\u2014the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet most laws of physics allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. There are only a few physical phenomena that violate the reversibility of time. This time directionality is known as the arrow of time. Acknowledged examples of the arrow of time are:\nThe relationships between these different arrows of time is a hotly debated topic in theoretical physics.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that entropy must increase over time. Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in a similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.\nClassical mechanics.\nIn non-relativistic classical mechanics, Newton's concept of \"relative, apparent, and common time\" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. The 1860s Maxwell's equations described that light always travels at a constant speed (in a vacuum). However, classical mechanics assumed that motion was measured relative to a fixed reference frame. The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment contradicted the assumption. Einstein later proposed a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the conclusion that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.\nSpacetime.\nTime has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in Einstein's special relativity and general relativity. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the spatial reference frame of the observer, and the human perception, as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks, are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.\nOn the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the past is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the future is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.\nDilation.\nEinstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and effect, measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic particles exist for a well-known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest.\nAccording to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \"warped\") by high-speed motion.\nEinstein (\"The Meaning of Relativity\"): \"Two events taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously.\" Einstein wrote in his book, \"Relativity\", that simultaneity is also relative, i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.\nAccording to general relativity, time also runs slower in stronger gravitational fields; this is gravitational time dilation. The effect of the dilation becomes more noticeable in a mass-dense object. A famous example of time dilation is a thought experiment of a subject approaching the event horizon of a black hole. As a consequence of how gravitational fields warp spacetime, the subject will experience gravitational time dilation. From the perspective of the subject itself, they will experience time normally. Meanwhile, an observer from the outside will see the subject move closer to the black hole until the extreme, in which the subject appears 'frozen' in time and eventually fades to nothingness due to the diminishing amount of light returning.\nRelativistic versus Newtonian.\nThe animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the Galilean and Lorentz transformations applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively. In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory (\"world line\") of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer.\nIn the Newtonian description these changes are such that \"time\" is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer). However, in the relativistic description the \"observability of events\" is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the \"light cone\" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of \"absolute time\" is no longer applicable: events move up and down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.\nQuantization.\nTime quantization refers to the theory that time has a smallest possible unit. Time quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories like the Standard Model of particle physics and general relativity time is not quantized. Planck time (~ 5.4 \u00d7 10\u221244 seconds) is the unit of time in the system of natural units known as Planck units. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Though tentative physical theories that attempt to describe phenomena at this scale exist; an example is loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity suggests that time is quantized; if gravity is quantized, spacetime is also quantized.\nTravel.\nTime travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal \"flow\" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) \"persist\" in some way. Time travel has been a plot device in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards or forwards in time has never been verified as a process, and doing so presents many theoretical problems and contradictory logic which to date have not been overcome. Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a time machine.\nA central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of causality; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a temporal paradox. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between branch points, parallel realities, or universes. The many-worlds interpretation has been used as a way to solve causality paradoxes arising from time travel. Any quantum event creates another branching timeline, and all possible outcomes coexist without any wave function collapse. This interpretation was an alternative but is opposite from the Copenhagen interpretation, which suggests that wave functions do collapse. In science, hypothetical faster-than-light particles are known as tachyons; the mathematics of Einstein's relativity suggests that they would have an \"imaginary rest mass\". Some interpretations suggest that it might move backward in time. General relativity permits the existence of closed timelike curves, which could allow an observer to travel back in time to the same space. Though for the G\u00f6del metric, such an occurrence requires a globally rotating universe, which has been contradicted by observations of the redshifts of distant galaxies and the cosmic background radiation. However, it has been suggested that a slowly rotating universe model may solve the Hubble tension, so it can not yet be ruled out.\nAnother solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. A famous example is the grandfather paradox, in which a person is supposed to travel back in time to kill their own grandfather. This would not be possible to enact because it is a historical fact that one's grandfather was not killed before his child (one's parent) was conceived. This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in their past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. The Novikov self-consistency principle asserts that due to causality constraints, time travel to the past is impossible.\nPerception.\nThe specious present refers to the time duration wherein one's perceptions are considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be 'specious' in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The term \"specious present\" was first introduced by the psychologist E. R. Clay, and later developed by William James.\nBiopsychology.\nThe brain's judgment of time is known to be a highly distributed system, including at least the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia as its components. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping. Mental chronometry is the use of response time in perceptual-motor tasks to infer the content, duration, and temporal sequencing of cognitive operations. Judgments of time can be altered by temporal illusions (like the kappa effect), age, psychoactive drugs, and hypnosis. The sense of time is impaired in some people with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and attention deficit disorder.\nPsychoactive drugs can impair the judgment of time. Stimulants can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals, while depressants can have the opposite effect. The level of activity in the brain of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine may be the reason for this. Such chemicals will either excite or inhibit the firing of neurons in the brain, with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the occurrence of more events within a given interval (speed up time) and a decreased firing rate reducing the brain's capacity to distinguish events occurring within a given interval (slow down time).\nPsychologists assert that time seems to go faster with age, but the literature on this age-related perception of time remains controversial. Those who support this notion argue that young people, having more excitatory neurotransmitters, are able to cope with faster external events. Some also argued that the perception of time is also influenced by memory and how much one have experienced; for example, as one get older, they will have spent less part of their total life waiting a month. Meanwhile, children's expanding cognitive abilities allow them to understand time in a different way. Two- and three-year-olds' understanding of time is mainly limited to \"now and not now\". Five- and six-year-olds can grasp the ideas of past, present, and future. Seven- to ten-year-olds can use clocks and calendars. Socioemotional selectivity theory proposed that when people perceive their time as open-ended and nebulous, they focus more on future-oriented goals.\nSpatial conceptualization.\nAlthough time is regarded as an abstract concept, there is increasing evidence that time is conceptualized in the mind in terms of space. That is, instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such. Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal events in a specific way. This spatial representation of time is often represented in the mind as a mental timeline (MTL). These origins are shaped by many environmental factors. Literacy appears to play a large role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/writing direction provides an everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture. In Western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and the future on the right) since people mostly read and write from left to right. Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with the future progressing toward the right. Conversely, speakers of Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and Hebrew read from right to left, and their MTLs unfold leftward (past on the right with future on the left); evidence suggests these speakers organize time events in their minds like this as well.\nThere is also evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization, often based on environmental features. A study of the indigenous Yupno people of Papua New Guinea found that they may use an allocentric MTL, in which time flows uphill; when speaking of the past, individuals gestured downhill, where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean. When speaking of the future, they gestured uphill, toward the source of the river. This was common regardless of which direction the person faced. A similar study of the Pormpuraawans, an aboriginal group in Australia, reported that when they were asked to organize photos of a man aging \"in order,\" individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the east and the oldest photos to the west, regardless of which direction they faced. This directly clashed with an American group that consistently organized the photos from left to right. Therefore, this group also appears to have an allocentric MTL, but based on the cardinal directions instead of geographical features. The wide array of distinctions in the way different groups think about time leads to the broader question that different groups may also think about other abstract concepts in different ways as well, such as causality and number.\nUse.\nIn sociology and anthropology, time discipline is the general name given to social and economic rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the social currency and awareness of time measurements, and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others. Arlie Russell Hochschild and Norbert Elias have written on the use of time from a sociological perspective.\nThe use of time is an important issue in understanding human behavior, education, and travel behavior. Time-use research is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20\u201330 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.\nTime management is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.\nSequence of events.\nA sequence of events, or series of events, is a sequence of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with causality relationships among the items. Because of causality, cause precedes effect, or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause. A sequence of events can be presented in text, tables, charts, or timelines. The description of the items or events may include a timestamp. A sequence of events that includes the time along with place or location information to describe a sequential path may be referred to as a world line.\nUses of a sequence of events include stories, historical events (chronology), directions and steps in procedures, and timetables for scheduling activities. A sequence of events may also be used to help describe processes in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., plans, schedules, procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines (cam timer), documentaries (\"Seconds From Disaster\"), law (choice of law), finance (directional-change intrinsic time), computer simulation (discrete event simulation), and electric power transmission (sequence of events recorder). A specific example of a sequence of events is the timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.\nSee also.\nOrganizations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Tifinagh is descended from the ancient Libyco-Berber alphabet. The traditional Tifinagh, sometimes called Tuareg Tifinagh, is still favored by the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert in southern Algeria, northeastern Mali, northern Niger, and northern Burkina Faso for writing the Tuareg languages. Neo-Tifinagh is an alphabet developed by the Berber Academy by adopting Tuareg Tifinagh for use for Kabyle; it has been since modified for use across North Africa.\nTifinagh is one of three major competing Berber orthographies alongside the Berber Latin alphabet and the Arabic alphabet. Tifinagh is the official script for Tamazight, an official language of Morocco and Algeria. Outside of symbolic cultural uses, Latin remains the dominant script for writing Berber languages throughout North Africa.\nThe ancient Libyco-Berber script was used by the ancient northern Berbers known as Libyco-Berbers, also known as Numidians, Afri, and Mauretanians, who inhabited the northern parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and the Canary Islands.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tifinagh\" (singular \"tafin\u0259q\" &lt; *ta-fin\u0259\u0263-t) is thought by some scholars to be a Berberized feminine plural cognate or adaptation of the Latin word \"Punicus\" 'Punic, Phoenician' through the Berber feminine prefix \"ti-\" and the root \u221aFN\u0194 &lt; *\u221aPNQ &lt; Latin \"Punicus\"; thus \"tifinagh\" could possibly mean 'the Phoenician (letters)' or 'the Punic letters'. Others support an etymology involving the Tuareg verb \"efnegh\" 'to write'.\nLibyco-Berber.\nBefore or during the existence of the ancient Berber kingdoms of Numidia (northern Algeria) and Mauretania (northern Morocco), between 202 BCE\u201325 BCE, many inscriptions were engraved using the Libyco-Berber script, also known as Ancient Libyan (). The Libyco-Berber script is found in thousands of stone inscriptions and engravings throughout Morocco, northern Algeria, Tunisia, northern Libya and the Canary Islands.\nThe exact evolution of both Libyco-Berber and Tifinagh is still unclear. The latter writing system was widely used in antiquity by speakers of the largely undeciphered Numidian language, also called Old Libyan, throughout Africa and on the Canary Islands. The script's origin is uncertain, with some scholars suggesting it is related to, descended or developed from the Phoenician alphabet while others argue an independent conception with slight Phoenician influences. Its first appearance is also uncertain, but it is no older than the first millennium BCE, with the oldest remains likely originating from the 6th century BCE. It disappeared in the northernmost areas of North Africa during the 8th century, after the Arab conquest of the Maghreb, Libyco-Berber along with Latin being replaced by the Arabic script.\nThe Libyco-Berber script was a pure abjad; it had no vowels. Gemination was not marked. The writing was usually from the bottom to the top, although right-to-left, and even other orders, were also found. The letters took different forms when written vertically than when they were written horizontally.\nThis \"libyque\" script had two forms. The undeciphered Western form was used along the Mediterranean coast from Kabylia to Morocco and probably the Canary Islands. The Eastern form was used in Constantine, Aur\u00e8s, and Tunisia. 22 out of 24 letters in the Eastern form have been deciphered thanks to Punic-Libyc bilingual inscriptions.\nSaharan Tifinagh.\nAndries (2004) identifies an additional phase of evolution called \"Saharan Tifinagh\" (). He reports that this variety is also known as Libyco-Berber () or Old Tuareg (); this would put into doubt the use of the term \"Libyco-Berber\" in the section above.\nThis phase shows some new letters relative to \"libyque\", most notably a vertical line to denote the final vowel /a/. It was used to write Old Tuareg, but is not well-understood. The youngest inscriptions in this scheme are probably around 200 years old.\nEarly uses of Tifinagh have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres. Among these are the 1,500 year old monumental tomb of the Tuareg matriarch Tin Hinan, where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.\nTuareg Tifinagh.\nThe Saharan script branched into the Tuareg Tifinagh scripts which is used to this day to write the Berber Tuareg languages, which belong to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family. \nAccording to M. C. A. MacDonald, the Tuareg are \"an entirely oral society in which memory and oral communication perform all the functions which reading and writing have in a literate society\u00a0... The Tifinagh are used primarily for games and puzzles, short graffiti and brief messages.\"\nWithin Tuareg Tifinagh, there is some divergence in the shape and number of signs, but this difference is small enough to not impact mutual intelligibility.\nOccasionally, the script has been used to write other neighbouring languages such as Tagdal, which belongs to a separate Songhay family.\nOrthography.\nCommon forms of the letters are illustrated at left, including various ligatures of \"t\" and \"n\". Gemination, though phonemic, is not indicated in Tifinagh. The letter \"t\", \u2d5c, is often combined with a preceding letter to form a ligature. Most of the letters have more than one common form, including mirror-images of the forms shown above.\nWhen the letters \"l\" and \"n\" are adjacent to themselves or to each other, the second is offset, either by inclining, lowering, raising, or shortening it. For example, since the letter \"l\" is a double line, ||, and \"n\" a single line, |, the sequence \"nn\" may be written |/ to differentiate it from \"l\". Similarly, \"ln\" is ||/, \"nl\" |//, \"ll\" ||//, \"nnn\" |/|, etc.\nTraditionally, the Tifinagh script does not indicate vowels except word-finally, where a single dot stands for any vowel (or \u2d62 and \u2d53 for -i and -u, respectively, in Ahaggar Tifinagh). In some areas, Arabic vowel diacritics are combined with Tifinagh letters to transcribe vowels, or \"y, w\" may be used for long \"\u012b\" and \"\u016b\".\nNeo-Tifinagh.\nDevelopment.\nNeo-Tifinagh is the modern fully alphabetic script developed by the Berber Academy, based in Paris.\nInitially, the academy had to choose a script to transliterate the Berber language. The choice between Tifinagh and Latin scripts then sparked intense debate both within and outside the Academy.\nMohand Arav Bessaoud, a founding member of the academy and strong Tifinagh advocate, recounted the resistance he faced from prominent figures like Mouloud Mammeri and Ramdane Achab, who argued that Tifinagh was archaic, obsolete, non-cursive, and impractical. Despite the criticism, Bessaoud persisted in promoting Tifinagh.\"Achab Ramdane opposed my actions, calling it rekindling extinguished embers\" - Said Bessaouad \nEfforts to promote Tifinagh.\nIn 1970, a meeting took place to decide on a system of writing. Influenced by Mahdjoubi Ahardane, Bessaoud opted for Tifinagh. Ahardane argued that Tifinagh was not merely a script but a testament to Berber history and identity. Further steps were taken afterwards regarding the standardization of the script.\nBy 1973, Ammar Negadi, a prominent Chaoui writer and fervent advocate of the Tifinagh script was elected secretary general of the Berber Academy, (now called Agraw Imazighen) in the Paris region. He propagated the academy's publications and cultural activities.\nNegadi reflected on his efforts: \"I distributed all of Agraw Imazighen's writings throughout the Aur\u00e8s region starting in 1973. The goal wasn't regular correspondence but widespread dissemination of Tifinagh.\" Neo-Tifinagh was spread by the Berber Academy's active promotion of the script, including its usage in their bulletin, \"Imazighen\", which was widely read by Berber communities in Algeria and Morocco.\nThe official activities of the Berber Academy ceased when Mohand Bessaoud Arav was imprisoned.\nBy 1980, Negadi founded his spin-off organization UPA (Amazigh People's Union), which published a bulletin in both Latin and Tifinagh, called \"Azaghen/Link\". He remained convinced that Tifinagh was the best graphical tool to express Berber language and culture, seeing it as part of the cultural heritage and identity to be defended.\nThe UPA bulletins continued to promote the Tifinagh alphabet, while activist Messaoud Nedjahi streamlined its characters from 50 to 26. This process inspired the Afus Deg Fus association to create the first set of standardized Neo-Tifinagh fonts in 1993.\nNeo-Tifinagh has since undergone further reform and is used in various contexts throughout North Africa. The Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture has standardized Neo-Tifinagh for use as the official orthography of Standard Moroccan Amazigh, an official language of Morocco.\nPolitical history.\nThe promotion of Neo-Tifinagh by the Berber Academy and Ammar Negadi's UPA was part of the efforts to spread Berberism throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The use of Neo-Tifinagh in their publications was influential in raising Berber consciousness; one reader has described its effect as being \"the proof that we actually existed.\"\nThe Moroccan state arrested and imprisoned people using Neo-Tifinagh during the 1980s and 1990s. The Algerian Black Spring was also partly caused by this repression of Berber language.\nIn the 1980s, the Berber flag, which was designed in 1970 and uses the Tifinagh letter \"z\" (Tifinagh: \u2d63) from the root of \"Amazigh\", began being used in demonstrations. The flag was adopted by the World Amazigh Congress in 1997.\nIn Morocco, following the creation of Standard Moroccan Amazigh in 2001, the 2003 adoption of Neo-Tifinagh served as a way to compromise between the deeply split proponents of the Latin script versus the Arabic script as Amazigh's official orthography. This choice, however, has also resulted in backlash from many Amazigh activists, who find Tifinagh to be limiting when compared to the Latin script.\nIn Libya, the government of Muammar Gaddafi consistently banned Tifinagh from being used in public contexts such as store displays and banners. After the Libyan Civil War, the National Transitional Council has shown an openness towards the Berber language. The rebel Libya TV, based in Qatar, has included the Berber language and the Neo-Tifinagh alphabet in some of its programming.\nTifinagh continues to be used as \"an emblem of distinctive Berber identity and nationhood.\"\nModern use.\nDue to the official adoption of Neo-Tifinagh in Morocco in 2003, the script has been adapted by the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture for modern digital use. Government websites in Morocco may be displayed in Neo-Tifinagh.\nStarting in 2003, Neo-Tifinagh was used for a small duration of Moroccan elementary school to teach Standard Moroccan Amazigh. However, practical use of Tifinagh in Morocco remains rare; one Amazigh activist has summarized the situation with the anecdote that he \"[knows] that some books that were written in Tifinagh were read by only two people ... the one who wrote the book and the one who did the editing!\" Public displays of Tifinagh in Morocco remains restricted primarily to signage and other culturally conspicuous uses.\nDespite Neo-Tifinagh's Algerian origins through the Berber Academy and UPA, the Latin alphabet became the predominant used script. Debate in what script to use for Berber languages tends to view the Latin and Arabic scripts as the primary options.\nAs of 2012, Tifinagh is \"not widely used in education or the media in any country.\"\nOther modifications.\nThe Andries (2004) submission of Tifinagh (including Neo-Tifinagh) to the Unicode Consortium also notes that Neo-Tifinagh is not the only variant that tries to introduce vowels into Tifinagh. The other schemes include APT (a scheme of additional signs), SIL, Hawad (a scheme of diacritics), Rissa Ixa, Arabic semi-vowels used among the Kel Antessar (Niger), Arabic diacritics used in Timbuktu, and \"Latin-like\" diacritics proposed by Chaker. None of these have enjoyed as much backing as Neo-Tifinagh.\nLetters.\nTuareg Tifinagh letters.\nThere are not one, but several Tuareg scripts with slightly different assignments for each letter. Nesmenser (2023) has documented many different forms of the script, including a list of \"ancient Temahuq Tifinagh\" as used across the Sahara. The following is based on Mohamed Aghali-Zakara (1993), which was in turn quoted in both Andries (2004; Unicode Submission) and Casajus (2011):\nNeo-Tifinagh letters.\nThe following are the letters of Neo-Tifinagh, as listed in a 2004 submission to the Unicode Consortium:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnicode.\nTifinagh was added to the Unicode Standard in March 2005, with the release of version 4.1.\nThe Unicode block range for Tifinagh is U+2D30\u2013U+2D7F:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30018", "revid": "24914062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30018", "title": "Turkic languages", "text": "Language family of Eurasia\nThe Turkic languages are a language family of more than 35 documented languages spoken by the Turkic peoples of Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe to Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia (Siberia), and West Asia. The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning from Mongolia to Northwest China, where Proto-Turkic is thought to have been spoken, and from where they expanded to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium. They are characterized as a dialect continuum.\nTurkic languages are spoken by some 200 million people. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish, spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans; its native speakers account for about 38% of all Turkic speakers, followed by Uzbek.\nCharacteristic features such as vowel harmony, agglutination, subject-object-verb order, and lack of grammatical gender, are almost universal within the Turkic family. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility, upon moderate exposure, among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Chaharmahali Turkic, Gagauz, and Balkan Gagauz, as well as Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Other Turkic languages demonstrate varying amounts of mutual intelligibility within their subgroups as well. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided into two branches: Oghur, of which the only surviving member is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages.\nTurkic languages show many similarities with the Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, and Japonic languages. These similarities have led some linguists (such as Turkologist Tal\u00e2t Tekin) to propose an Altaic language family, though this proposal is widely rejected by historical linguists. Similarities with the Uralic languages even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the Ural-Altaic hypothesis. However, there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies. The shared characteristics between the languages are attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact.\nDecember 15 is declared as \"World Turkic Language Family Day\" by UNESCO. On 15 December 1893, Orkhon Inscriptions, one of the first Turkic texts were decrypted.\nCharacteristics.\nTurkic languages are null-subject languages, have vowel harmony (with the notable exception of Uzbek due to strong Persian-Tajik influence), converbs, extensive agglutination by means of suffixes and postpositions, and lack of grammatical articles, noun classes, and grammatical gender. Subject\u2013object\u2013verb word order is universal within the family. In terms of the level of vowel harmony in the Turkic language family, Tuvan is characterized as almost fully harmonic whereas Uzbek is the least harmonic or not harmonic at all. Taking into account the documented historical-linguistic development of Turkic languages overall, both inscriptional and textual, the family provides over one millennium of documented stages as well as scenarios in the linguistic evolution of vowel harmony which, in turn, demonstrates harmony evolution along a confidently definable trajectory Though vowel harmony is a common characteristic of major language families spoken in Inner Eurasia (Mongolic, Tungusic, Uralic and Turkic), the type of harmony found in them differs from each other; specifically, Uralic and Turkic have a shared type of vowel harmony (called \"palatal vowel harmony\") whereas Mongolic and Tungusic represent a different type.\nHistory.\nPre-history.\nThe homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language is suggested to be somewhere between the Transcaspian steppe and Northeastern Asia (Manchuria), with genetic evidence pointing to the region near South Siberia and Mongolia as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity. Similarly several linguists, including Juha Janhunen, Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that modern-day Mongolia is the homeland of the early Turkic language. Relying on Proto-Turkic lexical items about the climate, topography, flora, fauna, people's modes of subsistence, Turkologist Peter Benjamin Golden locates the Proto-Turkic Urheimat in the southern, taiga-steppe zone of the Sayan-Altay region.\nExtensive contact took place between Proto-Turks and Proto-Mongols approximately during the first millennium BC; the shared cultural tradition between the two Eurasian nomadic groups is called the \"Turco-Mongol\" tradition. The two groups shared a similar religion system, Tengrism, and there exists a multitude of evident loanwords between Turkic languages and Mongolic languages. Although the loans were bidirectional, today Turkic loanwords constitute the largest foreign component in Mongolian vocabulary.\nItalian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider it an independent Chuvash family similar to Uralic and Turkic languages. Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for the classification purposes.\nSome lexical and extensive typological similarities between Turkic and the nearby Tungusic and Mongolic families, as well as the Korean and Japonic families has in more recent years been instead attributed to prehistoric contact amongst the group, sometimes referred to as the Northeast Asian sprachbund. A more recent (circa first millennium BC) contact between \"core Altaic\" (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic) is distinguished from this, due to the existence of definitive common words that appear to have been mostly borrowed from Turkic into Mongolic, and later from Mongolic into Tungusic, as Turkic borrowings into Mongolic significantly outnumber Mongolic borrowings into Turkic, and Turkic and Tungusic do not share any words that do not also exist in Mongolic.\nTurkic languages also show some Chinese loanwords that point to early contact during the time of Proto-Turkic.\nEarly written records.\nThe first established records of the Turkic languages are the eighth century AD Orkhon inscriptions by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, recording the Old Turkic language, which were discovered in 1889 in the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia. The \"Compendium of the Turkic Dialects\" (\"Div\u00e2n\u00fc L\u00fcgati't-T\u00fcrk\"), written during the 11th century AD by Ka\u015fgarl\u0131 Mahmud of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, constitutes an early linguistic treatment of the family. The \"Compendium\" is the first comprehensive dictionary of the Turkic languages and also includes the first known map of the Turkic speakers' geographical distribution. It mainly pertains to the Southwestern branch of the family.\nThe Codex Cumanicus (12th\u201313th centuries AD) concerning the Northwestern branch is another early linguistic manual, between the Kipchak language and Latin, used by the Catholic missionaries sent to the Western Cumans inhabiting a region corresponding to present-day Hungary and Romania. The earliest records of the language spoken by Volga Bulgars, debatably the parent or a distant relative of Chuvash language, are dated to the 13th\u201314th centuries AD.\nGeographical expansion and development.\nWith the Turkic expansion during the Early Middle Ages (c.\u00a06th\u201311th centuries AD), Turkic languages, in the course of just a few centuries, spread across Central Asia, from Siberia to the Mediterranean. Various terminologies from the Turkic languages have passed into Persian, Urdu, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Mongolian, Hungarian and to a lesser extent, Arabic.\nThe geographical distribution of Turkic-speaking peoples across Eurasia since the Ottoman era ranges from the North-East of Siberia to Turkey in the West.\nFor centuries, the Turkic-speaking peoples have migrated extensively and intermingled continuously, and their languages have been influenced mutually and through contact with the surrounding languages, especially the Iranian, Slavic, and Mongolic languages.\nThis has obscured the historical developments within each language and/or language group, and as a result, there exist several systems to classify the Turkic languages. The modern genetic classification schemes for Turkic are still largely indebted to Samoilovich (1922).\nThe Turkic languages may be divided into six branches:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn this classification, Oghur Turkic is also referred to as Lir-Turkic, and the other branches are subsumed under the title of Shaz-Turkic or Common Turkic. It is not clear when these two major types of Turkic can be assumed to have diverged.\nWith less certainty, the Southwestern, Northwestern, Southeastern and Oghur groups may further be summarized as West Turkic, the Northeastern, Kyrgyz-Kipchak, and Arghu (Khalaj) groups as East Turkic.\nGeographically and linguistically, the languages of the Northwestern and Southeastern subgroups belong to the central Turkic languages, while the Northeastern and Khalaj languages are the so-called peripheral languages.\nHruschka, et al. (2014) use computational phylogenetic methods to calculate a tree of Turkic based on phonological sound changes.\nSchema.\nThe following isoglosses are traditionally used in the classification of the Turkic languages:\nAdditional isoglosses include:\nMembers.\nThe following table is based mainly upon the classification scheme presented by Lars Johanson.\nVocabulary comparison.\nThe following is a brief comparison of cognates among the basic vocabulary across the Turkic language family (about 60 words). Despite being cognates, some of the words may denote a different meaning.\nEmpty cells do not necessarily imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem and is not cognate with the other words in the row or that a loanword is used in its place.\nAlso, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the \"Common meaning\" given is only approximate. In some cases, the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for \"fire\" is the Persian-derived \"ate\u015f\", whereas the native \"od\" is not in use in the standard language anymore). Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.\nAzerbaijani \"\u01dd\" and \"\u00e4\": IPA /\u00e6/\nAzerbaijani \"q\": IPA /g/, word-final \"q\": IPA /x/\nTurkish and Azerbaijani \"\u0131\", Karakhanid \"\u0268\", Turkmen \"y\", and Sakha \"\u00ef\": IPA /\u026f/\nTurkmen \"\u0148\", Karakhanid \"\u014b\": IPA /\u014b/\nTurkish and Azerbaijani \"y\",Turkmen \"\u00fd\" and \"j\" in other languages: IPA /j/\nAll \"\u015f\" and \"\u0161\" letters: IPA /\u0283/\nAll \"\u00e7\" and \"\u010d\" letters: IPA /t\u0361\u0283/\nKyrgyz \"c\": IPA /d\u0361\u0292/\nKazakh \"j\": IPA /\u0292/\nOther possible relations.\nThe Turkic language family is currently regarded as one of the world's primary language families. Turkic is one of the main members of the controversial Altaic language family, but Altaic currently lacks support from a majority of linguists. None of the theories linking Turkic languages to other families have a wide degree of acceptance at present. Shared features with languages grouped together as Altaic have been interpreted by most mainstream linguists to be the result of a sprachbund.\nRejected or controversial theories.\nKorean.\nThe possibility of a genetic relation between Turkic and Koreanic, independently from Altaic, is suggested by some linguists. The linguist Kabak (2004) of the University of W\u00fcrzburg states that Turkic and Korean share similar phonology as well as morphology. Li Yong-S\u014fng (2014) suggest that there are several cognates between Turkic and Old Korean. He states that these supposed cognates can be useful to reconstruct the early Turkic language. According to him, words related to nature, earth and ruling but especially to the sky and stars seem to be cognates.\nThe linguist Choi suggested already in 1996 a close relationship between Turkic and Korean regardless of any Altaic connections:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In addition, the fact that the morphological elements are not easily borrowed between languages, added to the fact that the common morphological elements between Korean and Turkic are not less numerous than between Turkic and other Altaic languages, strengthens the possibility that there is a close genetic affinity between Korean and Turkic.\u2014\u200a\nMany historians also point out a close non-linguistic relationship between Turkic peoples and Koreans. Especially close were the relations between the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and Goguryeo.\nUralic.\nSome linguists suggested a relation to Uralic languages, especially to the Ugric languages. This view is rejected and seen as obsolete by mainstream linguists. Similarities are because of language contact and borrowings mostly from Turkic into Ugric languages. Stachowski (2015) states that any relation between Turkic and Uralic must be a contact one.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30019", "revid": "1329099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30019", "title": "The Sound of Music", "text": "Musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein, premiered in 1959\nThe Sound of Music is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, and a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. It is based on the 1949 book \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\" by Maria von Trapp. Set in Austria on the eve of the \"Anschluss\" in 1938, the musical tells the story of Maria, who takes a job as governess to a large family while she decides whether to become a nun. She falls in love with the children, and eventually their widowed father, Captain von Trapp. He is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy, but he opposes the Nazis. He and Maria decide on a plan to flee Austria with the children. Many songs from the musical have become standards, including \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"Edelweiss\", \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\", and the title song \"The Sound of Music\".\nThe original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened in 1959 and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, out of nine nominations. The first London production opened at the Palace Theatre in 1961. The show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a 1965 film starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. \"The Sound of Music\" was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, as Oscar Hammerstein died of stomach cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.\nHistory.\nAfter viewing \"The Trapp Family\", a 1956 West German film about the Trapp family, and its 1958 sequel (\"The Trapp Family in America\"), stage director Vincent J. Donehue thought that the project would be perfect for his friend Mary Martin; Broadway producers Leland Hayward and Richard Halliday (Martin's husband) agreed. The producers originally envisioned a non-musical play that would be written by Lindsay and Crouse and that would feature songs from the repertoire of the Trapp Family Singers. Then they decided to add an original song or two, perhaps by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But it was soon agreed that the project should feature all new songs and be a musical rather than a play.\nDetails of the history of the von Trapp family were altered for the musical. The real Georg von Trapp did live with his family in a villa in Aigen, a suburb of Salzburg. He wrote to the Nonnberg Abbey in 1926 asking for a nun to help tutor his sick daughter, and the Mother Abbess sent Maria. His wife, Agathe Whitehead, had died in 1922. The real Maria and Georg married at the Nonnberg Abbey in 1927. Lindsay and Crouse altered the story so that Maria was governess to all of the children, whose names and ages were changed, as was Maria's original surname (the show used \"Rainer\" instead of \"Kutschera\"). The von Trapps spent some years in Austria after Maria and the Captain married and he was offered a commission in Germany's navy. Since von Trapp opposed the Nazis by that time, the family left Austria after the \"Anschluss\", going by train to Italy and then traveling on to London and the United States. To make the story more dramatic, Lindsay and Crouse had the family, soon after Maria's and the Captain's wedding, escape over the mountains to Switzerland on foot.\nSynopsis.\nAct I.\nIn Salzburg, Federal State of Austria, just before World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the \"Dixit Dominus\". One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (\"The Sound of Music\"). She returns late to the abbey where the Mother Abbess and the other nuns have been considering what to do about the free-spirit (\"Maria\"). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (\"My Favorite Things\"). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is suited for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.\nMaria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain's call. They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (\"Do-Re-Mi\").\nRolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the eldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\"). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings \"The Lonely Goatherd\" to distract them.\nCaptain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schraeder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (\"How Can Love Survive\"). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with \"Heil\". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that the children need him to show his love for them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing \"The Sound of Music\", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schraeder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.\nThe Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the \"Anschluss\" (the Nazi German annexation of Austria). Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the L\u00e4ndler. When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song (\"So Long, Farewell\"). Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzburg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.\nAt the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\").\nAct II.\nMax teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing \"My Favorite Things\" but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with the Captain about the imminent \"Anschluss\", trying to convince him that it is inevitable (\"No Way to Stop It\"). When he refuses to compromise on his opposition to it, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be \"An Ordinary Couple\". As they marry, the nuns reprise \"Maria\" against the wedding processional.\nWhile Maria and the Captain are on their honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzburg Festival. Herr Zeller, the \"Gauleiter\" of the region, demands to know why they are not flying the Flag of Nazi Germany now that the \"Anschluss\" has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of the Nazi German occupation, the Captain decides the children should not sing at the event. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)\"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.\nAt the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of \"Do-Re-Mi\", Max brings out the Captain's guitar. Captain von Trapp sings \"Edelweiss\", as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria's national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family's last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing \"So Long, Farewell\" (reprise), leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren't there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\".\nMusical numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProductions.\nOriginal productions.\n\"The Sound of Music\" premiered at New Haven's Shubert Theatre where it played an eight-performance tryout in October and November 1959 before another short tryout in Boston. The musical then opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 16, 1959, moved to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on November 6, 1962, and closed on June 15, 1963, after 1,443 performances. The director was Vincent J. Donehue, and the choreographer was Joe Layton. The original cast included Mary Martin as Maria, Theodore Bikel as Captain Georg von Trapp, Patricia Neway as Mother Abbess, Kurt Kasznar as Max Detweiler, Marion Marlowe as Elsa Schraeder, Brian Davies as Rolf, Lauri Peters as Liesl and Muriel O'Malley as Sister Margaretta. Patricia Brooks, June Card and Tatiana Troyanos were ensemble members in the original production. The show tied for the Tony Award for Best Musical with \"Fiorello!\". Other awards included Martin for Best Actress in a Musical, Neway for Best Featured Actress, Best Scenic Design (Oliver Smith) and Best Conductor And Musical Director (Frederick Dvonch). Bikel and Kasznar were nominated for acting awards, and Donehue was nominated for his direction. The entire children's cast was nominated for Best Featured Actress category as a single nominee, even though two of the children were boys.\nMartha Wright replaced Martin in the role of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962 and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who later married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf from September 1961 to June 1962. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: \"I promised myself then that if I could afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again.\"\nThe musical premiered in London's West End at the Palace Theatre on May 18, 1961, and ran for 2,385 performances. It was directed by Jerome Whyte and used the original New York choreography, supervised by Joe Layton, and the original sets designed by Oliver Smith. The cast included Jean Bayless as Maria, followed by Sonia Rees, Roger Dann as Captain von Trapp, Constance Shacklock as Mother Abbess, Eunice Gayson as Elsa Schraeder, Harold Kasket as Max Detweiler, Barbara Brown as Liesl, Nicholas Bennett as Rolf and Olive Gilbert as Sister Margaretta.\n1981 West End revival.\nIn 1981, at producer Ross Taylor's urging, Petula Clark agreed to star in a revival of the show at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in London's West End. Michael Jayston played Captain von Trapp, Honor Blackman was the Baroness and June Bronhill played the Mother Abbess. Other notable cast members included Helen Anker, John Bennett and Martina Grant. Despite her misgivings that, at age 49, she was too old to play the role convincingly, Clark opened to unanimous rave reviews and the largest advance sale in the history of British theatre at that time. Maria von Trapp, who attended the opening night performance, described Clark as \"the best\" Maria ever. Clark extended her initial six-month contract to thirteen months. Playing to 101 percent of seating capacity, the show set the highest attendance figure for a single week (October 26\u201331, 1981) of any British musical production in history (as recorded in \"The Guinness Book of Theatre\"). It was the first stage production to incorporate the two additional songs (\"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\") that Richard Rodgers composed for the film version. \"My Favorite Things\" had a similar context to the film version, while the short verse \"A Bell is No Bell\" was extended into a full-length song for Maria and the Mother Abbess. \"The Lonely Goatherd\" was set in a new scene at a village fair.\n1998 Broadway revival.\nDirector Susan H. Schulman staged the first Broadway revival of \"The Sound of Music\", with Rebecca Luker as Maria and Michael Siberry as Captain von Trapp. It also featured Patti Cohenour as Mother Abbess, Jan Maxwell as Elsa Schraeder, Fred Applegate as Max Detweiler, Dashiell Eaves as Rolf, Patricia Conolly as Frau Schmidt and Laura Benanti, in her Broadway debut, as Luker's understudy. Later, Luker and Siberry were replaced by Richard Chamberlain as the Captain and Benanti as Maria. Lou Taylor Pucci made his Broadway debut as the understudy for Kurt von Trapp. The production opened on March 12, 1998, at the Martin Beck Theatre, and closed on June 20, 1999, after 533 performances. This production was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. It then toured in North America.\n2006 West End revival.\nAn Andrew Lloyd Webber production opened on November 15, 2006, at the London Palladium, produced by Live Nation's David Ian and Jeremy Sams. Following failed negotiations with Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson, the role of Maria was cast through a UK talent search reality TV show called \"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?\" The talent show was produced by (and featured) Andrew Lloyd Webber and also featured presenter/comedian Graham Norton and a judging panel of David Ian, John Barrowman and Zo\u00eb Tyler.\nConnie Fisher was selected by public voting as the winner of the show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on \"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?\", played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess. After Garrett left, Margaret Preece took the role. The cast also featured Lauren Ward as the Baroness, Ian Gelder as Max, Sophie Bould as Liesl, and Neil McDermott as Rolf. Other notable replacements included Simon Burke and Simon MacCorkindale as the Captain and newcomer Amy Lennox as Liesl. Summer Strallen replaced Fisher in February 2008, with Mulholland playing Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinees. The revival received enthusiastic reviews, especially for Fisher, Preece, Bould and Garrett. The production closed on February 21, 2009, after a run of over two years and was followed by a UK national tour, described below.\n2009 and 2015 UK tours.\nA UK tour began in 2009 and visited more than two dozen cities before ending in 2011. The original cast included Connie Fisher as Maria, Michael Praed as Captain von Trapp and Margaret Preece as the Mother Abbess. Kirsty Malpass was the alternate Maria. Jason Donovan assumed the role of Captain Von Trapp, and Verity Rushworth took over as Maria, in early 2011. Lesley Garrett reprised her role as Mother Abbess for the tour's final engagement in Wimbledon in October 2011.\nAnother UK tour, produced by Bill Kenwright, began in 2015 and toured into 2016. It was directed by Martin Connor and starred Lucy O'Byrne as Maria.\n2015 and 2025 North American tours.\nA North American tour, directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Danny Mefford, began at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in September 2015. The tour ran until July 2017. Kerstin Anderson played Maria, with Ben Davis as Capt. von Trapp and Ashley Brown as Mother Abbess. The production received warm reviews.\nA North American tour began in September 2025. The production is directed by Jack O'Brien, with choreography by Danny Mefford.

Rachael Beck took over as Maria in Perth and Adelaide, and Rob Guest took over as Captain von Trapp in Perth.\n21st century.\nAn Austrian production premiered in 2005 at the Volksoper Wien in German. It was directed and choreographed by Renaud Doucet. The cast included Sandra Pires as Maria, Kurt Schreibmayer and Michael Kraus as von Trapp, with Heidi Brunner as Mother Abbess. The song \"Do-Re-Mi\" was rewritten as \"C wie Cellophanpapier\", replacing the solf\u00e8ge syllables with the German letter notation C through H and selecting mnemonics that begin with each letter. The production is still in the repertoire of the Volksoper with performances each season; performances are scheduled for 2024.\nThe Salzburg Marionette Theatre has toured extensively with their version that features the recorded voices of Broadway singers such as Christiane Noll as Maria.

Richard Watts Jr. of the \"New York Post\" stated that the show had \"strangely gentle charm that is wonderfully endearing. \"The Sound of Music\" strives for nothing in the way of smash effects, substituting instead a kind of gracious and unpretentious simplicity.\" The \"New York World-Telegram and Sun\" pronounced \"The Sound of Music\" \"the loveliest musical imaginable. It places Rodgers and Hammerstein back in top form as melodist and lyricist. The Lindsay-Crouse dialogue is vibrant and amusing in a plot that rises to genuine excitement.\" The \"New York Journal American\"'s review opined that \"The Sound of Music\" is \"the most mature product of the team ... it seemed to me to be the full ripening of these two extraordinary talents\".\nBrooks Atkinson of \"The New York Times\" gave a mixed assessment. He praised Mary Martin's performance, saying \"she still has the same common touch ... same sharp features, goodwill, and glowing personality that makes music sound intimate and familiar\" and stated that \"the best of the \"Sound of Music\" is Rodgers and Hammerstein in good form\". However, he said, the libretto \"has the hackneyed look of the musical theatre replaced with \"Oklahoma!\" in 1943. It is disappointing to see the American musical stage succumbing to the clich\u00e9s of operetta.\" Walter Kerr's review in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" was unfavorable: \"Before \"The Sound of Music\" is halfway through its promising chores it becomes not only too sweet for words but almost too sweet for music\", stating that the \"evening suffer[s] from little children\".\nCast recordings.\nColumbia Masterworks recorded the original Broadway cast album at the Columbia 30th Street Studio in New York City a week after the show's 1959 opening. The album was the label's first deluxe package in a gatefold jacket, priced $1 higher than previous cast albums. It was No. 1 on \"Billboard\"'s best-selling albums chart for 16 weeks in 1960. It was released on CD from Sony in the Columbia Broadway Masterworks series. In 1959, singer Patti Page recorded the title song from the show for Mercury Records on the day that the musical opened on Broadway. The 1961 London production was recorded by EMI and released on the His Master's Voice label, and later re-issued on CD in 1997, on the Broadway Angel label. The 1961 Australian cast recorording was the first time a major overseas production featuring Australian artists was transferred to disc.\nThe 1965 film soundtrack was released by RCA Victor and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. RCA Victor also released an album of the 1998 Broadway revival produced by Hallmark Entertainment and featuring the full revival cast, including Rebecca Luker, Michael Siberry, Jan Maxwell and Fred Applegate. The Telarc label made a studio cast recording of \"The Sound of Music\", with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra conducted by Erich Kunzel (1987). The lead roles went to opera stars: Frederica von Stade as Maria, H\u00e5kan Hageg\u00e5rd as Captain von Trapp, and Eileen Farrell as the Mother Abbess. The recording \"includes both the two new songs written for the film version and the three Broadway songs they replace, as well as a previously unrecorded verse of \"An Ordinary Couple\"\". The 2006 London revival was recorded and has been released on the Decca Broadway label. There have been numerous studio cast albums and foreign cast albums issued, though many have only received regional distribution. According to the cast album database, there are 62 recordings of the score that have been issued over the years.\nThe cast recording of the 1981 West End production was the first to be recorded digitally. It was released on CD for the first time in 2010 by the UK label Pet Sounds and included two bonus tracks from the original single issued by Epic to promote the production. A recording of the 2006 London Palladium cast was released. The from the 2013 NBC television production starring Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer was released on CD and digital download in December 2013 on the Sony Masterworks label. Also featured on the album are Audra McDonald, Laura Benanti and Christian Borle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30021", "revid": "32117828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30021", "title": "Trip hop", "text": "Genre of electronic music\nTrip hop is a music genre defined as a psychedelic fusion of hip hop and electronica with slow tempos and an atmospheric sound. The style emerged as a more experimental variant of breakbeat from the Bristol sound scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, incorporating influences from jazz, soul, funk, dub, rap, as well as sampling from movie soundtracks and other eclectic sources.\nPioneering trip hop acts include Massive Attack, UNKLE, Tricky, and Portishead. The term was first coined in a 1994 \"Mixmag\" piece about American producer DJ Shadow. Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as \"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\".\nCharacteristics.\nCommon musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat, often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel. Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&amp;B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&amp;B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird, and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps.\nTrip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands; Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure. Tricky opened his second album \"Nearly God\" with a version of \"Tattoo\", a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983.\nTrip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Contrasting with gangsta rap and its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn, combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to \"transcend\" the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.\nHistory.\nLate 1980s\u20131991: Origins.\nThe term \"trip-hop\" first appeared in print in June 1994. Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for \"Mixmag\", used it to describe \"In/Flux\", a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo' Wax Records.\nIn Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems. Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol's soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (\"down tempo\").\nBristol's Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol's signature sound of trip hop, often termed \"the Bristol Sound\". The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence, DJ Milo (Milo Johnson, aka DJ Nature) founding member of the Wild Bunch and the person generally accepted as the creator of the Bristol sound and therefore, trip-hop; MC Adrian \"Tricky Kid\" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s, the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack, a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists.\nAnother influence came from Gary Clail's Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart. The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart &amp; the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label. Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a primitive version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released \"Angel\", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s.\n1991\u20131997: Mainstream breakthrough.\nMassive Attack's first album \"Blue Lines\" was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom. \"Blue Lines\" was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" and other tracks were not seen as hip hop songs in a conventional sense despite similarities in production methods such as using sample-based rhythms. Co-produced by Jonny Dollar, the orchestral \"Unfinished\" featured R&amp;B singer Shara Nelson, and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career. Massive Attack released their second album entitled \"Protection\" in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away from the Wild Bunch era.\nIn the June 1994 issue of the UK magazine \"Mixmag\", music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term \"trip hop\" to describe the hip hop instrumental \"In/Flux\", a 1993 single by San Francisco's DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo' Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. \"In/Flux\", with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton. Soon, however, Massive Attack's dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre.\nIn 1993, Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk released \"Debut\", produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper. The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop. She had been in contact with London's underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip-hop musician Tricky. Bj\u00f6rk further embraced trip-hop with her 1995 album \"Post\" by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. \"Homogenic\", her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music.\nTrip-hop neared the peak of its popularity in 1994 and 1995, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the duo Coldcut, significantly influenced the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle &amp; Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come.\nIn 1994, Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album \"Dummy\". Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs. Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of \"Blue Lines\"), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, \"Dummy\" was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music was also widely imitated, to the point that they distanced themselves from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize, with Barrow stating \"The whole trip-hop tag was nonsense. It was developed by people in London, and the people in Bristol just had to put up with it.\".\nTricky also released his debut solo album, \"Maxinquaye\" in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness lyrics, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip-hop scene. Even more unusually, many of the solo songs on \"Maxinquaye\" featured little of Tricky's own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her re-imagining of rap group Public Enemy's 1988 song \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\", while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year, Tricky had released two more full-length albums, although they failed to find the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead. Through his collaborations with Bj\u00f6rk, however, he exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base.\nAlthough not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country.\n1997\u20132010: Continued success and new directions.\nAfter the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, the artists who made their own interpretations of the genre include Archive, Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Everything but the Girl, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term \"post-trip hop\" was in an October 2002 article of \"The Independent\", and was used to describe the band Second Person.\nTrip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey, How to Destroy Angels, Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, , Beck, Alanis Morissette, The xx and Deftones. Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue's 1997 album \"Impossible Princess\" also displayed a trip hop influence. Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Bj\u00f6rk, and Radiohead, have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres, including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop).\nTrip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album \"Perdition City\". Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics. RJD2 began his career as a DJ, but in 2001, began releasing albums under El-P's Def Jux Label. Zero 7's album \"Simple Things\", and in particular, its lead single \"Destiny\", was regarded highly by underground listeners and achieved significant popularity. In 2006, Gotye debuted his second studio album, \"Like Drawing Blood\". The songs on the album featured down-tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop. Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence. Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work.\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s trip hop achieved crossover success in the United States, often lumped under the \"electronica\" label. Trip hop songs were featured in film soundtracks of this era such as the \"Matrix\" series. Many producers who were not explicitly trip-hop artists also displayed its influence during this time. Daniel Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, released two albums that were heavily inspired by trip hop. His 2000 album \"Deltron 3030\" was a concept album about a rapper from the future, portrayed by Del the Funky Homosapien. 2001 saw the release of his side project, Lovage and the album \"Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By\", with special guests Mike Patton, Prince Paul, Maseo, Damon Albarn, and Afrika Bambaataa. British producer Fatboy Slim's breakthrough album, \"Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars\", was his most commercially successful release. Another heavily trip-hop influenced band, Elsiane, published their first album \"Hybrid\" in 2007, creating a \"mellow, hypnotic atmosphere utilized in the \u201990s by big names like Massive Attack, Portishead, etc.\"\n2010\u2013present.\nMajor notable trip hop releases from 2010s include Massive Attack's \"Heligoland,\" their first studio album in seven years; and Dutch's \"A Bright Cold Day\" in 2010, the latter group including Jedi Mind Tricks producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind.\nDJ Shadow's \"The Less You Know, the Better\" was released in 2011 after a highly publicised unveiling of songs, including appearances on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show and previews at a performance in Antwerp in August 2010. The album was met with \"generally favorable reviews\" on Metacritic, with some criticising Shadow's lack of originality. Sam Richards of \"NME\" felt that the album sounded \"like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place.\"\nBeak's album titled \"Beak\u00bb\" was released in 2012 and received high scores from journalists, including an 8/10 from \"NME\" and \"Spin\" magazine.\nLana Del Rey released her second album, \"Born to Die\" in 2012, which contained a string of trip hop ballads. The album topped the charts in eleven countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom; it has sold 3.4 million copies worldwide as of 2013 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.\nFollowing the 2013 release of \"EP2\", the music of FKA Twigs was described in a \"Pitchfork Magazine\" article as \"trip hop for a new time\", with \"a menacing undertow reminiscent of Massive Attack's \"Mezzanine\".\"\nIn September 2021, the Sneaker Pimps released the album \"Squaring the Circle\" which had been their first release in over 20 years, featuring Simonne Jones on some of the tracks. The album, while rooted in Trip Hop, had much more of a Pop styling than previous efforts.\nIn April 2024, Irish rock band Fontaines D.C. released \"Starburster\", the lead single from their fourth album \"Romance\". Critics \"Consequence\" and \"Clash\" described the track as trip hop.\nIn the mid-2020s, the genre saw a resurge, most notably in the music of pop acts like FKA Twigs, Addison Rae and Tame Impala. FKA Twigs' third studio album \"Eusexua\" saw elements of trip hop in its production, which was smiliar for the debut studio album of American recording artist Addison Rae. Critics argued that both albums were laced with trip hop influences, and resembled Madonna's 1998 studio album \"Ray of Light\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was known during his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He was the last major astronomer before the invention of the telescope and has been described as the greatest pre-telescopic astronomer.\nIn 1572, Tycho noticed a completely new star that was brighter than any star or planet. Astonished by the existence of a star that ought not to have been there, he devoted himself to the creation of ever more accurate instruments of measurement over the next fifteen years (1576\u20131591). King Frederick II granted Tycho an estate on the island of Hven and the money to build Uraniborg, the first large observatory in Christian Europe. He later worked underground at Stjerneborg, where he realised that his instruments in Uraniborg were not sufficiently steady. His unprecedented research program both turned astronomy into the first modern science and also helped launch the Scientific Revolution.\nAn heir to several noble families, Tycho was well educated. He worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of Copernican heliocentrism with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system, and devised the Tychonic system, his own version of a model of the Universe, with the Sun orbiting the Earth, and the planets as orbiting the Sun. In (1573), he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm. His measurements indicated that \"new stars\", , now called \"supernovae\", moved beyond the Moon, and he was able to show that comets were not atmospheric phenomena, as was previously thought.\nIn 1597, Tycho was forced by the new king, Christian IV, to leave Denmark. He was invited to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer, and built an observatory at Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou. Before his death in 1601, he was assisted for a year by Johannes Kepler, who went on to use Tycho's data to develop his own three laws of planetary motion.\nLife.\nFamily.\nTycho Brahe was born as heir to several of Denmark's most influential noble families. In addition to his immediate ancestry with the Brahe and the Bille families, he counted the Rud, Trolle, Ulfstand, and Rosenkrantz families among his ancestors. Both of his grandfathers and all of his great-grandfathers had served as members of the Danish king's Privy Council. His paternal grandfather and namesake, Thyge Brahe, was the lord of Tosterup Castle in Scania and died in battle during the 1523 Siege of Malm\u00f6 during the Lutheran Reformation Wars.\nHis maternal grandfather, Claus Bille, lord to Bohus Castle and a second cousin of Swedish king Gustav Vasa, participated in the Stockholm Bloodbath on the side of the Danish king against the Swedish nobles. Tycho's father, Otte Brahe, a royal Privy Councilor (like his own father), married Beate Bille, a powerful figure at the Danish court holding several royal land titles. Tycho's parents are buried under the floor of the church of K\u00e5ger\u00f6d, four kilometres west of Knutstorp Castle.\nEarly years.\nTycho was born on 14 December 1546, at his family's ancestral seat at Knutstorp (; ), about north of Sval\u00f6v in then Danish Scania. He was the oldest of 12 siblings, 8 of whom lived to adulthood, including Steen Brahe and Sophia Brahe. His twin brother died before being baptized. Tycho later wrote an ode in Latin to his dead twin, which was printed in 1572 as his first published work. An epitaph, originally from Knutstorp, but now on a plaque near the church door, shows the whole family, including Tycho as a boy.\nWhen he was only two years old Tycho was taken away to be raised by his uncle J\u00f8rgen Thygesen Brahe and his wife Inger Oxe, sister to Peder Oxe, Steward of the Realm, who were childless. It is unclear why Otte Brahe reached this arrangement with his brother, but Tycho was the only one of his siblings not to be raised by his mother at Knutstorp. Instead, Tycho was raised at J\u00f8rgen Brahe's estate at Tosterup and at Tranek\u00e6r on the island of Langeland, and later at N\u00e6sbyhoved Castle near Odense, and later again at the Castle of Nyk\u00f8bing on the island of Falster. Tycho later wrote that J\u00f8rgen Brahe \"raised me and generously provided for me during his life until my eighteenth year; he always treated me as his own son and made me his heir\".\nFrom ages 6 to 12, Tycho attended Latin school, probably in Nyk\u00f8bing. At age 12, on 19 April 1559, Tycho began studies at the University of Copenhagen. There, following his uncle's wishes, he studied law, but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in astronomy. At the university, Aristotle was a staple of scientific theory, and Tycho likely received a thorough training in Aristotelian physics and cosmology. He experienced the solar eclipse of 21 August 1560, and was greatly impressed by the fact that it had been predicted, although the prediction based on current observational data was a day off. He realized that more accurate observations would be the key to making more exact predictions. He purchased an ephemeris and books on astronomy, including Johannes de Sacrobosco's , Petrus Apianus's and Regiomontanus's .\nJ\u00f8rgen Thygesen Brahe, however, wanted Tycho to educate himself in order to become a civil servant, and sent him on a study tour of Europe in early 1562. Fifteen-year-old Tycho was given as mentee to the 19-year-old Anders S\u00f8rensen Vedel. Tycho eventually talked Vedel into allowing him to pursue astronomy during the tour. Vedel and his pupil left Copenhagen in February 1562. On 24 March, they arrived in Leipzig, where they matriculated at the Lutheran Leipzig University. In 1563, he observed a close conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, and noticed that the Copernican and Ptolemaic tables used to predict the conjunction were inaccurate. This led him to realise that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable. He began maintaining detailed journals of all his astronomical observations. In this period, he combined the study of astronomy with astrology, laying down horoscopes for different famous personalities.\nWhen Tycho and Vedel returned from Leipzig in 1565, Denmark was at war with Sweden, and as vice-admiral of the Danish fleet, J\u00f8rgen Brahe had become a national hero for having participated in the sinking of the Swedish warship \"Mars\" during the First battle of \u00d6land (1564). Shortly after Tycho's arrival in Denmark, J\u00f8rgen Brahe was defeated in the action of 4 June 1565, and shortly afterwards died of a fever. Stories have it that he contracted pneumonia after a night of drinking with the Danish King Frederick II when the king fell into the water in a Copenhagen canal and Brahe jumped in after him. Brahe's possessions passed on to his wife Inger Oxe, who considered Tycho with special fondness.\nTycho's nose.\nIn 1566, Tycho left to study at the University of Rostock in what is now Germany. There he studied with professors of medicine at the university's famous medical school and became interested in medical alchemy and herbal medicine. On 29 December 1566 at the age of 20, Tycho lost part of his nose in a sword duel with a fellow Danish nobleman, his third cousin Manderup Parsberg. At an engagement party at the home of Professor Lucas Bachmeister on 10 December the two had drunkenly quarreled over who was the superior mathematician. On 29 December, the cousins resolved their feud with a duel in the dark. Though the two were later reconciled, in the duel Tycho lost the bridge of his nose and gained a broad scar across his forehead.\nHe received the best possible care at the university and wore a prosthetic nose for the rest of his life. It was kept in place with paste or glue and said to be made of silver and gold. In November 2012, Danish and Czech researchers reported that the prosthesis was actually made of brass after chemically analyzing a small bone sample from the nose from the body exhumed in 2010.\nScience and life on Uraniborg.\nIn April 1567, Tycho returned home from his travels, with a firm intention of becoming an astrologer. Although he had been expected to go into politics and the law, like most of his kinsmen, and although Denmark was still at war with Sweden, his family supported his decision to dedicate himself to the sciences. His father wanted him to take up law, but Tycho was allowed to travel to Rostock and then to Augsburg, where he built a great quadrant, then Basel, and Freiburg. In 1568, he was appointed a canon at Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark, a largely honorary position that allowed him to focus on his studies.\nAt the end of 1570, he was informed of his father's ill health, so he returned to Knutstorp Castle, where his father died on 9 May 1571. The war was over, and the Danish lords soon returned to prosperity. Soon, another uncle, Steen Bille, helped him build an observatory and alchemical laboratory at Herrevad Abbey, where Tycho was assisted by his keenest disciple, his younger sister Sophie Brahe. Tycho was acknowledged by King Frederick II, who proposed to him that an observatory be built to better study the night sky. After accepting this proposal, the location for the Uraniborg\u2019s construction was set on an island called Hven, now Ven in the Sound not too far from Copenhagen, the earliest large observatory in Christian Europe.\nTycho Brahe was highly appreciated by King Frederick II, and he was accepted and supported by people of high social status. He was supported by the church. The support Tycho Brahe received from the king allowed him to continue his research and make significant contributions to the field of astronomy.\nIn the late 16th century, Tycho Brahe built an observatory called Uraniborg. It was built on the island of Hven located between the provinces of Zealand (Sj\u00e6lland) and Scania (Sk\u00e5ne). The island was then an administrative part of Zealand. Later, after the Peace of Roskilde in 1658, Scania was conquered by the Swedes. In 1660, Hven became part of Sweden. In Tycho's time, it was all Denmark. He lived on Hven for approximately 21 years. He began to build Uraniborg in 1576 and moved there soon after. As Uraniborg was a significant and advanced observatory, it took years to complete.\nUraniborg was a place where Tycho Brahe could research and analyze his previous findings, as well as explore new discoveries. Tycho Brahe was an astronomer of the pre-telescope era. Using just his naked eye, he observed the planets, Moon, stars, and space and recorded everything he saw while completing a multitude of calculations daily. The location of Uraniborg was strategically chosen, with seclusion and support being the primary reasons for building on the island of Hven. Seclusion was essential for accurate observation, and gave Tycho Brahe a better way to focus on his work without worrying about interruptions from other people. Seclusion was also important for observation, as there was nothing interfering with time, light, or motion observations.\nTycho Brahe was a perfectionist, and by being secluded he had complete control over his research and was not limited by anyone else's restrictions, enabling him to develop innovative research. He could focus all of his energy on his work, without receiving any backlash or questioning from anyone. The seclusion gave him the freedom to pursue his research without limitations and paved the way for groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astronomy. Uraniborg was one of the most advanced observatories of its time, equipped with several astronomical instruments, including quadrant instruments, sextants, and astronomical clocks.\nTycho Brahe's observations and calculations at Uraniborg allowed him to develop more accurate Solar System models. He compiled the most extensive and accurate catalog of stellar positions up to that time. Tycho Brahe's observations and calculations at Uraniborg allowed him to lay the groundwork for astronomers in the future.\nDespite the success Tycho Brahe had on Hven, he eventually left the island after a disagreement with the new king of Denmark, Christian IV. In 1597, Tycho Brahe moved to Prague, where he continued his work and was eventually appointed by Emperor Rudolf II in 1601 as imperial mathematician. However, Uraniborg remained a significant landmark in the history of astronomy.\nMorganatic marriage to Kirsten J\u00f8rgensdatter.\nTowards the end of 1571, Tycho fell in love with Kirsten, daughter of J\u00f8rgen Hansen, the Lutheran minister in Knudstrup. As she was a commoner, Tycho never formally married her, since if he did he would lose his noble privileges. However, Danish law permitted morganatic marriage, which meant that a nobleman and a common woman could live together openly as husband and wife for three years, and their alliance then became a legally binding marriage. However, each would maintain their social status, and any children they had together would be considered commoners, with no rights to titles, landholdings, coat of arms, or even their father's noble name.\nWhile King Frederick respected Tycho's choice of wife, himself having been unable to marry the woman he loved, many of Tycho's family members disagreed, and many churchmen continued to hold the lack of a divinely sanctioned marriage against him. Kirsten J\u00f8rgensdatter gave birth to their first daughter, Kirstine, named after Tycho's late sister, on 12October 1573. Kirstine died from the plague in 1576. Tycho wrote a heartfelt elegy for her tombstone. In 1574, they moved to Copenhagen where their daughter Magdalene was born. Later the family followed him into exile. Kirsten and Tycho lived together for almost thirty years until Tycho's death. Together, they had eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood.\n1572 supernova.\nOn 11 November 1572, Tycho observed, from Herrevad Abbey, a very bright star, now numbered SN 1572, which had unexpectedly appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. Because it had been maintained since antiquity that the world beyond the Moon's orbit was eternally unchangeable, with celestial immutability being a fundamental axiom of the Aristotelian world-view, other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the terrestrial sphere below the Moon. However, Tycho observed that the object showed no daily parallax against the background of the fixed stars. This implied that it was at least farther away than the Moon and those planets that do show such parallax. He found that the object did not change its position relative to the fixed stars over several months, as all planets did in their periodic orbital motions, even the outer planets, for which no daily parallax was detectable.\nThis suggested that it was not even a planet, but a fixed star in the stellar sphere beyond all the planets. In 1573, he published a small book , coining the term nova for a \"new\" star. This star was a supernova and is 7,500\u00a0light-years from Earth. This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession. Tycho was strongly critical of those who dismissed the implications of the astronomical appearance, writing in the preface to : (\"O thick wits. O blind watchers of the sky\"). The publication of his discovery made him a well-known name among scientists in Europe.\nLord of Hven.\nTycho continued with his detailed observations, often assisted by his first assistant and student, his younger sister Sophie. In 1574, Tycho published the observations made in 1572 from his first observatory at Herrevad Abbey. He then started lecturing on astronomy, but gave it up and left Denmark in spring 1575 to tour abroad. He first visited William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel's observatory at Kassel, then went on to Frankfurt, Basel, and Venice, where he acted as an agent for the Danish king, contacting artisans and craftsmen whom the king wanted to work on his new palace at Elsinore. Upon his return, the King wished to repay Tycho's service by offering him a position worthy of his family. He offered him a choice of lordships of militarily and economically important estates, such as the castles of Hammershus or Helsingborg.\nTycho was reluctant to take up a position as a lord of the realm, preferring to focus on his science. He wrote to his friend Johannes Pratensis, \"I did not want to take possession of any of the castles our benevolent king so graciously offered me. I am displeased with society here, customary forms and the whole rubbish\". Tycho secretly began to plan to move to Basel, wishing to participate in the burgeoning academic and scientific life there. The King heard of Tycho's plans, and desiring to keep the distinguished scientist, in 1576 he offered Tycho the island of Hven in \u00d8resund and funding to set up an observatory.\nUntil then, Hven had been property directly under the Crown. The 50 families on the island considered themselves to be freeholding farmers, but with Tycho's appointment as Feudal Lord of Hven, this changed. Tycho took control of agricultural planning, requiring the peasants to cultivate twice as much as they had done before, and he exacted corv\u00e9e labor from the peasants for the construction of his new castle. The peasants complained about Tycho's excessive taxation and took him to court. The court established Tycho's right to levy taxes and labor. The result was a contract detailing the mutual obligations of lord and peasants on the island.\nTycho envisioned his castle Uraniborg as a temple dedicated to the muses of arts and sciences, rather than as a military fortress. It was named after Urania, the muse of astronomy. Construction began in 1576, with a laboratory for his alchemical experiments in the cellar. Uraniborg was inspired by the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio. It was one of the first buildings in northern Europe to show influence from Italian renaissance architecture.\nWhen he realized that the towers of Uraniborg were not adequate as observatories, because of the instruments' exposure to the elements and the movement of the building, he constructed an underground observatory close to Uraniborg called Stjerneborg (Star Castle) in 1584. This consisted of several hemispherical crypts which contained the great equatorial armillary, large azimuth quadrant, zodiacal armillary, largest azimuth quadrant of steel and the trigonal sextant.\nThe basement of Uraniborg included an alchemical laboratory, with 16 furnaces for conducting distillations and other chemical experiments. Unusually for the time, Tycho established Uraniborg as a research centre, where almost 100 students and artisans worked from 1576 to 1597. Uraniborg contained a printing press and a paper mill, both among the first in Scandinavia, enabling Tycho to publish his own manuscripts, on locally made paper with his own watermark. He created a system of ponds and canals to run the wheels of the paper mill. Another resident of Uraniborg was a man with dwarfism named Jeppe, whom Tycho believed had the ability to predict the future, and he allegedly was able to correctly predict the chances of recovery or death of ill people in Hven.\nOver the years he worked on Uraniborg, Tycho was assisted by a number of students and proteg\u00e9s, many of whom went on to their own careers in astronomy. Among them were Christian S\u00f8rensen Longomontanus, later one of the main proponents of the Tychonic model and Tycho's replacement as royal Danish astronomer, Peder Fleml\u00f8se, Elias Olsen Morsing, and Cort Aslakss\u00f8n. Tycho's instrument-maker Hans Crol formed part of the scientific community on the island.\nGreat Comet of 1577.\nTycho observed the great comet that was visible in the Northern sky from November 1577 to January 1578. Within Lutheranism, it was commonly believed that celestial objects like comets were powerful portents, announcing the coming apocalypse. Several Danish amateur astronomers observed the object and published prophesies of impending doom. Tycho was able to determine that the comet's distance to Earth was much greater than the distance of the Moon, so that the comet could not have originated in the \"earthly sphere\", confirming his prior anti-Aristotelian conclusions about the fixed nature of the sky beyond the Moon.\nTycho realized that the comet's tail was always pointing away from the Sun. He calculated its diameter, mass, and the length of its tail, and speculated about the material it was made of. Through nightly observations of the comet, Tycho Brahe estimated its closest approach to Earth at about 230 times the Earth's radius. He also analyzed its motion, suggesting an orbit located between Mercury and Venus.\nAt this point, he had not yet broken with Copernican heliocentrism, and observing the comet inspired him to try to develop an alternative Copernican model, in which the Earth was immobile. Tycho Brahe's comet observations challenged the prevailing theory of solid celestial spheres. With the comet likely traveling between Mercury and Venus, the notion of these rigid spheres became untenable. It suggested a vast emptiness where objects like the comet, potentially quite large, could move freely and exhibit properties unlike those previously understood. The second half of his manuscript about the comet dealt with the astrological and apocalyptic aspects of the comet. Tycho rejected the prophesies of his competitors. Instead, he made his own predictions of dire political events in the near future. Among his predictions was bloodshed in Moscow, and the imminent fall of Ivan the Terrible by 1583.\nSupport from the Crown.\nThe support that Tycho received from the Crown was substantial, amounting to 1% of the annual total revenue at one point in the 1580s. Tycho often held large social gatherings in his castle. Pierre Gassendi wrote that Tycho had a tame elk and that his mentor the Landgrave Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel asked whether there was an animal faster than a deer. Tycho replied that there was none, but he could send his tame elk. When Wilhelm replied he would accept one in exchange for a horse, Tycho replied with the sad news that the elk had just died on a visit to entertain a nobleman at Landskrona. Apparently, during dinner, the elk had drunk a lot of beer, fallen down the stairs, and died.\nAmong the many noble visitors to Hven was James VI of Scotland, who married the Danish princess Anne. He gave gold coins to the ferryman and to the builders and workers at Tycho's paper mill. After his visit to Hven in 1590, James wrote a poem comparing Tycho with Apollon and Phaethon.\nAs part of Tycho's duties to the Crown, in exchange for his estate, he fulfilled the functions of a royal astrologer. At the beginning of each year, he had to present an Almanac to the court, predicting the influence of the stars on the political and economic prospects of the year. At the birth of each prince, he prepared their horoscopes, predicting their fates. He also worked as a cartographer with his former tutor Anders S\u00f8rensen Vedel on mapping out all of the Danish realm. An ally of the king and friendly with Queen Sophie, both his mother Beate Bille and adoptive mother Inger Oxe had been her court maids, he secured a promise from the King that ownership of Hven and Uraniborg would pass to his heirs.\nPublications, correspondence and scientific disputes.\nIn 1588, Tycho's royal benefactor died, and a volume of Tycho's great two-volume work (\"Introduction to the New Astronomy\") was published. The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations of 1572\u201373 involved much research to correct the stars' positions for refraction, precession, the motion of the Sun etc., and was not completed in Tycho's lifetime. It was published in Prague in 1602\u20131603.\nThe second volume, titled (\"Second Book About Recent Phenomena in the Celestial World\") and devoted to the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations, it included an account of Tycho's system of the world. The third volume was intended to treat the comets of 1580 and following years in a similar manner. It was never published, or written, though a great deal of material about the comet of 1585 was put together and published in 1845 with the observations of this comet.\nWhile at Uraniborg, Tycho maintained correspondence with scientists and astronomers across Europe. He inquired about other astronomers' observations and shared his own technological advances to help them achieve more accurate observations. Thus, his correspondence was crucial to his research. Often, correspondence was not just private communication between scholars, but also a way to disseminate results and arguments and to build progress and scientific consensus. Through correspondence, Tycho was involved in several personal disputes with critics of his theories. Prominent among them were John Craig, a Scottish physician who was a strong believer in the authority of the Aristotelian worldview, and Nicolaus Reimers Baer, known as Ursus, an astronomer at the Imperial court in Prague, whom Tycho accused of having plagiarized his cosmological model.\nCraig refused to accept Tycho's conclusion, that the comet of 1577 had to be located within the aetherial sphere, rather than within the atmosphere of Earth. Craig tried to contradict Tycho by using his own observations of the comet, and by questioning his methodology. Tycho published an \"apologia\" (a defense) of his conclusions, in which he provided additional arguments, as well as condemning Craig's ideas in strong language for being incompetent. Another dispute concerned the mathematician Paul Wittich, who, after staying on Hven in 1580, taught Count Wilhelm of Kassel and his astronomer Christoph Rothmann to build copies of Tycho's instruments without permission from Tycho. Craig, who had studied with Wittich, accused Tycho of minimizing Wittich's role in developing some of the trigonometric methods used by Tycho. In his dealings with these disputes, Tycho made sure to leverage his support in the scientific community, by publishing and disseminating his own answers and arguments.\nExile and later years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;Denmark what is my offence? How\nhave I offended my fatherland?\nYou may think that what I have done is wrong\nBut was I wrong to spread your fame abroad?\nTell me, who has done such things before?\nAnd sung your honour to the very stars?&lt;/poem&gt;\nExcerpt of Tycho Brahe's \"Elegy to Dania\"\nWhen Frederick died in 1588, his son and heir Christian IV was only 11 years old. A regency council was appointed to rule for the young prince-elect until his coronation in 1596. The head of the council (Steward of the Realm) was Christoffer Valkendorff, who disliked Tycho after a conflict between them, and hence Tycho's influence at the Danish court steadily declined. Feeling that his legacy on Hven was in peril, he approached the Dowager Queen Sophie and asked her to affirm in writing her late husband's promise to endow Hven to Tycho's heirs.\nHe realized that the young king was more interested in war than in science, and was of no mind to keep his father's promise. King Christian IV followed a policy of curbing the power of the nobility, by confiscating their estates to minimize their income bases, by accusing nobles of misusing their offices and of heresies against the Lutheran church. Tycho, who was known to sympathize with the Philippists, followers of Philip Melanchthon, was among the nobles who fell out of grace with the new king. The king's unfavorable disposition towards Tycho was likely also a result of efforts by several of his enemies at court to turn the king against him.\nIn addition to Valkendorff, Tycho's enemies included the king's doctor Peter Severinus, who also had personal gripes with Tycho. Several gnesio-Lutheran Bishops suspected Tycho of heresy\u00a0\u2013 a suspicion motivated by his known Philippist sympathies, his pursuits in medicine and alchemy, both of which he practiced without the church's approval, and his prohibiting the local priest on Hven to include the exorcism in the baptismal ritual. Among the accusations raised against Tycho were his failure to adequately maintain the royal chapel at Roskilde, and his harshness and exploitation of the Hven peasantry.\nTycho became even more inclined to leave when a mob of commoners, possibly incited by his enemies at court, rioted in front of his house in Copenhagen. Tycho left Hven in 1597, bringing some of his instruments with him to Copenhagen, and entrusting others to a caretaker on the island. Shortly before leaving, he completed his star catalogue giving the positions of 1,000 stars. After some unsuccessful attempts at influencing the king to let him return, including showcasing his instruments on the wall of the city, he acquiesced to exile. He wrote his most famous poem, \"Elegy to Dania\" in which he chided Denmark for not appreciating his genius.\nThe instruments he had used in Uraniborg and Stjerneborg were depicted and described in detail in his star catalogue or \"Instruments for the restoration of astronomy\", first published in 1598. The King sent two envoys to Hven to describe the instruments left behind by Tycho. Unversed in astronomy, the envoys reported to the king that the large mechanical contraptions such as his large quadrant and sextant were \"useless and even harmful\".\nFrom 1597 to 1598, he spent a year at the castle of his friend Heinrich Rantzau at Haus Wandesburg in Wandsbek outside Hamburg. Then they moved for a while to Wittenberg, where they stayed in the former home of the Protestant reformer Philip Melanchthon.\nIn 1599, he obtained the patronage of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and moved to Prague, as Imperial Court Astronomer. Tycho built a new observatory in a castle in Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou, 50\u00a0km from Prague, and worked there for one year. The emperor then brought him back to Prague, where he stayed until his death. At the imperial court even Tycho's wife and children were treated like nobility, which they had never been at the Danish court.\nTycho received financial support from several nobles in addition to the emperor, including Oldrich Desiderius Pruskowsky von Pruskow, to whom he dedicated his famous . In return for their support, Tycho's duties included preparing astrological charts and predictions for his patrons at events such as births, weather forecasting, and astrological interpretations of significant astronomical events, such as the supernova of 1572, sometimes called Tycho's supernova, and the Great Comet of 1577.\nRelationship with Kepler.\nIn Prague, Tycho worked closely with Kepler, his assistant. Kepler was a convinced Copernican, and considered Tycho's model to be mistaken, and derived from simple \"inversion\" of the Sun's and Earth's positions in the Copernican model. Together, the two worked on a new star catalogue based on his own accurate positions\u00a0\u2013 this catalogue became the \"Rudolphine Tables\". Also at the court in Prague was the mathematician Nicolaus Reimers (Ursus), with whom Tycho had previously corresponded, and who, like Tycho, had developed a geo-heliocentric planetary model, which Tycho considered to have been plagiarized from his own.\nKepler had previously spoken highly of Ursus, but now found himself in the problematic position of being employed by Tycho and having to defend his employer against Ursus' accusations, even though he disagreed with both of their planetary models. In 1600, he finished the tract (defense of Tycho against Ursus). Kepler had great respect for Tycho's methods and the accuracy of his observations and considered him to be the new Hipparchus, who would provide the foundation for a restoration of the science of astronomy.\nIllness, death, and investigations.\nTycho suddenly contracted a bladder or kidney ailment after attending a banquet in Prague. He died eleven days later, on 24 October 1601, at the age of 54. According to Kepler's first-hand account, Tycho had refused to leave the banquet to relieve himself because it would have been a breach of etiquette. After he returned home, he was no longer able to urinate, except eventually in very small quantities and with excruciating pain. The night before he died, he suffered from a delirium during which he was frequently heard to exclaim that he hoped he would not seem to have lived in vain.\nBefore dying, he urged Kepler to finish the \"Rudolphine Tables\" and expressed the hope that he would do so by adopting Tycho's own planetary system, rather than that of the polymath Nicolaus Copernicus. It was reported that Tycho had written his own epitaph, \"He lived like a sage and died like a fool.\" A contemporary physician attributed his death to a kidney stone, but no kidney stones were found during an autopsy performed after his body was exhumed in 1901. Modern medical assessment is that his death was more likely caused by either a burst bladder, prostatic hypertrophy, acute prostatitis, or prostate cancer, which led to urinary retention, overflow incontinence, and uremia.\nInvestigations in the 1990s suggested that Tycho may not have died from urinary problems, but instead from mercury poisoning. It was speculated that he had been intentionally poisoned. The two main suspects were his assistant, Johannes Kepler, whose motives would be to gain access to Tycho's laboratory and chemicals, and his cousin, Erik Brahe, at the order of friend-turned-enemy Christian IV, because of rumors that Tycho had had an affair with Christian's mother.\nIn February 2010, the Prague city authorities approved a request by Danish scientists to exhume the remains, and in November 2010 a group of Czech and Danish scientists from Aarhus University collected bone, hair and clothing samples for analysis. The scientists, led by Jens Vellev, analyzed Tycho's beard hair once again. The team reported in November 2012 that there was not enough mercury present to substantiate murder, and there were no lethal levels of any poisons present. The team's conclusion was that \"it is impossible that Tycho Brahe could have been murdered\".\nThe findings were confirmed by scientists from the University of Rostock, who examined a sample of Tycho's beard hairs that had been taken in 1901. Although traces of mercury were found, these were present only in the outer scales. Therefore, mercury poisoning as the cause of death was ruled out. The study suggests that the accumulation of mercury may have come from the \"precipitation of mercury dust from the air during [Tycho's] long-term alchemistic activities\".\nTycho is buried in the Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn, in Old Town Square near the Prague Astronomical Clock.\nCareer: observing the heavens.\nObservational astronomy.\nTycho's view of science was driven by his passion for accurate observations, and the quest for improved instruments of measurement drove his life's work. Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a telescope, soon to be turned skyward by Galileo Galilei and others. Given the limitations of the naked eye for making accurate observations, he devoted many of his efforts to improving the accuracy of the existing types of instrument\u00a0\u2013 the sextant and the quadrant. He designed larger versions of these instruments, which allowed him to achieve much higher accuracy. Because of the accuracy of his instruments, he quickly realized the influence of wind and the movement of buildings, and instead opted to mount his instruments underground directly on the bedrock.\nTycho's observations of stellar and planetary positions were noteworthy both for their accuracy and quantity. With an accuracy approaching one arcminute, his celestial positions were much more accurate than those of any predecessor or contemporary\u00a0\u2013 about five times as accurate as the observations of Wilhelm of Hesse. asserts of Tycho's Star Catalog D, \"In it, Tycho achieved, on a mass scale, a precision far beyond that of earlier catalogers. Cat D represents an unprecedented confluence of skills: instrumental, observational, and computational, all of which combined to enable Tycho to place most of his hundreds of recorded stars to an accuracy of ordermag 1'!\"\nHe aspired to a level of accuracy in his estimated positions of celestial bodies of being consistently within an arcminute of their real celestial locations, and also claimed to have achieved this level. But, in fact, many of the stellar positions in his star catalogues were less accurate than that. The median errors for the stellar positions in his final published catalog were about 1.5', indicating that only half of the entries were more accurate than that, with an overall mean error in each coordinate of around 2'.\nAlthough the stellar observations as recorded in his observational logs were more accurate, varying from 32.3\" to 48.8\" for different instruments, systematic errors of as much as 3' were introduced into some of the stellar positions Tycho published in his star catalog\u00a0\u2013 due, for instance, to his application of an erroneous ancient value of parallax and his neglect of polestar refraction. Incorrect transcription in the final published star catalogue, by scribes in Tycho's employ, was the source of even larger errors, sometimes by many degrees.\nCelestial objects observed near the horizon and above appear with a greater altitude than the real one, due to atmospheric refraction, and one of Tycho's most important innovations was that he worked out and published the very first tables for the systematic correction of this possible source of error. But, as advanced as they were, they attributed no refraction whatever above 45\u00b0 altitude for solar refraction, and none for starlight above 20\u00b0 altitude.\nTo perform the huge number of multiplications needed to produce much of his astronomical data, Tycho relied heavily on the then-new technique of \"prosthaphaeresis\", an algorithm for approximating products based on trigonometric identities that predated logarithms.\nInstruments.\nMany of Tycho's observations and discoveries were done with the aid of various instruments, many of which he himself made. The process that went into creating and refining his devices was haphazard at first, but was critical in the advancement of his observations. He pioneered an early example while he was a student in Leipzig. While he was gazing at the stars he realized that he needed a better way to write down not just his observations but also the angles and descriptions as well. So, he pioneered the use of the observational. In this notebook, he made his observations and asked himself questions to try to answer later on. Tycho also made sketches of what he saw as well from comets to the motions of planets.\nHis astronomical instrument innovation continued after his schooling. When he gained access to his inheritance, he went straight to work creating brand new instruments to replace the ones he used as a student. Tycho created a quadrant that was thirty-nine centimeters in diameter and added a new type of sight to it called a \"pinnacidia\", or light cutters as it is translated. This brand-new sight meant that the old pinhole style sight was rendered obsolete. When the sights of the pinnacidia were aligned in the correct manner the object that it is lined up with it will look exactly the same from both ends. This instrument was kept still on a heavy-duty base and adjusted via a brass plumb line and thumb screws, all of which helped give Tycho Brahe more accurate measurements of the heavens.\nThere were times that the instruments Tycho made were for a specific purpose or an event that he was witness to. Such was the case in 1577 when he first started construction of what would be called Uraniborg. In that year a comet was spotted moving across the sky. During this period of time Tycho made many observations, and one of the instruments that he used to make his observations was called a brass azimuthal quadrant. At sixty-five centimeters in radius it was a large instrument built either in 1576 or 1577, just in time for Tycho to use it to observe the path and distance of the 1577 comet. This instrument helped him to accurately track the comet's path as it crossed the orbits of the Solar System.\nA great many more instruments were constructed at Tycho Brahe's new manor on Hven called Uraniborg. It was a combination of a home, observatories and laboratory where he made some of his discoveries along with many of his instruments. Several of these instruments were very large, such as a steel azimuth quadrant equipped with a brass arc that was six feet (or 194 centimeters) in diameter. This and other instruments were placed in the two observatories attached to the manor.\nThe Tychonic cosmological model.\nAlthough Tycho admired Copernicus and was the first to teach his theory in Denmark, he was unable to reconcile Copernican theory with the basic laws of Aristotelian physics, which he believed to be foundational. He was critical of the observational data that Copernicus built his theory on, which he correctly considered to be inaccurate. Instead, Tycho proposed a \"geo-heliocentric\" system in which the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, while the other planets orbited the Sun. His system had many of the observational and computational advantages of Copernicus' system. It provided a safe position for those astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models, but reluctant to accept heliocentrism.\nIt gained a following after 1616, when the Catholic Church declared the heliocentric model to be contrary to philosophy and Christian scripture, and only able to be discussed as a computational convenience. Tycho's system offered a major innovation in that it eliminated the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits. Kepler and other Copernican astronomers, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Tycho to adopt the heliocentric model of the Solar System. To Tycho, the idea of a moving Earth was \"in violation not only of all physical truth but also of the authority of Holy Scripture, which ought to be paramount.\"\nTycho held that the Earth was too sluggish and massive to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens, whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending, were made of aether, a substance not found on Earth, that caused objects to move in a circle. By contrast, objects on Earth seem to have motion only when moved, and the natural state of objects on its surface was rest. Tycho said the Earth was an inert body, not readily moved. He acknowledged that the rising and setting of the Sun and stars could be explained by a rotating Earth, as Copernicus had said, still:\nsuch a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast.\nTycho believed that, if the Earth did orbit the Sun, there should be an observable stellar parallax every six months (the stars' positions would change thanks to Earth's changing position). The lack of any stellar parallax was explained by the Copernican theory as being due to the stars' enormous distances from Earth. Tycho noted and attempted to measure the apparent relative sizes of the stars in the sky. He used geometry to show that the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the Sun to Saturn and to be seen at these distances the stars would have to be gigantic, at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the Sun. Tycho said:\nDeduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.\nCopernicans offered a religious response to Tycho's geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if He wanted. In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho's by saying:\n[W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from here anything of the absurd. These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand. Grant the vastness of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be as great as you like\u00a0\u2013 these will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator. It reckons that the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his majesty. So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?\nReligion played a role in Tycho's geocentrism\u00a0\u2013 he cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest. He rarely used Biblical arguments alone. To him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth's motion, and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously.\nTycho's 1587 geo-heliocentric model differed from those of other geo-heliocentric astronomers, such as Wittich, Reimarus Ursus, Helisaeus Roeslin and David Origanus, in that the orbits of Mars and the Sun intersected. This was because Tycho had come to believe the distance of Mars from the Earth at opposition (that is, when Mars is on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun) was less than that of the Sun from the Earth. Tycho believed this because he came to believe Mars had a greater daily parallax than the Sun. In 1584, in a letter to a fellow astronomer, Brucaeus, he had claimed that Mars had been further than the Sun at the opposition of 1582, because he had observed that Mars had little or no daily parallax. He said he had therefore rejected Copernicus's model because it predicted Mars would be at only two-thirds the distance of the Sun.\nHe apparently later changed his mind to the opinion that Mars at opposition was indeed nearer the Earth than the Sun was, but apparently without any valid observational evidence in any discernible Martian parallax. Such intersecting Martian and solar orbits meant that there could be no solid rotating celestial spheres, because they could not possibly interpenetrate. Arguably, this conclusion was independently supported by the conclusion that the comet of 1577 was superlunary, because it showed less daily parallax than the Moon and thus must pass through any celestial spheres in its transit. While Tycho Brahe and his contemporaries lacked a fully developed alternative to Aristotelian physics, Brahe's comet observations cast significant doubt on its validity.\nLunar theory.\nTycho's distinctive contributions to lunar theory include his discovery of the variation of the Moon's longitude. This represents the largest inequality of longitude after the equation of the center and the evection. He also discovered librations in the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit, relative to the ecliptic (which is not a constant of about 5\u00b0 as had been believed before him, but fluctuates through a range of over a quarter of a degree), and accompanying oscillations in the longitude of the lunar node. These represent perturbations in the Moon's ecliptic latitude. Tycho's lunar theory doubled the number of distinct lunar inequalities, relative to those anciently known, and reduced the discrepancies of lunar theory to about a fifth of their previous amounts. It was published posthumously by Kepler in 1602, and Kepler's own derivative form appears in Kepler's \"Rudolphine Tables\" of 1627.\nSubsequent developments in astronomy.\nKepler used Tycho's records of the motion of Mars to deduce laws of planetary motion, enabling calculation of astronomical tables with unprecedented accuracy (the \"Rudolphine Tables\") and providing powerful support for a heliocentric model of the Solar System.\nGalileo's 1610 telescopic discovery that Venus shows a full set of phases refuted the pure geocentric Ptolemaic model. After that it seems 17th-century astronomy mostly converted to geo-heliocentric planetary models that could explain these phases just as well as the heliocentric model could, but without the latter's disadvantage of the failure to detect any annual stellar parallax that Tycho and others regarded as refuting it.\nThe three main geo-heliocentric models were the Tychonic, the Capellan with just Mercury and Venus orbiting the Sun such as favoured by Francis Bacon, for example, and the extended Capellan model of Riccioli with Mars also orbiting the Sun whilst Saturn and Jupiter orbit the fixed Earth. The Tychonic model was probably the most popular, albeit probably in what was known as 'the semi-Tychonic' version with a daily rotating Earth. This model was advocated by Tycho's ex-assistant and disciple Longomontanus, in his 1622 \"Astronomia Danica\", that was the intended completion of Tycho's planetary model with his observational data, and which was regarded as the canonical statement of the complete Tychonic planetary system. Longomontanus' work was published in several editions and used by many subsequent astronomers. Through him, the Tychonic system was adopted by astronomers as far away as China.\nThe ardent anti-heliocentric French astronomer Jean-Baptiste Morin devised a Tychonic planetary model with elliptical orbits published in 1650 in a simplified, Tychonic version of the \"Rudolphine Tables\". Another geocentric French astronomer, Jacques du Chevreul, rejected Tycho's observations including his description of the heavens and the theory that Mars was below the Sun. Some acceptance of the Tychonic system persisted through the 17th century and in places until the early 18th century. It was supported after a 1633 decree about the Copernican controversy, by \"a flood of pro-Tycho literature\" of Jesuit origin. Among pro-Tycho Jesuits, Ignace Pardies declared in 1691 that it was still the commonly accepted system, and Francesco Blanchinus reiterated that as late as 1728.\nPersistence of the Tychonic system, especially in Catholic countries, has been attributed to its satisfaction of a need, relative to Catholic doctrine, for \"a safe synthesis of ancient and modern\". After 1670, even many Jesuit writers only thinly disguised their Copernicanism. In Germany, the Netherlands, and England, the Tychonic system \"vanished from the literature much earlier\".\nJames Bradley's discovery of stellar aberration, published in 1729, eventually gave direct evidence excluding the possibility of all forms of geocentrism including Tycho's. Stellar aberration could only be satisfactorily explained on the basis that the Earth is in annual orbit around the Sun, with an orbital velocity that combines with the finite speed of the light coming from an observed star or planet, to affect the apparent direction of the body observed.\nWork in medicine, alchemy and astrology.\nTycho worked in medicine and alchemy. He was influenced by the Swiss physician Paracelsus, who considered the human body to be directly affected by celestial bodies. Tycho used Paracelsus's ideas to connect empiricism and natural science, and religion and astrology. Using his herbal garden at Uraniborg, Tycho produced recipes for herbal medicines, and used them to treat fever and plague. His herbal medicines were in use until the end of the 19th century.\nThe expression \"Tycho Brahe days\" referred to \"unlucky days\" that were featured in almanacs from the 1700s onwards, but which have no direct connection to Tycho or his work. Whether because Tycho realized that astrology was not an empirical science, or because he feared religious repercussions, he did not publicise his own astrological work. For example, two of his more astrological treatises, one on weather predictions and an almanac, were published in the names of his assistants, in spite of the fact that he worked on them personally. Some scholars have argued that he lost faith in horoscope astrology over the course of his career, and others that he simply changed his public communication on the topic as he realized that connections with astrology could influence the reception of his empirical astronomical work.\nLegacy.\nBiographies.\nThe first biography of Tycho, which was also the first full-length biography of any scientist, was written by Gassendi in 1654. In 1779, Tycho de Hoffmann wrote of Tycho's life in his history of the Brahe family. In 1913, Johann Dreyer published Tycho's collected works, facilitating further research. Early modern scholarship on Tycho tended to see the shortcomings of his astronomical model, painting him as a mysticist reluctant to accept Copernicanism, and valuing mostly his observations that allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of planetary movement. Especially in Danish scholarship, Tycho was depicted as a mediocre scholar and a traitor to the nation\u00a0\u2013 perhaps because of the important role in Danish historiography of Christian IV as a warrior king.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, scholars began reevaluating his significance, and studies by Kristian Peder Moesgaard, Owen Gingerich, Robert Westman, Victor E. Thoren, John R. Christianson and C. Doris Hellman focused on his contributions to science, and demonstrated that while he admired Copernicus he was simply unable to reconcile his basic theory of physics with the Copernican view. Christianson's work showed the influence of Tycho's Uraniborg as a training center for scientists who after studying with Tycho went on to make contributions in various scientific fields.\nScientific legacy.\nAlthough Tycho's planetary model was soon discredited, his astronomical observations were an essential contribution to the Scientific Revolution. The traditional view of Tycho is that he was primarily an empiricist who set new standards for precise and objective measurements. This appraisal originated in Gassendi's 1654 biography, \"Tychonis Brahe, equitis Dani, astronomorum coryphaei, vita\". It was furthered by Dreyer's biography in 1890, which was long the most influential work on Tycho. According to historian of science Helge Kragh, this assessment grew out of Gassendi's opposition to Aristotelianism and Cartesianism, and fails to account for the diversity of Tycho's activities.\nTycho was the last major astronomer before the invention of the telescope and has been described as the greatest pre-telescopic astronomer.\nThe Tycho Brahe Prize, inaugurated in 2008, is awarded annually by the European Astronomical Society in recognition of the pioneering development or exploitation of European astronomical instrumentation, or major discoveries based largely on such instruments.\nCultural legacy.\nTycho's discovery of the new star was the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Al Aaraaf\". In 1998, \"Sky &amp; Telescope\" magazine published an article by Donald Olson, Marilynn S. Olson and Russell L. Doescher arguing, in part, that Tycho's supernova was also the same \"star that's westward from the pole\" in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".\nTycho is directly referenced in Sarah Williams' poem : \"Reach me down my Tycho Brah\u00e9,\u00a0\u2013 I would know him when we meet\". Though, the poem's oft quoted line comes later: \"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; / I have loved the stars too truly to be fearful of the night.\"\nAlfred Noyes in his \"Watchers of the Sky\" (the first part of \"The Torch-bearers\" of 1922) included a long biographical poem in honour of Brahe, elaborating on the known history in a highly romantic and imaginative way.\nThe lunar crater Tycho is named in his honour, as is the crater Tycho Brahe on Mars and the minor planet 1677 Tycho Brahe in the asteroid belt. The bright supernova, SN\u00a01572, is also known as Tycho's Nova and the Tycho Brahe Planetarium in Copenhagen is also named after him, as is the palm genus \"Brahea\". In 2015, the planet Brahe was named after him as part of the NameExoWorlds campaign.\nBrahe Rock in Antarctica is named after Tycho Brahe.\nIn \"The Expanse\" (novel series) and \"The Expanse\" (TV series) \"Tycho\" is the name of a company known for its large-scale building projects all around the Solar System. The company has their own space station named \"Tycho Station\".\nIn the 1996 video game Descent II, the players' 7th destination planet is named Tycho Brahe.\nAuthor Jerry Holkins' comic alter ego and online handle for Penny Arcade is named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30028", "revid": "50590575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30028", "title": "The A-Team", "text": "American action-adventure television series (1983\u20131987)\nThe A\u2011Team is an American action\u2011adventure television series that aired on NBC from January 23, 1983, to March 8, 1987. Created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo, it follows a fictional squad of former U.S. Army Special Forces commandos who, after being falsely accused of a crime, escape military prison and become soldiers of fortune. Led by the cunning Colonel John\u202f\"Hannibal\" Smith and joined by Lieutenant Templeton \"Faceman\" Peck, Sergeant B.A. Baracus, and Captain H.M. Murdock, the team dedicates itself to helping those in need. \nThe series was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo and was a joint production of Universal Television and Stephen J. Cannell Productions for NBC. A feature film based on the series was released by 20th Century Fox in 2010.\nHistory.\n\"The A-Team\" was created by writers and producers Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo at the behest of Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment's president. Cannell was fired from ABC in the early 1980s, after failing to produce a hit show for the network, and was hired by NBC; his first project was \"The A-Team\". Tartikoff pitched the series to Cannell as a combination of \"The Dirty Dozen\", \"\", \"The Magnificent Seven\", \"Mad Max\" and \"Hill Street Blues\", with \"Mr. T driving the car\".\n\"The A-Team\" was not considered commercially promising, although Cannell has said that George Peppard suggested it would be a huge hit \"before we ever turned on a camera\". The show became popular; the first regular episode, which aired after Super Bowl XVII on January 30, 1983, reached 26.4% of the television audience, placing fourth in the top 10 Nielsen-rated shows.\nThe show is prominent in popular culture for its cartoonish violence (with few injuries even with heavy weapons), formulaic episodes, the team's ingenuity in improvising weaponry and vehicles out of seemingly random parts, and its distinctive theme tune. The show boosted the career of Mr. T, who portrayed the show's initial central character B. A. Baracus. Some of the show's catchphrases, such as \"I love it when a plan comes together\", \"Hannibal's on the jazz\", and \"I ain't gettin' on no plane!\" have appeared on T-shirts and other merchandise.\nThe term \"A-Team\" is a nickname coined for the Operational Detachments Alpha (ODA) of the U.S. Special Forces during the Vietnam War. The U.S. Army Special Forces still uses the term ODA for its 12-man direct operations teams.\nIn a Yahoo! survey of 1,000 US television viewers published in October 2003, \"The A-Team\" was voted the \"oldie\" television show viewers would most like to see revived, beating such popular television series from the 1980s as \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"Knight Rider\".\nPlot.\n\"The A-Team\" has a standard plot structure of independent episodes with few references to past events, and few overarching stories except the characters' continuing motivation to clear their names. In explaining the ratings drop during the show's fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt complained that \"the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome\". Reporter Adrian Lee called the plots \"stunningly simple\" in a 2006 article for \"The Express\" (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements \"as BA's fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items\". The show became emblematic of \"fit-for-TV warfare\" due to its depiction of ferocious combat scenes with lethal weapons, where the participants are never killed and rarely seriously injured, with the notable exception of General Fulbright. (\"See also\" On-screen violence section.)\nAs the television ratings of \"The A-Team\" fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986\u201387 to increase viewership. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative, propositions them to work for him. In exchange, he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions.\nConnections to the Vietnam War.\nAs a back story, the members of the A-Team were originally members of the 5th Special Forces Group during the Vietnam War. In the episode \"Bad Time on the Border\", Lieutenant Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith called them \"ex-Green Berets\". Their commanding officer Colonel Morrison ordered them to rob the Bank of Hanoi to help end the war. They succeeded, but on their return to base four days after the end of the war, they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the enemy and his headquarters burned down, destroying the proof that the A-Team were acting under orders. They were arrested, and imprisoned at Fort Bragg, from which they quickly escaped before trial.\nAn article in the \"New Statesman\" (UK) published shortly after the premiere of \"The A-Team\" in the United Kingdom, characterized it as an idealization of the Vietnam War, and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture.\nEpisodes.\nThe show ran for five seasons on the NBC television network, from January 23, 1983, to December 30, 1986 (with one additional, previously unbroadcast episode shown on March 8, 1987), for a total of 98 episodes.\nCharacters.\n\"The A-Team\" revolves around the four members of a former commando unit, now mercenaries. Their leader is Lieutenant Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith (George Peppard), whose plans tend to be unorthodox but effective. Lieutenant Templeton Peck (Dirk Benedict in the TV series, Tim Dunigan appeared as Templeton Peck in the pilot), usually called \"Face\" or \"Faceman\", is a smooth-talking con man who is second-in-command, and the appropriator of vehicles and other useful items. The team's pilot is Captain H. M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock (Dwight Schultz), who has been declared insane and lives in a Veterans' Affairs mental institution for the first four seasons. The team's strong man and mechanic is Sergeant First Class Bosco \"B.A.\", or \"Bad Attitude\", Baracus (Mr. T).\nUntil the first half of the second season, the team was assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen (Melinda Culea). In the second half of the second season, Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker (Marla Heasley). The character of Tia Fulbright (Tia Carrere), a Vietnam War orphan now living in the United States, was meant to join the team in the fifth season, but she was replaced by Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), who served as the team's special effects expert. Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth season after its second episode.\nCasting.\nAlthough the part of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind, NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor. Therefore, in the pilot, Face was portrayed by Tim Dunigan, who was later replaced by Benedict, with the comment that Dunigan was \"too tall and too young\". According to Dunigan: \"I look even younger on camera than I am. So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school.\"\nTia Carrere was intended to join the principal cast of the show in its fifth season after appearing in the season four finale, providing a tie to the team's inception during the war. Unfortunately for this plan, Carrere was under contract to \"General Hospital\", which prevented her from joining \"The A-Team\". Her character was abruptly dropped as a result.\nAccording to Mr. T in \"Bring Back... The A-Team\" in 2006, the role of B. A. Baracus was written specifically for him. This is corroborated by Cannell's own account of the initial concept proposed by Tartikoff.\nJames Coburn, who co-starred in \"The Magnificent Seven\", was considered for the role of Hannibal in \"The A-Team\", and George Peppard (Hannibal) was the original consideration for the role of Vin (played by Steve McQueen instead) in \"The Magnificent Seven\".\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 scores 53% (19 reviews), and season 5 scores 60% (5 reviews).\nAwards.\n\"The A-Team\" was nominated for three Emmy Awards: in 1983 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the pilot episode, in 1984 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the episode \"When You Comin' Back, Range Rider?\", and in 1987 (Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series) for the episode \"Firing Line\".\nRatings.\nDuring the show's first three seasons, \"The A-Team\" viewership included an average of 20% to 24% of all American television households. The first regular episode (\"Children of Jamestown\"), reached 26.4% of the television watching audience, placing fourth in the top 10 rated shows, according to the Nielsen ratings. By March, \"The A-Team\", now on its regular Tuesday timeslot, dropped to the eighth spot, but rated a 20.5%. During the sweeps week in May of that year, \"The A-Team\" dropped again but remained steady at 18.5%, and rose to 18.8% during the second week of May sweeps. These were the highest ratings NBC had achieved in five years. During the second season, the ratings continued to soar, reaching fourth place in the twenty-highest rated programs, behind \"Dallas\" and \"Simon &amp; Simon\", in January (mid-season), while during the third season, it was beaten out only by two other NBC shows, including \"The Cosby Show\".\nIn the fourth season, \"The A-Team\" experienced a dramatic fall in ratings, as it started to lose its position while television viewership increased. As such, the ratings, while stable, were relatively lower. The season premiere ranked a 17.4% (a 26% audience share on that timeslot) on the Nielsen Rating scale, but ratings quickly declined after that. In October, \"The A-Team\" had fallen to 19th and by Super Bowl Night had fallen further, to 29th on the night where the show had originally scored its first hit three years earlier. For the remainder of its fourth season \"The A-Team\" managed to hang around the 20th spot, far from the top 10 position it had enjoyed during its first three seasons.\nAfter four years on Tuesday, NBC moved \"The A-Team\" to a new timeslot on Friday for what would be its final season. Ratings continued to drop, and \"The A-Team\" later fell out of the top 50. In November 1986, NBC canceled the series, declining to order the last nine episodes of what would have been a 22-episode season. The final season ranked 61st with a 12.8 average rating.\nInternational.\n\"The A-Team\" has been broadcast worldwide and international response has been varied. In 1984, main cast members George Peppard, Mr. T, Dirk Benedict, and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands. Peppard was the first to receive the invitation and thus thought the invitation applied only to him. When the other cast members were also invited, Peppard declined. The immense turn-out for the stars was unforeseen, and they were forced to leave early as a security measure. A video was released in which Schultz apologised and thanked everyone who had attended.\nAlthough ratings soared during its early seasons, many US television critics described the show largely as cartoonish and thereby wrote the series off. Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes, most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans.\nThe show was a huge hit in Italy in the mid-1980s to the 1990s and was also popular in France where it was broadcast as \"L'Agence tous risques\" (literally The all-risk Agency). In Indonesia, \"The A-Team\" also gained success as a big hit since the television network RCTI aired the show in December 1989 until 1994.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They are all Vietnam veterans. The gradual assimilation of Vietnam into acceptable popular mythology, which began solemnly with \"The Deer Hunter\", has reached its culmination with \"The A-Team\": No longer a memory to be hurriedly brushed aside, but heroes of a network adventure show. Their enemy is a comic army officer, Col. Lynch, see \"Sgt. Bilko\", see \"Beetle Bailey\", see \"M*A*S*H\", whose pursuit of our heroes is doomed to slapstick failure. This is classic right-wing American populism; patriotic, macho, anti-authority, and is unlikely to be understood in Britain, where to be right-wing implies an obsequiousness towards officers and the status quo. But right-wing this series certainly is. The bandits, it turns out, are in league with a group of sinister guerrillas who are trying to destabilise the country. Thanks to the A-Team's hearts and minds policy, the villagers rise up and put them to rout, in a 20-minute series of comic-book battle scenes, over-turning cars and airplane stunt-tricks, in which not a single person is hurt.\u2014\u200a\nOn-screen violence.\nThe violence presented in \"The A-Team\" is highly sanitized. People do not have visible wounds and blood though they might have a limp and sling, nor does the A-Team kill people. The results of violence are only ever presented when required for the script. After almost every car crash, there is a brief shot showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck, even in helicopter crashes. However, more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season. According to co-creator Stephen J. Cannell, this part of the show became a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of believability on purpose.\nThe show has been described as cartoonish and likened to \"Tom and Jerry\". Dean P. of the \"Courier-Mail\" described the violence in the show as \"hypocritical\" and that \"the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects.\" Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used \"antineutron bullets\u2014they destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being\". According to certain estimates, an episode of \"The A-Team\" held up to 46 violent acts. Cannell responded: \"They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue.\" Originally, \"The A-Team's\" status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as \"The Cosby Show\", \"Who's the Boss?\" and \"Growing Pains\". John J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" wrote in a 1986 article that \"...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety\".\nGMC Vandura.\nThe 1983 GMC Vandura van used by the A-Team, with its characteristic red stripe, black and red turbine mag wheels, and rooftop spoiler, is an enduring pop culture icon. The customized 1994 GMC van in \"The A-Team\" movie was displayed at the 2010 New York International Auto Show.\nMerchandise.\nThe huge success of the series yielded a vast array of merchandise, including toys, video games, and snacks released worldwide. This includes several sets of trading cards and stickers, action figures from Galoob, B.A.'s van, Face's Corvette, helicopters, trucks, and jeeps from model car manufacturer Ertl. It includes jigsaw puzzles, View-Master reels, an electric race car track, and a TYCO produced train set. Following the original cancellation of the series, further merchandise has appeared as the series has achieved cult status, including an \"A-Team\" van by Hot Wheels. In 2016, Lego released a pack that includes a B.A. Baracus minifigure and constructible van, which unlocks additional \"A-Team\" themed content in the video game \"Lego Dimensions\", including all four team members as playable characters.\nComics.\nMarvel Comics produced a three-issue \"A-Team\" comic book series, which was later reprinted as a trade paperback. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, an \"A-Team\" comic strip appeared for several years in the 1980s as part of the children's television magazine and comic \"Look-In\", to tie in with the British run of the series. It was preceded by a short run in the final year (1984) of \"TV Comic\".\nBooks.\nSeveral novels are based on the series, the first six published in America by Dell and in Britain by Target Books, and the last four only published in Britain. The first six are credited to Charles Heath. The books are generally found in paperback form, although hardback copies (with different cover artwork) were also released.\nIn the United Kingdom from 1985 to 1988, four Annuals were produced, each consisting of text and comic strip stories, puzzles, and photos of the show's stars, with a further one produced by Marvel Comics consisting of several reprinted comic strips, released in 1989 and 1990.\nA Panini set of stickers, which adapt six TV episodes (from the first and earlier second season) using shots from the episodes, can be stuck into an accompanying book, with text under each inserted sticker to narrate the story.\nTheme song and soundtrack.\nThe original main theme composed by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter (in a performance credited to Post) was released on the vinyl LP \"Mike Post\u00a0\u2013 Television Theme Songs\" (Elektra Records E1-60028Y, 1982) and again on the \"Mike Post\u00a0\u2013 Mike Post\" LP (RCA Records AFL1-5183, 1984), both long out-of-print; however, this was not the same version of the theme as on-screen. The theme from seasons two through four (including the opening narration and sound effects), was also released on TVT's \"Television's Greatest Hits: 70s and 80s\". A 7-inch single of the song credited to Post was released on RCA in 1984.\nThe French version of the song has lyrics, which mirror the spoken description of the show in the English opening credits. The theme has been ranked among the best TV themes ever, with TV weatherman Al Roker sharing that opinion, and using the song to \"get jazzed up\" in the morning.\nThough no original music other than the theme has been released, in 1984 EMI issued an album of re-recorded material from the series conducted by Daniel Caine, reissued by Silva Screen on compact disc in 1999, SILVAD 3509.\nVideo games.\nVideo games were released for numerous platforms, mostly as shooter games.\nIn 1983\u201384, \"Saboteur\", first designed by Howard Scott Warshaw, was in development for the Atari 2600 as an action game and was meant to be a sequel to \"Yars\u2019 Revenge\". Atari's then parent Warner-Brothers wanted to convert the game into \"The A-Team\" to fulfill a licensing obligation, and \"Saboteur\" and its contributions to the Yars universe were dropped. This new project retained much of the design and gameplay from its original incarnation during its testing phase with the player primarily controlling a disembodied head representing Mr. T, along with Murdoch, after replacing Hannibal during development, to stop an evil enemy faction from destroying the world with a nuclear weapon. Due to possible licensing issues, \"The A-Team\" wasn't released commercially, instead the prototype would be shelved indefinitely, though it can be played online and downloaded. Eventually, the original finished version of \"Saboteur\" itself, under its original design, plot, and gameplay, would finally see an official release in November 2004 for the first Atari Flashback console.\nIn 1985, \"The A-Team\" was published and released on the Commodore 64 by Courbois Software. It is an action game, in the form of a top-down shooter, in which players assume the role of an unnamed soldier charged with doing battle against the A-Team in the form large floating heads. Players are positioned on the bottom portion of the screen and move left and right, shooting upwards at the A-team as they move left to right, each with their own attack pattern based on the personalities of each character. The player eliminates each member by shooting them enough times, defeating each one to end a round with the process repeated with each round being harder than the last. Players have three lives and are killed on one hit. The game is endless meaning there is no way to complete it. The only achievement during prolonged play is getting the highest score. A strange notable trait this game has the digitized version of the main theme for \"Star Wars\" that plays on the title screen instead of \"The A-Team's\" theme.\nIn 1989, \"El Equipo A\" (Spanish for \"The A-Team\") was developed and published by Zafiro Software Division as a side scrolling shooter for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MS-DOS, and MSX. Gameplay consists of levels scrolling to the left or right depending on the level as players shoot various enemies such as soldiers, tanks, and jeeps while avoiding shooting innocent civilians and the A-Team as they appear on screen. The game is only in Spanish and from most of the gameplay, low quality, and different graphics, the game is a bootleg version of \"Operation Wolf\" each based the original's respective platforms that manages to reuse many of their same overall mechanics as a whole.\nOn June 15, 2010, \"The A-Team\" was released by GameHouse and RealNetworks under Fox Digital Entertainment and is based on the 2010 film for the iPhone as an overhead scrolling, third person, action shooter with cover based mechanics for the purpose of marketing the film. Players control the A-team as they battle enemies with melee hand-to-hand or ranged weapon combat and can switch between each member during levels. Some levels allowed players to control an attack helicopter the shoot enemies and destroy objects. Voice-overs from B.A. Baracus are portrayed by Quinton Jackson from the film.\nProduction.\nFilming.\nThe series was co-produced by former actor John Ashley who narrated the movie.\nWeapons.\nIn early episodes, the team used Colt AR-15 SP1 semi-automatic rifles (with automatic sound effects, simulating the M16), while in later seasons they used the Ruger Mini-14, and on rare occasions, the selective fire AC-556K variant of the Mini-14. Hannibal is also seen using an M60 machine gun (which Hannibal called \"Baby\") in some episodes as well as a Micro-uzi. MAC-11s with parts added to simulate the Uzi appear in at least two early episodes. Hannibal's sidearms are either a nickel-plated Smith &amp; Wesson Model 59, or a stainless steel Smith &amp; Wesson Model 639. Unusually in the episode \"Black Day at Bad Rock\" he is seen carrying a Browning Hi-Power. Face's usual sidearm is a Colt Lawman Mk III, though he does use Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers in latter seasons. Many antagonists and members of the team use 1911s as well. Starting from Season 4, the then-exotic Steyr AUG bullpup rifle also became prominent in the series. \"So many different firearms were used in the 1980s hit \"The A-Team\" that it's impossible to list them all. For five seasons, the wrongly accused foursome used rifles, handguns, submachine guns and shotguns to bring justice for the little guy while trying to stay out of jail. Regardless of the number of explosions or rounds fired, nobody ever got seriously hurt except for the occasional flesh wound of a team member.\" The \"American Rifleman\" declared \"The A-Team\" the Number One Show on Television to regularly feature firearms.\nHome media.\nUniversal Studios has released all five seasons of \"The A-Team\" on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4. In Region 2, a complete series set titled \"The A-Team\u2014The Ultimate Collection\" was released on October 8, 2007. A complete series set was released in Region 1 on June 8, 2010, including 25 discs packaged in a replica of the black van. The complete series set was released in Region 4 on November 3, 2010. All 5 seasons were re-released in Region 2 with new packaging on June 21, 2010. The series was remastered and released on Blu-ray disc in the United Kingdom by Fabulous Films on October 17, 2016.\nLegacy.\n\"Bring Back... The A-Team\" (2006).\nOn May 18, 2006, Channel 4 in the UK attempted to reunite the surviving cast members of \"The A-Team\" for the show \"Bring Back...\" in an episode titled \"Bring Back...The A-Team\". \nJustin Lee Collins presented the challenge, securing interviews and appearances from Dirk Benedict, Dwight Schultz, Marla Heasley, Jack Ging, series co-creator Stephen Cannell, and Mr. T. Collins eventually united Benedict, Schultz, Heasley, Ging and Cannell, along with William Lucking, Lance LeGault, and George Peppard's son, Christian. Mr. T was unable to make the meeting, which took place in the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills, but he appeared on the show for a brief talk with Collins.\nFeature film.\nA feature film based on \"The A-Team\" was released on June 11, 2010, and was produced by 20th Century Fox. The film stars Liam Neeson as Hannibal, Bradley Cooper as Faceman, Quinton Jackson as B.A. and Sharlto Copley as Murdock with Jessica Biel as the team's ally and Patrick Wilson as the film's villain, Agent Lynch, while both Dirk Benedict (Faceman) and Dwight Schultz (Murdock) made brief cameo appearances in the film (as a prisoner using a sunbed and a psychiatrist overseeing Murdock's shock therapy, respectively); because of timing issues, these scenes were moved to the end of the credits. They were later reinserted for the extended-cut of the film.\nReboot series.\nIn September 2015, Fox announced the development of a reboot \"A-Team\" series with Chris Morgan as executive producer with Cannell's daughter, Tawnia McKiernan, and Albert Kim writing. The team had male and female characters but the project did not make it to the screen.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30029", "revid": "26910586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30029", "title": "Terry Pratchett", "text": "English fantasy author (1948\u20132015)\nSir Terence David John Pratchett (28 April 1948 \u2013 12 March 2015) was an English author, humorist, and satirist, best known for the \"Discworld\" series of 41 comic fantasy novels published between 1983 and 2015, and for the apocalyptic comedy novel \"Good Omens\" (1990), which he co-wrote with Neil Gaiman.\nPratchett's first novel, \"The Carpet People\", was published in 1971. The first \"Discworld\" novel, \"The Colour of Magic\", was published in 1983, after which Pratchett wrote an average of two books a year. The final \"Discworld\" novel, \"The Shepherd's Crown\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death.\nWith more than 100\u00a0million books sold worldwide in 43\u00a0languages, Pratchett was the UK's best-selling author of the 1990s. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted for services to literature in the 2009 New Year Honours. In 2001, he won the annual Carnegie Medal for \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\", the first \"Discworld\" book marketed for children. He received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010.\nIn December 2007 Pratchett announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. He later made a substantial public donation to the Alzheimer's Research Trust (now Alzheimer's Research UK, ARUK), filmed three television programmes chronicling his experiences with the condition for the BBC, and became a patron of ARUK. Pratchett died on 12 March 2015, at the age of 66.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and education.\nPratchett was born on 28 April 1948 in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, England, the only child of David (1921\u20132006), a mechanic, and Eileen Pratchett (1922\u20132010), a secretary, of Hay-on-Wye. His maternal grandparents came from Ireland. Pratchett attended Holtspur School, where he was bullied for his speech impediments. He was disliked by the head teacher, who, Pratchett said, thought \"he could tell how successful you were going to be in later life by how well you could read or write at the age of six\".\nPratchett's family moved to Bridgwater, Somerset, briefly in 1957. He passed his eleven plus exam in 1958, earning a place at High Wycombe Technical High School, where he was a key member of the debating society and wrote stories for the school magazine. Pratchett described himself as a \"non-descript\" student and, in his \"Who's Who\" entry, credited his education to the Beaconsfield Public Library.\nPratchett's early interests included astronomy. He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned a telescope and wanted to be an astronomer, but lacked the necessary mathematical skills. He developed an interest in science fiction and attended science fiction conventions from about 1963\u20131964, but stopped a few years later when he got his first job as a trainee journalist at the local paper. His early reading included the works of H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and \"every book you really ought to read\", which he later regarded as \"getting an education\".\nPratchett published his first short story, \"Business Rivals\", in the High Wycombe Technical School's magazine in 1962. It is the tale of a man named Crucible who finds the Devil in his flat in a cloud of sulphurous smoke. \"The Hades Business\" was published in the school magazine when he was 13, and published commercially when he was 15.\nPratchett earned five O-levels and started A-level courses in Art, English and History. His initial career choice was journalism and he left school at 17, in 1965, to start an apprenticeship with Arthur Church, the editor of the \"Bucks Free Press\". In this position he wrote, among other things, more than 80 stories for the \"Children's Circle\" section under the name Uncle Jim. Two of the stories contain characters found in his novel \"The Carpet People\" (1971). While on day release from his apprenticeship, Pratchett finished his A-Level in English and took the National Council for the Training of Journalists proficiency course.\nCareer.\nIn 1968 Pratchett interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director of a small publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. Pratchett mentioned that he had written a manuscript, \"The Carpet People\". Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by Pratchett. It received strong, although few, reviews and was followed by the science fiction novels \"The Dark Side of the Sun\" (1976) and \"Strata\" (1981). In the 1970s and 1980s, Pratchett published stories in a regional newspaper under the pseudonym Patrick Kearns.\nAfter various positions in journalism, in 1979 Pratchett became press officer for the South West Region of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in an area that contained three nuclear power stations. He later joked that he had demonstrated \"impeccable timing\" by making this career change so soon after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania, US, and said he would \"write a book about his experiences if he thought anyone would actually believe them\".\nThe first \"Discworld\" novel, \"The Colour of Magic\", was published in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. Pratchett gave up working for the CEGB to make his living through writing in 1987, after finishing the fourth \"Discworld\" novel, \"Mort\". His sales increased quickly and many of his books occupied top places on bestseller lists; he was the UK's bestselling author of the 1990s. According to \"The Times\", Pratchett was the top-selling and highest earning UK author in 1996. Some of his books have been published by Doubleday, another Transworld imprint. In the United States, where his books are published by HarperCollins, Pratchett had poorer sales, marketing and distribution until 2005, when \"Thud!\" reached the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\nAccording to the \"Bookseller's Pocket Yearbook\" (2005), in 2003 Pratchett's UK sales amounted to 3.4% of the fiction market by hardback sales and 3.8% by value, putting him in second place behind J. K. Rowling (6% and 5.6%, respectively), while in the paperback sales list Pratchett came 5th with 1.2% and 1.3% by value (behind James Patterson (1.9% and 1.7%), Alexander McCall Smith, John Grisham and J. R. R. Tolkien). He has UK sales of more than 2.5\u00a0million copies a year. His 2011 \"Discworld\" novel \"Snuff\" became the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. As of 2023, Pratchett's works have sold more than 100\u00a0million copies in 43\u00a0languages.\nPersonal life.\nPratchett married Lyn Purves at the Congregational Church, Gerrards Cross, on 5 October 1968. They moved to Rowberrow, Somerset, in 1970. Their daughter Rhianna Pratchett, also a writer, was born there in 1976. In 1993 the family moved to Broad Chalke, a village west of Salisbury, Wiltshire.\nPratchett was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library. In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library, which he had visited as a child, and donated the income from the event to it. He also visited his former school to speak to the students.\nPratchett often wore large black hats, in a style described as \"more that of urban cowboy than city gent\". Concern for the future of civilisation prompted him to install five kilowatts of photovoltaic cells (for solar energy) at his house in 2007.\nPratchett had an observatory built in his back garden and was a keen astronomer from childhood. He made a 2005 appearance on the BBC programme \"The Sky at Night\" and appeared on the 50th anniversary of the show in 2007. He travelled on a cruise ship from Taiwan to watch the 2009 solar eclipse.\nComputing.\nPratchett started to use computers for writing as soon as they were available to him. His first computer was a ZX81; the first computer he used properly for writing was an Amstrad CPC 464, later replaced by an IBM PC compatible. Pratchett was one of the first authors to routinely use the Internet to communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992. However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another \"thing to use\". He had many computers in his house, with a bank of six monitors to ease writing. When he travelled, he always took a portable computer, originally a 1992 Olivetti Quaderno, with him to write.\nIn a 1995 interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Pratchett expressed concern about the potential spread of misinformation online. He felt that there was a \"kind of parity of esteem of information\" on the internet, and gave the example of Holocaust denial being presented on the same terms as peer-reviewed research, with no easy way to gauge reliability. Gates disagreed, saying that online authorities would index and check facts and sources in a much more sophisticated way than in print. The interview was rediscovered in 2019, and seen by Pratchett's biographer as prescient of fake news.\nPratchett was an avid video game player, and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books. He favoured games that are \"intelligent and have some depth\", citing \"Half-Life 2\" (2004) and fan missions for \"Thief\" as examples. The red army in \"Interesting Times\" prompted comparisons to the 1991 puzzle game \"Lemmings\". When asked about this connection, Pratchett said: \"Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that\u00a0... Not only did I wipe \"Lemmings\" from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back.\" He described \"\" (2006) as his favourite video game, saying that he used many of its non-combat-oriented fan-made mods, and contributed to the development of at least one popular fan-made mod.\nNatural history.\nPratchett had a fascination with natural history that he referred to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of carnivorous plants. He described them in the biographical notes on the dust jackets of some of his books, and elsewhere, as \"not as interesting as people think\". By \"Carpe Jugulum\" the account had become that \"he used to grow carnivorous plants, but now they've taken over the greenhouse and he avoids going in\".\nIn 1995, a fossil of a sea-turtle from the Eocene epoch of New Zealand was named \"Psephophorus terrypratchetti\" in his honour by the palaeontologist Richard K\u00f6hler (his Discworld being a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle).\nIn 2016, Pratchett fans unsuccessfully petitioned the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to name chemical element 117, temporarily called \"ununseptium\", as \"octarine\" with the proposed symbol Oc (pronounced \"ook\"). The final name chosen for element 117 was \"tennessine\" with the symbol Ts.\nPratchett was a trustee for the Orangutan Foundation but was pessimistic about the future of orangutans. His activities included visiting Borneo with a Channel 4 film crew to make an episode of \"Jungle Quest\" in 1995, seeing orangutans in their natural habitat. Following Pratchett's lead, fan events such as the Discworld Conventions have adopted Orangutan Foundation as their nominated charity, which has been acknowledged by the foundation. One of Pratchett's most popular fictional characters, the Librarian, is a wizard who was transformed into an orangutan in a magical accident and decides to remain in that condition as it is so convenient for his work.\nViews on religion.\nPratchett, who was brought up in a Church of England family, described himself as an atheist and a humanist. He was a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.\nPratchett wrote that he read the Old Testament as a child and \"was horrified\", but liked the New Testament and thought that Jesus \"had a lot of good things to say ... But I could never see the two testaments as one coherent narrative\". He then read \"On the Origin of Species\", which \"all made perfect sense ... Evolution was far more thrilling to me than the biblical account.\" He said that he had never disliked religion and thought it had a purpose in human evolution. In an interview Pratchett cites a quotation from the protagonist in his novel \"Nation\", \"It is better to build a seismograph than to worship the volcano\", a statement Pratchett said he agreed with.\nPratchett told \"The Times\" in 2008: \"I believe in the same God that Einstein did ... And it is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that on the other side of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows.\" In an interview on \"Front Row\" he described an experience of hearing his dead father's voice and feeling a sense of peace. Commentators took these statements to mean that Pratchett had become religious, but Pratchett responded in an article published in the \"Daily Mail\" in which he denied that he had found God, and clarified that he believed the voice had come from a memory of his father and a sense of personal elation.\nAlzheimer's disease diagnosis.\nIn August 2007, Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke a few years before, which doctors believed had damaged the right side of his brain. In December 2007, he announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which had been responsible for the \"stroke\". He had a rare form of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a disease in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel.\nDescribing the diagnosis as an \"embuggerance\" in a radio interview, Pratchett appealed to people to \"keep things cheerful\" and proclaimed that \"we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism\". He stated he felt he had time for \"at least a few more books yet\", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask \"is there anything I can do?\", in this case he would only entertain such offers from \"very high-end experts in brain chemistry\". Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech-recognition software.\nIn March 2008, Pratchett announced he was donating \u00a3494,000 (about US$1,000,000) to the Alzheimer's Research Trust (later called Alzheimer's Research UK), and that he was shocked \"to find out that funding for Alzheimer's research is just 3% of that to find cancer cures\". He said: \"I am, along with many others, scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along.\"\nIn April 2008, Pratchett worked with the BBC to make a two-part documentary series about his illness, \"Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer's\". The first part was broadcast on BBC Two on 4 February 2009, drawing 2.6 million viewers and a 10.4% audience share. The second, broadcast on 11 February 2009, drew 1.72 million viewers and a 6.8% audience share. The documentary won a BAFTA award in the Factual Series category.\nOn 26 November 2008, Pratchett met Prime Minister Gordon Brown and asked for an increase in dementia-research funding. Pratchett tested a prototype device to address his condition. The ability of the device to alter the course of the illness has been met with scepticism from Alzheimer's researchers.\nIn an article published in 2009 Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (a term he disliked) before his disease progressed to a critical point. He later said that he felt \"it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help, rather than suffer\". Pratchett was selected to give the 2010 BBC Richard Dimbleby Lecture, \"Shaking Hands With Death\", broadcast on 1 February 2010. Pratchett introduced his lecture on the topic of assisted death (he preferred this to the term \"assisted suicide\"), but the main text was read by his friend Tony Robinson because his condition made it difficult for him to read. In June 2011, Pratchett presented a BBC television documentary, \",\" about assisted suicide. It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish BAFTAs in November 2011.\nIn September 2012, Pratchett told an interviewer: \"I have to tell you that I thought I'd be a lot worse than this by now, and so did my specialist.\" In the same interview he said that the cognitive part of his mind was \"untouched\" and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA). However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, citing his condition and \"other age-related ailments\".\nDeath and legacy.\nPratchett died at his home from complications of Alzheimer's disease on the morning of 12 March 2015. He was 66 years old. \"The Telegraph\" reported an unidentified source as saying that, despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide, his death had been natural. After Pratchett's death, his assistant, Rob Wilkins, wrote from the official Terry Pratchett Twitter account:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublic figures who paid tribute included Prime Minister David Cameron, the comedian Ricky Gervais, and the authors Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Brooks, Margaret Atwood, George R. R. Martin and Neil Gaiman. Pratchett was memorialised in graffiti in East London. The video game companies Frontier Developments and Valve added elements to their games named after him. Users of the social news site Reddit organised a tribute by which an HTTP header, \"codice_1\", was added to websites' responses, a reference to the \"Discworld\" novel \"Going Postal\", in which \"the clacks\" (a semaphore system, used as \"Discworld\"'s equivalent to a telegraph) are programmed to repeat the name of its creator's deceased son; the sentiment in the novel is that no one is ever forgotten as long as their name is still spoken. A June 2015 web server survey reported that approximately 84,000 websites had been configured with the header. Pratchett's humanist funeral service was held in Salisbury on 25 March 2015.\nIn 2015, Pratchett's estate announced an endowment in perpetuity to the University of South Australia. The Sir Terry Pratchett Memorial Scholarship supports a Masters scholarship at the university's Hawke Research Institute. In 2023, several stories published in a regional newspaper between 1970 and 1975 under the pen name Patrick Kearns were discovered to have been authored by Pratchett. They were published along with a handful of other uncollected stories as \"\" in October 2023.\nAwards and honours.\nPratchett received a knighthood for \"services to literature\" in the 2009 UK New Year Honours list. He was previously appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, also for \"services to literature\", in 1998. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Pratchett commented in the \"Ansible\" science fiction/fan newsletter, \"I suspect the 'services to literature' consisted of refraining from trying to write any\", but added, \"Still, I cannot help feeling mightily chuffed about it.\" On 31 December 2008, it was announced that Pratchett would be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. Afterwards he said, \"You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword.\" In 2010, Pratchett created his own sword from deposits of iron he had found in a field near his home as he believed a knight should have a sword.\nTen honorary doctorates were conferred on Pratchett: from the University of Warwick in 1999, the University of Portsmouth in 2001, the University of Bath in 2003, the University of Bristol in 2004, Buckinghamshire New University in 2008, the University of Dublin in 2008, Bradford University in 2009, University of Winchester in 2009, The Open University in 2013 for his contribution to Public Service and his last, from the University of South Australia, in May 2014. \nPratchett was made an adjunct Professor in the School of English at Trinity College Dublin in 2010, with a role in postgraduate education in creative writing and popular literature.\nPratchett won the British Book Awards' \"Fantasy and Science Fiction Author of the Year\" category in 1994, the British Science Fiction Award in 1989 for his novel \"Pyramids\", and a Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2008 for \"Making Money\". He won the 2001 Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, which recognised \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\" as the year's best children's book published in the UK. \"Night Watch\" won the 2003 Prometheus Award for best libertarian novel. Four of the five \"Discworld\" novels that centre on the trainee witch Tiffany Aching won the annual Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2016. In 2005, \"Going Postal\" was shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel; however, Pratchett recused himself, stating that stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of Worldcon. In the same year, \"A Hat Full of Sky\" won a Mythopoeic Award. In 2008, \"Making Money\" was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel. \"I Shall Wear Midnight\" won the 2010 Andre Norton Award, presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) as a part of the Nebula Award ceremony.\nIn 2016 the SFWA named Pratchett the recipient of Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award, given for \"significant impact on the science fiction or fantasy landscape\". He received the NESFA Skylark Award in 2009 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010. In 2011 he won Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association, a lifetime honour for \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\". The librarians cited nine \"Discworld\" novels published from 1983 to 2004 and observed that \"Pratchett's tales of Discworld have won over generations of teen readers with intelligence, heart, and undeniable wit. Comic adventures that fondly mock the fantasy genre, the Discworld novels expose the hypocrisies of contemporary society in an intricate, ever-expanding universe. With satisfyingly multilayered plots, Pratchett's humor honors the intelligence of the reader. Teens eagerly lose themselves in a universe with no maps.\" In 2003 the BBC conducted The Big Read to identify the \"Nation's Best-loved Novel\" and finally published a ranked list of the \"Top 200\". Pratchett's highest-ranking novel was \"Mort\", number 65, but he and Charles Dickens were the only authors with five in the Top 100 (four of his were from the \"Discworld\" series). He also led all authors with fifteen novels in the Top 200.\nAn asteroid (127005 Pratchett) is named after Pratchett. In 2013 Pratchett was named Humanist of the Year by the British Humanist Association for his campaign to fund research into Alzheimers, his contribution to the right to die public debate and his Humanist values. Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novels have led to dedicated conventions, the first in Manchester in 1996, then worldwide, often with the author as guest of honour. Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book-signing tour; queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as he continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received a large amount of fan mail from them. Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing what they think about his books, saying that since he was well paid for his novels, his fans were \"everything\" to him.\nIn March 2017, Beaconsfield Town Council commissioned a commemorative plaque dedicated to Pratchett for Beaconsfield Library.\nCoat of Arms.\nIn 2010, Pratchett was granted his own coat of arms following his knighthood. The arms were designed by Hubert Chesshyre and granted by Letters Patent of Garter and Clarenceux Kings of Arms. The owl is a morepork, which taken together with the ankh is a reference to the city of Ankh-Morpork. The image of a morpork holding an ankh appears in the fictional Ankh-Morpork City Arms. The motto \"Noli Timere Messorem\" is a corrected version of the dog Latin \"Non Timetis Messor\", the motto of Death's son-in-law and former apprentice, Mort of Sto Helit and his heirs. The phrase is a reference to the song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" by Blue \u00d6yster Cult.\nWriting.\nPratchett said that to write, one must read extensively, both inside and outside one\u2019s chosen genre and to the point of \"overflow\". He advised that writing is hard work, and that writers must \"make grammar, punctuation and spelling a part of your life\". However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as \"an unavoidable consequence\" rather than the reason for writing.\nFantasy genre.\nAlthough during his early career he wrote for the science fiction and horror genres, Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy, and said: \"It is easier to bend the universe around the story.\" In the acceptance speech for his Carnegie Medal, he said: \"Fantasy isn't just about wizards and silly wands. It's about seeing the world from new directions\", pointing to the \"Harry Potter\" novels and \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the same speech, he acknowledged benefits of these works for the genre.\nPratchett believed he owed \"a debt to the science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of\" and disliked the term \"magical realism\", which, he said, is \"like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people\". He expressed annoyance that fantasy is \"unregarded as a literary form\", arguing that it \"is the oldest form of fiction\"; he said he was infuriated when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental to the way we understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.\nStyle and themes.\nPratchett's earliest \"Discworld\" novels were written largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the \"Discworld\" series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) satire.\nPratchett had a tendency to avoid using chapters, arguing in a Book Sense interview that \"life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and Homer did not write in chapters\", adding \"I'm blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults\". However, there were exceptions; \"Going Postal\" and \"Making Money\" and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters. Pratchett said that he used chapters in the young adult novels because \"[his] editor screams until [he] does\", but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary \"stopping point\" that got in the way of the narrative.\nCharacters, place names, and titles in Pratchett's books often contain puns, allusions and cultural references. Some characters are parodies of well-known characters: for example, Pratchett's character Cohen the Barbarian, also called Ghengiz Cohen, is a parody of Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan, and his character Leonard of Quirm is a parody of Leonardo da Vinci.\nAnother feature of his writing is the use of dialogue in small capitals, without quotation marks, for utterances by the character Death.\nPratchett was an only child, and his characters are often without siblings. Pratchett explained, \"In fiction only children are the interesting ones.\"\n\"Discworld\" novels often included a modern innovation and its introduction to the world's medieval setting, such as a public police force (\"Guards! Guards!\"), guns (\"Men at Arms\"), cinema (\"Moving Pictures\"), investigative journalism (\"The Truth\"), the postage stamp (\"Going Postal\"), modern banking (\"Making Money\"), and the steam engine (\"Raising Steam\"). The \"clacks\", the tower-to-tower semaphore system that sprang up in later novels, is a mechanical optical telegraph (as created by the Chappe brothers and employed during the French Revolution) before wired electric telegraph chains, with all the change and turmoil that such an advancement implies. The resulting social upheaval driven by these changes serves as the setting for the main story.\nInfluences.\nPratchett's earliest inspirations were \"The Wind in the Willows\" by Kenneth Grahame, and the works of H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His literary influences were P.G. Wodehouse, Tom Sharpe, Jerome K. Jerome, Roy Lewis, Alan Coren, G. K. Chesterton, and Mark Twain.\nWorks.\n\"Discworld\".\nThe \"Discworld\" series consists of 41 novels and a variety of supporting material. Pratchett began writing the \"Discworld\" series in order to \"have fun with some of the cliches\". The Discworld is a large disc resting on the backs of four giant elephants, all supported by the giant turtle Great A'Tuin as it swims its way through space. The books were published essentially in chronological order, and advancements can be seen in the development of the Discworld civilisations, such as the creation of paper money in Ankh-Morpork.\n\"The Science of Discworld\".\nPratchett wrote four \"Science of Discworld\" books in collaboration with professor of mathematics Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, both of the University of Warwick: \"The Science of Discworld\" (1999), ' (2002), ' (2005), and \"\" (2013).\nAll four books have chapters that alternate between fiction and non-fiction: the fictional chapters are set within the Discworld universe, where characters observe, and experiment on, a universe with the same physics as ours. The non-fiction chapters (written by Stewart and Cohen) explain the science behind the fictional events.\nIn 1999, Pratchett appointed both Cohen and Stewart as \"Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University\" at the same ceremony at which the University of Warwick awarded him an honorary degree.\n\"Folklore of Discworld\".\nPratchett collaborated with the folklorist Dr Jacqueline Simpson on \"The Folklore of Discworld\" (2008), a study of the relationship between many of the persons, places and events described in the \"Discworld\" books and their counterparts in myths, legends, fairy tales and folk customs on Earth.\nOther writing.\nPratchett's first two adult novels, \"The Dark Side of the Sun\" (1976) and \"Strata\" (1981), were both science fiction, the latter taking place partly on a disc-shaped world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his \"Discworld\" series and novels for children, with two exceptions: \"Good Omens\" (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which was nominated for both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and \"Nation\" (2008), a book for young adults.\nAfter writing \"Good Omens\" Pratchett brainstormed with Larry Niven on a story that became the short novel \"Rainbow Mars\". Niven eventually completed the story on his own, but he states in the afterword that a number of Pratchett's ideas remained in the finished version. Pratchett also collaborated with the British science fiction author Stephen Baxter on a parallel Earth series. The first novel, entitled \"The Long Earth\" was published on 21 June 2012. A second novel, \"The Long War\", was released on 18 June 2013. \"The Long Mars\" was published in 2014. The fourth book in the series, \"The Long Utopia\", was published in June 2015, and the fifth, \"The Long Cosmos\", in June 2016.\nIn 2012, the first volume of Pratchett's collected short fiction was published under the title \"A Blink of the Screen\". In 2014 a similar collection was published of Pratchett's non-fiction, entitled \"A Slip of the Keyboard\".\nPratchett wrote parts of the dialogue for a mod for the game ' (2006), which added a Nord companion named Vilja. He also worked on a similar mod for ' (2011), which featured Vilja's great-great-granddaughter.\nChildren's literature.\nPratchett's first children's novel was also his first published novel: \"The Carpet People\" in 1971, which Pratchett substantially rewrote and re-released in 1992. The next, \"Truckers\" (1988), was the first in \"The Nome Trilogy\" of novels for young readers (also known as \"The Bromeliad Trilogy\"), about small gnome-like creatures called \"Nomes\", and the trilogy continued in \"Diggers\" (1990) and \"Wings\" (1990). Subsequently, Pratchett wrote the \"Johnny Maxwell\" trilogy, about the adventures of a boy called Johnny Maxwell and his friends, comprising \"Only You Can Save Mankind\" (1992), \"Johnny and the Dead\" (1993) and \"Johnny and the Bomb\" (1996). \"Nation\" (2008) marked his return to the non-\"Discworld\" children's novel, and this was followed in 2012 by \"Dodger\", a children's novel set in Victorian London. On 21 November 2013 Doubleday Children's released Pratchett's \"Jack Dodger's Guide to London\".\nIn 2001, he wrote \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\", his first \"Discworld\" book marketed for children.\nPratchett also wrote a five-book children's series featuring a trainee witch, Tiffany Aching, and taking place on \"Discworld\", beginning with The Wee Free Men in 2003.\nIn September 2014, a collection of children's stories, \"Dragons at Crumbling Castle\", written by Pratchett, and illustrated by Mark Beech, was published. This was followed by another collection, \"The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner\", also illustrated by Mark Beech, in 2016. A third volume, \"Father Christmas's Fake Beard\", was released in 2017. A fourth collection, \"The Time-travelling Caveman\", was released in September 2020. A final collection, \"\", was published in October 2023, collecting 20 stories written by Pratchett for newspapers in the 1970s and 80s under pseudonyms such as \"Patrick Kearns\" which had not previously been attributed to Pratchett.\nUnfinished texts.\nPratchett's daughter, the writer Rhianna Pratchett, is the custodian of the \"Discworld\" franchise. She said that she had no plans to publish her father's unfinished work or continue the \"Discworld\" series. Pratchett told Neil Gaiman that anything that he had been working on at the time of his death should be destroyed by a steamroller. On 25\u00a0August 2017 his former assistant Rob Wilkins fulfilled this wish by arranging for Pratchett's hard drive to be crushed under a steamroller at the Great Dorset Steam Fair.\nAccording to Wilkins, Pratchett left \"an awful lot\" of unfinished writing, \"10\u00a0titles I know of and fragments from many other bits and pieces\". Pratchett had mentioned two new texts, \"Scouting for Trolls\" and a \"Discworld\" novel following a new character. The notes left behind outline ideas about \"how the old folk of the Twilight Canyons solve the mystery of a missing treasure and defeat the rise of a Dark Lord despite their failing memories\"; \"the secret of the crystal cave and the carnivorous plants in the Dark Incontinent\", about Constable Feeney of the Watch, first introduced in \"Snuff\", involving how he \"solves a whodunnit among the congenitally decent and honest goblins\"; and a second book about Amazing Maurice from \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\".\nWorks about Pratchett.\nA collection of essays about Pratchett's writings is compiled in the book \"Terry Pratchett: Guilty of Literature\", edited by Andrew M. Butler, Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, published by Science Fiction Foundation in 2000. A second, expanded edition was published by Old Earth Books in 2004. Andrew M. Butler wrote the \"Pocket Essentials Guide to Terry Pratchett\" published in 2001. \"Writers Uncovered: Terry Pratchett\" is a biography for young readers by Vic Parker, published by Heinemann Library in 2006.\nA BBC docudrama based on Pratchett's life, \"Terry Pratchett: Back In Black\", was broadcast in February 2017, starring Paul Kaye as Pratchett. Neil Gaiman was involved with the project which used Pratchett's own words. Pratchett's assistant, Rob Wilkins, said that Pratchett was working on this documentary before he died. According to the BBC, finishing it would \"show the author was still having the last laugh\".\nThe English author, critic and performer Marc Burrows wrote an unofficial biography, \"The Magic of Terry Pratchett\", published by Pen &amp; Sword on 6 July 2020. Though it was not endorsed by the Pratchett estate, prior to its publication they did wish Burrows \"all the best\" regarding the book through the official Pratchett Twitter account. It received generally favourable reviews and won the 2021 Locus Award for Non-Fiction.\nIn 2022, Wilkins wrote the official biography, \"Terry Pratchett: A Life with Footnotes\". The biography was well received. In \"The Daily Telegraph\", Tristram Fane Saunders wrote that it \"spins magic from mundanity in precisely the way Pratchett himself did\". However, in a review for the \"Irish Independent\", Kevin Power called it more a collection of fan notes than a serious biography.\nIn April 2023, \"Entering Discworld Population\", an episode of the podcast \"Imaginary Worlds\", was released to mark the 75th anniversary of Pratchett's birth. It discussed four of Pratchett's recurring fiction characters as representative of his underlying philosophy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30030", "revid": "50147426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30030", "title": "Treaty of Versailles", "text": "One of the treaties that ended World War I\nThe Treaty of Versailles was a peace treaty signed on 28 June 1919. As the most important treaty of World War\u00a0I, it ended the state of war between Germany and most of the Allied Powers. It was signed in the Palace of Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to the war. The other Central Powers on the German side signed separate treaties. Although the armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the actual fighting, and agreed certain principles and conditions including the payment of reparations, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. Germany was not allowed to participate in the negotiations before signing the treaty.\nThe treaty required Germany to disarm, make territorial concessions, extradite alleged war criminals, agree to Kaiser Wilhelm being put on trial, recognise the independence of states whose territory had previously been part of the German Empire, and pay reparations to the Entente powers. The most critical and controversial provision in the treaty was: \"The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\" The other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles. This article, Article 231, became known as the \"War Guilt\" clause.\nCritics including John Maynard Keynes declared the treaty too harsh, styling it as a \"Carthaginian peace\", and saying the reparations were excessive and counterproductive. On the other hand, prominent Allied figures such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently. This is still the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists.\nThe result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one satisfied. In particular, Germany was neither pacified nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The United States never ratified the Versailles treaty; instead it made a separate peace treaty with Germany, albeit based on the Versailles treaty. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers. The reparation system was reorganized and payments reduced in the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. Bitter resentment of the treaty powered the rise of the Nazi Party, and eventually the outbreak of a second World War.\nAlthough it is often referred to as the \"Versailles Conference\", only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the \"Big Four\" meetings taking place generally at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay.\nBackground.\nFirst World War.\nWar broke out following the July Crisis in 1914. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, followed quickly by Germany declaring war on Russia on 1 August, and on Belgium and France on 3 August. The German invasion of Belgium on 3 August led to a declaration of war by Britain on Germany on 4 August, creating the conflict that became the First World War. Two alliances faced off, the Central Powers (led by Germany) and the Triple Entente (led by Britain, France and Russia). Other countries entered as fighting raged widely across Europe, as well as the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Having seen the overthrow of the Tsarist regime in the February Revolution and the Kerensky government in the October Revolution, the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic under Vladimir Lenin in March 1918 signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, amounting to a surrender that was highly favourable to Germany. Sensing victory before the American Expeditionary Forces could be ready, Germany now shifted forces to the Western Front and tried to overwhelm the Allies. It failed. Instead, the Allies won decisively on the battlefield, overwhelmed Germany's Turkish, Austrian, and Bulgarian allies, and forced an armistice in November 1918 that resembled a surrender.\nRole of the Fourteen Points.\nThe United States entered the war against the Central Powers in 1917 and President Woodrow Wilson played a significant role in shaping the peace terms. His expressed aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions. On 8 January 1918, Wilson issued the Fourteen Points. They outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, and democracy. While the term was not used, self-determination was assumed. It called for a negotiated end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states.\nIt called for what it characterised as a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexation. The Fourteen Points were based on the research of the Inquiry, a team of about 150 advisors led by foreign-policy advisor Edward M. House, into the topics likely to arise in the expected peace conference.\nArmistice.\nDuring the autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. Desertion rates within the German army began to increase, and civilian strikes drastically reduced war production. On the Western Front, the Allied forces launched the Hundred Days Offensive and decisively defeated the German western armies. Sailors of the Imperial German Navy at Kiel mutinied in response to the naval order of 24 October 1918, which prompted uprisings in Germany, which became known as the German Revolution. The German government tried to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that they surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.\nMany aspects of the Versailles treaty that were later criticised were agreed first in the 11 November armistice agreement, whilst the war was still ongoing. These included the German evacuation of German-occupied France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Alsace-Lorraine, and the left bank of the Rhine (all of which were to be administered by the Allies under the armistice agreement), the surrender of a large quantity of war materiel, and the agreed payment of \"reparation for damage done\".\nGerman forces evacuated occupied France, Belgium, and Luxembourg within the fifteen days required by the armistice agreement. By late 1918, Allied troops had entered Germany and began the occupation of the Rhineland under the agreement, in the process establishing bridgeheads across the Rhine in case of renewed fighting at Cologne, Koblenz, and Mainz. Allied and German forces were additionally to be separated by a 10\u00a0km-wide demilitarised zone.\nBlockade.\nBoth Germany and Great Britain were dependent on imports of food and raw materials, most of which had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The Blockade of Germany was a naval operation conducted by the Allied Powers to stop the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs reaching the Central Powers. The German was mainly restricted to the German Bight and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that 763,000 German civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at 424,000 people.\nThe blockade was maintained for eight months after the Armistice in November 1918, into the following year of 1919. Foodstuffs imports into Germany were controlled by the Allies after the Armistice with Germany until Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. In March 1919, Churchill informed the House of Commons, that the ongoing blockade was a success and \"Germany is very near starvation.\" From January 1919 to March 1919, Germany refused to agree to Allied demands that Germany surrender its merchant ships to Allied ports to transport food supplies. Some Germans considered the armistice to be a temporary cessation of the war and knew, if fighting broke out again, their ships would be seized. Over the winter of 1919, the situation became desperate and Germany finally agreed to surrender its fleet in March. The Allies then allowed for the import of 270,000 tons of foodstuffs.\nBoth German and non-German observers have argued that these were the most devastating months of the blockade for German civilians, though disagreement persists as to the extent and who is truly at fault. According to Max Rubner 100,000 German civilians died due to the continuation blockade after the armistice. In the UK, Labour Party member and anti-war activist Robert Smillie issued a statement in June 1919 condemning continuation of the blockade, claiming 100,000 German civilians had died as a result.\nNegotiations.\nTalks between the Allies to establish a common negotiating position started on 18 January 1919, in the (Clock Room) at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris.\nInitially, 70 delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. Russia was excluded due to their signing of a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and early withdrawal from the war. Furthermore, German negotiators were excluded to deny them an opportunity to divide the Allies diplomatically.\nInitially, a \"Council of Ten\" (comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) met officially to decide the peace terms. This council was replaced by the \"Council of Five\", formed from each country's foreign ministers, to discuss minor matters. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and United States President Woodrow Wilson formed the \"Big Four\" (at one point becoming the \"Big Three\" following the temporary withdrawal of Orlando). These four men met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly. The minor powers attended a weekly \"Plenary Conference\" that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final text of the treaty.\nFrench aims.\nFrance had lost 1.3\u00a0million soldiers, including 25% of French men aged 18\u201330, as well as 400,000 civilians. France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation; the so-called zone rouge (Red Zone), the most industrialized region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east, had been devastated, and in the final days of the war, mines had been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed.\nClemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe.\nBritish economist and Versailles negotiator John Maynard Keynes summarized this position as attempting to \"set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished.\"\nClemenceau told Wilson: \"America is far away, protected by the ocean. Not even Napoleon himself could touch England. You are both sheltered; we are not\".\nThe French wanted a frontier on the Rhine, to protect France from a German invasion and compensate for French demographic and economic inferiority.\nAmerican and British representatives refused the French claim and after two months of negotiations, the French accepted a British pledge to provide an immediate alliance with France if Germany attacked again, and Wilson agreed to put a similar proposal to the Senate. Clemenceau had told the Chamber of Deputies, in December 1918, that his goal was to maintain an alliance with both countries. Clemenceau accepted the offer, in return for an occupation of the Rhineland for fifteen years and that Germany would also demilitarise the Rhineland.\nFrench negotiators required reparations, to make Germany pay for the destruction induced throughout the war and to decrease German strength. The French also wanted the iron ore and coal of the Saar Valley, by annexation to France.\nThe French were willing to accept a smaller amount of World War\u00a0I reparations than the Americans would concede and Clemenceau was willing to discuss German capacity to pay with the German delegation, before the final settlement was drafted. In April and May 1919, the French and Germans held separate talks, on mutually acceptable arrangements on issues like reparation, reconstruction and industrial collaboration. France, along with the British Dominions and Belgium, opposed League of Nations mandates and favored annexation of former German colonies.\nThe French, who had suffered significantly in the areas occupied by Germany during the war, were in favour of trying German war criminals, including the Kaiser. In the face of American objections that there was no applicable existing law under which the Kaiser could be tried, Clemenceau took the view that the \"law of responsibility\" overruled all other laws and that putting the Kaiser on trial offered the opportunity to establish this as an international precedent.\nBritish aims.\nBritain had suffered heavy financial costs but suffered little physical devastation during the war. British public opinion wanted to make Germany pay for the War.\nPublic opinion favoured a \"just peace\", which would force Germany to pay reparations and be unable to repeat the aggression of 1914, although those of a \"liberal and advanced opinion\" shared Wilson's ideal of a peace of reconciliation.\nIn private Lloyd George opposed revenge and attempted to compromise between Clemenceau's demands and the Fourteen Points, because Europe would eventually have to reconcile with Germany.\nLloyd George wanted terms of reparation that would not cripple the German economy, so that Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner. By arguing that British war pensions and widows' allowances should be included in the German reparation sum, Lloyd George ensured that a large amount would go to the British Empire.\nLloyd George also intended to maintain a European balance of power to thwart a French attempt to establish itself as the dominant European power. A revived Germany would be a counterweight to France and a deterrent to Bolshevik Russia. Lloyd George also wanted to neutralize the German navy to keep the Royal Navy as the greatest naval power in the world; dismantle the German colonial empire with several of its territorial possessions ceded to Britain and others being established as League of Nations mandates, a position opposed by the Dominions.\nTogether with the French, the British favoured putting German war criminals on trial, and included the Kaiser in this. Already in 1916 Herbert Asquith had declared the intention \"to bring to justice the criminals, whoever they be and whatever their station\", and a resolution of the war cabinet in 1918 reaffirmed this intent. Lloyd George declared that the British people would not accept a treaty that did not include terms on this, though he wished to limit the charges solely to violation of the 1839 treaty guaranteeing Belgian neutrality. The British were also well aware that the Kaiser having sought refuge in the Netherlands meant that any trial was unlikely to take place and therefore any Article demanding it was likely to be a dead letter.\nAmerican aims.\nBefore the American entry into the war, Wilson had talked of a \"peace without victory\". This position fluctuated following the US entry into the war. Wilson spoke of the German aggressors, with whom there could be no compromised peace.\nOn 8 January 1918, however, Wilson delivered a speech (known as the Fourteen Points) that declared the American peace objectives: the rebuilding of the European economy, self-determination of European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, the promotion of free trade, the creation of appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, the creation of a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace. The aim of the latter was to provide a forum to revise the peace treaties as needed, and deal with problems that arose as a result of the peace and the rise of new states.\nWilson brought along top intellectuals as advisors to the American peace delegation, and the overall American position echoed the Fourteen Points. Wilson firmly opposed harsh treatment on Germany. While the British and French wanted to largely annex the German colonial empire, Wilson saw that as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice and human rights of the native populations, and favored them having the right of self-determination via the creation of mandates. The promoted idea called for the major powers to act as disinterested trustees over a region, aiding the native populations until they could govern themselves.\nIn spite of this position and in order to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations, Wilson favored turning over the former German colony of Shandong, in Eastern China, to the Japanese Empire rather than return the area to the Republic of China's control.\nFurther confounding the Americans, was US internal partisan politics. In November 1918, the Republican Party won the Senate election by a slim margin. Wilson, a Democrat, refused to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation making his efforts seem partisan, and contributed to a risk of political defeat at home.\nOn the subject of war crimes, the Americans differed to the British and French in that Wilson's proposal was that any trial of the Kaiser should be solely a political and moral affair, and not one of criminal responsibility, meaning that the death penalty would be precluded. This was based on the American view, particularly those of Robert Lansing, that there was no applicable law under which the Kaiser could be tried. Additionally, the Americans favoured trying other German war criminals before military tribunals rather than an international court, with prosecutions being limited to \"violation[s] of the laws and customs of war\", and opposed any trials based on violations against what was called \"laws of humanity\".\nItalian aims.\nVittorio Emanuele Orlando and his foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, an Anglican of British origins, worked primarily to secure the partition of the Habsburg Empire and their attitude towards Germany was not as hostile. Generally speaking, Sonnino was in line with the British position while Orlando favored a compromise between Clemenceau and Wilson. Within the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles, Orlando obtained certain results such as the permanent membership of Italy in the security council of the League of Nations and a promised transfer of British Jubaland and French Aozou strip to the Italian colonies of Somalia and Libya respectively. Italian nationalists, however, saw the War as a \"mutilated victory\" for what they considered to be little territorial gains achieved in the other treaties directly impacting Italy's borders. Orlando was ultimately forced to abandon the conference and resign. Orlando refused to see World War\u00a0I as a mutilated victory, replying at nationalists calling for a greater expansion that \"Italy today is a great state...on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.\" Francesco Saverio Nitti took Orlando's place in signing the treaty of Versailles.\nThe Italian leadership were divided on whether to try the Kaiser. Sonnino considered that putting the Kaiser on trial could result in him becoming a \"patriotic martyr\". Orlando, in contrast, stated that \"the ex-Kaiser ought to pay like other criminals\", but was less sure about whether the Kaiser should be \"tried\" as a criminal or merely have a political verdict cast against him. Orlando also considered that \"[t]he question of the constitution of the Court presents almost insurmountable difficulties\".\nTreaty content and signing.\nIn June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including Articles 227 to 231 (i.e., the Articles related to the extradition of the Kaiser for trial, the extradition of German war criminals for trial before Allied tribunals, the handing over of documents relevant for war crimes trials, and accepting liability for war reparations). In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.\nOn 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed. The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of the Republic of German Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Quran to the king of Hedjaz.\nTerritorial changes.\nThe treaty stripped Germany of of territory and 7\u00a0million people. It also required Germany to give up the gains made via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and grant independence to the protectorates that had been established.\nIn Western Europe, Germany was required to recognize Belgian sovereignty over Moresnet and cede control of the Eupen-Malmedy area. Within six months of the transfer, Belgium was required to conduct a plebiscite on whether the citizens of the region wanted to remain under Belgian sovereignty or return to German control, communicate the results to the League of Nations and abide by the League's decision. The Belgian transitional administration, under High Commissioner General Herman Baltia, was responsible for the organisation and control of this process, held between January and June 1920. The plebiscite itself was held without a secret ballot, and organized as a consultation in which all citizens who opposed the annexation had to formally register their protest. Ultimately, only 271 of 33,726 voters signed the protest list, of which 202 were German state servants. After the Belgian government reported this result, the League of Nations confirmed the change of status on 20 September 1920, with the line of the German-Belgian border finally fixed by a League of Nations commission in 1922. To compensate for the destruction of French coal mines, Germany was to cede the output of the Saar coalmines to France and control of the Saar to the League of Nations for 15 years; a plebiscite would then be held to decide sovereignty.\nThe treaty restored the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France by rescinding the treaties of Versailles and Frankfurt of 1871 as they pertained to this issue.\nFrance was able to make the claim that the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine were indeed part of France and not part of Germany by disclosing a letter sent from the Prussian King to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie that Eug\u00e9nie provided, in which William I wrote that the territories of Alsace-Lorraine were requested by Germany for the sole purpose of national defense and not to expand the German territory. The sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein was to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held at a future time (see Schleswig Plebiscites).\nIn Central Europe Germany was to recognize the independence of Czechoslovakia and cede parts of the province of Upper Silesia to them.\nGermany had to recognize the independence of Poland, which had regained its independence following a national revolution against the occupying Central Powers, and renounce \"all rights and title\" over Polish territory. Portions of Upper Silesia were to be ceded to Poland, with the future of the rest of the province to be decided by plebiscite. The border would be fixed with regard to the vote and to the geographical and economic conditions of each locality.\nThe Province of Posen (now Pozna\u0144), which had come under Polish control during the Greater Poland Uprising, was also to be ceded to Poland.\nPomerelia (Eastern Pomerania), on historical and ethnic grounds, was transferred to Poland so that the new state could have access to the sea and became known as the Polish Corridor.\nThe sovereignty of part of southern East Prussia was to be decided via plebiscite while the East Prussian Soldau area, which was astride the rail line between Warsaw and Danzig, was transferred to Poland outright without plebiscite.\nAn area of was transferred to Poland under the agreement.\nMemel was to be ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, for disposal according to their wishes.\nGermany was to cede the city of Danzig and its hinterland, including the delta of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, for the League of Nations to establish the Free City of Danzig.\nMandates.\nArticle 119 of the treaty required Germany to renounce sovereignty over former colonies and Article 22 converted the territories into League of Nations mandates under the control of Allied states. Togoland and German Kamerun (Cameroon) were transferred to France, aside from portions given to Britain, British Togoland and British Cameroon. Ruanda and Urundi were allocated to Belgium, whereas German South-West Africa went to South Africa and Britain obtained German East Africa. As compensation for the German invasion of Portuguese Africa, Portugal was granted the Kionga Triangle, a sliver of German East Africa in northern Mozambique.\nArticle 156 of the treaty transferred German concessions in Shandong, China, to Japan, not to China. Japan was granted all German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator and those south of the equator went to Australia, except for German Samoa, which was taken by New Zealand.\nMilitary restrictions.\nThe treaty was comprehensive and complex in the restrictions imposed upon the post-war German armed forces (the ). The provisions were intended to make the incapable of offensive action and to encourage international disarmament.\nGermany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920 to leave an army of no more than 100,000 men in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions. The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the German General Staff was to be dissolved.\nMilitary schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm, and conscription was abolished. Private soldiers and non-commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of 25 years, with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises. To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.\nThe number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force was reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden.\nThe Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden.\nMilitary structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and D\u00fcne were to be destroyed.\nGermany was prohibited from the arms trade, limits were imposed on the type and quantity of weapons and prohibited from the manufacture or stockpile of chemical weapons, armoured cars, tanks and military aircraft.\nThe German navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and was limited to a maximum of six light cruisers (not exceeding ), twelve destroyers (not exceeding ) and twelve torpedo boats (not exceeding ) and was forbidden submarines.\nThe manpower of the navy was not to exceed 15,000 men, including manning for the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration, other land services, officers and men of all grades and corps. The number of officers and warrant officers was not allowed to exceed 1,500 men.\nGermany surrendered eight battleships, eight light cruisers, forty-two destroyers, and fifty torpedo boats for decommissioning. Thirty-two auxiliary ships were to be disarmed and converted to merchant use.\nArticle 198 prohibited Germany from having an air force, including naval air forces, and required Germany to hand over all aerial related materials. In conjunction, Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft or related material for a period of six months following the signing of the treaty.\nReparations.\nIn Article 231 Germany accepted responsibility for the losses and damages caused by the war \"as a consequence of the ... aggression of Germany and her allies.\" The treaty required Germany to compensate the Allied powers, and it also established an Allied \"Reparation Commission\" to determine the exact amount which Germany would pay and the form that such payment would take. The commission was required to \"give to the German Government a just opportunity to be heard\", and to submit its conclusions by 1 May 1921. In the interim, the treaty required Germany to pay an equivalent of 20\u00a0billion gold marks ($5\u00a0billion) in gold, commodities, ships, securities or other forms. The money would help to pay for Allied occupation costs and buy food and raw materials for Germany.\nGuarantees.\nTo ensure compliance, the Rhineland and bridgeheads east of the Rhine were to be occupied by Allied troops for fifteen years.\nIf Germany had not committed aggression, a staged withdrawal would take place; after five years, the Cologne bridgehead and the territory north of a line along the Ruhr would be evacuated. After ten years, the bridgehead at Coblenz and the territories to the north would be evacuated and after fifteen years remaining Allied forces would be withdrawn.\nIf Germany reneged on the treaty obligations, the bridgeheads would be reoccupied immediately.\nInternational organizations.\nPart I of the treaty, in common with all the treaties signed during the Paris Peace Conference, was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which provided for the creation of the League, an organization for the arbitration of international disputes.\nPart XIII organized the establishment of the International Labour Office, to regulate hours of work, including a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of a living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed abroad; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures.\nThe treaty also called for the signatories to sign or ratify the First International Opium Convention.\nWar Crimes.\nArticle 227 of the Versailles treaty required the handing over of Kaiser Wilhelm for trial \"for supreme offence against international treaties and the sanctity of treaties\" before a bench of five allied judges \u2013 one British, one American, one French, one Italian, and one Japanese. If found guilty the judges were to \"fix such punishment which it considers should be imposed\". The death penalty was therefore not precluded. Article 228 allowed the Allies to demand the extradition of German war criminals, who could be tried before military tribunals for crimes against \"the laws and customs of war\" under Article 229. To provide an evidentiary basis for such trials, Article 230 required the German government to transfer information and documents relevant to such trials.\nReactions.\nBritain.\nThe delegates of the Commonwealth and British Government had mixed thoughts on the treaty, with some seeing the French policy as being greedy and vindictive. Lloyd George and his private secretary Philip Kerr believed in the treaty, although they also felt that the French would keep Europe in a constant state of turmoil by attempting to enforce the treaty. Delegate Harold Nicolson wrote \"are we making a good peace?\", while General Jan Smuts (a member of the South African delegation) wrote to Lloyd-George, before the signing, that the treaty was unstable and declared \"Are we in our sober senses or suffering from shellshock? What has become of Wilson's 14 points?\" He wanted the Germans not be made to sign at the \"point of the bayonet\".\nSmuts issued a statement condemning the treaty and regretting that the promises of \"a new international order and a fairer, better world are not written in this treaty\". Lord Robert Cecil said that many within the Foreign Office were disappointed by the treaty. The treaty received widespread approval from the general public. Bernadotte Schmitt wrote that the \"average Englishman ... thought Germany got only what it deserved\" as a result of the treaty, but public opinion changed as German complaints mounted.\nFormer wartime British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and the Independent Liberal opposition in the British Parliament after the 1918 general election believed the treaty was too punitive. Asquith campaigned against it while running for another House of Commons seat in the 1920 Paisley by-election.\nPrime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, following the German re-militarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, stated that he was \"pleased\" that the treaty was \"vanishing\", expressing his hope that the French had been taught a \"severe lesson\".\nStatus of British Dominions.\nThe Treaty of Versailles was an important step in the status of the British Dominions under international law. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa had each made significant contributions to the British war effort, but as separate countries, rather than as British colonies. India also made a substantial troop contribution, although under direct British control, unlike the Dominions. The four Dominions and India all signed the Treaty separately from Britain, a clear recognition by the international community that the Dominions were no longer British colonies. \"Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.\" By signing the Treaty individually, the four Dominions and India also were in their own right, rather than simply as part of the British Empire.\nFrance.\nThe signing of the treaty was met with roars of approval, singing, and dancing from a crowd outside the Palace of Versailles. In Paris proper, people rejoiced at the official end of the war, the return of Alsace and Lorraine to France, and that Germany had agreed to pay reparations.\nWhile France ratified the treaty and was active in the League, the jubilant mood soon gave way to a political backlash for Clemenceau. The French Right saw the treaty as being too lenient and saw it as failing to achieve all of France's demands. Left-wing politicians attacked the treaty and Clemenceau for being too harsh (the latter turning into a ritual condemnation of the treaty, for politicians remarking on French foreign affairs, as late as August 1939). Marshal Ferdinand Foch stated \"this (treaty) is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.\"; a criticism over the failure to annex the Rhineland and for compromising French security for the benefit of the United States and Britain. When Clemenceau stood for election as President of France in January 1920, he was defeated.\nItaly.\nReaction in the Kingdom of Italy to the treaty was extremely negative. The country had suffered high casualties, yet failed to achieve most of its major war goals, notably gaining control of the Dalmatian coast and Fiume. President Wilson rejected Italy's claims on the basis of \"national self-determination.\" For their part, Britain and France\u2014who had been forced in the war's latter stages to divert their own troops to the Italian front to stave off collapse\u2014were disinclined to support Italy's position at the peace conference. Differences in negotiating strategy between Premier Vittorio Orlando and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino further undermined Italy's position at the conference. A furious Vittorio Orlando suffered a nervous collapse and at one point walked out of the conference (though he later returned). He lost his position as prime minister just a week before the treaty was scheduled to be signed, effectively ending his active political career. Anger and dismay over the treaty's provisions helped pave the way for the establishment of Benito Mussolini's Fascist dictatorship three years later.\nPortugal.\nPortugal entered the war on the Allied side in 1916 primarily to ensure the security of its African colonies, which were threatened with seizure by both Britain and Germany. To this extent, she succeeded in her war aims. The treaty recognized Portuguese sovereignty over these areas and awarded her small portions of Germany's bordering overseas colonies, including the Kionga Triangle. Otherwise, Portugal gained little at the peace conference. Her promised share of German reparations never materialized, and a seat she coveted on the executive council of the new League of Nations went instead to Spain\u2014which had remained neutral in the war. In the end, Portugal ratified the treaty, but got little out of the war, which cost more than 8,000 Portuguese Armed Forces troops and as many as 100,000 of her African colonial subjects their lives.\nUnited States.\nAfter the Versailles conference, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson claimed that \"at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!\" However, Wilson had refused to bring any leading members of the Republican party, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, into the talks. The Republicans controlled the United States Senate after the election of 1918, and were outraged by Wilson's refusal to discuss the war with them. The senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.\nA discontent bloc of 12\u201318 \"Irreconcilables\", mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the treaty. One bloc of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge. A second group of Democrats supported the treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with \"reservations\", especially on Article 10, so that the League of Nations could not draw the US into war without the consent of the US Congress. All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. But Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.\nThe closest the treaty came to passage was on 19 November 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to end the chances of ratification permanently. Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the treaty, saying it favored the British.\nAfter Wilson's presidency, his successor Republican President Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the formation of the League of Nations. Congress subsequently passed the Knox\u2013Porter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the United States and the Central Powers. It was signed into law by President Harding on 2 July 1921. Soon after, the US\u2013German Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on 25 August 1921. Article 1 of this treaty obliged the German government to grant to the U.S. government all rights and privileges that were enjoyed by the other Allies that had ratified the Versailles treaty. Two similar treaties were signed with Austria and Hungary on 24 and 29 August 1921, in Vienna and Budapest respectively.\nEdward House's views.\nWilson's former friend Edward Mandell House, present at the negotiations, wrote in his diary on 29 June 1919:\nI am leaving Paris, after eight fateful months, with conflicting emotions. Looking at the conference in retrospect, there is much to approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who are saying that the treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.\nChina.\nMany in China felt betrayed as the German territory in China was handed to Japan. Wellington Koo refused to sign the treaty and the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. The sense of betrayal led to great demonstrations in China such as the May 4th movement. There was immense dissatisfaction with Duan Qirui's government, which had secretly negotiated with the Japanese in order to secure loans to fund their military campaigns against the south. On 12 June 1919, the Chinese cabinet was forced to resign and the government instructed its delegation at Versailles not to sign the treaty. As a result, relations with the Western world deteriorated.\nGermany.\nOn 29 April, the German delegation under the leadership of the Foreign Minister Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau arrived in Versailles. On 7 May, when faced with the conditions dictated by the victors, including the so-called \"War Guilt Clause\", von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied to Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George: \"We can sense the full force of hatred that confronts us here.\u00a0... You demand from us to confess we were the only guilty party of war; such a confession in my mouth would be a lie.\"\nBecause Germany was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, the German government issued a protest against what it considered to be unfair demands, and a \"violation of honour\", soon afterwards withdrawing from the proceedings of the peace conference.\nGermans of all political shades denounced the treaty. The so-called \"War Guilt Clause\" that they saw as blaming Germany for starting the war was seen as an insult to the nation's honour. The clauses calling on the Germans to hand over alleged war criminals also caused deep offence, as many of those accused were seen as heroes, and also because the Allies were seen as applying one-sided justice. They referred to the treaty as \"the \"Diktat\"\" since its terms were presented to Germany on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Germany's first democratically elected head of government, Philipp Scheidemann, resigned rather than sign the treaty. In an emotional and polemical address to the Weimar National Assembly on 12 May 1919, he called the treaty a \"horrific and murderous witch's hammer\", and exclaimed: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Which hand would not shrivel, that shackled itself and us in such a way? At the end of his speech, Scheidemann stated that, in the government's opinion, the treaty was unacceptable.\nAfter Scheidemann's resignation, a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer. President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west\u2014and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg\u2014after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener\u2014concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. But rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities.\nUpon receiving Hindenburg's answer, the Bauer government recommended signing the treaty with the proviso that the \"war-guilt\" clause and the articles that required the extradition of war criminals and of the former Emperor be excluded. After the Allies refused anything other than full acceptance of the treaty, the National Assembly voted in favour of signing it by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). The result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. The Bauer government included the following statement with the acceptance:The honour of the German people will not be affected by an act of violence. After the appalling suffering of the last four years, the German people lack any means to defend it externally. Therefore, yielding to overwhelming force and without abandoning its view of the outrageous injustice of the peace terms, the Government of the German Republic declares that it is prepared to accept and sign the peace terms imposed by the Allied and Associated Governments.\nForeign minister Hermann M\u00fcller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116.\nJapan.\nThe disenfranchised and often colonized \"non-white\" world held high expectations that a new order would open up an unheralded opportunity to have a principle of racial equality recognized by the leading global powers. Japanese diplomacy had bitter memories of the rhetoric of the Yellow Peril, and the arrogance, underwritten by the assumptions about a White Man's Burden, memories aggravated by the rise of racial discrimination against their business men, severe immigration restrictions on Asiatics, and court judgments hostile to Japanese interests, which characterized Western states' treatment of their nationals. Japan's delegation, among whose plenipotentiaries figured Baron Makino and Ambassador Chinda Sutemi, was led by its elder statesman Saionji Kinmochi.\nVersailles represented a chance to overturn this imposed inferiority, whose tensions were strengthened particularly in Japan's relationship with the United States during WW1. Confidence in their growing industrial strength, and conquest of Germany's Far East possessions, together with their proven fidelity to the Entente would, it was thought, allow them finally to take their rightful place among the victorious Great Powers. They solicited support especially from the American delegation to obtain recognition for the principle of racial equality at the League of Nations Commission. Their proposals to this end were consistently rebuffed by British, French, American and Australian diplomats, who were all sensitive to their respective countries' internal pressures. Wilson himself was an enactor of segregationist policies in the United States, Clemenceau openly ridiculed them, Arthur Balfour considered Africans inferior to Europeans \u2013 equality was only true of people within particular nations \u2013 while William Hughes, adopting a \"slap the Jap\" attitude, was a vocal defender of a White Australia policy.\nJapan's attempt, buttressed by the Chinese emissary Wellington Koo among others, to incorporate a Racial Equality Proposal in the treaty, had broad support, but was effectively declined when it was rejected by the United States, Great Britain and Australia, despite a powerfully persuasive speech delivered by Makino.\nJapan itself both prior to and during WW1 had embarked on a vigorous expansion of continental colonialism, whose aims were justified in terms of uniting Asians, such as Koreans and Chinese, who were seen as belonging to the same race and culture as the Japanese (: ), though it was geared to subordinating them to Japan's interests in a paternalistic manner. Aspiring to be accepted as a world actor with similar status to the traditional Western powers, Japan envisaged an Asian Monroe Doctrine, where Japan's proper sphere of geostrategic interests in Asia would be recognized. Some years earlier, Japan secured both British and French support for its claims to inherit rights that Germany had exercised both in China and in the Pacific Ocean north of the Equator. American policy experts, unaware of these secret agreements, nonetheless suggested that Japan had adopted a Prussian model that would imperil China's own search for autonomy, and these considerations influenced Wilson.\nNonetheless Japan emerged from the Treaty with territorial gains, including the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory and all the territories of German New Guinea north of the Equator, forming the South Seas Mandate.\nImplementation.\nReparations.\nOn 5 May 1921, the reparation Commission established the London Schedule of Payments and a final reparation sum of 132\u00a0billion gold marks to be demanded of all the Central Powers. This was the public assessment of what the Central Powers combined could pay, and was also a compromise among Belgian, British, and French demands and assessments. Furthermore, the Commission recognized that the Central Powers could pay little and that the burden would fall upon Germany. As a result, the sum was split into different categories, of which Germany was only required to pay 50\u00a0billion gold marks (US$\u00a0billion); this being the genuine assessment of the commission on what Germany could pay, and allowed the Allied powers to save face with the public by presenting a higher figure. Furthermore, payments made between 1919 and 1921 of roughly 8 billion marks, most of it credit for state assets (e.g., German state railways in the Danzig corridor) transferred to Allied countries were taken into account reducing the sum to 41\u00a0billion gold marks.\nIn order to meet this sum, Germany could pay in cash or kind: coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. Germany's assistance with the restoration of the university library of Leuven, which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum. Territorial changes imposed by the treaty were also factored in. The payment schedule required US$\u00a0million within twenty-five days and then US$\u00a0million annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports. The German Government was to issue bonds at five per cent interest and set up a sinking fund of one per cent to support the payment of reparations.\nTerritorial changes.\nIn February and March 1920, the Schleswig Plebiscites were held. The people of Schleswig were presented with only two choices: Danish or German sovereignty. The northern Danish-speaking area voted for Denmark while the southern German-speaking area voted for Germany, resulting in the province being partitioned. The East Prussia plebiscite was held on 11 July 1920. There was a 90% turn out with 99.3% of the population wishing to remain with Germany. Further plebiscites were held in Eupen-Malmedy and Neutral Moresnet. On 20 September 1920, the League of Nations allotted these territories to Belgium. These latter plebiscites were followed by a boundary commission in 1922, followed by the new Belgian-German border being recognized by the German Government on 15 December 1923.\nThe transfer of the Hultschin area, of Silesia, to Czechoslovakia was completed on 3 February 1921.\nFollowing the implementation of the treaty, Upper Silesia was initially governed by Britain, France, and Italy. Between 1919 and 1921, three major outbreaks of violence took place between German and Polish civilians, resulting in German and Polish military forces also becoming involved.\nIn March 1921, the Inter-Allied Commission held the Upper Silesia plebiscite, which was peaceful despite the previous violence. The plebiscite resulted in c. 60 per cent of the population voting for the province to remain part of Germany.\nFollowing the vote, the League of Nations debated the future of the province.\nIn 1922, Upper Silesia was partitioned: Oppeln, in the north-west, remained with Germany while Silesia Province, in the south-east, was transferred to Poland.\nMemel remained under the authority of the League of Nations, with a French Armed Forces garrison, until January 1923.\nOn 9 January 1923, the Lithuanian Army invaded the territory during the Klaip\u0117da Revolt.\nThe French garrison withdrew, and in February the Allies agreed to attach Memel as an \"autonomous territory\" to Lithuania. On 8 May 1924, after negotiations between the Lithuanian Government and the Conference of Ambassadors and action by the League of Nations, the annexation of Memel was ratified. Lithuania accepted the Memel Statute, a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status while responsibility for the territory remained with the great powers. The League of Nations mediated between the Germans and Lithuanians on a local level, helping the power-sharing arrangement last until 1939.\nOn 13 January 1935, 15 years after the Saar Basin had been placed under the protection of the League of Nations, a plebiscite was held to determine the future of the area. 528,105 votes were cast, with 477,119 votes (90 per cent of the ballot) in favour of union with Germany; 46,613 votes were cast for the status quo, and 2,124 votes for union with France. The region returned to German sovereignty on 1 March 1935. When the result was announced 4,100 people, including 800 refugees from Germany fled to France.\nRhineland occupation.\nIn late 1918, American, Belgian, British, and French troops entered the Rhineland to enforce the armistice. Before the treaty, the occupation force stood at roughly 740,000 men. Following the signing of the peace treaty, the numbers drastically decreased and by 1926 the occupation force numbered only 76,000 men.\nAs part of the 1929 negotiations that would become the Young Plan, Gustav Stresemann, and Aristide Briand negotiated the early withdrawal of Allied forces from the Rhineland.\nOn 30 June 1930, after speeches and the lowering of flags, the last troops of the Anglo-French-Belgian occupation force withdrew from Germany.\nBelgium maintained an occupation force of roughly 10,000 troops throughout the initial years.\nThis figure fell to 7,102 by 1926, and continued to fall as a result of diplomatic developments.\nThe British Second Army, with some 275,000 veteran soldiers, entered Germany in late 1918. In March 1919, this force became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). The total number of troops committed to the occupation rapidly dwindled as veteran soldiers were demobilized, and were replaced by inexperienced men who had finished basic training following the cessation of hostilities.\nBy 1920, the BAOR consisted of only 40,594 men and the following year had been further reduced to 12,421. The size of the BAOR fluctuated over the following years, but never rose above 9,000 men. The British did not adhere to all obligated territorial withdrawals as dictated by Versailles, on account of Germany not meeting her own treaty obligations.\nA complete withdrawal was considered, but rejected in order to maintain a presence to continue acting as a check on French ambitions and prevent the establishment of an autonomous Rhineland Republic.\nThe French Army of the Rhine was initially 250,000 men strong, including at a peak 40,000 African colonial troops (). By 1923, the French occupation force had decreased to roughly 130,000 men, including 27,126 African troops.\nThe troop numbers peaked again at 250,000 during the occupation of the Ruhr, before decreasing to 60,000 men by 1926. Germans viewed the use of French colonial troops as a deliberate act of humiliation, and used their presence to create a propaganda campaign dubbed the Black Shame. This campaign lasted throughout the 1920s and 30s, although peaked in 1920 and 1921. For example, a 1921 German Government memo detailed 300 acts of violence from colonial troops, which included 65 murders and 170 sexual offenses. Historical consensus is that the charges were exaggerated for political and propaganda purposes, and that the colonial troops behaved far better than their white counterparts. An estimated 500\u2013800 Rhineland Bastards were born as a result of fraternization between colonial troops and German women, and who would later be persecuted.\nThe United States Third Army entered Germany with 200,000 men. In June 1919, the Third Army demobilized and by 1920 the US occupation force had been reduced to 15,000 men. Wilson further reduced the garrison to 6,500 men, before Warren G. Harding's inauguration in 1921. On 7 January 1923, after the Franco\u2013Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, the US Senate legislated the withdrawal of the remaining force.\nOn 24 January, the American garrison started their withdrawal from the Rhineland, with the final troops leaving in early February.\nViolations.\nReparations.\nIn June 1921 Germany made the first cash payment of 1 billion gold marks due under the London Schedule of Payments. However, this was the only full payment of cash made under the unamended schedule, and from then until the Dawes plan began operation in late 1924 only small cash payments were made. Whilst in-kind payments of goods such as coal and timber were made throughout 1922, these were never paid in full, and in December 1922 Germany was declared in default of timber deliveries by a 3-to-1 vote of the Reparations Commission, the British representative casting the sole opposing vote. On 9 January of the following year, after Germany had defaulted either partially or wholly on coal deliveries for the thirty-fourth time in thirty-six months, the Reparations Commission also declared Germany in default of coal reparations and authorised the occupation of the Ruhr coalfields in order to secure the deliveries, again with the British representative casting the sole opposing vote and all other votes being in favour.\nIn a move that was condemned by the British, French, Belgian, and Italian engineers supported by French and Belgian forces occupied the Ruhr area on 11 January 1923. The German government answered with \"passive resistance\", which meant that coal miners and railway workers refused to obey any instructions by the occupation forces. Production and transportation came to a standstill, but the financial consequences, including the payment in paper currency of striking workers by the German government, contributed to German hyperinflation in the period from late 1921 to 1924. Consequently, passive resistance was called off in late 1923. The end of passive resistance in the Ruhr allowed Germany to undertake a currency reform and to negotiate the Dawes Plan, which led to the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr Area in 1925. The agreement of the Dawes plan in late 1924 also led to a resumption of reparations payments in hard cash and gold. Total receipts from the Ruhr occupation summed to 900 million gold marks.\nFrom the agreement of the Dawes Plan in late 1924 until July 1931 when payment was suspended under a proposal by Herbert Hoover as a result of the Great Depression, reparations payments were made regularly and on time both in cash and in-kind, though always slightly less than was required under the plan. The one year suspension of payments under the Hoover Moratorium was to be converted into a permanent moratorium according to a proposal created at the Lausanne Conference of 1932, however the agreement was never ratified. The government of Adolf Hitler declared all further payments cancelled in 1933, and no further reparations payments were made until after the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War. Germany finally paid off its debts under the Versailles treaty, which had been reduced by 50% at the 1953 London Debt Conference, in 2010.\nMilitary.\nIn 1920, the head of the Hans von Seeckt clandestinely re-established the General Staff, by expanding the \"Truppenamt\" (Troop Office); purportedly a human resources section of the army. In March, 18,000 German troops entered the Rhineland under the guise of attempting to quell possible unrest by the Communist Party of Germany and in doing so violated the demilitarized zone. In response, French troops advanced farther into Germany until the German troops withdrew.\nGerman officials conspired systematically to evade the clauses of the treaty, by failing to meet disarmament deadlines, refusing Allied officials access to military facilities, and maintaining and hiding weapon production. As the treaty did not ban German companies from producing war material outside of Germany, companies moved to the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. Bofors was bought by Krupp, and in 1921 German troops were sent to Sweden to test weapons.\nThe establishment of diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, via the Genoa Conference and Treaty of Rapallo, was also used to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles. Publicly, these diplomatic exchanges were largely in regards to trade and future economic cooperation. But secret military clauses were included that allowed for Germany to develop weapons inside the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it allowed for Germany to establish three training areas for aviation, chemical and tank warfare. In 1923, the British newspaper \"The Times\" made several claims about the state of the German Armed Forces: that it had equipment for 800,000 men, was transferring army staff to civilian positions in order to obscure their real duties, and warned of the militarization of the German police force by the exploitation of the Kr\u00fcmper system. \nThe Weimar Government also funded domestic rearmament programs, which were covertly funded with the money camouflaged in \"X-budgets\", worth up to an additional 10% of the disclosed military budget.\nBy 1925, German companies had begun to design tanks and modern artillery. During the year, over half of Chinese arms imports were German and worth 13\u00a0million \"Reichsmarks.\" In January 1927, following the withdrawal of the Allied disarmament committee, Krupps ramped up production of armor plate and artillery.\n Production increased so that by 1937, military exports had increased to 82,788,604 \"Reichsmarks\". Production was not the only violation: \"Volunteers\" were rapidly passed through the army to make a pool of trained reserves, and paramilitary organizations were encouraged with the illegally militarized police. Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were not limited by the treaty, thus this loophole was exploited and as such the number of NCOs were vastly in excess to the number needed by the .\nIn December 1931, the finalized a second rearmament plan that called for 480\u00a0million \"Reichsmarks\" to be spent over the following five years: this program sought to provide Germany the capability of creating and supplying a defensive force of 21 divisions supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks. This coincided with a 1\u00a0billion \"Reichsmark\" programme that planned for additional industrial infrastructure that would be able to permanently maintain this force. As these programs did not require an expansion of the military, they were nominally legal.\nOn 7 November 1932, the Reich Minister of Defense Kurt von Schleicher authorized the illegal Plan for a standing army of 21 divisions based on 147,000 professional soldiers and a large militia. Later in the year at the World Disarmament Conference, Germany withdrew to force France and Britain to accept German equality of status. London attempted to get Germany to return with the promise of all nations maintaining an equality in armaments and security. The British later proposed and agreed to an increase in the to 200,000 men, and for Germany to have an air force half the size of the French. It was also negotiated for the French Army to be reduced.\nIn October 1933, following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the founding of the Nazi regime, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. In March 1935, Germany reintroduced conscription followed by an open rearmament programme and the official unveiling of the Luftwaffe (air force), and signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement that allowed a surface fleet 35% of the size of the Royal Navy. The resulting rearmament programmes were allotted 35\u00a0billion \"Reichsmarks\" over an eight-year period.\nTerritorial.\nOn 7 March 1936, German troops entered and remilitarized the Rhineland.\nOn 12 March 1938, following German pressure to the collapse of the Austrian Government, German troops crossed into Austria and the following day Hitler announced the \"Anschluss\": the annexation of Austria by Germany.\nThe following year, on 23 March 1939, Germany annexed Memel from Lithuania.\nWar criminals.\nDespite \"hang the Kaiser\" being a popular slogan of the time, particularly in Britain, the proposed trial of the Kaiser under Article 227 of the Versailles treaty never took place. Defying popular British anger at the Kaiser, and the fact that putting the Kaiser on trial was originally a British proposal, Lloyd George refused to support French calls for the Kaiser to be extradited from the Netherlands where he was living in exile. The Dutch authorities refused extradition, and the former Kaiser died there in 1941.\nArticle 228 allowed for the extradition of German war criminals to stand trial before Allied tribunals. Originally a list of as many of 20,000 alleged criminals was prepared by the Allies, however this was later reduced. Following the ratification of the treaty in January 1920, the Allies submitted a request that 890 (or 895) alleged war criminals be extradited for trial. France and Belgium each requested the extradition of 334 individuals including von Hindenburg and Ludendorff for the damages they had inflicted on Belgium and the mass deportations they had overseen from both France and Belgium. Britain submitted a list of 94 names, including von Tirpitz for the sinkings of civilian shipping by German U-boats. Italy's request included 29 names divided between those accused of mistreating prisoners of war and those responsible for U-Boat sinkings. Romania requested the extradition of 41 individuals including von Mackensen. Poland requested 51 people be extradited, and Yugoslavia (successor to wartime Serbia) four. Germany refused extradition, however, claiming that carrying out such a request to extradite people widely regarded as heroes in Germany would likely result in the fall of the government, but made a counter-offer of holding trials at Leipzig, an offer that was ultimately accepted by the Allies.\nAfter subsequent negotiation, the list of alleged war criminals submitted by the Allies for trial at Leipzig was reduced to 45, however, this ultimately also ended up being too many for the German authorities, and in the end only 12 officers were put on trial \u2013 six from the British list, five from the French one, and one from the Belgian list. The British list included only low-level officers and enlisted men, including a prison-guard accused of beating prisoners of war and two U-Boat commanders who sank hospital ships (the Dover Castle and the Llandovery Castle). In contrast the French list were all high-ranking officials, including Lieutenant-General Karl Stenger, who was accused of massacring French prisoners of war. The Belgian case involved a man accused of mistreating and imprisoning Belgian children. However, when the Germans announced that the trial would be under German law, with the German prosecutor being able to exercise prosecutorial discretion, the French and Belgians withdrew from the process in protest. Only half of the cases led to conviction, with superior orders being allowed as a defence in the Dover Castle case, and in mitigation in the Llandovery Castle case where the officer responsible had massacred seamen in lifeboats. All but one of the people put forward by the French were acquitted, including Karl Stenger, who was showered with flowers by German spectators. The Belgian case was also acquitted.\nThe Commission of Allied Jurists responded to these proceedings on 22 January 1922 by declaring that the Leipzig court had failed to carry out its mandate by failing to convict accused who should have been convicted, and by showing excessive leniency even where people had been convicted. The Allied Jurists recommended that extradition of war criminals be requested under Article 228. However, no further extradition request was made, though trials were held in France and Belgium of German war criminals \"in absentia\".\nHistorical assessments.\nHistorians are split on the impact of the treaty. Some saw it as a good solution in a difficult time, others saw it as a disastrous measure that would anger the Germans to seek revenge. The actual impact of the treaty is also disputed.\nIn his book \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" (published 1919), John Maynard Keynes referred to the Treaty of Versailles as a \"Carthaginian peace\", a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. He stated: \"I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.\"\nKeynes had been the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, and used in his passionate book arguments that he and others (including some US officials) had used at Paris. He believed the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic instability.\nFrench economist \u00c9tienne Mantoux disputed that analysis. During the 1940s, Mantoux wrote a posthumously published book titled \"The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes\" in an attempt to rebut Keynes' claims. More recently economists have argued that the restriction of Germany to a small army saved it so much money it could afford the reparations payments.\nIt has been argued\u2014for instance by historian Gerhard Weinberg in his book \"A World at Arms\" (1994)\u2014that the treaty was in fact quite advantageous to Germany. The Bismarckian Reich was maintained as a political unit instead of being broken up, and Germany largely escaped post-war military occupation (in contrast to the situation following World War\u00a0II). In a 1995 essay, Weinberg noted that with the disappearance of Austria-Hungary and with Russia withdrawn from Europe, that Germany was now the dominant power in Eastern Europe.\nThe British military historian Correlli Barnett argued that the Treaty of Versailles was \"extremely lenient in comparison with the peace terms that Germany herself, when she was expecting to win the war, had had in mind to impose on the Allies\". Furthermore, he said, it was \"hardly a slap on the wrist\" when contrasted with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Germany had imposed on a defeated Russian SFSR in March 1918, which had taken away a third of Russia's population (albeit mostly of non-Russian ethnicity), one-half of Russia's industrial undertakings and nine-tenths of Russia's coal mines, coupled with an indemnity of six billion marks. Eventually, even under the \"cruel\" terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany's economy had been restored to its pre-war status.\nBarnett also argues that, in strategic terms, Germany was in fact in a superior position following the Treaty than she had been in 1914. Germany's eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former Austrian Empire fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by revolution and civil war, and the newly restored Poland was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by France and Belgium, both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty \"much enhanced\" German power.\nBritain and France should have (according to Barnett) \"divided and permanently weakened\" Germany by undoing Bismarck's work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again.\nBy failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain \"had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War\".\nThe British historian of modern Germany Richard J. Evans wrote that during the war the German right was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them. Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles. Evans further noted that the parties of the Weimar Coalition, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Christian democratic Centre Party, were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to say as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the Weimar Republic. Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the Great Depression of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the \"main cause\" of National Socialism and the German economy was \"only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations\".\nEwa Thompson points out that the treaty allowed numerous nations in Central and Eastern Europe to liberate themselves from oppressive German rule, a fact that is often neglected by Western historiography, more interested in understanding the German point of view. In nations that found themselves free as the result of the treaty\u2014such as Poles or Czechs\u2014it is seen as a symbol of recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by their much larger aggressive neighbours.\nResentment caused by the treaty sowed fertile psychological ground for the eventual rise of the Nazi Party, but the German-born Australian historian J\u00fcrgen Tampke argued that it was \"a perfidious distortion of history\" to argue that the terms prevented the growth of democracy in Germany and aided the growth of the Nazi Party; saying that its terms were not as punitive as often held and that German hyper-inflation in the 1920s was partly a deliberate policy to minimise the cost of reparations. As an example of the arguments against the he quotes Elizabeth Wiskemann who heard two officer's widows in Wiesbaden complaining that \"with their stocks of linen depleted they had to have their linen washed once a fortnight (every two weeks) instead of once a month!\"\nThe German historian Detlev Peukert wrote that Versailles was far from the impossible peace that most Germans claimed it was during the interwar period, and though not without flaws was actually quite reasonable to Germany. Rather, Peukert argued that it was widely believed in Germany that Versailles was a totally unreasonable treaty, and it was this \"perception\" rather than the \"reality\" of the Versailles treaty that mattered. Peukert noted that because of the \"millenarian hopes\" created in Germany during World War\u00a0I when for a time it appeared that Germany was on the verge of conquering all of Europe, any peace treaty the Allies of World War\u00a0I imposed on the defeated \"German Reich\" were bound to create a nationalist backlash, and there was nothing the Allies could have done to avoid that backlash. Having noted that much, Peukert commented that the policy of rapprochement with the Western powers that Gustav Stresemann carried out between 1923 and 1929 were constructive policies that might have allowed Germany to play a more positive role in Europe, and that it was not true that German democracy was doomed to die in 1919 because of Versailles. Finally, Peukert argued that it was the Great Depression and the turn to a nationalist policy of autarky within Germany at the same time that finished off the Weimar Republic, not the Treaty of Versailles.\nFrench historian Raymond Cartier states that millions of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland and in Posen-West Prussia were placed under foreign rule in a hostile environment, where harassment and violation of rights by authorities are documented.\nCartier asserts that, out of 1,058,000 Germans in Posen-West Prussia in 1921, 758,867 fled their homelands within five years due to Polish harassment. These sharpening ethnic conflicts would lead to public demands to reattach the annexed territory in 1938 and become a pretext for Hitler's annexations of Czechoslovakia and parts of Poland.\nAccording to David Stevenson, since the opening of French archives, most commentators have remarked on French restraint and reasonableness at the conference, though Stevenson notes that \"[t]he jury is still out\", and that \"there have been signs that the pendulum of judgement is swinging back the other way.\"\nTerritorial changes.\nThe Treaty of Versailles resulted in the creation of several thousand miles of new boundaries, with maps playing a central role in the negotiations at Paris. The plebiscites initiated due to the treaty have drawn much comment. Historian Robert Peckham wrote that the issue of Schleswig \"was premised on a gross simplification of the region's history. ... Versailles ignored any possibility of there being a third way: the kind of compact represented by the Swiss Federation; a bilingual or even trilingual Schleswig-Holsteinian state\" or other options such as \"a Schleswigian state in a loose confederation with Denmark or Germany, or an autonomous region under the protection of the League of Nations.\"\nIn regard to the East Prussia plebiscite, historian Richard Blanke wrote that \"no other contested ethnic group has ever, under un-coerced conditions, issued so one-sided a statement of its national preference\". Richard Debo wrote \"both Berlin and Warsaw believed the Soviet invasion of Poland had influenced the East Prussian plebiscites. Poland appeared so close to collapse that even Polish voters had cast their ballots for Germany\".\nIn regard to the Silesian plebiscite, Blanke observed \"given that the electorate was at least 60% Polish-speaking, this means that about one 'Pole' in three voted for Germany\" and \"most Polish observers and historians\" have concluded that the outcome of the plebiscite was due to \"unfair German advantages of incumbency and socio-economic position\". Blanke alleged \"coercion of various kinds even in the face of an allied occupation regime\" occurred, and that Germany granted votes to those \"who had been born in Upper Silesia but no longer resided there\". Blanke concluded that despite these protests \"there is plenty of other evidence, including Reichstag election results both before and after 1921 and the large-scale emigration of Polish-speaking Upper Silesians to Germany after 1945, that their identification with Germany in 1921 was neither exceptional nor temporary\" and \"here was a large population of Germans and Poles\u2014not coincidentally, of the same Catholic religion\u2014that not only shared the same living space but also came in many cases to see themselves as members of the same national community\". Prince Eustachy Sapieha, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, alleged that Soviet Russia \"appeared to be intentionally delaying negotiations\" to end the Polish-Soviet War \"with the object of influencing the Upper Silesian plebiscite\". Once the region was partitioned, both \"Germany and Poland attempted to 'cleanse' their shares of Upper Silesia\" via oppression resulting in Germans migrating to Germany and Poles migrating to Poland. Despite the oppression and migration, Opole Silesia \"remained ethnically mixed.\"\nFrank Russell wrote that, in regard to the Saar plebiscite, the inhabitants \"were not terrorized at the polls\" and the \"totalitarian [Nazi] German regime was not distasteful to most of the Saar inhabitants and that they preferred it even to an efficient, economical, and benevolent international rule.\" When the outcome of the vote became known, 4,100 (including 800 refugees who had previously fled Germany) residents fled over the border into France.\nMilitary terms and violations.\nDuring the formulation of the treaty, the British wanted Germany to abolish conscription but be allowed to maintain a volunteer Army. The French wanted Germany to maintain a conscript army of up to 200,000 men in order to justify their own maintenance of a similar force. Thus the treaty's allowance of 100,000 volunteers was a compromise between the British and French positions. Germany, on the other hand, saw the terms as leaving them defenseless against any potential enemy.\nBernadotte Everly Schmitt wrote that \"there is no reason to believe that the Allied governments were insincere when they stated at the beginning of Part V of the Treaty ... that in order to facilitate a general reduction of the armament of all nations, Germany was to be required to disarm first.\" A lack of American ratification of the treaty or joining the League of Nations left France unwilling to disarm, which resulted in a German desire to rearm. Schmitt argued \"had the four Allies remained united, they could have forced Germany really to disarm, and the German will and capacity to resist other provisions of the treaty would have correspondingly diminished.\"\nMax Hantke and Mark Spoerer wrote \"military and economic historians [have] found that the German military only insignificantly exceeded the limits\" of the treaty before 1933. Adam Tooze concurred, and wrote \"To put this in perspective, annual military spending by the Weimar Republic was counted not in the billions but in the hundreds of millions of \"Reichsmarks\"\"; for example, the Weimar Republic's 1931 program of 480\u00a0million \"Reichsmarks\" over five years compared to the Nazi Government's 1933 plan to spend 4.4\u00a0billion \"Reichsmarks\" per year.\nP. M. H. Bell argued that the British Government was aware of later Weimar rearming, and lent public respectability to the German efforts by not opposing them, an opinion shared by Churchill.\nNorman Davies wrote that \"a curious oversight\" of the military restrictions were that they \"did not include rockets in its list of prohibited weapons\", which allowed Wernher von Braun an area to research which eventually resulting in \"his break [that] came in 1943\" leading to the development of the V-2 rocket.\nRise of the Nazis.\nThe Treaty created much resentment in Germany, which was exploited by Adolf Hitler in his rise to power at the helm of Nazi Germany. Central to this was belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, which held that the German army had not lost the war and had been betrayed by the Weimar Republic, who negotiated an unnecessary surrender. The Great Depression exacerbated the issue and led to a collapse of the German economy. Though the treaty may not have caused the crash, it was a convenient scapegoat. Germans viewed the treaty as a humiliation and eagerly listened to Hitler's oratory which blamed the treaty for Germany's ills. Hitler promised to reverse the depredations of the Allied powers and recover Germany's lost territory and pride, which has led to the treaty being cited as a cause of World War\u00a0II.\nHermann G\u00f6ring first met Adolf Hitler at a speech which Hitler gave at a rally against French demands for the extradition of alleged German war criminals under the Versailles treaty.\nNotes.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography and memory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Published in 1987, it is the fourth \"Discworld\" novel and the first to focus on the character Death, who only appeared as a side character in the previous novels. The title is the name of its main character, and is also a play on words: in French and Catalan, \"mort\" means \"death\", while in Romanian it means \"dead\". The French language edition is titled \"Mortimer\", and the Catalan language edition is titled \"Morth\".\nIn 2004, Pratchett stated that \"Mort\" was the first Discworld novel with which he was \"pleased\", stating that in previous books, the plot had existed to support the jokes, but that in \"Mort\", the plot was integral.\nPlot summary.\nAs a teenager, Mort has a personality and temperament that makes him unsuited to the family farming business. Mort's father Lezek takes him to a local hiring fair in the hope that Mort will land an apprenticeship. Just before the last stroke of midnight, Death arrives and takes Mort on as an apprentice. Death takes Mort to his domain, where he meets Death's elderly manservant Albert, and his adopted daughter Ysabell. Mort later accompanies Death as he travels to collect the soul of the King of Sto Lat, who is due to be assassinated by the scheming Duke of Sto Helit. After Mort unsuccessfully tries to prevent the assassination, Death warns him that all deaths are predetermined, and that he cannot interfere with fate.\nDeath assigns Mort to collect the soul of Princess Keli, daughter of the murdered king, but he instead kills the assassin the Duke had sent after her. Keli lives, but shortly after the assassin's death people begin acting as if something had happened without knowing why, namely what would be funeral preparations and acts of mourning. She soon finds that the rest of the world no longer acknowledges her existence unless she confronts them and even then they forget her immediately after. She subsequently employs the wizard Igneous Cutwell, who is able to see her as he is trained to see things that are invisible to normal people to make her existence clear to the public. Mort eventually discovers that his actions have created an alternate reality in which Keli lives, but he also learns that it is being overridden by the original reality and will eventually cease to exist, killing Keli. While consulting Cutwell, Mort sees a picture of Unseen University's founder, Alberto Malich, noting that he bears a resemblance to Albert.\nMort and Ysabell travel into the Stack, a library in Death's domain that holds the biographies of everyone who has ever lived, in order to investigate Albert, eventually discovering that he is indeed Malich. They further learn that Malich had feared monsters waiting for him in the afterlife, and performed a reversed version of the Rite of AshkEnte in the hope of keeping Death away from him. The spell backfired and sent him to Death's side, where he has remained in order to put off his demise. During this time, Death, yearning to relish what being human is like, travels to Ankh-Morpork to indulge in new experiences, including getting drunk, dancing, gambling and finding a job. Mort in turn starts to become more like Death, adopting his mannerisms and aspects of his personality, while his own is slowly overridden.\nDeath's absence forces Mort to collect the next two souls, who are both located on separate parts of the Disc (in the Agatean Empire and Tsort, respectively), and due to die on the same night that the alternate reality will be destroyed. Before he and Ysabell leave to collect the souls, Mort uses the part of Death within him to force Albert to provide a spell that will slow down the alternate reality's destruction. After Mort and Ysabell leave, Albert returns to Unseen University, under the identity of Malich. His eagerness to live on the Disc is reinvigorated during this time, and he has the wizards perform the Rite of AshkEnte in the hope of finally escaping Death's grasp. The ritual summons both Death and the part of Death that had been taking Mort over, restoring him to normal. Unaware of Albert's treachery, Death takes him back into his service, the Librarian preventing the wizard's escape.\nMort and Ysabell travel to Keli's palace, where the princess and Cutwell have organised a hasty coronation ceremony in the hope that Keli can be crowned queen before the alternate reality is destroyed. With the reality now too small for Albert's spell, Mort and Ysabell save Keli and Cutwell from being destroyed with the alternate reality. They return to Death's domain to find a furious Death waiting for them, the latter having learned of Mort's actions from Albert. Death dismisses Mort and attempts to take the souls of Keli and Cutwell, but Mort challenges him to a duel for them. Though Death eventually wins the duel, he spares Mort's life and sends him back to the Disc.\nDeath convinces the gods to change the original reality so that Keli rules in place of the Duke, who was inadvertently killed during Death and Mort's duel due to the destruction of his lifetimer. Mort and Ysabell \u2013 who have fallen in love over the course of the story \u2013 get married, and are made Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit by Keli, while Cutwell is made the Master of the Queen's Bedchamber. Death attends Mort and Ysabell's wedding reception, where he warns Mort that he will have to make sure that the original Duke's destiny is fulfilled, and presents him with the alternate reality he created, now shrunk to the size of a large pearl, before the two part on amicable terms.\nAdaptations.\nStephen Briggs adapted the novel for the stage in 1992.\nThe novel was adapted as a graphic novel, \"Mort: The Big Comic\", published in 1994.\nThe novel has been adapted by Robin Brooks for BBC Radio Four. Narrated by Anton Lesser, with Geoffrey Whitehead as Death, Carl Prekopp as Mort, Clare Corbett as Ysabell and Alice Hart as Princess Keli, the programme was first broadcast in four parts in mid-2004 and has been repeated frequently, most recently on Radio 4 Extra.\nOn 15 December 2007 a German-language stage musical adaptation premiered in Hamburg.\nAn English musical adaptation of \"Mort\" was presented in Guildford in August 2008 by Youth Music Theatre UK. The adaptation was by Jenifer Toksvig (sister of Sandi Toksvig) and the composer was Dominic Haslam. A new production, directed by Luke Sheppard, was staged at the Greenwich Theatre in 2011.\nCancelled animated adaptation.\nAfter the film \"The Princess and the Frog\" (2009), Disney animators John Musker and Ron Clements planned that their next project would be an animated film version of \"Mort\", but their failure to obtain the film rights prevented them from continuing with the project, instead creating \"Moana\".\nReception.\nDave Langford reviewed \"Mort\" for \"White Dwarf\" #96, and stated that \"After a slightly less successful experiment in \"Equal Rites\", Pratchett has sussed the combination of hilarity with a tortuous plot, and the rest of us would-be humorists hate him for it.\"\nIn the BBC's 2003 Big Read contest, viewers voted on the \"Nation's Best-loved Book\"; \"Mort\" was among the Top 100 and chosen as the most popular of Pratchett's novels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nBerners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web's subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In 2009, he was elected Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.\nBerners-Lee was previously a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is an advisor at social network MeWe. In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. He received the 2016 Turing Award \"for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale\". He was named in \"Time\" magazine's list of the and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.\nEarly life.\nBerners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Berners-Lee (n\u00e9e Woods; 1924\u20132017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921\u20132019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management.\nBerners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.\nIn 1976, Berners-Lee took a first in physics from The Queen's College, Oxford. While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.\nCareer and research.\nAfter graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.\nBerners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.\nAfter leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a \"real-time remote procedure call\" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.\nIn 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and\u2014ta-da!\u2014the World Wide Web.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.\u2014\u200a\nBerners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and redistributed it in 1990. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall, who called his proposals \"vague, but exciting\". Robert Cailliau had independently proposed a project to develop a hypertext system at CERN, and joined Berners-Lee as a partner in his efforts to get the web off the ground. They used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which Berners-Lee designed and built the first web browser. His software also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN httpd (Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).\nBerners-Lee published the first website, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server and a website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.\nIn a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of 25 eminent scientists, academics, writers and world leaders in 2016, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked number one, with the entry stating: \"The fastest growing communications medium of all time, the Internet has changed the shape of modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world.\"\nIn 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that anyone could easily adopt them.\nBerners-Lee participated in Curl Corp's attempt to develop and promote the Curl programming language.\nIn 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset. In 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.\nIn a \"Times\" article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes (\"//\") in a web address were \"unnecessary\". He told the newspaper that he easily could have designed web addresses without the slashes. \"There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time,\" he said in his lighthearted apology.\nSince 2021, Berners-Lee has been an advisory board member of Proton Foundation.\nPolicy work.\nBy 2010, he created data.gov.uk alongside Nigel Shadbolt. Of the Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: \"The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to\u2014not the other way around.\" He added: \"Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.\"\nIn November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF).\nBerners-Lee is one of the pioneer voices in favour of net neutrality, and has expressed the view that ISPs should supply \"connectivity with no strings attached\", neither controlling nor monitoring customers' browsing activity without their express consent. He advocates the idea that net neutrality is a kind of human network right: \"Threats to the Internet, such as companies or governments that interfere with or snoop on Internet traffic, compromise basic human network rights.\" Berners-Lee participated in an open letter to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He and 20 other Internet pioneers urged the FCC to cancel a vote on 14 December 2017 to uphold net neutrality. The letter was addressed to Senator Roger Wicker, Senator Brian Schatz, Representative Marsha Blackburn and Representative Michael F. Doyle.\nBerners-Lee was honoured as the \"Inventor of the World Wide Web\" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer. He tweeted \"This is for everyone\" which appeared in LED lights attached to the chairs of the audience. In 2025, he released a book on the history of the Internet by the same name.\nBerners-Lee joined the board of advisors of start-up \"State.com\", based in London. As of May 2012, he is president of the Open Data Institute, which he and Shadbolt co-founded in 2012.\nThe Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in 2013, and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft. The A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world where, in 2013, only 31% of people were online. Berners-Lee will work with those aiming to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.\nBerners-Lee holds the founders chair in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he heads the Decentralized Information Group and is leading Solid, a joint project with the Qatar Computing Research Institute that aims to radically change the way Web applications work, resulting in true data ownership and greater privacy. In 2016, he joined the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University as a professorial research fellow and as a fellow of Christ Church, one of the Oxford colleges.\nFrom the mid-2010s, Berners-Lee initially remained neutral on the emerging Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) proposal with its controversial digital rights management (DRM) implications. In March 2017 he felt he had to take a position, which was to support the EME proposal. He reasoned EME's virtues whilst noting DRM was inevitable. As W3C director, he approved the finalised specification in July 2017. His stance was opposed by some, including Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the anti-DRM campaign Defective by Design and the Free Software Foundation. Concerns included being not supportive of the Internet's open philosophy against commercial interests and risks of users being forced to use a particular web browser to view specific DRM content. The EFF raised a formal appeal. It did not succeed, and the EME specification became a formal W3C recommendation in September 2017.\nOn 30 September 2018, Berners-Lee announced his open-source startup Inrupt to fuel a commercial ecosystem around the Solid project, which aims to give users more control over their personal data and let them choose where the data goes, who's allowed to see certain elements and which apps are allowed to see that data.\nIn November 2019, at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin, Berners-Lee and the WWWF launched \"Contract for the Web\", a campaign initiative to persuade governments, companies and citizens to commit to nine principles to stop \"misuse\", with the warning that \"if we don't act now\u00a0\u2013 and act together\u00a0\u2013 to prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering [its potential for good]\".\nAwards and honours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe wove the World Wide Web and created a mass medium for the 21st century. The World Wide Web is Berners-Lee's alone. He designed it. He loosed it on the world. And he more than anyone else has fought to keep it open, nonproprietary and free.\n\u2014Tim Berners-Lee's entry in \"Time\" magazine's list of the , March 1999.\nBerners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours \"for services to the global development of the Internet\", and was invested formally on 16 July 2004.\nOn 13 June 2007, he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), an order restricted to 24 living members, plus any honorary members. Bestowing membership of the Order of Merit is within the personal purview of the Sovereign and does not require recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001. He was also elected as a member into the American Philosophical Society in 2004 and the National Academy of Engineering in 2007.\nHe has been conferred honorary degrees from a number of universities around the world, including Manchester (his parents worked on the Manchester Mark 1 in the 1940s), Harvard and Yale.\nIn 2012, Berners-Lee was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork \u2013 the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover \u2013 to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.\nIn 2013, he was awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. On 4 April 2017, he received the 2016 Association for Computing Machinery's Turing Award for his invention of the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and their fundamental protocols and algorithms.\nPersonal life.\nBerners-Lee has said \"I like to keep work and personal life separate.\"\nBerners-Lee has married three times. Following final exams in Oxford, he married Jane Northcote (daughter of Cambridge biologist Don Northcote) in 1976. They moved together to Poole to work at Plessey, and then moved in 1980 to work at CERN together for a six-month contract. After their return to Britain, they decided to end their marriage.\nIn 1990, Berners-Lee married Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer. She was also working in Switzerland at the World Health Organization. They had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, he married Rosemary Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London. Leith is a Canadian Internet and banking entrepreneur and a founding director of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation. The couple also collaborate on venture capital to support artificial intelligence companies.\nBerners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but he turned away from religion in his youth. After he became a parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist (UU). When asked whether he believes in God, he said: \"Not in the sense of most people. I'm atheist and Unitarian Universalist.\"\nThe web's source code was auctioned by Sotheby's in London during 23\u201330 June 2021, as a non-fungible token (NFT) by Berners-Lee. It sold for US$5,434,500. The proceeds would reportedly be used to fund initiatives by Berners-Lee and Leith.\nIn 2025, Berners-Lee published a memoir, \"This is For Everyone\", with ghostwriter Stephen Witt. It received mixed reviews. Stephen Fry recorded the audiobook.\nIn November 2025, Berners-Lee was the guest on BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\". His chosen luxury to take to the hypothetical island was a chromatic harmonica.\nViews.\nBerners-Lee views Wikipedia as probably the best single example of what he wanted the World Wide Web to be. At the end of Chapter 7 of \"This is for Everyone\", he writes: Wikipedia has grown to contain millions of articles on every subject known to our species \u2013 an invaluable repository of human knowledge that I consider one of the modern wonders of the world. What made this system work was \"intercreativity\" \u2013 a group of people being creative. Wikipedia is probably the best single example of what I wanted the web to be. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30035", "revid": "40043980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30035", "title": "The Legend of Zelda", "text": "Video game series\n is a video game series created by Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo; some installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Flagship, Grezzo, and Tantalus Media. \nThe series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young man of the elf-like Hylian race, and Princess Zelda, a princess within the bloodline of the goddess Hylia, as they fight to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king who wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic that can grant any wish its user desires when complete, to remake the world in his own dark image. If someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required virtue. While the conflict with Ganon serves as a backbone for the series, some games have featured other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being sent to these other lands in their time of need.\nSince \"The Legend of Zelda\" was released in 1986, the series has expanded to include 21 entries on all of Nintendo's major game consoles, as well as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on the games aired in 1989 and manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan since 1997. \"The Legend of Zelda\" is one of Nintendo's most successful franchises; several of its entries are considered among the greatest video games of all time.\nGameplay.\nGameplay of \"The Legend of Zelda\" games feature a mix of puzzles, action-adventure, and exploration. These elements used to be constant throughout the series, with small refinements and additions in each new game. Later installments include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Depending on the game, players control Link or Princess Zelda from a fixed top-down perspective or in a 3D game world with a free-roaming camera.\n\"Zelda\" games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, but the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas. Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series, while others are unique to a single game. Staples of the series include bombs that can both act as weapons and open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; shields; bows and arrows; light sources; magical rods, hammers, and musical instruments; digging tools; and a grappling hook-like device called the hookshot. Items can be bought, rented, or found as a puzzle-solving reward, depending on the game. In 2017's \"Breath of the Wild\" and its 2023 sequel, \"Tears of the Kingdom\", swords and other weapons originally found in dungeons or purchased from shops are now found in the game world and stolen from defeated enemies. These are generally used through by swapping out to one or more selected button prompts through a menu, while the sword is usually fixed. Echoes copied by Zelda in \"\" also attack or clear paths with bombs. Early in certain \"Zelda\" games, swords are given to Link and/or found in a secluded area. More powerful swords, or special sword abilities, can be discovered by Link or taught to him in the games. Existing weapons can also receive upgrades.\nThe motion controls of 2011's \"Skyward Sword\", using either the Wii's Wii MotionPlus or the Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con, simulate sword fighting by swinging the controller in specific directions to attack enemies or counter an enemy's attempt to block. \"Breath of the Wild\" introduced a physics engine\u2014allowing for physics-based solutions such as crushing an enemy via rolling a boulder onto it\u2014and what was called a chemistry engine, a rule-based state calculator in which various elements (fire, water, wind, etc.) interact with other objects and elements in different ways. \"Echoes of Wisdom\" is also a departure from other games' style of combat, as the playable Zelda is primarily unable to directly hit enemies on her own. Instead, she uses an item called the Tri Rod to create echoes via coping objects and enemies and recreating them to solve puzzles and defeat enemies, even if the object or enemy in question is not in the area or region her current situation is. Another physics-based technique in newer \"Zelda\" titles involves using certain abilities to allow Link or Zelda to remotely move or drop objects on top of enemies, drop enemies down holes, or propel themselves across gaps.\nAlthough the games contain role-playing elements (' is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat. This has led to much debate over whether or not \"Zelda\" games should be classified as action RPGs, a genre on which the series has had a strong influence. In 1992, series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto disagreed with the label, classifying \"Zelda\" as \"a real-time adventure game\". He said that he was \"not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers\" but wanted \"to preserve as much of that 'live' feeling as possible\", and felt that action games are better suited to convey to players. In 2012, \"Dark Souls\" director Hidetaka Miyazaki listed \"A Link to the Past\" as one of his top RPGs, alongside video games such as \"Dragon Quest III\", ', and ', and the collectable card game, '.\nThe games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry standards. The original \"Zelda\" was the first console game with a save function that enabled players to stop playing and then resume later. \"Ocarina of Time\" introduced a targeting system that let the player lock the camera on to enemy or friendly non-player characters which simplified 3D combat.\nOverworld and Dungeons.\nMany mainline \"Zelda\" game consist of three key areas: an overworld which connects all other areas and allows multidirectional movement is multidirectional, giving players some degree of freedom; areas of interaction with other characters (like caves, towns, or hidden rooms) in which the player can purchase equipment, gain special items or advice, or complete side quests; and dungeons (or temples, towers, etc.), labyrinthine areas found underground (with some exceptions), comprising a wide range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each usually has one major item that can be essential for solving its puzzles and often plays a crucial role in defeating its boss and/or progressing through the game. In 2013, \"\" introduced a more open-ended progression system by allowing Link to rent items to reach and beat the last seven dungeons. Following this, every main dungeon in \"Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of the Kingdom\" can be accessed in any order before reaching the final boss in their open world setting. Neither game has items hidden inside dungeons for progression, but the latter involves the help of specific companions to solve tasks in their respective Temples.\nNavigating a dungeon is usually aided by locating a map, which reveals its layout, and a magic compass, which reveals the location of significant and smaller items such as keys and equipment. In games released after the NES, dungeons include a special \"big key\" or \"boss key\" that unlocks the door to fight its boss. In place of a big key, \"Breath of the Wild\" has Link use his Sheikah Slate to activate all the control terminals inside the dungeon before its boss attacks him, and \"Tears of the Kingdom\" has companions reach and interact with the locations of multiple locks in the relevant Temple to open the door to the boss. The original \"Zelda\" on the NES had its dungeons known as \"the underworld\" in contrast to the overworld, but later games had broad sections located underground or behind rifts that were not dungeons in of themselves, but connected to the overworld or other dungeons, such as Subrosia in ', the Depths in \"Tears of the Kingdom\", and the Still World in \"Echoes of Wisdom\". Some games, like ', \"Four Swords Adventures\" and \"Tri Force Heroes\", have no broadly-connecting overworld, and use randomly picked levels, a linear progression of numbered levels, or a hub world like Hytopia Castle Town.\nSailing and gliding.\nWhile a raft first appeared in the first game, they had limited use and can only be boarded from a dock. Sailing is\u2014by design\u2014the only way to traverse the island-dotted overworlds of \"The Wind Waker\" in 2002 and \"Phantom Hourglass\" in 2007. By \"Breath of the Wild\", rafts' sails could be propelled by wind using the chemistry engine, and logs could also be used as makeshift boats. The introduction of Ultrahand and Zonai machine parts in \"Tears of the Kingdom\" gave players the ability to build a raft or a flying machine out of parts. While gliding had previously been used for puzzles and minigames with the guidance of chickens known as Cuccos, and an item to help scale cliff faces appeared in 2004's \"The Minish Cap\", \"Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of the Kingdom\" use both elements more prominently. In the games' open world, climbing walls and gliding off them on a paraglider makes it possible for the player to plot out multiple routes; in contrast to the way some players had been \"glitching\" up mountains players while controlling Geralt in \"The Witcher\" series and Dovahkiin in \"\" (2011), here it is not considered unintentional climbing. Instead of mountains being impassable walls they are fully climbable for the players by design. \"Tears of the Kingdom\" also allows Link to be launched into the sky and travel further with either Zonai machines or gliding. The Reverse Bond ability in \"Echoes of Wisdom\" also has Zelda attach herself to a climbing spider or flying bird monster to progress through the game world.\nHealth and fairies.\nIn most \"Zelda\" games, the player's HP or life meter is represented by a line of hearts. The player usually starts with three hearts; their max health can be increased by finding heart-shaped crystals called heart containers. Full heart containers are usually received at the end of dungeons and dropped by dungeon bosses. Smaller \"Pieces of Heart\" are awarded for completing side quests or found hidden throuought the game world, and require a certain number (commonly four) to form a full heart container. Health can be replenished by picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed objects, consuming items such as potions or food, or going to a Great Fairy Fountain to have the Great Fairy heal Link completely. \"Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of the Kingdom\" broke from this tradition, and had Link hunt and cook his food or find potion ingredients in cut grass rather than freely be given hearts to pick up. Occasionally, the player will find fairies hidden in specific locations; they can either heal Link immediately or be kept in empty bottles, and will revive him the next time he dies.\nConception and production.\nInspiration.\n\"The Legend of Zelda\" was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's \"explorations\" as a young boy in the hillsides and forests surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan. According to Miyamoto, one of his most memorable experiences was finding a cave entrance in the middle of the woods. After some hesitation, he entered the cave and explored its depths with the aid of a lantern. Miyamoto has referred to the creation of the \"Zelda\" games as an attempt to bring to life a \"miniature garden\" for players to play with in each game of the series.\nThe story and setting were developed by Takashi Tezuka. Seeking to create a fairytale adventure game, Tezuka drew inspirations from fantasy books such as J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". According to Keiji Terui, who wrote the backstory in the first game's manual, the location named Death Mountain was initially a working title for the legend of the Triforce which was written with inspirations from the battles of medieval Europe. The Master Sword was introduced as Excalibur in the French version of \"A Link to the Past\", which is regarded as reminiscent to the legend of King Arthur. Link's steed, was named after Epona, Celtic goddess of fertility.\nPrincess Zelda was named after American novelist, socialite and painter Zelda Fitzgerald, as Miyamoto thought the name sounded \"pleasant and significant\". Tezuka modeled Link's appearance after the eponymous character of Walt Disney's \"Peter Pan\" (1953). When the series made the transition to 3D, the combat system of \"Ocarina of Time\" was based on the chanbara (samurai) style of Japanese sword fighting.\nAudio.\nGames in \"The Legend of Zelda\" series frequently feature in-game musical instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread. Often, instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in \"The Legend of Zelda\" can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the dungeon entrances. This warping with music feature has also been used in \"A Link to the Past\" and \"Link's Awakening\". In \"Ocarina of Time\", playing instruments is a core part of the game, with the player needing to play the instrument through the use of the game controller to succeed. \"Ocarina of Time\" is \"[one of the] first contemporary non-dance title[s] to feature music-making as part of its gameplay\", using music as a heuristic device and requiring the player to utilise songs to progress in the game \u2013 a game mechanic that is also present in \"Majora's Mask\".\n\"The Legend of Zelda Theme\" is a recurring piece of music that was created for the first game. The composer and sound director of the series, Koji Kondo, initially planned to use Maurice Ravel's \"Bol\u00e9ro\" as the game's title theme, but was forced to change it after learning the orchestral piece had not yet entered the public domain late in production. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day.\nUp until \"Breath of the Wild\", the \"Legend of Zelda\" series avoided using voice acting in speaking roles, relying instead on written dialogue. Series producer Eiji Aonuma previously stated that having the other characters speak while Link remains silent \"would be off-putting\".\nPlot.\nSetting.\n\"The Legend of Zelda\" takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, which has developed a deep history and wide geography over the series's many releases. Hyrule's principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called Hylians, which include the protagonists Link and Zelda.\nThe fictional universe established by the \"Zelda\" games sets the stage for each adventure. Some games take place in different lands with their own back-stories. Labrynna (from '), Holodrum (from '), and Hytopia (from ') are different countries separate from the Kingdom of Hyrule, Termina (from '), the World of the Ocean King (from '), and Lorule (from ') serve as parallel worlds, and Koholint is an island far away from Hyrule that appears to be part of a dream.\nStory.\nThe world of Hyrule was created by three golden goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru. They created the world to trap Null, which absorbed all life that appeared in an endless void created by it. Before departing, the three goddesses left the Triforce, a sacred artifact which could grant any wish to its user. It manifests as three golden triangles, each embodying one of the goddesses' virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom. However, as the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately. Because of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the \"Sacred Realm\" until one worthy of its power and has the balanced virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom in their heart could obtain it in its entirety. If a person does not possess balanced heart and tries to use the Triforce, it will split into three parts; the virtue that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the remainding two will seek out others. In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them. The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enter it: a pure heart will make it a paradise while evil will transform it into a dark realm.\nIn \"Skyward Sword\", the Triforce was sought by the demon king Demise, an eternal being that had conquered time itself. After a long battle against the goddess Hylia, guardian of the Triforce, Demise was sealed away within her temple. Hylia, placing the world's inhabitants known as Hylians on a floating island in the sky called Skyloft to protect them, orchestrated a means to stop the demon from escaping: creating the Goddess Sword (later becoming the Master Sword) for her chosen hero and discarding her divinity to be reborn among the people of Skyloft. In time, Zelda and Link (the reborn Hylia and her predestined warrior) enacted the goddess's plan and Demise was destroyed, but he vowed that his rage would be reborn and forever plague those descended from Link and Zelda. Following the establishment of Hyrule Kingdom, Demise's prophecy came to fruition in \"Ocarina of Time\", when Ganondorf's attempt to get the Triforce scattered it with him gaining the Triforce of Power. The Triforce of Wisdom ended up with the Hylian princesses descended from Zelda, each named after her, while the Triforce of Courage is passed to a youth named Link across generations. While the Triforces of Power and Wisdom have been part of the series since the original \"The Legend of Zelda\", it was in \"\" that the Triforce of Courage was introduced, being obtained by Link at the end of his quest. The Triforce, or even a piece of it, is not always distributed as a whole. Such as in \"The Wind Waker\", Link must find all the pieces (called Triforce Shards) of the Triforce of Courage before he can return to Hyrule. Even in the original \"The Legend of Zelda\", Zelda breaks her Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces for Link to find, before she was captured by Ganon.\nFictional chronology.\nThe chronology of the \"Legend of Zelda\" series was a subject of much debate among fans until an official timeline was released within the \"\" collector's book, first released in Japan in December 2011. Prior to its release, in a 2003 interview, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed the existence of an internal document which connected all the games, with series producer Eiji Aonuma later revealing in 2010 the confidential nature of this document, which only Miyamoto himself and the director of each game had access to.\nIn-game content, marketing material, and developer statements once partially established a timeline of the released installments: the original \"The Legend of Zelda\" was followed by \"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\", which takes place several years later; \"A Link to the Past\" is a prequel to the previous two games, and is followed by '; the events of \"Ocarina of Time\" occur many centuries before \"A Link to the Past\" (according to character designer Satoru Takizawa, it was meant to implicitly tell the story of the Imprisoning War), and was followed by '; ' predates \"Ocarina of Time\"; \"The Wind Waker\" takes place in one of the parallel timelines that emerged from \"Ocarina of Time\", more than a century later; ', upon its release, was considered to be a direct sequel to \"Four Swords\", set sometime after its events; ' is a prequel to \"Four Swords\", telling of the origins of the villain Vaati and the creation of the Four Sword; \"Twilight Princess\" takes place after \"Majora's Mask\"; ' is a sequel to \"The Wind Waker\", and is followed by \"Spirit Tracks\", which is set about a century later on a land far away from the setting of \"The Wind Waker;\"and \"Skyward Sword\" precedes \"The Minish Cap\", telling the story of the creation of the Master Sword.\nIn the early 2000s, Nintendo of America released a timeline on the official website of the series as one of the possible interpretation of the events from all entries released up to that point, featuring a single protagonist named Link, the \"Hero of Time\" from its first adventure in \"Ocarina of Time\". It was followed by \"Majora's Mask\", \"A Link to the Past\", ', ', the original \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\", and finally \"Link's Awakening\". In 2011, series translator Daniel Owsen revealed that, at one point, his coworkers at Nintendo of America and him conceived another complete timeline and intended to make it available online, but the Japanese series developers rejected the idea so that the placement of each game would be kept open to the imagination of the players.\nOn December 21, 2011, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series, \"The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia\" art book was published by Shogakukan, which contained an official timeline of the fictional chronology of the series up to that point. This timeline subsequently posits that following \"Ocarina of Time\", it splits into three alternate routes: in one, Link ultimately fails to defeat Ganon, leading into the Imprisoning War and \"A Link to the Past\", \"Oracle of Seasons\" and \"Oracle of Ages\", \"Link's Awakening\", \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"The Adventure of Link\". The second and third, where Link successfully defeats Ganon, lead to a split timeline between his childhood (where Zelda sends him back in time so he can use the wisdom he has gained to warn young Zelda of the horrifying fate of Hyrule) and adulthood (where adult Zelda lives on to try and rebuild her kingdom). His childhood continues with \"Majora's Mask\", followed by \"Twilight Princess\" and \"Four Swords Adventures\". The timeline from his adult life continues into \"Wind Waker\", \"Phantom Hourglass\" and \"Spirit Tracks\".\nReleased in 2013, ' takes place six generations after \"A Link to the Past\", and features the Triforce being reunited, and Ganon being resurrected, while 2015's ' is a direct sequel to \"A Link Between Worlds\", which takes place several years later.\nIn 2018, Nintendo revealed the placement of the timeline of the previous year's ' was after all previous games in the series, without specifying a connection to any of the three timeline branches. Aonuma and \"Breath of the Wild\" director Hidemaro Fujibayashi justified the vague placement with the previous idea of keeping it open to players' imaginations. Nintendo moved \"Link's Awakening\" to take place before \"Oracle of Seasons\" and \"Oracle of Ages\". In 2020, Nintendo released ', a gameplay-wise sequel to the 2014 spin-off game \"Hyrule Warriors\", set 100 years before \"Breath of the Wild\", but with the events of \"Age of Calamity\" diverging from the backstory established in \"Breath of the Wild\", ostensibly creating an alternate timeline separate from it. However, events depicted within \"Age of Calamity\" unrelated to its use of time travel differ from events established in \"Breath of the Wild\" and its supplementary art book, \"Creating a Champion\" - such as Link pulling the Master Sword during the events of \"Age of Calamity\", when he was previously established to have obtained it in his youth - rendering \"Age of Calamity\" wholly non-canonical. In 2023 ', a direct sequel to \"Breath of the Wild\", was released; it depicts the Imprisoning War as taking place shortly after Hyrule's founding by the Zonai king, Rauru. In 2025 ' was added to the timeline after \"Tri Force Heroes\" and before \"The Legend of Zelda\". \"\" takes place during the events of \"Tears of the Kingdom\", where Zelda was sent back in time to when Hyrule was founded and fights in the Imprisoning War. To date, it is the only canonical \"Hyrule Warriors\" game.\nCharacters.\nLink.\nThe central protagonist of \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, and the primary player character of every individual game except for \"\", Link is the name of various Hylian young men or boys who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage. In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters (NPCs). Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist \"Link\" because the character is/was supposed to be the \"link\" between the player and the game world. The various Links each have a special title, such as \"Hero of Time\", \"Hero of Winds\" or \"Hero of the Wild\". Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak and only produces grunts, yells, and similar sounds, but he is not mute\u00a0\u2013 dialogue from him is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, despite not being seen or heard by the player. Link is depicted as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.\nPrincess Zelda.\nPrincess Zelda is the princess of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom. Her name is present in many of her ancestors and descendants. She sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link. She was not playable in the main series until \"Spirit Tracks\", where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player, and becomes the primary playable character in \"Echoes of Wisdom\", in which Link is largely absent and Zelda does not speak. Zelda appears under various other aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in \"Ocarina of Time\") and Tetra (in \"The Wind Waker\" and \"Phantom Hourglass\"). In \"Skyward Sword\", it is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline. The name \"Zelda\" derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald.\nGanon.\nGanon, also known as Ganondorf in his Gerudo form, is the final boss in a slight majority (12 out of 21, including Demise) of \"The Legend of Zelda\" games. In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of women save for one man born every one hundred years. He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often, he seeks the complete Triforce, a powerful magical relic, part of it often in the possession of Link and Zelda. He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength, but it is often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces. Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the exception of \"Four Swords Adventures\", where he is a reincarnation of the original. In each game the battles with him are different and he fights using different styles. The game \"Skyward Sword\" indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of a Demon King known as Demise.\nMain series.\n1986\u20131997: 2D origins.\n\"The Legend of Zelda\", the first game of the series, was first released in Japan in February 1986, on the Famicom Disk System. A cartridge version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, using battery-backed memory, was released in 1987 in the United States on August 22, and in Europe on November 27. The game features a \"Second Quest\", accessible either upon completing the game, or by registering one's name as \"ZELDA\" when starting a new quest. The \"Second Quest\" features different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies.\nThe second game, \", was released for the Famicom Disk System in Japan in January 1987, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe in September 1988 and North America in December 1988. The game exchanged the top-down perspective for side-scrolling (though the top-down point of view was retained for overworld areas), and introduced RPG elements (such as experience points) not used previously or thereafter in the series.\n\" returned to the top-down view and added the concept of an alternate dimension, the Dark World. The game was released for the Super NES in November 1991. \"A Link to the Past\" was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. The SNES version was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in January 2007, on the Wii U Virtual Console, and on Nintendo Classics.\nThe next game, ', for Nintendo's Game Boy, is the first \"Zelda\" for a handheld, and the first set outside Hyrule and to exclude Princess Zelda. \"Link's Awakening\" was re-released, in full color, as a launch game for the Game Boy Color in 1998 as '. This remaster features additions such as an extra color-based dungeon and a photo shop that allows interaction with the Game Boy Printer. \"Link's Awakening DX\" was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in June 2011. An was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.\n1998\u20132001: Transition to 3D.\nThe series made the transition to 3D with ' for the Nintendo 64, which was released in November 1998. This game, initially known as \"Zelda 64\" and in development for the Japanese-only 64DD before converting to cartridge format when the hardware was delayed, retains the core gameplay of the previous 2D games. A new gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, enables more precise sword fighting in a 3D space by focusing the camera on a nearby target and alters the player's actions relative to that target. The game heavily uses context-sensitive button play, having the player control various actions, each handled slightly differently, using only one button on the controller (e.g. standing next to a block and pressing A would make Link grab it, enabling him to push orpull it, but moving forwards into a block and tapping A has Link climb the block). The game debuted Link's horse, Epona, allowing Link to travel quickly across land and fire arrows from horseback. \"Ocarina of Time\" was very successful commercially and critically, considered by many critics and gamers to be the best video game of all time, and ranking highly on \"IGN\" and \"EGM\"'s \"greatest games of all time\" lists, as well as scoring perfect scores in several video game publications. In February 2006, it was ranked by \"Nintendo Power\" as the best game released for a Nintendo console. The cancelled 64DD expansion for \"Ocarina of Time\", known as \"Ura Zelda\" during development, was re-released on the GameCube in 2002 as a pre-order incentive for \"The Wind Waker\" in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Named ', the game was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty. Europe would receive this \"Two-Game Bonus Disc\" free in every copy of \"The Wind Waker\", except for the discounted Player's Choice version. \"Ocarina of Time\" was available through the Wii and Wii U's respective Virtual Console services and \"Ocarina of Time\" has been made available through Nintendo Classics in HD resolution on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. \"Ocarina of Time 3D\" for the Nintendo 3DS, featuring remade graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in June 2011.\n\"Ocarina of Time\"'s follow-up, ', was released in April 2000. It uses the same 3D game engine as the previous game, and added a time-based concept, in which Link relives the events of three days as many times as needed to complete the game's objectives. It was originally called \"Zelda Gaiden\", a Japanese title that translates as \"Zelda Side story\". Gameplay changed significantly; in addition to the time-limit, Link can use masks to transform into creatures with unique abilities. While \"Majora's Mask\" retains the graphical style of \"Ocarina of Time\", it is also a departure, particularly in its atmosphere. It features motion-blur, unlike its predecessor. The game is darker in tone, dealing with death and tragedy in a manner not previously seen in the series, and has a sense of impending doom, as a large moon slowly descends upon the land of to destroy all life. \"Majora's Mask\" was available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console catalogues. ' was released for 3DS in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia in February 2015. The Nintendo 64 version was added to Nintendo Classics in February 2022.\n were released simultaneously for the Game Boy Color in 2001, and interact using passwords or a Game Link Cable. After one game has been completed, the player is given a password that allows the other game to be played as a sequel. They were developed by Flagship in conjunction with Nintendo, with supervision from Miyamoto. After the team experimented with porting the original \"The Legend of Zelda\" to the Game Boy Color, they decided to make an original trilogy to be called the \"Triforce Series\". When the password system linking the three games proved too troublesome, the concept was reduced to two games at Miyamoto's suggestion. These two games became \"Oracle of Ages\", which is more puzzle-based, and \"Oracle of Seasons\", which is more action-oriented. Both titles were later released on the 3DS Virtual Console and Nintendo Classics.\n2002\u20132005: Introduction of Toon Link and multiplayer.\nThe Game Boy Advance release of \"A Link to the Past\" in 2002 featured a new game, \"\", the first multiplayer \"Zelda\". This game introduced Toon Link, a name first used in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" to refer to cartoon-based visual designs of Link. \"Four Swords Anniversary Edition\" was released in September 2011, as free DSiWare available until February 20, 2012.\n', a 3D cel-shaded game also featuring Toon Link, was released in Japan in December 2002, and the US and Europe in 2003. The gameplay centers on controlling wind with a baton called the Wind Waker and sailing a small boat around an island-filled ocean, retaining similar gameplay mechanics as the previous 3D games in the series.

Based on the handheld \"Four Swords\", \"Four Swords Adventures\" was another deviation from previous \"Zelda\" gameplay, focusing on level-based and multiplayer gameplay. The game contains 24 levels and a map screen; there is no connecting overworld. For multiplayer features, each player must use a Game Boy Advance system linked to the GameCube via a Nintendo GameCube \u2013 Game Boy Advance link cable. The game features a single-player campaign, in which using a Game Boy Advance is optional. \"Four Swords Adventures\" includes two gameplay modes: \"Hyrulean Adventure\", with a plot and gameplay similar to other \"Zelda\" games, and \"Shadow Battle\", in which multiple Links, played by multiple players, battle each other. The Japanese and Korean versions include an exclusive third segment, \"Navi Trackers\", which contains spoken dialogue for most of the characters.\nIn November 2004 in Japan and Europe, and January 2005 in America, Nintendo released \"\" for the Game Boy Advance. In \"The Minish Cap\" Link can shrink in size using a mystical, sentient hat named Ezlo. While shrunk, he can see previously explored parts of a dungeon from a different perspective, and enter areas through otherwise-impassable openings. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console and Nintendo Classics.\n2006\u20132011: Motion and touch-based swordplay.\nIn November 2006, ' was released as the first \"Zelda\" game on the Wii. It was later released in December as the last Nintendo-published game for the GameCube, the console for which it was originally developed. The Wii version features motion controls and a reversed world where everything that is in the west on the GameCube is in the east on the Wii. The display is mirrored in order to make Link right-handed to make use of the Wii Remote feel more natural for the majority of players. The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult Link to confront the troubles of the \"Twilight Realm\", a mysterious force that appears around and interacts with Hyrule. When he enters this realm, he is transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use his sword, shield or other items, but gains other abilities such as sharpened senses from his new form. \"Twilight Princess\" includes an incarnation of Link's horse, Epona, for fast transportation, and features mounted battle scenarios including boss battles that were not seen in previous games. \"Twilight Princess\" diverted from the cel-shading of \"Wind Waker\", integrating graphics featuring more detailed textures, giving the game a darker atmosphere. ' was released for Wii U in 2016.\n\"\" was released in June 2007 in Japan and October in North America and Europe for the Nintendo DS. It had a cel-shaded 3D graphical design with top-down gameplay and gameplay optimised for the DS' touch screen.

In this game, the \"spirit tracks\", railroads which chain an ancient evil, are disappearing from Hyrule. Zelda and Link go to the Spirit Tower (the ethereal point of convergence for the tracks) to find out why, but villains Cole and Byrne steal Zelda's body for the resurrection of the Demon King. Rendered disembodied, Zelda is left a spirit, and only Link (and a certain few sages) can see her. Together they go on a quest to restore the spirit tracks, defeat the Demon King, and return Zelda to her body. Using a modified engine of that used in \"Phantom Hourglass\", the notably new feature in this game is that the Phantom Guardians seen in \"Phantom Hourglass\" are, through a series of events, periodically controllable by Zelda.

The Game &amp; Watch game \"Zelda\" was released first in August 1989 as a dual-screen handheld electronic game. It was re-released in 1998 as a Toymax, Inc. Mini Classic and was later included as an unlockable extra in \"Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4\", a 2002 compilation for the Game Boy Advance. While the Game &amp; Watch \"Zelda\" was developed in-house by Nintendo, the subsequent two LCD games were developed by third parties under license by Nintendo. In October 1989, \"The Legend of Zelda\" was developed by Nelsonic as part of its Game Watch line. This game was an actual digital watch with primitive gameplay based on the original \"Legend of Zelda\". In 1992, Epoch Co. developed \"\" for its Barcode Battler\u00a0II console. The game employed card-scanning technology similar to the later-released Nintendo e-Reader.\nThree video games were developed and released on CD-i in the early 1990s as a product of a compromise between Philips and Nintendo, after the companies failed to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Created independently with no observation by or influence from Nintendo, the games are , and later, \"Zelda's Adventure\". Nintendo never acknowledged them in the \"Zelda\" timeline, and they are considered to be in a separate, self-contained canon.

The original plan, however, was to release three titles concurrently, but one title, \"\", had to be cancelled due to technical issues arising from complications related to the interconnected nature of the titles.\nClose Nintendo collaborator Retro Studios did preliminary work on two separate \"Zelda\" pitches. \"Heroes of Hyrule\" would have been a Nintendo DS game that would have combined the traditional gameplay of the series with that of tactical role-playing games like \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". They additionally proposed an action game for the Wii starring Sheik that would have explored the origins of the Master Sword. Both were cancelled after being rejected by Nintendo.\nReception.\n\"The Legend of Zelda\" series has received outstanding levels of acclaim from critics and the public.

Link appears as a fighter in \"Super Smash Bros.\" for the Nintendo 64, the first entry in the series, and is part of the roster in all subsequent releases in the series as well. Zelda (who can transform into Sheik), Ganondorf, and Young Link (the child version of Link from \"Ocarina of Time\") were added to the player roster for \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", and appeared in all subsequent releases except for \"Young Link\" (who is later replaced by \"Toon Link\" from \"The Wind Waker\", in subsequent releases \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\"). Sheik becomes a separate playable character from \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\" onwards.

Further details of this series went sparse until 2021 when Adam Conover gave an interview regarding his \"College Humor\" period. There, the \"College Humor\" team had been planning a skit that would have combined \"Star Fox\" with \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" and had even talked to Miyamoto on the project. Conover said that they were told about a month into the project that Nintendo had requested they stop all work on the project as a result of the leak related to the live-action \"Zelda\" show; Nintendo, already protective of its IP, had pulled many external projects including the live-action show.\nPrint media.\nValiant Comics released a short series of comics featuring characters and settings from the \"Zelda\" cartoon as part of their \"Nintendo Comics System\" line.

It was written by Tracey West and was set shortly after the events of \"Ocarina of Time\".\nIn 2011, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the series, an art book, ', was published in Japan by Shogakukan. It was followed by an international release by Dark Horse Books in 2013. It contains concept art from the series's conception to the release of \"Skyward Sword\" in 2011 and multiple essays about the production of the games, as well as an overarching timeline of the series. It also includes a prequel manga to \"Skyward Sword\" by Akira Himekawa. The English-language release took the number one spot on Amazon's sales chart, taking the spot away from E. L. James's \"50 Shades of Grey\" trilogy. Dark Horse released ', a follow-up art book to \"Hyrule Historia\" containing additional artwork and interviews, in North America and Europe in February 2017.\nMusic.\nTaking place in Cologne, Germany, on September 23, 2010, the video game music concert \"Symphonic Legends\" focused on music from Nintendo and, among others, featured games such as \"The Legend of Zelda\". Following an intermission, the second half of the concert was entirely dedicated to an expansive symphonic poem dedicated to the series. The 35-minute epic tells the story of Link's evolution from child to hero.\nTo celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series in 2011, Nintendo commissioned an original symphony, '. The show was originally performed in the fall of 2011 in Los Angeles and consists of live performances of much of the music from the series. It has since been scheduled for 18 shows so far throughout the United States and Canada. Nintendo released a CD, \"The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Special Orchestra CD\". Featuring eight tracks from live performances of the symphony, the CD is included alongside the special edition of ' for the Wii. Nintendo later celebrated \"The Legend of Zelda\"'s 30th anniversary with an album which was released in Japan in February 2017.\nThe Nintendo Music streaming service included soundtracks from eight \"Zelda\" games as of \u00a02025[ [update]] for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online to stream and listen to, including \"The Legend of Zelda\", ', ', ', ', \"Skyward Sword\", ', and '.\nMerchandise.\n\"The Legend of Zelda\"-themed \"Monopoly\" board game was released in the United States in September 2014. A \"Clue\" board game in the style of \"The Legend of Zelda\" series was released in June 2017. A \"UNO\"-styled \"The Legend of Zelda\" game was released in February 2018, exclusively at GameStop in North America. A limited edition \"Zelda\" 25th anniversary 3DS was released in December 2011, in Australia.\nFilm.\nIn 2007, Imagi Animation Studios, which had provided the animation for \"TMNT\" and \"Astro Boy\", created a pitch reel for a computer-animated \"The Legend of Zelda\" film. Nintendo did not accept the studio's offer due to the memory of the failure of the 1993 live-action film adaptation of \"Super Mario Bros.\" In 2013, Aonuma said that, if the development of a film began, the company would want to use the opportunity to embrace audience interaction in some capacity. In June 2023, it was said that Nintendo was close to closing a deal with Illumination and Universal Pictures to produce a film adaptation of the franchise following the success of their film, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\", but Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri denied these reports later that month.\nBy November 2023, Nintendo was developing a live-action \"Legend of Zelda\" film with Sony Pictures, which will co-finance and distribute it worldwide. Wes Ball has been attached to direct, with Derek Connolly writing the script, and Miyamoto and Avi Arad will be producing alongside Ball and his producing partner Joe Hartwick Jr. through their Oddball Entertainment company. In July 2025, Bo Bragason and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth had been cast as Zelda and Link respectively. The film was scheduled for worldwide release on March 26, 2027, which was later changed to May 7. Filming began in New Zealand in November 2025 and will continue until April 2026.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30038", "revid": "2243698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30038", "title": "Thomas Henry Huxley", "text": "English biologist and comparative anatomist (1825\u20131895)\nThomas Henry Huxley (4 May 1825 \u2013 29 June 1895) was an English biologist and anthropologist who specialised in comparative anatomy. He has become known as \"Darwin's Bulldog\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.\nThe stories regarding Huxley's famous 1860 Oxford evolution debate with Samuel Wilberforce were a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution and in his own career, although some historians think that aspects of the surviving story of the debate are a later fabrication. Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert Chambers, the author of \"Vestiges\", he changed his mind and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes.\nHuxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as gradualism, and was undecided about natural selection, but despite this, he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. Instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain, he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition. Huxley coined the term \"agnosticism\" in 1869 and elaborated on it in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not.\nHuxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self-taught. According to Edward Poulton, he became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the later 19th century. He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing \"Archaeopteryx\" with \"Compsognathus\", he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a view now held by modern biologists.\nThe tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution, and by his extensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere. Huxley's 1893 Romanes Lecture, \"\", is exceedingly influential in China; the Chinese translation of Huxley's lecture even transformed the Chinese translation of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\".\nEarly life.\nThomas Henry Huxley was born in Ealing, then a village in Middlesex. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. His parents were members of the Church of England, but he sympathized with nonconformists. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as Alfred Russel Wallace, Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family which had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics schoolmaster at Great Ealing School until it closed, putting the family into financial difficulties. As a result, Thomas left school at the age of 10, after only two years of formal schooling.\nDespite this lack of formal schooling, Huxley was determined to educate himself. He became one of the great autodidacts of the nineteenth century. At first he read Thomas Carlyle, James Hutton's \"Geology\", and Sir William Hamilton's \"Logic\". In his teens, he taught himself German, eventually becoming fluent and used by Charles Darwin as a translator of scientific material in German. He learned Latin, and enough Greek to read Aristotle in the original.\nLater on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert, first teaching himself about invertebrates, and later on vertebrates. He did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates. In his later debates and writing on science and religion, his grasp of theology was better than many of his clerical opponents.\nHe was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes. Chandler's practice was in London's Rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the Dickensian poor. Afterward, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband. Now aged 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind University College Hospital), a cut-price anatomy school. All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling.\nA year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the Apothecaries' yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox's assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer. Later in life, Huxley organised a pension for his old mentor.\nAt twenty he passed his First M.B. examination at the University of London, winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology. However, he did not present himself for the final (Second M.B.) exams and consequently did not qualify for a university degree. His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy.\nVoyage of the \"Rattlesnake\".\nAged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the Royal College of Surgeons for a licence to practise, yet he was \"deep in debt\". So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the Royal Navy. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a \"viva voce\").\nFinally, Huxley was made Assistant Surgeon ('surgeon's mate', but in practice marine naturalist) to HMS \"Rattlesnake\", about to set sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. The \"Rattlesnake\" left England on 3 December 1846 and, once it arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates. He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by Edward Forbes FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox). Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley.\nHuxley's paper \"On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae\" was published in 1849 by the Royal Society in its \"Philosophical Transactions\". Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of \"Hydrozoa\". The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach. This is characteristic of the phylum now called the \"Cnidaria\". He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals. When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in \"The Oceanic Hydrozoa\", published by the Ray Society in 1859.\nThe value of Huxley's work was recognised and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met Joseph Dalton Hooker and John Tyndall, who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the \"Rattlesnake\". He solved the problem of \"Appendicularia\", whose place in the animal kingdom Johannes Peter M\u00fcller had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the Ascidians are both, as Huxley showed, tunicates, today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum \"Chordata\". Other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy.\nLater life.\nFollowing a lecture at the Royal Institution on 30 April 1852 Huxley indicated that it remained difficult to earn a living as a scientist alone. This was demonstrated in a letter written on 3 May 1852, where he states \"Science in England does everything\u2014but PAY. You may earn praise but not pudding\". However, Huxley effectively resigned from the navy by refusing to return to active service, and in July 1854 he became professor of natural history at the Royal School of Mines and naturalist to the British Geological Survey in the following year. In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution 1855\u20131858 and 1865\u20131867; Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons 1863\u20131869; president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1869\u20131870; president of the Quekett Microscopical Club 1878; president of the Royal Society 1883\u20131885; Inspector of Fisheries 1881\u20131885; and president of the Marine Biological Association 1884\u20131890. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1869.\nThe thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life. Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884. He resigned the presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six months' leave. His pension was \u00a31200 a year.\nHuxley's London home, in which he wrote many of his works, was at 4\u00a0Marlborough Place, St John's Wood. The house was extended in the early 1870s to include a large drawing and dining room at which he held informal Sunday gatherings.\nIn 1890, he moved from London to Eastbourne, where he had purchased land in the Staveley Road upon which a house was built, 'Hodeslea', under the supervision of his son-in-law F.\u00a0Waller. Here Huxley edited the nine volumes of his \"Collected Essays\". In 1894 he heard of Eugene Dubois' discovery in Java of the remains of \"Pithecanthropus erectus\" (now known as \"Homo erectus\").\nHe died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia) in 1895 in Eastbourne, and was buried in London at East Finchley Cemetery. No invitations were sent out but two hundred people turned up for the funeral; they included Joseph Dalton Hooker, William Henry Flower, Mulford B. Foster, Edwin Lankester, Joseph Lister, and apparently Henry James. The family plot had been purchased upon the death of his eldest son Noel, who died of scarlet fever in 1860; Huxley's wife Henrietta Anne n\u00e9e\u00a0Heathorn and son Noel are also buried there.\nFamily.\nHuxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons:\nPublic duties and awards.\nFrom 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty. He served on eight Royal Commissions, from 1862 to 1884. From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the Royal Society and from 1883 to 1885 he was president. He was president of the Geological Society from 1868 to 1870. In 1870, he was president of the British Association at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted London School Board. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1877 to 1879. He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities.\nHe was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science. The Royal Society, who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award. He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition. \nHe was elected to Honorary membership of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1872.\nThen later in life he received the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894; the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876; the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the \"Life and Letters\". He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of University College, Oxford.\nIn 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley, Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the Order of the Polar Star: they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain. Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies, academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany. He also became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892. In 1916 a street in the Bronx, New York City, was named in his honour (Huxley Avenue).\nAs recognition of his many public services, he was appointed Privy Councillor in 1892.\nDespite his many achievements, he was given no award by the British state until late in life. In this, he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state. (Darwin's proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisers, including Wilberforce.) Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours, or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment \u2013 he had vigorous debates in print with Benjamin Disraeli, William Ewart Gladstone, and Arthur Balfour, and his relationship with Lord Salisbury was less than tranquil.\nHuxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective advocate, and for some Huxley was \"\"the\" premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century [for] the whole English-speaking world\".\nThough he had many admirers and disciples, his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership. He had, directly or indirectly, guided the careers and appointments of the next generation. Huxley thought he was \"the only man who can carry out my work\": The deaths of Balfour and William Kingdon Clifford were \"the greatest losses to science in our time\".\nVertebrate palaeontology.\nThe first half of Huxley's career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Palaeozoic era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.\nMuch paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea. Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.\nHuxley's detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive. His work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach: Whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified, and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups.\nThe lobe-finned fish (such as coelacanths and lungfish) have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur. His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of tetrapods, one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology.\nThe study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles, which he united under the title of \"Sauropsida\". His papers on \"Archaeopteryx\" and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are.\nApart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate and had descended from the same stock as the apes, Huxley did little work on mammals, with one exception. On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses, discovered by Othniel Charles Marsh, in Yale University's Peabody Museum. An Easterner, Marsh was America's first professor of palaeontology, but also one who had come west into hostile Indian territory in search of fossils, hunted buffalo, and met Red Cloud (in 1874). Funded by his uncle George Peabody, Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries: the huge Cretaceous aquatic bird \"Hesperornis\", and the dinosaur footprints along the Connecticut River were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special. After a week with Marsh and his fossils, Huxley wrote excitedly, \"The collection of fossils is the most wonderful thing I ever saw.\"(p203)\nThe collection at that time went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling \"Orohippus\" from the Eocene through three-toed species such as \"Miohippus\" to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: The ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.\nThe horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. If so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived. The experience with Marsh was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.(p204)\nMarsh's and Huxley's conclusions were initially quite different. However, Marsh carefully showed Huxley his complete sequence of fossils. As Marsh put it, Huxley \"then informed me that all this was new to him and that my facts demonstrated the evolution of the horse beyond question, and for the first time indicated the direct line of descent of an existing animal. With the generosity of true greatness, he gave up his own opinions in the face of new truth, and took my conclusions as the basis of his famous New York lecture on the horse.\"(p204)\nSupport of Darwin.\nHuxley was originally not persuaded by \"development theory\", as evolution was once called. This can be seen in his savage review of Robert Chambers' \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\", an 1844 book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution, which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was by all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.\nHuxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin's ideas before they were published (the group included Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the Linnean Society in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin's notebook and a Darwin letter to Asa Gray. Huxley's famous response to the idea of natural selection was \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\" However, he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis.\nLogically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication.\nHuxley's support started with his anonymous favourable review of the \"Origin\" in the \"Times\" for 26 December 1859, and continued with articles in several periodicals, and in a lecture at the Royal Institution in February 1860. At the same time, Richard Owen, whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the \"Origin\" in the \"Edinburgh Review\", also primed Samuel Wilberforce who wrote one in the \"Quarterly Review\", running to 17,000 words. The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce's son wrote his biography. So it can be said that, just as Darwin groomed Huxley, so Owen groomed Wilberforce; and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves. Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate, we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the \"Quarterly\":\nSince Lord Brougham assailed Dr Young, the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a \"flighty\" person, who endeavours \"to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,\" and whose \"mode of dealing with nature\" is reprobated as \"utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.\"\nIf I confine my retrospect of the reception of the \"Origin of Species\" to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the \"Quarterly Review\" article...\nSince his death, Huxley has become known as \"Darwin's Bulldog\", taken to refer to his pluck and courage in debate, and to his perceived role in protecting the older man. The sobriquet appears to be Huxley's own invention, although of unknown date, and it was not current in his lifetime.\nWhile the second half of Darwin's life was lived mainly within his family, the younger and combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large. A letter from Huxley to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871) states: \"The dogs have been snapping at [Darwin's] heels too much of late.\"\nDebate with Wilberforce.\nFamously, Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the British Association meeting, on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum. Huxley's presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met Robert Chambers, the Scottish publisher and author of \"Vestiges\", who was walking the streets of Oxford in a dispirited state, and begged for assistance. The debate followed the presentation of a paper by John William Draper, and was chaired by Darwin's former botany tutor John Stevens Henslow. Darwin's theory was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, and those supporting Darwin included Huxley and their mutual friends Hooker and John Lubbock. The platform featured Sir Benjamin Brodie and Professor Beale, and Robert FitzRoy, who had been captain of HMS \"Beagle\" during Darwin's voyage, spoke against Darwin.\nWilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' \"Vestiges\". For the more challenging task of opposing the \"Origin\", and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen\u2014Owen stayed with him the night before the debate. On the day, Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his \"Quarterly Review\" article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate\u2014the exact wording is not certain\u2014was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.\nThe letters of Alfred Newton include one to his brother giving an eyewitness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought \"he\" had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange, though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report, differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.\nOne effect of the debate was to hugely increase Huxley's visibility amongst educated people, through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals. Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority. A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the Old Testament, especially the Book of Genesis. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial \"Essays and Reviews\". Thus, both on the side of science and on that of religion, the debate was important and its outcome significant. (see also below)\nHuxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate (and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education), whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled.\nMan's place in nature.\nFor nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes. This led him directly into a clash with Richard Owen, a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley's Croonian Lecture, delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on \"The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull\" was the start. In this, he rejected Owen's theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were homologous, an opinion previously held by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Lorenz Oken.\nFrom 1860 to 1863 Huxley developed his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, students and the general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December. Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work \"Evidence as to Man's place in Nature\" (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his \"Descent of Man\" in 1871.\nAlthough Darwin did not publish his \"Descent of Man\" until 1871, the general debate on this topic had started years before (there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, and Georges-Louis Leclerc). Darwin had dropped a hint when, in the conclusion to the \"Origin\", he wrote: \"In the distant future... light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history\". Not so distant, as it turned out. A key event had already occurred in 1857 when Richard Owen presented (to the Linnean Society) his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus \"Homo\". Having reached this opinion, Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own. No other biologist held such an extreme view. Darwin reacted \"Man...as distinct from a chimpanzee [as] an ape from a platypus... I cannot swallow that!\" Neither could Huxley, who was able to demonstrate that Owen's idea was completely wrong.\nThe subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting, when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen, and promised a later demonstration of the facts. In fact, a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces. In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B.A. Huxley's friend William Flower gave a public dissection to show that the same structures (the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor) were indeed present in apes. The debate was widely publicised, and parodied as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\". It was seen as one of Owen's greatest blunders, revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate but also a better anatomist.\nOwen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes, but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size.\nHuxley's ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue (new series) of his own journal, the \"Natural History Review\": \"the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed\". This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of \"Man's Place in Nature\", with an addendum giving his account of the Owen/Huxley controversy about the ape brain. In his \"Collected Essays\" this addendum was removed.\nThe extended argument on the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley's career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen's decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists.\nThe following was written by Huxley to George Rolleston before the BA meeting in 1861:\n\"My dear Rolleston... The obstinate reiteration of erroneous assertions can only be nullified by as persistent an appeal to facts; and I greatly regret that my engagements do not permit me to be present at the British Association in order to assist personally at what, I believe, will be \"the seventh public demonstration during the past twelve months\" of the untruth of the three assertions, that the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus minor, are peculiar to man and do not exist in the apes. I shall be obliged if you will read this letter to the Section\" Yours faithfully, Thos. H. Huxley.\nDuring those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he examined the Neanderthal skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-\"sapiens\" discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large. Huxley also started to dabble in physical anthropology, and classified the human races into nine categories, along with placing them under four general categorisations as Australoid, Negroid, Xanthochroic and Mongoloid. Such classifications depended mainly on physical appearance and certain anatomical characteristics.\nNatural selection.\nHuxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things were not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.\nHuxley's reservations on natural selection were of the type \"until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved\". Huxley's position on selection was agnostic; yet he gave no credence to any other theory. Despite this concern about evidence, Huxley saw that if evolution came about through variation, reproduction and selection then other things would also be subject to the same pressures. This included ideas because they are invented, imitated and selected by humans: \u2018The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.\u2019 This is the same idea as meme theory put forward by Richard Dawkins in 1976.\nDarwin's part in the discussion came mostly in letters, as was his wont, along the lines: \"The empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms, and in any event unnecessary. It's the same as asking to see every step in the transformation (or the splitting) of one species into another. My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved; no other theory does nearly so well\".\nHuxley's reservation, as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked, was contagious: \"it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism\". One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, \"but not the question of mechanism\".\nPallbearer.\nHuxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of Charles Darwin on 26 April 1882.\nThe X Club.\nIn November 1864, Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the X Club, composed of like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, John Tyndall, J. D. Hooker, John Lubbock (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), Herbert Spencer (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), William Spottiswoode (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), Thomas Hirst (Professor of Physics at University College London), Edward Frankland (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and George Busk, zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for HMS \"Dreadnought\"). All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology.\nThere were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as William Flower and George Rolleston, (Huxley proteg\u00e9s), and liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster. Guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time.\nThey would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business. It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening. The first item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.\nThe next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas. This was the weekly \"Reader\", which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become part-owner of the \"Natural History Review\" bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the \"NHR\" failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The \"Reader\" also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not as astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him.\nHowever, the experience gained with the \"Reader\" was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of \"Nature\" in 1869. This time no mistakes were made: above all, there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), Norman Lockyer, who served until 1919, a year before his death. In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, \"Nature\" issued a supplement devoted to Huxley.\nThe peak of the X Club's influence was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science. After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now Lord Avebury) was the last surviving member.\nHuxley was also an active member of the Metaphysical Society, which ran from 1869 to 1880. It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions. Tyndall and Huxley later joined the Club (founded by Dr. Johnson) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up.\nEducational influence.\nWhen Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day either were self-taught or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation.\nSchool of Mines and Zoology.\nIn the early 1870s, the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London. The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities. In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster.\nThe typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9 am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators. Huxley's demonstrators were picked men\u2014all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas as well as their own. Michael Foster became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; Ray Lankester became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875\u201391), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891\u201398) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898\u20131907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; W.T. Thiselton-Dyer became Hooker's successor at Kew (he was already Hooker's son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at University College, Cardiff; and William Rutherford became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir William Flower, Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum. It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. Darwin said \"No one fact tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower\".\nHuxley's courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: \"The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism\"; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said \"Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices\". E.W MacBride said \"Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist. To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes.\nThis largely morphological program of comparative anatomy remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution (Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Fritz M\u00fcller, Henry Bates) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. Michael Ruse finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes.\nSince Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and M\u0171ller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Adrian Desmond suggests that \"[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function\". That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man.\nHuxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day. He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life. Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths.\nSchools and the Bible.\nHuxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870, he was elected to the London School Board in its first elections. In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc. In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study. A practical example of the latter is his famous 1868 lecture \"On a Piece of Chalk\" which was first published as an essay in \"Macmillan's Magazine\" in London later that year. The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as \"organized common sense\".\nHuxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible's significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life. \"I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches\". However, what Huxley proposed was to create an \"edited version\" of the Bible, shorn of \"shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe\". The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debates took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said \"I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools\". The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.\nIt may be right to see Huxley's life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said \"It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems\"\u2014and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern Christian apologists consider Huxley the father of antitheism, though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life, especially the \"Roman Church ... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind\". In the same line of thought, in an article in \"Popular Science\", Huxley used the expression \"the so-called Christianity of Catholicism\", explaining: \"I say 'so-called' not by way of offence, but as a protest against the monstrous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth.\"\nOriginally coining the term in 1869, Huxley elaborated on \"agnosticism\" in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not. Huxley statesAgnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle... the fundamental axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration... In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable. Use of that term has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism). Much of Huxley's agnosticism is influenced by Kantian views on human perception and the ability to rely on rational evidence rather than belief systems.\nIn 1893, during preparation for the second Romanes Lecture, Huxley expressed his disappointment at the shortcomings of 'liberal' theology, describing its doctrines as 'popular illusions', and the teachings they replaced 'faulty as they are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth'.\nVladimir Lenin remarked that for Huxley \"agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism\". (See also the Debate with Wilberforce above.)\nAdult education.\nHuxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public. For most of his adult life, he wrote for periodicals\u2014the \"Westminster Review\", the \"Saturday Review\", the \"Reader\", the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", \"Macmillan's Magazine\", the \"Contemporary Review\". Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.\nIn 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker, Wm. Rossiter, who did most of the work; the funds were put up mainly by F.D. Maurice's Christian Socialists. At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire.\nThe technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective. A good example was \"The Physical Basis of Life\", a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme\u2014that vital action is nothing more than \"the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it\"\u2014shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the \"Fortnightly Review\" for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said \"No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation\". The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; \"Punch\" added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.\nThe topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight. For these audiences, Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century.\nWhen the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on Auguste Comte's positivism, Huxley corrected him: \"Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity\" (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays \"Methods &amp; Results\" 156). A later version was \"[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed\". (lecture on http:// Huxley 1870 \"Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews\" p.\u00a0149). Huxley's dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte's ideas withered in Britain.\nHuxley and the humanities.\nDuring his life, and especially in the last ten years after retirement, Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities.\nPerhaps the best known of these topics is \"Evolution and Ethics\", which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson Julian Huxley gave Romanes Lectures on this theme. For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority. Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, human emotions, intellect, and tendency to prefer living in groups and spending resources on raising young are part and parcel of human evolution and therefore inherited.\nDespite this, the \"details\" of human values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by human culture, and partly chosen on an individual basis. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the \"struggle for existence\": \"Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture.\" It is therefore an individual's responsibility to make ethical choices (see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics). This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate. In this argument, Huxley is diametrically opposed to his long-time friend Herbert Spencer.\nHuxley's dissection of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's views on man and society is another example of his later work. The essay undermines Rousseau's ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property. Characteristic is: \"The doctrine that all men are, in any sense, or have been, at any time, free and equal, is an utterly baseless fiction.\"\nHuxley's method of argumentation (his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much studied. His career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies.\nRoyal and other commissions.\nHuxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions (titles somewhat shortened here). The Royal Commission is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice.\nFamily.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1855 he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825\u20131914), an English \u00e9migr\u00e9e whom he had met in Sydney, Australia. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons:\nHuxley's relationships with his relatives and children were genial by the standards of the day\u2014so long as they lived their lives in an honourable manner, which some did not. After his mother, his eldest sister Lizzie was the most important person in his life until his own marriage. He remained on good terms with his children, more than can be said of many Victorian fathers. This excerpt from a letter to Jessie, his eldest daughter is full of affection:\nHuxley's descendants include children of Leonard Huxley:\nOther significant descendants of Huxley, such as Sir Crispin Tickell, are treated in the Huxley family.\nMental problems in the family.\nBiographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family. His father became \"sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind\", and later died in Barming Asylum; brother George suffered from \"extreme mental anxiety\" and died in 1863 leaving serious debts. Brother James, a well-known psychiatrist and Superintendent of Kent County Asylum, was at 55 \"as near mad as any sane man can be\". His favourite daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marian), who became the first wife of the artist John Collier, was troubled by mental illness for years. She died of pneumonia in her mid-twenties.\nAbout Huxley himself, we have a more complete record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards, he sank into a \"deep lethargy\" and, though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.\nThe next episode we know of in Huxley's life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS \"Rattlesnake\" in 1848. Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871, and again in 1873. Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of 60. This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate bipolar disorder) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.\nThe problems continued sporadically into the third generation. Two of Leonard's sons suffered serious depression: Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913, and five more later in life.\nSatires.\nDarwin's ideas and Huxley's controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires. It was the debate about man's place in nature that roused such widespread comment: cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count; Darwin's head on a monkey's body is one of the visual clich\u00e9s of the age. The \"Great Hippocampus Question\" attracted particular attention:\nHuxley's low set included Hooker \"in the green and vegetable line\" and \"Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier\"; Owen's \"crib in Bloomsbury\" was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.\nRacism debate.\nIn October 2021 a history group reviewing colonial links told Imperial College London that, because Huxley \"might now be called racist\", it should remove a bust of him and rename its Huxley Building. The group of 21 academics had been launched in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 to address Imperial's \"links to the British Empire\" and build a \"fully inclusive organisation\". It reported that Huxley's paper \"Emancipation \u2013 Black and White\" \"espouses a racial hierarchy of intelligence\" that helped to feed ideas around eugenics, which \"falls far short of Imperial's modern values\", and that his theories \"might now be called 'racist' in as much as he used racial divisions and hierarchical categorisation in his attempt to understand their origins in his studies of human evolution\". Imperial's provost Ian Walmsley responded that Imperial would \"confront, not cover up, uncomfortable or awkward aspects of our past\" and this was \"very much not a 'cancel culture' approach\". Students would be consulted before management decided on any action to be taken.\nA critical response by Nick Matzke said that Huxley was a public, longstanding abolitionist who wrote \"the most complete demonstration of the specific diversity of the types of mankind will nowise constrain science to spread her \u00e6gis over their [slaveholders'] atrocities\" and \"the North is justified in any expenditure of blood or of money, which shall eradicate a system hopelessly inconsistent with the moral elevation, the political freedom, or the economical progress of the American people\"; a major opponent of the racist position of polygenism, as well as the position that some human races were transitional (in 1867 Huxley said \"there was no shade of justification for the assertion that any existing modification of mankind now known was to be considered as an intermediate form between man and the animals next below him in the scale of the fauna of the world\"); a vehement opponent of the scientific racist James Hunt; and a political radical who believed in granting equal rights and the vote to both black people and women.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBiographies"}
{"id": "30039", "revid": "48523215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30039", "title": "Triumph of the Will", "text": "1935 Nazi propaganda film\nTriumph of the Will () is a 1935 German Nazi propaganda film directed, produced, edited, and co-written by Leni Riefenstahl. Adolf Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress (rally) in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters. The film contains excerpts of speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Its overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power with Hitler as its leader. The film was produced after the Night of the Long Knives, and many formerly prominent SA members are absent.\nFollowing its release in March 1935, it became a major example of film used as propaganda and was well-received at home. Riefenstahl's techniques\u2014such as moving cameras, aerial photography, the use of long-focus lenses to create a distorted perspective, and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography\u2014have earned \"Triumph of the Will\" recognition as one of the greatest propaganda films in history. It won several awards in Germany, France and Italy.\nDuring World War II, Frank Capra's seven-film series \"Why We Fight\" was directly inspired by \"Triumph of the Will\" and the United States' response to it.\nIn today's Germany, \"Triumph of the Will\" is not banned. In 2018, the Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Young Persons even rejected an application to index an imported version. The decision explained that \"Triumph of the Will\" is a historical document that can be classified as having high art-historical value. Nevertheless, the film is not freely distributed in Germany because the rights holder, Transit Film, exercises its copyright and takes action against unauthorized publications. Screenings that take place with the consent of Transit Film are held in an educational context.\nThe film continues to influence films, documentaries and commercials to this day.\nSynopsis.\nThe film begins with a prologue establishing the present-day as 5 September 1934 and the elapsed time since World War I, the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler's appointment as chancellor, climaxing in his visit to Nuremberg on that day. It is the only commentary in the entire film.\nDay 1: The film opens with shots of the clouds above the city, and then moves through the clouds to float above the assembling masses below, with the intention of portraying the beauty and majesty of the scene. The cruciform shadow of Hitler's plane is visible as it passes over the tiny figures marching below, accompanied by an orchestral arrangement of the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\". Upon arriving at the Nuremberg airport, Hitler and other Nazi leaders emerge from his plane to thunderous applause and a cheering crowd. He is then driven into Nuremberg, through equally enthusiastic people, to his hotel where a night rally is later held.\nDay 2: The second day begins with images of Nuremberg at dawn, accompanied by an extract from the Act III Prelude (\"Wach Auf!\") of Richard Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\". Following this is a montage of the attendees preparing for the opening of the Reich Party Congress, and footage of the top Nazi officials arriving at the Luitpold Arena. The film then cuts to the opening ceremony, where Rudolf Hess announces the start of the Congress. The camera then introduces much of the Nazi hierarchy and covers their opening speeches, including Joseph Goebbels, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Fritz Todt, Robert Ley and Julius Streicher. Then the film cuts to an outdoor rally for the \"Reichsarbeitsdienst\" (Labor Service), which is primarily a series of quasi-military drills by men carrying spades. This is also where Hitler gives his first speech on the merits of the Labour Service and praising them for their work in rebuilding Germany. The day then ends with a torchlight SA parade and fireworks display in which Viktor Lutze speaks to the crowds.\nDay 3: The third day starts with a Hitler Youth rally on the parade ground. Again the camera covers the Nazi dignitaries arriving and the introduction of Hitler by Baldur von Schirach. Hitler then addresses the Youth, describing in militaristic terms how they must harden themselves and prepare for sacrifice. Everyone present, including General Werner von Blomberg, then assemble for a military pass and review, featuring Wehrmacht cavalry and various armored vehicles. That night Hitler delivers another speech to low-ranking party officials by torchlight, commemorating the first year since the Nazis took power and declaring that the party and state are one entity.\nDay 4: The fourth day is the climax of the film, where the most memorable of the imagery is presented. Hitler, flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze, walks through a long wide expanse with over 150,000 SA and SS troops standing at attention, to lay a wreath at a First World War memorial. Hitler then reviews the parading SA and SS men, following which Hitler and Lutze deliver a speech where they discuss the Night of the Long Knives purge of the SA several months prior. Lutze reaffirms the SA's loyalty to the regime, and Hitler absolves the SA of any crimes committed by Ernst R\u00f6hm. New party flags are consecrated by letting them touch the \"Blutfahne\" (the same cloth flag said to have been carried by the fallen Nazis during the Beer Hall Putsch) and, following a final parade in front of the Nuremberg Frauenkirche, Hitler delivers his closing speech. In it he reaffirms the primacy of the Nazi Party in Germany, declaring, \"All loyal Germans will become National Socialists. Only the best National Socialists are party comrades!\" Hess then leads the assembled crowd in a final \"Sieg Heil\" salute for Hitler, marking the close of the party congress. The entire crowd sings the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" as the camera focuses on the giant Swastika banner, which fades into a line of silhouetted men in Nazi party uniforms, marching in formation as the lyrics \"Comrades shot by the Red Front and the Reactionaries march in spirit together in our columns\" are sung.\nProduction.\nRiefenstahl, a popular German actress, had directed her first film called \"Das blaue Licht\" (\"The Blue Light\") in 1932. Hitler was impressed with \"Das blaue Licht\", and in 1933 asked her to direct a film about the Nazis' annual Nuremberg Rally, which became \"Der Sieg des Glaubens\" (\"The Victory of Faith\"). Hitler chose Riefenstahl as he wanted the film as \"artistically satisfying\" as possible to appeal to a non-political audience, but he also believed that propaganda must admit no element of doubt.\n\"The Victory of Faith\" faced numerous technical problems, including a lack of preparation (Riefenstahl reported having just a few days) and Hitler's apparent unease at being filmed. Though the film apparently did well at the box office, it later became a serious embarrassment to the Nazis after SA Leader Ernst R\u00f6hm, who had a prominent role in the film, was executed during the Night of the Long Knives. All references to R\u00f6hm were ordered to be erased from German history, which included the destruction of all copies of \"The Victory of Faith\". It was considered a lost film until a copy turned up in the 1980s in the German Democratic Republic's film archives.\nIn April 1934, Riefenstahl was commissioned by Hitler to create a successor film to \"The Victory of Faith\". Riefenstahl however, remained focused on production of her own film \"Tiefland\" (which was released only in 1954), while fellow director Walter Ruttmann worked on the party film. Ruttmann's ideals departed significantly from \"The Victory of Faith\" and sought to reorient the focus of the film onto the history of the Nazi movement rather than Hitler himself. Hitler visited the studio on 6 December 1934 and permanently removed Ruttmann from the project, leaving Riefenstahl in sole control of what would become \"Triumph des Willens\" (\"Triumph of the Will\"). Riefenstahl claimed that she attempted to avoid doing the film by committing to \"Tiefland\" and having Ruttmann doing it instead.\nFilming.\nThe film follows a design similar to \"The Victory of Faith\", with the city of Nuremberg scenes, even to the shot of a cat, included in the city driving sequence in both films. Herbert Windt reused much of his musical score from Victory of Faith, in , which he also scored.\nRiefenstahl's staff had sixteen cameramen, who all had an assistant of their own, using thirty cameras and four complete sound-equipment trucks. 120 assistants worked on the film. Riefenstahl shot an estimated 61 hours of footage to create the two hour film.\nRiefenstahl shot \"Triumph of the Will\" on a nominal budget of roughly 280,000\u00a0RM (approximately US$110,000 in 1934, $1.54\u00a0m in 2015). However Hans Saupert, chief of staff for Franz Xaver Schwarz, claimed that the actual cost of the film was 1 million RM. Riefenstahl claimed that the film was financed by her own efforts and a distribution agreement with Ufa, but she received a large amount of financial support from the Nazis directly and indirectly through construction projects for the rally. While being interrogated after World War II, she admitted to having a Reich Party Account, and she was reimbursed by the Nazis for all expenditures.\nExtensive preparations were facilitated by the cooperation of party members, the military, and high-ranking Nazis like Goebbels. In 1975, Susan Sontag claimed that \"The Rally was planned not only as a spectacular mass meeting, but as a spectacular propaganda film.\" Goebbels wanted film propaganda to be done using subtle methods, but \"Triumph of the Will\" was produced against his wishes.\nAlbert Speer, Hitler's personal architect, designed the set in Nuremberg and did most of the coordination for the event. Pits were dug in front of the speakers' platform so Riefenstahl could get the camera angles she wanted, and tracks were laid so that her cameramen could get traveling shots of the crowd. When the audio from rough cuts was not up to par, major party leaders and high-ranking public officials reenacted their speeches in a studio for her.\nEditing.\nRiefenstahl was visited by high-ranking Nazis during the editing process. Hitler suggested the title \"Triumph of the Will\" in September 1934. Goebbels came on 5 December, Hitler and Julius Schaub on 6 December, and Hess on 7 December. She started with 130,000 metres of film and reduced it to 3,000 metres by March 1935. The final product was almost twice as long as \"Victory of Faith\".\nWalter von Reichenau visited Riefenstahl in December 1934 to see the footage she shot of the military. He was disappointed that Riefenstahl was not going to include the footage in the final film due to the poor quality caused by bad weather during the military exercises. She later produced \"\" which focused on the military at the 1935 Nuremberg Rally.\nReception.\n\"Triumph of the Will\" was approved by the censors on 26 March 1935, and premiered on 28 March at the Berlin Ufa Palace Theater. Within two months the film had earned 815,000 Reichsmark (equivalent to million 2021 euros), and Ufa considered it one of the three most profitable films of that year. Hitler praised the film as being an \"incomparable glorification of the power and beauty of our Movement.\" For her efforts, Riefenstahl was rewarded with the German Film Prize (\"Deutscher Filmpreis\"), a gold medal at the 1935 Venice Biennale, and the Grand Prix at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. However, there were few claims that the film would result in a mass influx of \"converts\" to fascism and the Nazis apparently did not make a serious effort to promote the film outside of Germany. Film historian Richard Taylor also said that \"Triumph of the Will\" was not generally used for propaganda purposes inside Nazi Germany. \"The Independent\" wrote in 2003: \"\"Triumph of the Will\" seduced many wise men and women, persuaded them to admire rather than to despise, and undoubtedly won the Nazis friends and allies all over the world.\"\nThe reception in other countries was not always as enthusiastic. British documentarian Paul Rotha called it tedious, while others were repelled by its pro-Nazi sentiments. During World War II, Frank Capra helped to create a direct response, through the film series called \"Why We Fight\", a series of newsreels commissioned by the United States government that spliced in footage from \"Triumph of the Will\", but recontextualized it so that it promoted the cause of the Allies instead. Capra later remarked that \"Triumph of the Will\" \"fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal.\" Clips from \"Triumph of the Will\" were also used in an Allied propaganda short called \"General Adolph Takes Over\", set to the British dance tune \"The Lambeth Walk\". The legions of marching soldiers, as well as Hitler giving his Nazi salute, were made to look like wind-up dolls, dancing to the music. The Danish resistance used to take over cinemas and force the projectionist to show \"Swinging the Lambeth Walk\" (as it was also known); Erik Barrow has said: \"The extraordinary risks were apparently felt justified by a moment of savage anti-Hitler ridicule.\" Also during World War II, the poet Dylan Thomas wrote a screenplay for and narrated \"These Are The Men\", a propaganda piece using \"Triumph of the Will\" footage to discredit Nazi leadership.\nOne of the best ways to gauge the response to \"Triumph of the Will\" was the instant and lasting international fame it gave Riefenstahl. \"The Economist\" said it \"sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century.\" For a director who made eight films, only two of which received significant coverage outside of Germany, Riefenstahl had unusually high name recognition for the remainder of her life, most of it stemming from \"Triumph of the Will\". However, her career was also permanently damaged by this association. After the war, Riefenstahl was imprisoned by the Allies for four years for allegedly being a Nazi sympathizer and was permanently blacklisted by the film industry. When she died in 2003\u2014sixty-eight years after the film's premiere\u2014her obituary received significant coverage in many major publications, including the Associated Press, \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\", and \"The Guardian\", most of which reaffirmed the importance of \"Triumph of the Will\".\nEthical controversy.\nLike American filmmaker D. W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\", \"Triumph of the Will\" has been criticized as a use of spectacular filmmaking to promote a profoundly unethical system. In her defense, Riefenstahl claimed that she was na\u00efve about the Nazis when she made it and had no knowledge of Hitler's genocidal or antisemitic policies. She also pointed out that \"Triumph of the Will\" contains \"not one single anti-semitic word\", although it does contain a veiled comment by Julius Streicher that \"a people that does not protect its racial purity will perish\".\nHowever, Roger Ebert has observed that for some, \"the very absence of anti-semitism in \"Triumph of the Will\" looks like a calculation; excluding the central motif of almost all of Hitler's public speeches must have been a deliberate decision to make the film more efficient as propaganda.\"\nRiefenstahl said in 1964:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If you see this film again today you ascertain that it doesn't contain a single reconstructed scene. Everything in it is true. And it contains no tendentious commentary at all. It is history. A pure historical film\u00a0... it is film-v\u00e9rit\u00e9. It reflects the truth that was then in 1934, history. It is therefore a documentary. Not a propaganda film. Oh! I know very well what propaganda is. That consists of recreating events in order to illustrate a thesis, or, in the face of certain events, to let one thing go in order to accentuate another. I found myself, me, at the heart of an event which was the reality of a certain time and a certain place. My film is composed of what stemmed from that.\nHowever, Riefenstahl was an active participant in the rally, though in later years she downplayed her influence significantly, claiming, \"I just observed and tried to film it well. The idea that I helped to plan it is downright absurd.\" Ebert states that \"Triumph of the Will\" is \"by general consent [one] of the best documentaries ever made\", but added that because it reflects the ideology of a movement regarded by many as evil, it poses \"a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?\" When reviewing the film for his \"Great Movies\" collection, Ebert reversed his opinion, characterizing his earlier conclusion as \"the received opinion that the film is great but evil\" and calling it \"a terrible film, paralyzingly dull, simpleminded, overlong and not even 'manipulative', because it is too clumsy to manipulate anyone but a true believer\".\nWriting in 1975, Susan Sontag considers \"Triumph of the Will\" the \"most successful, most purely propagandistic film ever made, whose very conception negates the possibility of the filmmaker's having an aesthetic or visual conception independent of propaganda.\" Sontag points to Riefenstahl's involvement in the planning and design of the Nuremberg ceremonies as evidence that Riefenstahl was working as a propagandist, rather than as an artist in any sense of the word. With some 30 cameras and a crew of 150, the marches, parades, speeches, and processions were orchestrated like a movie set for Riefenstahl's film. Further, this was not the first political film made by Riefenstahl for the Nazis (there was \"Victory of Faith\", 1933), nor was it the last (\"Day of Freedom\", 1935, and \"Olympia\", 1938). \"Anyone who defends Riefenstahl's films as documentary\", Sontag states, \"if documentary is to be distinguished from propaganda, is being disingenuous. In \"Triumph of Will\", the document (the image) is no longer simply the record of reality; 'reality' has been constructed to serve the image.\" This is considerably different from the position she takes ten years earlier in a 1965 essay entitled \"On Style\", where she opposes the idea that Riefenstahl's propaganda films are purely propaganda, and writes: \"To call Leni Riefenstahl's \"The Triumph of the Will\" and \"The Olympiad\" masterpieces is not to gloss over Nazi propaganda with aesthetic lenience. The Nazi propaganda is there. But something else is there, too, which we reject at our loss. Because they project the complex movements of intelligence and grace and sensuousness, these two films of Riefenstahl (unique among works of Nazi artists) transcend the categories of propaganda or even reportage. And we find ourselves\u2014to be sure, rather uncomfortably\u2014seeing 'Hitler' and not Hitler, the '1936 Olympics' and not the 1936 Olympics. Through Riefenstahl's genius as a film-maker, the 'content' has\u2014let us even assume, against her intentions\u2014come to play a purely formal role.\"\nInfluences and legacy.\n\"Triumph of the Will\" remains well known for its striking visuals. As one historian notes, \"many of the most enduring images of the [Nazi] regime and its leader derive from Riefenstahl's film.\"\nExtensive excerpts of the film were used in Erwin Leiser's documentary \"Mein Kampf\", produced in Sweden in 1960. Riefenstahl unsuccessfully sued the Swedish production company Minerva-Film for copyright violation, although she did receive forty thousand marks in compensation from German and Austrian distributors of the film.\nIn 1942, Charles A. Ridley of the British Ministry of Information made a short propaganda film called among other names \"Schichlegruber - Doing the Lambeth Walk\" and \"Lambeth Walk \u2013 Nazi Style\", which edited footage of Hitler and German soldiers from the film to make it appear they were marching and dancing to the song \"The Lambeth Walk\". The targeted-at-Nazis film was a parody of \"The Lambeth Walk,\" a British dance that had been popular in swing clubs in Germany and was denounced by the Nazis as \"Jewish mischief and animalistic hopping.\" The propaganda film was distributed uncredited to newsreel companies, who would supply their own narration.\nCharlie Chaplin's satire \"The Great Dictator\" (1940) was inspired in large part by \"Triumph of the Will\". Frank Capra used significant footage, with a mocking narration in the first installment of the propagandistic film produced by the United States Army \"Why We Fight\" as an exposure of Nazi militarism and totalitarianism to American soldiers and sailors.\nCopyright.\n\"Triumph of the Will\" remains in copyright. However, the film is commonly mistaken as belonging to the public domain, and it receives frequent unauthorized home video releases as a result.\nGermany.\nRiefenstahl initially stated that the Nazi Party held the copyright for the film. She stated that she held the copyright as it was her own creation despite funding from the party after meeting with her lawyer Eugen Kr\u00e4mer in August 1949.\nRiefenstahl filed lawsuits against two postwar documentaries which had incorporated footage of \"Triumph of the Will\". The first lawsuit occurred in 1954 against Wolfgang Hartwig, producer of \"Bis f\u00fcnf nach zw\u00f6lf\". Hartwig argued that the rights belonged to the state, but reportedly eventually paid compensation to Riefenstahl, who donated it to a charity dedicated to returning prisoners of war. Her second lawsuit against Swedish producer Erwin Leiser's \"Mein Kampf\" in 1960 was enveloped in greater public debate about the copyright and morality of works produced during the Nazi regime. The case was settled against her in 1969.\nIn a judgement by the Federal Court of Justice on 29 December 1966, the copyright to the film was transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany as the legal successor of Nazi Germany. These rights are administered by the federally owned Transit-Film GmbH based in Munich, although it was contractually regulated in 1974 that any public screening until 2004 had to be approved by Riefenstahl and that she received 70% of all revenues.\nUnited States.\nIn 1996, the copyrights of the film were restored to Riefenstahl under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, although some aspect of the US copyrights are uncertain.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30040", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30040", "title": "Titanium", "text": "element with atomic number 22 (Ti)\nTitanium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength that is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\nTitanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide (TiO2), is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.\nTitanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry, and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, and surgical instruments.\nThe two most useful properties of the metal are its corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\n&lt;section begin=properties/&gt;\nAs a metal, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. Due to its relatively high melting point (1,668\u00a0\u00b0C or 3,034\u00a0\u00b0F) it has sometimes been described as a refractory metal, but this is not the case. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Titanium is superconducting when cooled below its critical temperature of 0.49\u00a0K.&lt;section end=properties/&gt;\nCommercially pure (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 434\u00a0MPa (63,000\u00a0psi), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400\u00a0MPa (200,000\u00a0psi). However, titanium loses strength when heated above .\nTitanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.\nThe metal is a dimorphic allotrope of a hexagonal close packed \u03b1 form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) \u03b2 form at . The specific heat of the \u03b1 form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the \u03b2 form regardless of temperature.\nChemical properties.\nLike aluminium and magnesium, the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidizes immediately upon exposure to air to form a thin non-porous passivation layer that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation or corrosion. When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1\u20132\u00a0nm thick but it continues to grow slowly, reaching a thickness of 25\u00a0nm in four years. This layer gives titanium excellent resistance to corrosion against oxidizing acids, but it will dissolve in dilute hydrofluoric acid, hot hydrochloric acid, and hot sulfuric acid.\nTitanium is capable of withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids at room temperature, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. Titanium burns in normal air at temperatures lower than its melting point, so melting the metal is possible only in an inert atmosphere or vacuum. At room temperature, titanium is fairly inert to halogens, but will violently combine with chlorine and bromine at to form titanium tetrachloride and titanium tetrabromide, respectively.\nTitanium readily reacts with oxygen at in air, and at in pure oxygen, forming titanium dioxide. This oxide is also formed by reaction between titanium and pure oxygen at room temperature and pressure of . Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at to form titanium nitride, which causes embrittlement.\nOccurrence.\nTitanium is the ninth-most abundant element in Earth's crust (0.63% by mass) and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most igneous rocks, in sediments derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water. Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5\u20131.5%.\nCommon titanium-containing minerals are anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is an extremely rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. Total reserves of anatase, ilmenite, and rutile are estimated to exceed 2 billion tonnes.\nThe concentration of titanium is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100\u00a0\u00b0C, the concentration of titanium in water is estimated to be less than 10\u22127 M at pH 7. The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.\nTitanium is contained in meteorites, and it has been detected in the Sun and in M-type stars (the coolest type) with a surface temperature of . Rocks brought back from the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission are composed of 12.1% TiO2. Native titanium is only found in rocks that have been exposed to pressures between roughly 2.8 to 4.0gigapascal on Earth, but it has been identified in nanocrystals on the Moon.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring titanium is composed of five stable isotopes: 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti, and 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8% natural abundance). Twenty-three radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable of which are 44Ti with a half-life of 63 years; 45Ti, 184.8 minutes; 51Ti, 5.76 minutes; and 52Ti, 1.7 minutes. All other radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds, with the majority less than half a second.\nThe isotopes of titanium range from 39Ti to 66Ti. The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than 46Ti is positron emission (with the exception of 44Ti which undergoes electron capture), leading to isotopes of scandium, and the primary mode for isotopes heavier than 50Ti is beta emission, leading to isotopes of vanadium. Titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with deuterons, emitting mainly positrons and hard gamma rays.\nCompounds.\nThe +4 oxidation state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 oxidation state are also numerous. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because of its high oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit a high degree of covalent bonding.\nOxides, sulfides, and alkoxides.\nThe most important oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All three are white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark, as in rutile. They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.\nThe term \"titanates\" usually refers to titanium(IV) compounds, as represented by barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, such as ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.\nA variety of reduced oxides (suboxides) of titanium are known, mainly reduced stoichiometries of titanium dioxide obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying. Ti3O5, described as a Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO2 with hydrogen at high temperatures, and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapor-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO2 evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index. Also known is Ti2O3, with the corundum structure, and TiO, with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.\nThe alkoxides of titanium(IV), prepared by treating TiCl4 with alcohols, are colorless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water. They are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO2 via the sol-gel process. Titanium isopropoxide is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the Sharpless epoxidation.\nTitanium forms a variety of sulfides, but only TiS2 has attracted significant interest. It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of lithium batteries. Because Ti(IV) is a \"hard cation\", the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide.\nNitrides and carbides.\nTitanium nitride (TiN) is a refractory solid exhibiting extreme hardness, thermal/electrical conductivity, and a high melting point. TiN has a hardness equivalent to sapphire and carborundum (9.0 on the Mohs scale), and is often used to coat cutting tools, such as drill bits. It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a barrier layer in semiconductor fabrication. Titanium carbide (TiC), which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.\nHalides.\nTitanium tetrachloride (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial samples are yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 is used in the conversion of titanium ores to titanium metal. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to make titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel\u2013de Boer process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated in the production of high purity titanium metal.\nTitanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable chlorides. A notable example is titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst for production of polyolefins (see Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst) and a reducing agent in organic chemistry.\nOrganometallic complexes.\nOwing to the important role of titanium compounds as polymerization catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied. The most common organotitanium complex is titanocene dichloride ((C5H5)2TiCl2). Related compounds include Tebbe's reagent and Petasis reagent. Titanium forms carbonyl complexes, e.g. (C5H5)2Ti(CO)2.\nHistory.\nTitanium was discovered in 1791 by the clergyman and geologist William Gregor as an inclusion of a mineral in Cornwall, Great Britain. Gregor recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, in 1791 Gregor reported his findings in both German and French science journals: \"Crell's Annalen\" and \"Observations et M\u00e9moires sur la Physique\". He named this oxide manaccanite.\nAround the same time, Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein produced a similar substance, but could not identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (the German name of Bajm\u00f3cska), a village in Hungary (now Bojni\u010dky in Slovakia).\nKlaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed that it contained titanium.\nThe currently known processes for extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; it is not possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon (as in iron smelting) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce titanium carbide. An extraction of 95% pure titanium was achieved by Lars Fredrik Nilson and . To achieve this they chlorinated titanium oxide in a carbon monoxide atmosphere with chlorine gas before reducing it to titanium metal by the use of sodium. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at under great pressure in a batch process known as the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll produced it by reducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and with sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues to seek cheaper and more efficient routes, such as the FFC Cambridge process, the Kroll process is still predominantly used for commercial production.\nTitanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer discovered the iodide process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications (Alfa class and Mike class) as part of programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early 1950s, titanium came into use extensively in military aviation, particularly in high-performance jets, starting with aircraft such as the F-100 Super Sabre and Lockheed A-12 and SR-71.\nThroughout the Cold War period, titanium was considered a strategic material by the U.S. government, and a large stockpile of titanium sponge (a porous form of the pure metal) was maintained by the Defense National Stockpile Center, until the stockpile was dispersed in the 2000s. Even so, the U.S. government annually allocates 15,000metric tons of titanium sponge as potential acquisitions for the stockpile.\nProduction.\nTitanium production is largely divided into three measured categories: manufacture of porous titanium metal \"sponge\", titanium oxide pigment, and titanium mineral concentrates used for the production of sponge, pigment, metal ingots, and other titanium products such as coatings. These concentrates are largely made up of the mineral ilmenite, but also include anatase, natural and synthetic rutile, tailings, slag, and leucoxene. As of 2024, the largest producers of titanium mineral concentrates were China, Mozambique, and South Africa.\nMost of the world's titanium is produced in China. The United States Geological Survey's 2025 report on mineral commodities estimated that out of the of titanium sponge produced globally in 2024, 220,000 (69%) were produced in China, with the second-largest producer being Japan (which produced 55,000metric tons in the same year, 17% of the total). Japan was the largest exporter of titanium sponge in 2024, but did not produce any titanium minerals on its own. A prior report in 2021 noted that the four leading producers of titanium sponge were China (52%), Japan (24%), Russia (16%) and Kazakhstan (7%). Russia remains the third-largest producer of titanium sponge through the efforts of the metallurgy company VSMPO-AVISMA, despite international sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Production statistics on titanium dioxide pigment are not as clear-cut, but estimates placed the maximum capacity on global pigment production at in 2024.\nVarious methods have been developed to extract and refine titanium from ore since the metal was first purified in 1910.\nMineral beneficiation processes.\nSeveral processes have been developed to extract titanium and usable titanium-containing minerals from ore. The Becher process is an industrial process used to produce synthetic rutile, a form of titanium dioxide, from the ore ilmenite by removing iron. It is not used at scale. The chloride process produces titanium tetrachloride through treatment of rutile ore with chlorine and carbon at high heat, then oxidizes the product with an oxygen flame or plasma to produce titanium dioxide. The sulfate process uses sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to leach titanium from ilmenite ore (FeTiO3), producing titanyl sulfate (). This sulfate is broken into two hydrates, and , through addition of water, and this water is removed by adding heat, which produces titanium dioxide as the end product.\nPurification processes.\nHunter process.\nThe Hunter process was the first industrial process to produce pure metallic titanium. It was invented in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter, a chemist born in New Zealand who worked in the United States. The process involves reducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with sodium (Na) in a batch reactor with an inert atmosphere at a temperature of 1,000\u00a0\u00b0C. Dilute hydrochloric acid is then used to leach the salt from the product. \nTiCl4(g) + 4 Na(l) \u2192 4 NaCl(l) + Ti(s)\nKroll process.\nThe processing of titanium metal occurs in four major steps: reduction of titanium ore into \"sponge\", a porous form; melting of sponge, or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot; primary fabrication, where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet, bar, plate, sheet, strip, and tube; and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products.\nBecause it cannot be readily produced by reduction of titanium dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction in the presence of chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere.\n&lt;chem&gt;2FeTiO3 + 7Cl2 + 6C -&gt;[900^oC] 2FeCl3 + 2TiCl4 + 6CO&lt;/chem&gt;\n&lt;chem&gt;TiCl4 + 2Mg -&gt;[1100^oC] Ti + 2MgCl2&lt;/chem&gt;\nArkel-Boer process.\nThe van Arkel\u2013de Boer process was the first semi-industrial process developed to produce pure titanium, invented by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925 for the electronics company Philips. It is a closed-loop process that involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide. This same process is used to purify other metals, such as thorium, hafnium, and zirconium, and a similar process using further refined iodide was used to refine chromium. A desire to develop processes that could be run continuously led to the development of commercial processes to refine titanium.\nArmstrong process.\nTitanium powder is manufactured using a flow production process known as the Armstrong process that is similar to the batch production Hunter process. A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten sodium; the products (sodium chloride salt and titanium particles) are filtered from the extra sodium. Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both the sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.\nOther processes.\nThe titanium tetrachloride used as an intermediate in both the Hunter and Kroll process is a volatile and corrosive liquid, and is thus hazardous to work with. The processes involving the tetrachloride, both its formation and the vacuum distillation processes used to purify the final material, are slow, and have prompted development of other techniques.\nMethods for electrolytic production of Ti metal from using molten salt electrolytes have been proposed starting in the 1990s, and have been researched and tested at laboratory and small pilot plant scales. While some metals such as nickel and copper can be refined by electrowinning at room temperature, titanium must be in the molten state, which is likely to damage the refractory lining of a reaction vessel. Zhang and colleagues concluded in 2017 that despite industry interests in finding new ways to manufacture titanium metal, no method had yet been developed to commercially replace the Kroll process. One manufacturer in Virginia has developed a method to recycle scrap titanium metal back into powder, though their scale remains small, having the goal of producing only 125\u00a0tons of titanium per year as of 2025.\nOne method that has been developed to potentially supplant the Kroll process is known as hydrogen-assisted magnesiothermic reduction and makes use of magnesium, hydrochloric acid, and a hydrogen atmosphere to directly reduce titanium dioxide to pure titanium. The reduction of titanium dioxide powder by magnesium in an atomphere of hydrogen can be followed by a leaching step with hydrochloric acid, which removes magnesium and residual non-titanium oxides. This is followed by additional reduction and leaching steps, and eventually results in pure titanium powder or titanium hydride.\nFabrication.\nAll welding of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as embrittlement, which reduce the integrity of the assembly welds and lead to joint failure.\nTitanium is very difficult to solder directly, and hence a solderable metal or alloy such as steel is coated on titanium prior to soldering. Titanium metal can be machined with the same equipment and the same processes as stainless steel.\nTitanium alloys.\nCommon titanium alloys are made by reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (rutile with copper added), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.\nAbout fifty grades of titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although only a couple of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31\u00a0grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which grades one through four are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and grade\u00a04 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.\nIn addition to the ASTM specifications, titanium alloys are also produced to meet aerospace and military specifications (SAE-AMS, MIL-T), ISO standards, and country-specific specifications, as well as proprietary end-user specifications for aerospace, military, medical, and industrial applications.\nForming and forging.\nCommercially pure flat product (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but processing must take into account of the tendency of the metal to springback. This is especially true of certain high-strength alloys. Exposure to the oxygen in air at the elevated temperatures used in forging results in formation of a brittle oxygen-rich metallic surface layer called \"alpha case\" that worsens the fatigue properties, so it must be removed by milling, etching, or electrochemical treatment. The working of titanium may include friction welding, cryo-forging, and vacuum arc remelting.\nApplications.\nTitanium is used in steel as an alloying element (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and other metals. Titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets. Powdered titanium is used in pyrotechnics as a source of bright-burning particles.\nPigments, additives, and coatings.\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most common compound of the element, being the end point of 95% of the world's refined titanium. It is a widely used white pigment. It is also used in cement, in gemstones, and as an optical opacifier in paper.\nTiO2 pigment is chemically inert, resists fading in sunlight, and is very opaque: it imparts a pure and brilliant white color to the brown or grey chemicals that form the majority of household plastics. In nature, this compound is found in the minerals anatase, brookite, and rutile. Paint made with titanium dioxide does well in severe temperatures and marine environments. Pure titanium dioxide has a very high index of refraction and an optical dispersion higher than diamond. Titanium dioxide is used in sunscreens because it reflects and absorbs UV light.\nAerospace and marine.\nBecause titanium alloys have high tensile strength to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, landing gear, firewalls, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. About two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft frames and engines. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.\nThe Lockheed A-12 and the SR-71 \"Blackbird\" were two of the first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. A large amount of titanium mill products are used in the production of many aircraft, such as (following values are amount of raw mill products used, only a fraction of this ends up in the finished aircraft): 116\u00a0metric tons are used in the Boeing 787, 77 in the Airbus A380, 59 in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Boeing 737, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. In aero engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. An early use in jet engines was for the Orenda Iroquois in the 1950s.\nBecause titanium is resistant to corrosion by sea water, it is used to make propeller shafts, rigging, heat exchangers in desalination plants, heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and divers' knives. Titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and military. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys, forging titanium in huge vacuum tubes.\nIndustrial.\nWelded titanium pipe and process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in oil and gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Titanium is also used in sputtering targets.\nPowdered titanium acts as a non-evaporative getter, and is one of several gas-reactive materials used to remove gases from ultra-high vacuum systems. This application manifested in titanium sublimation pumps first employed in 1961, though the metal was first used in vacuum systems to prevent chambers from oxidizing in a design created by Raymond Herb in 1953.\nTitanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a colorless liquid, is important as an intermediate in the process of making TiO2 and is also used to produce the Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to iridize glass and, because it fumes strongly in moist air, it is used to make smoke screens. In many industrial applications, titanium and its alloys can serve as a potential substitute for other metals, such as nickel, niobium, scandium, silver, tantalum, and tungsten.\nConsumer and architectural.\nTitanium metal is used in automotive applications, particularly in automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts.\nTitanium is used in many sporting goods: tennis rackets, golf clubs, lacrosse stick shafts; cricket, hockey, lacrosse, and football helmet grills, and bicycle frames and components. Although not a mainstream material for bicycle production, titanium bikes have been used by racing teams and adventure cyclists. Titanium is used in spectable frames, as it is durable and protect the lenses, though it may be less flexible than alternatives. Its biocompatibility is a potential benefit over other glasses frame materials. Titanium is a common material for backpacking cookware and eating utensils. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because they are lighter and more durable. Some upmarket lightweight and corrosion-resistant tools, such as shovels, knife handles and flashlights, are made of titanium or titanium alloys. \nTitanium has occasionally been used in architecture. The Monument to Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel in space, as well as the upper part of the Monument to the Conquerors of Space on top of the Cosmonaut Museum in Moscow are made of titanium. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Cerritos Millennium Library were the first buildings in Europe and North America, respectively, to be sheathed in titanium panels. Titanium sheathing was used in the Frederic C. Hamilton Building in Denver, Colorado.\nBecause of titanium's superior strength and light weight relative to other metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become widespread in the manufacture of firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of some laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook G4) and phones (such as the iPhone 15 Pro).\nJewelry.\nBecause of its durability, titanium is used in some designer jewelry, such as titanium rings. Its inertness makes it hypoallergenic and wearable in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-karat gold, because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-karat gold and is more durable than pure 24-karat gold.\nTitanium's durability, light weight, and dent and corrosion resistance make it useful for watch cases. Some artists work with titanium to produce sculptures, decorative objects and furniture. Titanium may be anodized to vary the thickness of the surface oxide layer, causing optical interference fringes and a variety of bright colors. With its variable coloration and chemical inertness, titanium is a popular metal for body piercing.\nTitanium has a minor use in dedicated non-circulating coins and medals. In 1999, the world's first titanium coin was minted for Gibraltar's millennium celebration. Pobjoy Mint, the British mint that produced the coin, continued to manufacture anodized titanium coins until its closure in 2023. The Gold Coast Titans, an Australian rugby league team, award a medal of pure titanium to their player of the year.\nMedical.\nBecause titanium is biocompatible (non-toxic and not rejected by the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) and dental implants. Titanium and titanium alloy implants have been used in surgery since the 1950s, and are favored due to their low rate of corrosion, long life, and low Young's modulus. A titanium alloy that contains 6% aluminium and 4% vanadium commonly used in the aerospace industry is also a common material for artificial joints.\nTitanium has the inherent ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that can last for over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate. Biomedical implants coated with a combination of silver and titanium have been researched as a potential option for load-bearing implants that need antimicrobial surfaces.\nModern advancements in additive manufacturing techniques have increased potential for titanium use in orthopedic implant applications. Complex implant scaffold designs can be 3D-printed using titanium alloys, which allows for more patient-specific applications and increased implant osseointegration. Because titanium is non-ferromagnetic, patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized. Titanium is used for the surgical instruments used in image-guided surgery, as well as wheelchairs, crutches, and any other products where high strength and low weight are desirable.\nTitanium dioxide nanoparticles are widely used in electronics and the delivery of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\nAnticancer therapy studies.\nFollowing the success of platinum-based chemotherapy, titanium(IV) complexes were among the first non-platinum compounds to be tested and accepted for clinical trials in cancer treatment. The advantage of titanium compounds lies in their high efficacy and low toxicity \"in vivo\". In biological environments, hydrolysis leads to the safe and inert titanium dioxide. Despite these advantages, the first candidate compounds failed clinical trials due to insufficient efficacy to toxicity ratios and formulation complications. Further development resulted in the creation of potentially effective, selective, and stable titanium-based drugs.\nNuclear waste storage.\nBecause of its corrosion resistance, containers made of titanium have been studied for the long-term storage of nuclear waste. Containers lasting more than 100,000 years are thought possible with manufacturing conditions that minimize material defects. A titanium \"drip shield\" has been considered for installation over containers of other types to enhance their longevity.\nHazards and safety.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nTitanium is non-toxic, even in large doses, and does not play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated 0.8milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through the digestive system without being absorbed in the tissues. However, it can sometimes bioaccumulate in tissues that contain silica. Yellow nail syndrome has been reported in individuals that have been exposed to titanium, though the disorder's rarity have made it difficult to determine a direct association between exposure and disorder development.\nAs a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead. When used in the production or handling of chlorine, titanium exposed to dry chlorine gas may result in a titanium\u2013chlorine fire. Titanium can also catch fire when a fresh, non-oxidized surface comes in contact with liquid oxygen.\nFunction in plants.\nAn unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2\u00a0ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80\u00a0ppm.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30041", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30041", "title": "Technetium", "text": "element with atomic number 43 (Tc)\nTechnetium is a chemical element; it has symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive. Technetium and promethium are the only radioactive elements whose neighbours in the sense of atomic number are both stable. All available technetium is produced as a synthetic element. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore and thorium ore (the most common source), or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. This silvery gray, crystalline transition metal lies between manganese and rhenium in group\u00a07 of the periodic table, and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of both adjacent elements. The most common naturally occurring isotope is 99Tc, in traces only.\nMany of technetium's properties had been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before it was discovered; Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name \"ekamanganese\" (\"Em\"). In 1937, technetium became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name (from the Greek \"\", 'artificial', + \"-ium\").\nOne short-lived gamma ray\u2013emitting nuclear isomer, technetium-99m, is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of tests, such as bone cancer diagnoses. The ground state of the nuclide technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray\u2013free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are byproducts of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because even the longest-lived isotope of technetium has a relatively short half-life (4.21\u00a0million years), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.\nHistory.\nEarly assumptions.\nFrom the 1860s through 1871, early forms of the periodic table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained a gap between molybdenum (element\u00a042) and ruthenium (element\u00a044). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name \"eka-manganese\" (from \"eka\", the Sanskrit word for \"one\") because it was one place down from the known element manganese.\nEarly misidentifications.\nMany early researchers, both before and after the periodic table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements. This turned out not to be the case, due to technetium's radioactivity.\nIrreproducible results.\nGerman chemists Walter Noddack, Otto Berg, and Ida Tacke reported the discovery of element\u00a075 and element\u00a043 in 1925, and named element\u00a043 \"masurium\" (after Masuria in eastern Prussia, now in Poland, the region where Walter Noddack's family originated). This name caused significant resentment in the scientific community, because it was interpreted as referring to a series of victories of the German army over the Russian army in the Masuria region during World War I; as the Noddacks remained in their academic positions while the Nazis were in power, suspicions and hostility against their claim for discovering element\u00a043 continued. The group bombarded columbite with a beam of electrons and deduced element\u00a043 was present by examining X-ray emission spectrograms. The wavelength of the X-rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by Henry Moseley in 1913. The team claimed to detect a faint X-ray signal at a wavelength produced by element\u00a043. Later experimenters could not replicate the discovery, and it was dismissed as an error. Still, in 1933, a series of articles on the discovery of elements quoted the name \"masurium\" for element\u00a043. Some more recent attempts have been made to rehabilitate the Noddacks' claims, but they are disproved by Paul Kuroda's study on the amount of technetium that could have been present in the ores they studied: it could not have exceeded 3 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03bcg/kg of ore, and thus would have been undetectable by the Noddacks' methods.\nOfficial discovery and later history.\nThe discovery of element\u00a043 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segr\u00e8. In mid-1936, Segr\u00e8 visited the United States, first Columbia University in New York and then the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive. Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron.\nSegr\u00e8 enlisted his colleague Perrier to attempt to prove, through comparative chemistry, that the molybdenum activity was indeed from an element with the atomic number 43, which they did. University of Palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery , after the Latin name for Palermo, \"\". In 1947, element 43 was named after the Greek word (), meaning 'artificial', since it was the first element to be artificially produced.\nSegr\u00e8 returned to Berkeley and met Glenn T. Seaborg. They isolated the metastable isotope technetium-99m, which is now used in some ten million medical diagnostic procedures annually.\nIn 1952, the astronomer Paul W. Merrill detected the spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1\u00a0nm, 423.8\u00a0nm, 426.2\u00a0nm, and 429.7\u00a0nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were near the end of their lives but were rich in the short-lived element, which indicated that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. That evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.\nSince that discovery, there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in very small quantities (about 0.2\u00a0ng/kg), where it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The natural nuclear fission reactor in Oklo contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nTechnetium is a silvery-gray radioactive metal with an appearance similar to platinum, commonly obtained as a gray powder. The crystal structure of the bulk pure metal is hexagonal close-packed. Atomic technetium has characteristic emission lines at wavelengths of 363.3\u00a0nm, 403.1\u00a0nm, 426.2\u00a0nm, 429.7\u00a0nm, and 485.3\u00a0nm. The unit cell parameters of the orthorhombic Tc metal were reported when Tc is contaminated with carbon (a = 0.2805(4), b = 0.4958(8), c = 0.4474(5)\u00b7nm for Tc-C with 1.38 wt% C and a = 0.2815(4), b = 0.4963(8), c = 0.4482(5)\u00b7nm for Tc-C with 1.96 wt% C ). The metal form is slightly paramagnetic, meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields, but will assume random orientations once the field is removed. Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a type-II superconductor at temperatures below .\nBelow this temperature, technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth, greater than any other element except niobium.\nChemical properties.\nTechnetium is located in group\u00a07 of the periodic table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. This is consistent with the tendency of period\u00a05 elements to resemble their counterparts in period\u00a06 more than period\u00a04 due to the lanthanide contraction. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from \u22121 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but \"not\" in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.\nMetallic technetium slowly tarnishes in moist air and, in powder form, burns in oxygen. When reacting with hydrogen at high pressure, it forms the non-stoichiometric hydride TcH1.3 and while reacting with carbon it forms Tc6C, with cell parameter 0.398\u00a0nm.\nTechnetium can catalyse the destruction of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies. This caused a problem in the separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.\nCompounds.\nPertechnetate and other derivatives.\nThe most prevalent form of technetium that is easily accessible is sodium pertechnetate, Na[TcO4]. The majority of this material is produced by radioactive decay from [99MoO4]2\u2212:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;[99MoO4]2\u2212 \u2192 [99mTcO4]\u2212 + e\u2212\nPertechnetate (TcO4-) is only weakly hydrated in aqueous solutions, and it behaves analogously to perchlorate anion, both of which are tetrahedral. Unlike permanganate (MnO4-), it is only a weak oxidizing agent.\nRelated to pertechnetate is technetium heptoxide. This pale-yellow, volatile solid is produced by oxidation of Tc metal and related precursors:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;4 Tc + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Tc2O7\nIt is a molecular metal oxide, analogous to manganese heptoxide. It adopts a centrosymmetric structure with two types of Tc\u2212O bonds with 167 and 184\u00a0pm bond lengths.\nTechnetium heptoxide hydrolyzes to pertechnetate and pertechnetic acid, depending on the pH:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Tc2O7 + 2 OH\u2212 \u2192 2 TcO4\u2212 + H2O\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Tc2O7 + H2O \u2192 2 HTcO4\nHTcO4 is a strong acid. In concentrated sulfuric acid, [TcO4]\u2212 converts to the octahedral form TcO3(OH)(H2O)2, the conjugate base of the hypothetical triaquo complex [TcO3(H2O)3]+.\nOther chalcogenide derivatives.\nTechnetium forms a dioxide, disulfide, diselenide, and ditelluride. An ill-defined Tc2S7 forms upon treating pertechnate with hydrogen sulfide. It thermally decomposes into disulfide and elemental sulfur. Similarly the dioxide can be produced by reduction of the Tc2O7.\nUnlike the case for rhenium, a trioxide has not been isolated for technetium. However, TcO3 has been identified in the gas phase using mass spectrometry.\nSimple hydride and halide complexes.\nTechnetium forms the complex TcH92-. The potassium salt is isostructural with ReH92-. At high pressure formation of TcH1.3 from elements was also reported.\nThe following binary (containing only two elements) technetium halides are known: TcF6, TcF5, TcCl4, TcBr4, TcBr3, \u03b1-TcCl3, \u03b2-TcCl3, TcI3, \u03b1-TcCl2, and \u03b2-TcCl2. The oxidation states range from Tc(VI) to Tc(II). Technetium halides exhibit different structure types, such as molecular octahedral complexes, extended chains, layered sheets, and metal clusters arranged in a three-dimensional network. These compounds are produced by combining the metal and halogen or by less direct reactions.\nTcCl4 is obtained by chlorination of Tc metal or Tc2O7. Upon heating, TcCl4 gives the corresponding Tc(III) and Tc(II) chlorides.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;TcCl4 \u2192 \u03b1-TcCl3 + 1/2 Cl2\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;TcCl3 \u2192 \u03b2-TcCl2 + 1/2 Cl2\nThe structure of TcCl4 is composed of infinite zigzag chains of edge-sharing TcCl6 octahedra. It is isomorphous to transition metal tetrachlorides of zirconium, hafnium, and platinum.\nTwo polymorphs of technetium trichloride exist, \u03b1- and \u03b2-TcCl3. The \u03b1 polymorph is also denoted as Tc3Cl9. It adopts a confacial bioctahedral structure. It is prepared by treating the chloro-acetate Tc2(O2CCH3)4Cl2 with HCl. Like Re3Cl9, the structure of the \u03b1-polymorph consists of triangles with short M-M distances. \u03b2-TcCl3 features octahedral Tc centers, which are organized in pairs, as seen also for molybdenum trichloride. TcBr3 does not adopt the structure of either trichloride phase. Instead it has the structure of molybdenum tribromide, consisting of chains of confacial octahedra with alternating short and long Tc\u2014Tc contacts. TcI3 has the same structure as the high temperature phase of TiI3, featuring chains of confacial octahedra with equal Tc\u2014Tc contacts.\nSeveral anionic technetium halides are known. The binary tetrahalides can be converted to the hexahalides [TcX6]2\u2212 (X = F, Cl, Br, I), which adopt octahedral molecular geometry. More reduced halides form anionic clusters with Tc\u2013Tc bonds. The situation is similar for the related elements of Mo, W, Re. These clusters have the nuclearity Tc4, Tc6, Tc8, and Tc13. The more stable Tc6 and Tc8 clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of Tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds. Every technetium atom makes six bonds, and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two bridging ligand halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine.\nCoordination and organometallic complexes.\nTechnetium forms a variety of coordination complexes with organic ligands. Many have been well-investigated because of their relevance to nuclear medicine.\nTechnetium forms a variety of compounds with Tc\u2013C bonds, i.e. organotechnetium complexes. Prominent members of this class are complexes with CO, arene, and cyclopentadienyl ligands. The binary carbonyl Tc2(CO)10 is a white volatile solid. In this molecule, two technetium atoms are bound to each other; each atom is surrounded by octahedra of five carbonyl ligands. The bond length between technetium atoms, 303\u00a0pm, is significantly larger than the distance between two atoms in metallic technetium (272\u00a0pm). Similar carbonyls are formed by technetium's congeners, manganese and rhenium. Interest in organotechnetium compounds has also been motivated by applications in nuclear medicine. Technetium also forms aquo-carbonyl complexes, one prominent complex being [Tc(CO)3(H2O)3]+, which are unusual compared to other metal carbonyls.\nIsotopes.\nTechnetium, with atomic number \"Z\"\u00a0= 43, is the lowest-numbered element in the periodic table for which all isotopes are radioactive. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, promethium, has atomic number 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.\nThe most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium-97 with a half-life of \u00a0million\u00a0years and technetium-98 with \u00a0million\u00a0years; current measurements of their half-lives give overlapping confidence intervals corresponding to one standard deviation and therefore do not allow a definite assignment of technetium's most stable isotope. The next most stable isotope is technetium-99, which has a half-life of 211,100\u00a0years. Thirty-four other radioisotopes have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 86 to 122. Most of these have half-lives that are less than an hour, the exceptions being technetium-93 (2.75\u00a0hours), technetium-94 (4.88\u00a0hours), technetium-95 (19.26\u00a0hours), and technetium-96 (4.28\u00a0days).\nThe primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than technetium-98 (98Tc) is electron capture, producing molybdenum (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a042). For technetium-98 and heavier isotopes, the primary mode is beta emission (the emission of an electron or positron), producing ruthenium (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a044), with the exception that technetium-98 and technetium-100 can decay both by beta emission and electron capture.\nTechnetium also has numerous nuclear isomers, which are isotopes with one or more excited nucleons. Technetium-97m (97mTc; \"m\" stands for metastable) is the most stable, with a half-life of 91.1\u00a0days and excitation energy 0.097\u00a0MeV, followed by technetium-95m (62.0\u00a0days, 0.039\u00a0MeV), and technetium-99m (6.01\u00a0hours, 0.143\u00a0MeV).\nTechnetium-99 (99Tc) is a major product of the fission of uranium-235 (235U), making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium, and the only one detected in nature. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2 \u00d7 108 disintegrations per second (in other words, the specific activity of 99Tc is 0.62\u00a0GBq/g).\nOccurrence and production.\nTechnetium occurs naturally in the Earth's crust in minute concentrations of about 0.003 parts per trillion. Technetium is so rare because the half-lives of 97Tc and 98Tc are only 4.2 million years. More than a thousand of such periods have passed since the formation of the Earth, so the probability of survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1\u00a0nanogram (10\u22129 g), equivalent to ten trillion atoms, of technetium.\nSome red giant stars with the spectral types S, M, and N display a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red giants are known informally as technetium stars.\nFission product.\nIn contrast to the rare natural occurrence, bulk quantities of technetium-99 are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods, which contain various fission products. The fission of a gram of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors yields 27\u00a0mg of technetium-99, giving technetium a fission product yield of 6.1%. Other fissile isotopes produce similar yields of technetium, such as 4.9% from uranium-233 and 6.21% from plutonium-239. An estimated 49,000\u00a0TBq (78\u00a0metric tons) of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors between 1983 and 1994, by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium.\nOnly a fraction of the production is used commercially.\nTechnetium-99 is produced by the nuclear fission of both uranium-235 and plutonium-239. It is therefore present in radioactive waste and in the nuclear fallout of fission bomb explosions. Its decay, measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel, is the dominant contributor to nuclear waste radioactivity after about 104~106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste. From 1945 to 1994, an estimated 160\u00a0TBq (about 250\u00a0kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment during atmospheric nuclear tests.\nThe amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is on the order of 1000\u00a0TBq (about 1600\u00a0kg), primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing; most of this was discharged into the sea. Reprocessing methods have reduced emissions since then, but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the Sellafield plant, which released an estimated 550\u00a0TBq (about 900\u00a0kg) from 1995 to 1999 into the Irish Sea. \nFrom 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90\u00a0TBq (about 140\u00a0kg) per year.\nDischarge of technetium into the sea resulted in contamination of some seafood with minuscule quantities of this element. For example, European lobster and fish from west Cumbria contain about 1\u00a0Bq/kg of technetium.\nFission product for commercial use.\nThe metastable isotope technetium-99m is continuously produced as a fission product from the fission of uranium or plutonium in nuclear reactors:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt; ^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\\ce{sf}] ^{137}_{53}I + ^{99}_{39}Y + 2^{1}_{0}n&lt;/chem&gt;\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt; ^{99}_{39}Y -&gt;[\\beta^-][1.47\\,\\ce{s}] ^{99}_{40}Zr -&gt;[\\beta^-][2.1\\,\\ce{s}] ^{99}_{41}Nb -&gt;[\\beta^-][15.0\\,\\ce{s}] ^{99}_{42}Mo -&gt;[\\beta^-][65.94\\,\\ce{h}] ^{99}_{43}Tc -&gt;[\\beta^-][211,100\\,\\ce{y}] ^{99}_{44}Ru&lt;/chem&gt;\nBecause used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing, all molybdenum-99 and technetium-99m is decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major actinides in conventional nuclear reprocessing. The liquid left after plutonium\u2013uranium extraction (PUREX) contains a high concentration of technetium as TcO4- but almost all of this is technetium-99, not technetium-99m.\nThe vast majority of the technetium-99m used in medical work is produced by irradiating dedicated highly enriched uranium targets in a reactor, extracting molybdenum-99 from the targets in reprocessing facilities, and recovering at the diagnostic center the technetium-99m produced upon decay of molybdenum-99. Molybdenum-99 in the form of molybdate MoO42- is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3) in a shielded column chromatograph inside a technetium-99m generator (\"technetium cow\", also occasionally called a \"molybdenum cow\"). Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of 67\u00a0hours, so short-lived technetium-99m (half-life: 6\u00a0hours), which results from its decay, is being constantly produced. The soluble pertechnetate TcO4- can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution. A drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium-235, which are subject to the security precautions of fissile materials.\nAlmost two-thirds of the world's supply comes from two reactors; the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada, and the High Flux Reactor at Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group in Petten, Netherlands. All major reactors that produce technetium-99m were built in the 1960s and are close to the end of life. The two new Canadian Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment reactors planned and built to produce 200% of the demand of technetium-99m relieved all other producers from building their own reactors. With the cancellation of the already tested reactors in 2008, the future supply of technetium-99m became problematic.\nWaste disposal.\nThe long half-life of technetium-99 and its potential to form anionic species creates a major concern for long-term disposal of radioactive waste. Many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at cationic species such as caesium (e.g., caesium-137) and strontium (e.g., strontium-90). Hence the pertechnetate escapes through those processes. Current disposal options favor burial in continental, geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such practice is the likelihood that the waste will contact water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and iodide tend not to adsorb into the surfaces of minerals, and are likely to be washed away. By comparison plutonium, uranium, and caesium tend to bind to soil particles. Technetium could be immobilized by some environments, such as microbial activity in lake bottom sediments, and the environmental chemistry of technetium is an area of active research.\nAn alternative disposal method, transmutation, has been demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16\u00a0seconds) which decays by beta decay to stable ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium are present in the target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374\u00a0days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.\nThe actual separation of technetium-99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process. During fuel reprocessing, it comes out as a component of the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.\nNeutron activation.\nMolybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can be formed by the neutron activation of molybdenum-98. When needed, other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission, but are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes (for example, technetium-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of ruthenium-96).\nParticle accelerators.\nThe feasibility of technetium-99m production with the 22-MeV-proton bombardment of a molybdenum-100 target in medical cyclotrons following the reaction 100Mo(p,2n)99mTc was demonstrated in 1971. The recent shortages of medical technetium-99m reignited the interest in its production by proton bombardment of isotopically enriched (&gt;99.5%) molybdenum-100 targets. Other techniques are being investigated for obtaining molybdenum-99 from molybdenum-100 via (n,2n) or (\u03b3,n) reactions in particle accelerators.\nApplications.\nNuclear medicine and biology.\nTechnetium-99m (\"m\" indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive isotope medical tests. For example, technetium-99m is a radioactive tracer that medical imaging equipment tracks in the human body. It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140\u00a0keV gamma rays, and its half-life is 6.01\u00a0hours (meaning that about 94% of it decays to technetium-99 in 24\u00a0hours). The chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of biochemical compounds, each of which determines how it is metabolized and deposited in the body, and this single isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests. More than 50 common radiopharmaceuticals are based on technetium-99m for imaging and functional studies of the brain, heart muscle, thyroid, lungs, liver, gall bladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood, and tumors.\nThe longer-lived isotope, technetium-95m with a half-life of 61\u00a0days, is used as a radioactive tracer to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems.\nIndustrial and chemical.\nTechnetium-99 decays almost entirely by beta decay, emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.\nLike rhenium and palladium, technetium can serve as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.\nWhen steel is immersed in water, adding a small concentration (55\u00a0ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) to the water protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to . For this reason, pertechnetate has been used as an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) CrO42- can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20\u00a0years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer (passivation). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.\nAs noted, the radioactive nature of technetium (3\u00a0MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.\nPrecautions and biological effect.\nTechnetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15\u00a0\u03bcg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. In the body, technetium quickly gets converted to the stable TcO4- ion, which is highly water-soluble and quickly excreted. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) is a function of compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.\nAll isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully. The most common isotope, technetium-99, is a weak beta emitter; such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware. The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust; such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk. For most work, careful handling in a fume hood is sufficient, and a glove box is not needed.\nBeing close to noble metals, technetium is not very susceptible to corrosion, and during biofouling, its ability to self-cleanse has been recorded due to its radiotoxic effect on biota.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nS.

{"id": "30042", "revid": "32694456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30042", "title": "Tin", "text": "element with atomic number 50 (Sn)\nTin is a chemical element; it has the symbol Sn (from la \" stannum\") and atomic number 50. A metallic-gray metal, tin is soft enough to be cut with little force, and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, a bar of tin makes a sound, the so-called \"tin cry\", as a result of twinning in tin crystals.\nTin is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains stannic oxide, SnO2. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth, making up 0.00022% of its crust, and with 10 stable isotopes, it has the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, due to its magic number of protons.\nIt has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is \u03b2-tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal; at low temperatures it is less dense grey \u03b1-tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin does not easily oxidize in air and water.\nThe first tin alloy used on a large scale was bronze, made of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448\u00a0tin and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u20448\u00a0copper (12.5% and 87.5% respectively), from as early as 3000\u00a0BC. After 600\u00a0BC, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85\u201390% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony, bismuth, and sometimes lead and silver, has been used for flatware since the Bronze Age. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin-lead soft solders, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of indium tin oxide in optoelectronic applications. Another large application is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as \"tin cans\". Some organotin compounds can be extremely toxic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical.\nTin is a soft, malleable, ductile and highly crystalline silvery-white metal. When a bar of tin is bent a crackling sound known as the \"tin cry\" can be heard from the twinning of the crystals. This trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in its solid state. Tin melts at about , the lowest in group\u00a014, and boils at , the second lowest (ahead of lead) in its group. The melting point is further lowered to for 11\u00a0nm particles.\n\u03b2-tin, also called \"white tin\", is the allotrope (structural form) of elemental tin that is stable at and above room temperature. It is metallic and malleable, and has body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. \u03b1-tin, or \"gray tin\", is the nonmetallic form. It is stable below and is brittle. \u03b1-tin has a diamond cubic crystal structure, as do diamond and silicon. \u03b1-tin does not have metallic properties because its atoms form a covalent structure in which electrons cannot move freely. \u03b1-tin is a dull-gray powdery material with no common uses other than specialized semiconductor applications. \u03b3-tin and \u03c3-tin exist at temperatures above \u00a0 and pressures above several GPa.\nIn cold conditions \u03b2-tin tends to transform spontaneously into \u03b1-tin, a phenomenon known as \"tin pest\" or \"tin disease\". Some unverifiable sources also say that, during Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812, the temperatures became so cold that the tin buttons on the soldiers' uniforms disintegrated over time, contributing to the defeat of the Grande Arm\u00e9e, a persistent legend.\nThe \u03b1-\u03b2 transformation temperature is , but impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower it well below . With the addition of antimony or bismuth the transformation might not occur at all, increasing durability.\nCommercial grades of tin (99.8% tin content) resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of small amounts of bismuth, antimony, lead, and silver present as impurities. Alloying elements such as copper, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, and silver increase the hardness of tin. Tin easily forms hard, brittle intermetallic phases that are typically undesirable. It does not mix into a solution with most metals and elements so tin does not have much solid solubility. Tin mixes well with bismuth, gallium, lead, thallium and zinc, forming simple eutectic systems.\nTin becomes a superconductor below 3.72\u00a0K and was one of the first superconductors to be studied. The Meissner effect, one of the characteristic features of superconductors, was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals.\nChemical.\nTin resists corrosion from water, but can be corroded by acids and alkalis. Tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals. When heated in air it oxidizes slowly to form a thin passivation layer of stannic oxide () that inhibits further oxidation.\nIsotopes.\nTin has ten stable isotopes, the greatest number of any element. Their mass numbers are 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 122, and 124. Tin-120 makes up almost a third of all tin. Tin-118 and tin-116 are also common. Tin-115 is the least common stable isotope. The isotopes with even mass numbers have no nuclear spin, while those with odd mass numbers have a nuclear spin of 1/2. It is thought that tin has such a great multitude of stable isotopes because of tin's atomic number being 50, which is a \"magic number\" in nuclear physics.\nTin is one of the easiest elements to detect and analyze by NMR spectroscopy, which relies on molecular weight and its chemical shifts are referenced against tetramethyltin (SnMe4).\nOf the stable isotopes, tin-115 has a high neutron capture cross section for thermal neutrons, at 30 barns. Tin-117 has a cross section of 2.3 barns, one order of magnitude smaller, while tin-119 has a slightly smaller cross section of 2.2 barns. Before these cross sections were well known, it was proposed to use tin-lead solder as a coolant for fast reactors because of its low melting point. Current studies are for lead or lead-bismuth reactor coolants because both heavy metals are nearly transparent to fast neutrons, with very low capture cross sections. In order to use a tin or tin-lead coolant, the tin would first have to go through isotopic separation to remove the isotopes with odd mass number. Combined, these three isotopes make up about 17% of natural tin but represent nearly all of the capture cross section. Of the remaining seven isotopes tin-112 has a capture cross section of 1 barn. The other six isotopes forming 82.7% of natural tin have capture cross sections of 0.3 barns or less, making them effectively transparent to neutrons.\nTin has 33 unstable isotopes, ranging in mass number from 98 to 140. The unstable tin isotopes have half-lives of less than a year except for tin-126, which has a half-life of about 230,000 years. Tin-100 and tin-132 are two of the very few nuclides with a \"doubly magic\" nucleus; though they are unstable, being far off the valley of stability in neutron\u2013proton ratio, the tin isotopes lighter than tin-100 and heavier than tin-132 are even less stable. Another 55 metastable isomers have been identified for tin isotopes between 111 and 131, the most stable being tin-121m, with a half-life of 43.9 years.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tin\" is shared among Germanic languages and can be traced back to reconstructed Proto-Germanic ; cognates include German , Swedish and Dutch . It is not found in other branches of Indo-European, except by borrowing from Germanic (e.g., Irish from English).\nThe Latin name for tin, , originally meant an alloy of silver and lead, and came to mean 'tin' in the fourth century\u2014the earlier Latin word for it was , or \"white lead\". apparently came from an earlier (meaning the same substance), the origin of the Romance and Celtic terms for \"tin\", such as French , Spanish , Italian , and Irish . The origin of / is unknown; it may be pre-Indo-European.\nThe suggests instead that came from Cornish , and is evidence that Cornwall in the first centuries AD was the main source of tin.\nHistory.\nTin extraction and use can be dated to the beginnings of the Bronze Age around 3000\u00a0BC, when it was observed that copper objects formed of polymetallic ores with different metal contents had different physical properties. The earliest bronze objects had a tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are believed to be the result of unintentional alloying due to trace metal content in the copper ore. The addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness, lowers the melting temperature, and improves the casting process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser, less spongy metal. This was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed molds of the Bronze Age. Arsenical bronze objects appear first in the Near East where arsenic is commonly found with copper ore, but the health risks were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age. This created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a trade network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of Bronze Age cultures.\nCassiterite (SnO2), the oxide form of tin, was most likely the original source of tin. Other tin ores are less common sulfides such as stannite that require a more involved smelting process. Cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as placer deposits because it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the accompanying granite. Cassiterite is usually black or dark in color, and these deposits can be easily seen in river banks. Alluvial (placer) deposits may incidentally have been collected and separated by methods similar to gold panning.\nCompounds and chemistry.\nIn the great majority of its compounds, tin has the oxidation state II or IV. Compounds containing bivalent tin are called while those containing tetravalent tin are termed .\nInorganic compounds.\nHalide compounds are known for both oxidation states. For Sn(IV), all four halides are well known: SnF4, SnCl4, SnBr4, and SnI4. The three heavier members are volatile molecular compounds, whereas the tetrafluoride is polymeric. All four halides are known for Sn(II) also: SnF2, SnCl2, SnBr2, and SnI2. All are polymeric solids. Of these eight compounds, only the iodides are colored.\nTin(II) chloride (also known as stannous chloride) is the most important commercial tin halide. Illustrating the routes to such compounds, chlorine reacts with tin metal to give SnCl4 whereas the reaction of hydrochloric acid and tin produces SnCl2 and hydrogen gas. Alternatively SnCl4 and Sn combine to stannous chloride by a process called comproportionation:\nSnCl4 + Sn \u2192 2 SnCl2\nTin can form many oxides, sulfides, and other chalcogenide derivatives. The dioxide SnO2 (cassiterite) forms when tin is heated in the presence of air. SnO2 is amphoteric, which means that it dissolves in both acidic and basic solutions. Stannates with the structure [Sn(OH)6]2\u2212, like K2[Sn(OH)6], are also known, though the free stannic acid H2[Sn(OH)6] is unknown.\nSulfides of tin exist in both the +2 and +4 oxidation states: tin(II) sulfide and tin(IV) sulfide (mosaic gold).\nHydrides.\nStannane (SnH4), with tin in the +4 oxidation state, is unstable. Organotin hydrides are however well known, e.g. tributyltin hydride (Sn(C4H9)3H). These compounds release transient tributyl tin radicals, which are rare examples of compounds of tin(III).\nOrganotin compounds.\nOrganotin compounds, sometimes called stannanes, are chemical compounds with tin\u2013carbon bonds. Of the tin compounds, the organic derivatives are commercially the most useful. Some organotin compounds are highly toxic and have been used as biocides. The first organotin compound to be reported was diethyltin diiodide ((C2H5)2SnI2), reported by Edward Frankland in 1849.\nMost organotin compounds are colorless liquids or solids that are stable to air and water. They adopt tetrahedral geometry. Tetraalkyl- and tetraaryltin compounds can be prepared using Grignard reagents:\nSnCl4 + 4 RMgBr \u2192 R4Sn + 4 MgBrCl\nThe mixed halide-alkyls, which are more common and more important commercially than the tetraorgano derivatives, are prepared by redistribution reactions:\nSnCl4 + R4Sn \u2192 2 SnCl2R2\nDivalent organotin compounds are uncommon, although more common than related divalent organogermanium and organosilicon compounds. The greater stabilization enjoyed by Sn(II) is attributed to the \"inert pair effect\". Organotin(II) compounds include both stannylenes (formula: R2Sn, as seen for singlet carbenes) and distannylenes (R4Sn2), which are roughly equivalent to alkenes. Both classes exhibit unusual reactions.\nOccurrence.\nTin is generated via the long \"s\"-process in low-to-medium mass stars (with masses of 0.6 to 10 times that of the Sun), and finally by beta decay of the heavy isotopes of indium.\nTin is the 49th most abundant element in Earth's crust, representing 2\u00a0ppm compared with 75\u00a0ppm for zinc, 50\u00a0ppm for copper, and 14\u00a0ppm for lead.\nTin does not occur as the native element but must be extracted from various ores. Cassiterite (SnO2) is the only commercially important source of tin, although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite, cylindrite, franckeite, canfieldite, and teallite. Minerals with tin are almost always associated with granite rock, usually at a level of 1% tin oxide content.\nBecause of the higher specific gravity of tin dioxide, about 80% of mined tin is from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary lodes. Tin is often recovered from granules washed downstream in the past and deposited in valleys or the sea. The most economical ways of mining tin are by dredging, hydraulicking, or open pits. Most of the world's tin is produced from placer deposits, which can contain as little as 0.015% tin.\nAbout 253,000 tonnes of tin were mined in 2011, mostly in China (110,000\u00a0t), Indonesia (51,000\u00a0t), Peru (34,600\u00a0t), Bolivia (20,700\u00a0t) and Brazil (12,000\u00a0t). Estimates of tin production have historically varied with the market and mining technology. It is estimated that, at current consumption rates and technologies, the Earth will run out of mine-able tin in 40 years. In 2006 Lester Brown suggested tin could run out within 20 years based on conservative estimates of 2% annual growth.\nScrap tin is an important source of the metal. Recovery of tin through recycling is increasing rapidly as of 2019. Whereas the United States has neither mined (since 1993) nor smelted (since 1989) tin, it was the largest secondary producer, recycling nearly 14,000 tonnes in 2006.\nNew deposits are reported in Mongolia, and in 2009, new deposits of tin were discovered in Colombia.\nProduction.\nTin is produced by carbothermic reduction of the oxide ore with carbon or coke. Both reverberatory furnace and electric furnace can be used:\n SnO2 + C Arc furnace\u2192 Sn + CO2\u2191\nIndustry.\nThe ten largest tin-producing companies produced most of the world's tin in 2007.\nMost of the world's tin is traded on LME, from 8 countries, under 17 brands.\nThe International Tin Council was established in 1947 to control the price of tin. It collapsed in 1985. In 1984, the Association of Tin Producing Countries was created, with Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, and Zaire as members.\nPrice and exchanges.\nTin is unique among mineral commodities because of the complex agreements between producer countries and consumer countries dating back to 1921. Earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and led to the \"First International Tin Agreement\" in 1956, the first of a series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through these agreements, the International Tin Council (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. reduced its strategic tin stockpile, partly to take advantage of historically high tin prices. The 1981\u201382 recession damaged the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required extensive borrowing. ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major \"tin crisis\" ensued\u2014tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years. ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, fell to $4 per pound and remained around that level through the 1990s. The price increased again by 2010 with a rebound in consumption following the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, accompanying restocking and continued growth in consumption.\nLondon Metal Exchange (LME) is tin's principal trading site. Other tin contract markets are Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) and Indonesia Tin Exchange (INATIN).\nDue to factors involved in the 2021 global supply chain crisis, tin prices almost doubled during 2020\u201321 and have had their largest annual rise in over 30 years. Global refined tin consumption dropped 1.6 percent in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global manufacturing industries.\nApplications.\nIn 2018, just under half of all tin produced was used in solder. The rest was divided between tin plating, tin chemicals, brass and bronze alloys, and niche uses.\nPigments.\nPigment Yellow 38, tin(IV) sulfide, is known as mosaic gold.\nPurple of Cassius, Pigment Red 109, a hydrous double stannate of gold, was mainly, in terms of painting, restricted to miniatures due to its high cost. It was widely used to make cranberry glass. It has also been used in the arts to stain porcelain.\nLead-tin yellow (which occurs in two yellow forms \u2014 a stannate and a silicate) was a pigment that was historically highly important for oil painting and which had some use in fresco in its silicate form. Lead stannate is also known in orange form but has not seen wide use in the fine arts. It is available for purchase in pigment form from specialist artists' suppliers. There is another minor form, in terms of artistic usage and availability, of lead-tin yellow known as Lead-tin Antimony Yellow.\nCerulean blue, a somewhat dull cyan chemically known as cobalt stannate, continues to be an important artists' pigment. Its hue is similar to that of Manganese blue, Pigment Blue 33, although it lacks that pigment's colorfulness and is more opaque. Artists typically must choose between cobalt stannate and manganese blue imitations made with phthalocyanine blue green shade (Pigment Blue 15:3), as industrial production of manganese blue pigment ceased in the 1970s. Cerulean blue made with cobalt stannate, however, was popular with artists prior to the production of Manganese blue.\nPigment Red 233, commonly known as Pinkcolor or Potter's Pink and more precisely known as Chrome Tin Pink Sphene, is a historically important pigment in watercolor. However, it has enjoyed a large resurgence in popularity due to Internet-based word-of-mouth. It is fully lightfast and chemically stable in both oil paints and watercolors. Other inorganic mixed metal complex pigments, produced via calcination, often feature tin as a constituent. These pigments are known for their lightfastness, weatherfastness, chemical stability, lack of toxicity, and opacity. Many are rather dull in terms of colorfulness. However, some possess enough colorfulness to be competitive for use cases that require more than a moderate amount of it. Some are prized for other qualities. For instance, Pinkcolor is chosen by many watercolorists for its strong granulation, even though its chroma is low. Recently, NTP Yellow (a pyrochlore) has been brought to market as a non-toxic replacement for lead(II) chromate with greater opacity, lightfastness, and weathering resistance than proposed organic lead chromate replacement pigments possess. NTP Yellow possesses the highest level of color saturation of these contemporary inorganic mixed metal complex pigments. More examples of this group include Pigment Yellow 158 (Tin Vanadium Yellow Cassiterite), Pigment Yellow 216 (Solaplex Yellow), Pigment Yellow 219 (Titanium Zinc Antimony Stannate), Pigment Orange 82 (Tin Titanium Zinc oxide, also known as Sicopal Orange), Pigment Red 121 (also known as Tin Violet and Chromium stannate), Pigment Red 230 (Chrome Alumina Pink Corundum), Pigment Red 236 (Chrome Tin Orchid Cassiterite), and Pigment Black 23 (Tin Antimony Grey Cassiterite). Another blue pigment with tin and cobalt is Pigment Blue 81, Cobalt Tin Alumina Blue Spinel.\nPigment White 15, tin(IV) oxide, is used for its iridescence, most commonly as a ceramic glaze. There are no green pigments that have been used by artists that have tin as a constituent and purplish pigments with tin are classified as red, according to the Colour Index International.\nSolder.\nTin has long been used in alloys with lead as solder, in amounts of 5 to 70% w/w. Tin with lead forms a eutectic mixture at the weight proportion of 61.9% tin and 38.1% lead (the atomic proportion: 73.9% tin and 26.1% lead), with melting temperature of 183\u00a0\u00b0C (361.4\u00a0\u00b0F). Such solders are primarily used for joining pipes or electric circuits. Since the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive came into effect on 1 July 2006, the lead content in such alloys has decreased. While lead exposure is associated with serious health problems, lead-free solder is not without its challenges, including a higher melting point, and the formation of tin whiskers that cause electrical problems. Tin pest can occur in lead-free solders, leading to loss of the soldered joint. Replacement alloys are being found, but the problems of joint integrity remain. A common lead-free alloy is 99% tin, 0.7% copper, and 0.3% silver, with melting temperature of 217\u00a0\u00b0C (422.6\u00a0\u00b0F).\nTin plating.\nTin bonds readily to iron and is used for coating lead, zinc, and steel to prevent corrosion. Tin-plated (or tinned) steel containers are widely used for food preservation, and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin. A tinplate canister for preserving food was first manufactured in London in 1812. Speakers of British English call such containers \"tins\", while speakers of U.S. English call them \"cans\" or \"tin cans\". One derivation of such use is the slang term \"tinnie\" or \"tinny\", meaning \"can of beer\" in Australia. The tin whistle is so called because it was mass-produced first in tin-plated steel.\nCopper cooking vessels such as saucepans and frying pans are frequently lined with a thin plating of tin, by electroplating or by traditional chemical methods, since use of copper cookware with acidic foods can be toxic.\nSpecialized alloys.\nTin in combination with other elements forms a wide variety of useful alloys. Tin is most commonly alloyed with copper. Pewter is 85\u201399% tin, and bearing metal has a high percentage of tin as well. Bronze is mostly copper with 12% tin, while the addition of phosphorus yields phosphor bronze. Bell metal is also a copper\u2013tin alloy, containing 22% tin. Tin has sometimes been used in coinage; it once formed a single-digit percentage (usually five percent or less) of American and Canadian pennies. \nThe niobium\u2013tin compound Nb3Sn is commercially used in coils of superconducting magnets for its high critical temperature (18\u00a0K) and critical magnetic field (25\u00a0T). A superconducting magnet weighing as little as two kilograms is capable of producing the magnetic field of a conventional electromagnet weighing tons.\nA small percentage of tin is added to zirconium alloys for the cladding of nuclear fuel.\nMost metal pipes in a pipe organ are of a tin/lead alloy, with 50/50 as the most common composition. The proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a desirable tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead phase solidifies first, then when the eutectic temperature is reached, the remaining liquid forms the layered tin/lead eutectic structure, which is shiny; contrast with the lead phase produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal. Major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance, workability, and resistance to corrosion.\nManufacturing of chemicals.\nTin compounds are used in the production of various chemicals, including stabilizers for PVC and catalysts for industrial processes. Tin in form of ingots provide the raw material necessary for these chemical reactions, ensuring consistent quality and performance. \nOptoelectronics.\nThe oxides of indium and tin are electrically conductive and transparent, and are used to make transparent electrically conducting films with applications in optoelectronics devices such as liquid crystal displays.\nOther applications.\nPunched tin-plated steel, also called pierced tin, is an artisan technique originating in central Europe for creating functional and decorative housewares. Decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety, based on local tradition and the artisan. Punched tin lanterns are the most common application of this artisan technique. The light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits. Lanterns and other punched tin articles were created in the New World from the earliest European settlement. A well-known example is the Revere lantern, named after Paul Revere.\nIn America, pie safes and food safes were in use in the days before refrigeration. These were wooden cupboards of various styles and sizes \u2013 either floor standing or hanging cupboards meant to discourage vermin and insects and to keep dust from perishable foodstuffs. These cabinets had tinplate inserts in the doors and sometimes in the sides, punched out by the homeowner, cabinetmaker, or a tinsmith in varying designs to allow for air circulation while excluding flies. Modern reproductions of these articles remain popular in North America.\nWindow glass is most often made by floating molten glass on molten tin (float glass), resulting in a flat and flawless surface. This is also called the \"Pilkington process\".\nTin is used as a negative electrode in advanced Li-ion batteries. Its application is somewhat limited by the fact that some tin surfaces catalyze decomposition of carbonate-based electrolytes used in Li-ion batteries.\nTin(II) fluoride is added to some dental care products as stannous fluoride (SnF2). Tin(II) fluoride can be mixed with calcium abrasives while the more common sodium fluoride gradually becomes biologically inactive in the presence of calcium compounds. It has also been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride in controlling gingivitis.\nTin is used as a target to create laser-induced plasmas that act as the light source for extreme ultraviolet lithography.\nOrganotin compounds.\nOrganotin compounds are organometallic compounds containing tin\u2013carbon bonds. Worldwide industrial production of organotin compounds likely exceeds 50,000 tonnes.\nPVC stabilizers.\nThe major commercial application of organotin compounds is in the stabilization of PVC plastics. In the absence of such stabilizers, PVC would rapidly degrade under heat, light, and atmospheric oxygen, resulting in discolored, brittle products. Tin scavenges labile chloride ions (Cl\u2212), which would otherwise strip HCl from the plastic material. Typical tin compounds are carboxylic acid derivatives of dibutyltin dichloride, such as dibutyltin dilaurate.\nBiocides.\nSome organotin compounds are relatively toxic, with both advantages and problems. They are used for biocidal properties as fungicides, pesticides, algaecides, wood preservatives, and antifouling agents. Tributyltin oxide is used as a wood preservative. Tributyltin is used for various industrial purposes such as slime control in paper mills and disinfection of circulating industrial cooling waters. Tributyltin was used as additive for ship paint to prevent growth of fouling organisms on ships, with use declining after organotin compounds were recognized as persistent organic pollutants with high toxicity for some marine organisms (the dog whelk, for example). The EU banned the use of organotin compounds in 2003, while concerns over the toxicity of these compounds to marine life and damage to the reproduction and growth of some marine species (some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter) have led to a worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization. Many nations now restrict the use of organotin compounds to vessels greater than long. The persistence of tributyltin in the aquatic environment is dependent upon the nature of the ecosystem. Because of this persistence and its use as an additive in ship paint, high concentrations of tributyltin have been found in marine sediments located near naval docks. Tributyltin has been used as a biomarker for imposex in neogastropods, with at least 82 known species. With the high levels of TBT in the local inshore areas, due to shipping activities, the shellfish had an adverse effect. Imposex is the imposition of male sexual characteristics on female specimens where they grow a penis and a pallial vas deferens. A high level of TBT can damage mammalian endocrine glands, reproductive and central nervous systems, bone structure and gastrointestinal tract. Tributyltin also affect mammals, Including sea otters, whales, dolphins, and humans.\nOrganic chemistry.\nSome tin reagents are useful in organic chemistry. In the largest application, stannous chloride is a common reducing agent for the conversion of nitro and oxime groups to amines. The Stille reaction couples organotin compounds with organic halides or pseudohalides.\nLi-ion batteries.\nTin forms several inter-metallic phases with lithium metal, making it a potentially attractive material for battery applications. Large volumetric expansion of tin upon alloying with lithium and instability of the tin-organic electrolyte interface at low electrochemical potentials are the greatest challenges to employment in commercial cells. Tin inter-metallic compound with cobalt and carbon was implemented by Sony in its Nexelion cells released in the late 2000s. The composition of the active material is approximately Sn0.3Co0.4C0.3. Research showed that only some crystalline facets of tetragonal (beta) Sn are responsible for undesirable electrochemical activity.\nPrecautions.\nCases of poisoning from tin metal, its oxides, and its salts are almost unknown. On the other hand, certain organotin compounds are almost as toxic as cyanide.\nExposure to tin in the workplace can occur by inhalation, skin contact, and eye contact. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set the permissible exposure limit for tin exposure in the workplace as 2\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) determined a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100\u00a0mg/m3, tin is immediately dangerous to life and health.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "30043", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30043", "title": "Tellurium", "text": "element with atomic number 52 (Te)\nTellurium is a chemical element; it has the symbol Te and atomic number 52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in its native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth.\nTellurium-bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin 'earth'. Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.\nCommercially, the primary use of tellurium is CdTe solar panels and thermoelectric devices. A more traditional application in copper (tellurium copper) and steel alloys, where tellurium improves machinability, also consumes a considerable portion of tellurium production.\nTellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nTellurium has two allotropes, crystalline and amorphous. When crystalline, tellurium is silvery-white with a metallic luster. The crystals are trigonal and chiral (space group 152 or 154 depending on the chirality), like the gray form of selenium. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is a black-brown powder prepared by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous acid or telluric acid (Te(OH)6). Tellurium is a semiconductor that shows greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on atomic alignment; the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light (photoconductivity). When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel. Of the chalcogens (oxygen-family elements), tellurium has the highest melting and boiling points, at , respectively.\nChemical properties.\nCrystalline tellurium consists of parallel helical chains of Te atoms, with three atoms per turn. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is not volatile.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Six of those isotopes, 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 124Te, 125Te, and 126Te, are stable. The other two, 128Te and 130Te, are slightly radioactive, with extremely long half-lives, including 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01024 years for 128Te. This is the longest known half-life among all radionuclides and is about 160 trillion (1012) times the age of the known universe. Electron capture decay should occur for 123Te, but is still unobserved.\nA further 31 artificial radioisotopes of tellurium are known, with atomic masses ranging from 104 to 142 and with half-lives up to 19.31 days for 121Te. Also, 17 nuclear isomers are known, with half-lives up to 164.7 days for the same isotope. Except for beryllium-8 and beta-delayed alpha emission branches in some lighter nuclides, tellurium (104Te to 109Te) is the lightest element with isotopes known to undergo alpha decay.\nThe atomic mass of tellurium () exceeds that of iodine (), the next element in the periodic table. Such inversions were thought by some to be paradoxical before atomic number was discovered.\nOccurrence.\nWith an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum (about 1\u00a0\u03bcg/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements. In comparison, even thulium \u2013 the rarest of the stable lanthanides \u2013 has crystal abundances of 500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (see Abundance of the chemical elements).\nThe rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance. Tellurium is more abundant than rubidium in the cosmos, though rubidium is 10,000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be caused by conditions during preaccretional sorting in the solar nebula, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of oxygen and water, was controlled by the reductive power of free hydrogen. Under this scenario, certain elements that form volatile hydrides, such as tellurium, were severely depleted through the evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process.\nTellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of gold such as calaverite and krennerite (two different polymorphs of AuTe2), petzite, Ag3AuTe2, and sylvanite, AgAuTe4. The town of Telluride, Colorado, was named in the hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found as a chemical compound, it is often combined with tellurium.\nAlthough tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by the oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.\nIn the gold rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie discarded a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and it was used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.\nIn 2023 astronomers detected the creation of tellurium during collision between two neutron stars.\nHistory.\nTellurium (Latin \"tellus\" meaning \"earth\") was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in Kleinschlatten (today Zlatna), near today's city of Alba Iulia, Romania. This ore was known as \"Faczebajer wei\u00dfes bl\u00e4ttriges Golderz\" (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Faceb\u00e1nya, now Fa\u021ba B\u0103ii in Alba County) or \"antimonalischer Goldkies\" (antimonic gold pyrite), and according to Anton von Rupprecht, was \"Spie\u00dfglask\u00f6nig\" (\"argent molybdique\"), containing native antimony. In 1782 Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, who was then serving as the Austrian chief inspector of mines in Transylvania, concluded that the ore did not contain antimony but was bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests, M\u00fcller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated, the new metal gives off a white smoke with a radish-like odor; that it imparts a red color to sulfuric acid; and that when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names \"aurum paradoxum\" (paradoxical gold) and \"metallum problematicum\" (problem metal), because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony.\nIn 1789, a Hungarian scientist, P\u00e1l Kitaibel, discovered the element independently in an ore from Deutsch-Pilsen that had been regarded as argentiferous molybdenite, but later he gave the credit to M\u00fcller. In 1798, it was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who had earlier isolated it from the mineral calaverite.\nIn the early 1920s, Thomas Midgley Jr. found tellurium prevented engine knocking when added to fuel, but ruled it out due to the difficult-to-eradicate smell. Midgley went on to discover and popularize the use of tetraethyl lead.\nThe 1960s brought an increase in thermoelectric applications for tellurium (as bismuth telluride), and in free-machining steel alloys, which became the dominant use. These applications were overtaken by the growing importance of CdTe in thin-film solar cells in the 2000s.\nProduction.\nMost Te (and Se) is obtained from porphyry copper deposits, where it occurs in trace amounts. The element is recovered from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of blister copper. It is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining of lead. Treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore yields approximately of tellurium.\nThe anode sludges contain the selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in compounds with the formula M2Se or M2Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500\u00a0\u00b0C the anode sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air. The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;M2Te + O2 + Na2CO3 \u2192 Na2TeO3 + 2 M + CO2\nTellurites can be leached from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydrotellurites HTeO3\u2212 in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, but they can be separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe metal is produced from the oxide (reduced) either by electrolysis or by reacting the tellurium dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCommercial-grade tellurium is usually marketed as 200-mesh powder but is also available as slabs, ingots, sticks, or lumps. The year-end price for tellurium in 2000 was US$30 per kilogram. In recent years, the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply, reaching as high as US$220 per pound in 2006. The average annual price for 99.99%-pure tellurium increased from $38 per kilogram in 2017 to $74 per kilogram in 2018. Despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production, the United States Department of Energy (DoE) anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by 2025.\nIn the 2020s, China produced ca. 50% of world's tellurium and was the only country that mined Te as the main target rather than a by-product. This dominance was driven by the rapid expansion of solar cell industry in China. In 2022, the largest Te providers by volume were China (340 tonnes), Russia (80 t), Japan (70 t), Canada (50 t), Uzbekistan (50 t), Sweden (40 t) and the United States (no official data).\nCompounds.\nTellurium belongs to the chalcogen (group 16) family of elements on the periodic table, which also includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and polonium: Tellurium and selenium compounds are similar. Tellurium exhibits the oxidation states \u22122, +2, +4 and +6, with +4 being most common.\nTellurides.\nReduction of Te metal produces the tellurides and polytellurides, Ten2\u2212. The \u22122 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals, such as zinc telluride, ZnTe, produced by heating tellurium with zinc. Decomposition of ZnTe with hydrochloric acid yields hydrogen telluride (H2Te), a highly unstable analogue of the other chalcogen hydrides, H2O, H2S and H2Se:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHalides.\nThe +2 oxidation state is exhibited by the dihalides, TeCl2, TeBr2 and TeI2. The dihalides have not been obtained in pure form, although they are known decomposition products of the tetrahalides in organic solvents, and the derived tetrahalotellurates are well-characterized:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere X is Cl, Br, or I. These anions are square planar in geometry. Polynuclear anionic species also exist, such as the dark brown TeI62\u2212, and the black TeI142\u2212.\nWith fluorine Te forms the mixed-valence Te2F4 and TeF6. In the +6 oxidation state, the \u2013OTeF5 structural group occurs in a number of compounds such as HOTeF5, B(OTeF5)3, Xe(OTeF5)2, Te(OTeF5)4 and Te(OTeF5)6. The square antiprismatic anion TeF82\u2212 is also attested. The other halogens do not form halides with tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but only tetrahalides (TeCl4, TeBr4 and TeI4) in the +4 state, and other lower halides (Te3Cl2, Te2Cl2, Te2Br2, Te2I and two forms of TeI). In the +4 oxidation state, halotellurate anions are known, such as TeCl62\u2212 and Te2Cl102\u2212. Halotellurium cations are also attested, including TeI3+, found in TeI3AsF6.\nOxocompounds.\nTellurium monoxide was first reported in 1883 as a black amorphous solid formed by the heat decomposition of TeSO3 in vacuum, disproportionating into tellurium dioxide, TeO2 and elemental tellurium upon heating. Since then, however, existence in the solid phase is doubted and in dispute, although it is known as a vapor fragment; the black solid may be merely an equimolar mixture of elemental tellurium and tellurium dioxide.\nTellurium dioxide is formed by heating tellurium in air, where it burns with a blue flame. Tellurium trioxide, \u03b2-TeO3, is obtained by thermal decomposition of Te(OH)6. The other two forms of trioxide reported in the literature, the \u03b1- and \u03b3- forms, were found not to be true oxides of tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but a mixture of Te4+, OH- and O2-. Tellurium also exhibits mixed-valence oxides, Te2O5 and Te4O9.\nThe tellurium oxides and hydrated oxides form a series of acids, including tellurous acid (H2TeO3), orthotelluric acid (Te(OH)6) and metatelluric acid ((H2TeO4)\"n\"). The two forms of telluric acid form \"tellurate\" salts containing the TeO and TeO anions, respectively. Tellurous acid forms \"tellurite\" salts containing the anion TeO.\nZintl cations.\nWhen tellurium is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, the result is a red solution of the Zintl ion, Te42+. The oxidation of tellurium by AsF5 in liquid SO2 produces the same square planar cation, in addition to the trigonal prismatic, yellow-orange Te64+:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther tellurium Zintl cations include the polymeric Te72+ and the blue-black Te82+, consisting of two fused 5-membered tellurium rings. The latter cation is formed by the reaction of tellurium with tungsten hexachloride:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInterchalcogen cations also exist, such as Te2Se62+ (distorted cubic geometry) and Te2Se82+. These are formed by oxidizing mixtures of tellurium and selenium with AsF5 or SbF5.\nOrganotellurium compounds.\nTellurium does not readily form analogues of alcohols and thiols, with the functional group \u2013TeH, that are called tellurols. The \u2013TeH functional group is also attributed using the prefix \"tellanyl-\". Like H2Te, these species are unstable with respect to loss of hydrogen. Telluraethers (R\u2013Te\u2013R) are more stable, as are telluroxides.\nTritelluride quantum materials.\nRecently, physicists and materials scientists have been discovering unusual quantum properties associated with layered compounds composed of tellurium that's combined with certain rare-earth elements, as well as yttrium (Y).\nThese novel materials have the general formula of \"R\" Te3, where \"\"R\" \" represents a rare-earth lanthanide (or Y), with the full family consisting of \"R\" = Y, lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), and thulium (Tm). Compounds containing promethium (Pm), europium (Eu), ytterbium (Yb), and lutetium (Lu) have not yet been observed. These materials have a two-dimensional character within an orthorhombic crystal structure, with slabs of \"R\" Te separated by sheets of pure tellurium.\nIt is thought that this 2-D layered structure is what leads to a number of interesting quantum features, such as charge-density waves, high carrier mobility, superconductivity under specific conditions, and other peculiar properties whose natures are only now emerging.\nFor example, in 2022, a small group of physicists at Boston College in Massachusetts led an international team that used optical methods to demonstrate a novel axial mode of a Higgs-like particle in \"R\" Te3 compounds that incorporate either of two rare-earth elements (\"R\" =\u2009La, Gd). This long-hypothesized, axial, Higgs-like particle also shows magnetic properties and may serve as a candidate for dark matter.\nApplications.\nIn 2022, the major applications of tellurium were thin-film solar cells (40%), thermoelectrics (30%), metallurgy (15%), and rubber (5%), with the first two applications experiencing a rapid increase owing to the worldwide tendency of reducing dependence on the fossil fuel. In metallurgy, tellurium is added to iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. It improves the machinability of copper without reducing its high electrical conductivity. It increases resistance to vibration and fatigue of lead and stabilizes various carbides and in malleable iron.\nHeterogeneous catalysis.\nTellurium oxides are components of commercial oxidation catalysts. Te-containing catalysts are used for the ammoxidation route to acrylonitrile (CH2=CH\u2013C\u2261N):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;2\u00a0CH3\u2212CH\nCH2 + 2\u00a0NH3 + 3\u00a0O2 \u2192 2\u00a0CH2\nCH\u2013C\u2261N + 6\u00a0H2O\nRelated catalysts are used in the production of tetramethylene glycol:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;CH3CH2CH2CH3 + O2 \u2192 HOCH2CH2CH2CH2OH\nSemiconductor and electronic.\nCadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels exhibit some of the greatest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators.\nIn 2018, China installed thin-film solar panels with a total power output of 175 GW, more than any other country in the world; most of those panels were made of CdTe. In June 2022, China set goals of generating 25% of energy consumption and installing 1.2 billion kilowatts of capacity for wind and solar power by 2030. This proposal will increase the demand for tellurium and its production worldwide, especially in China, where the annual volumes of Te refining increased from 280 tonnes in 2017 to 340 tonnes in 2022.\n is an efficient material for detecting X-rays. It is being used in the NASA space-based X-ray telescope NuSTAR.\nMercury cadmium telluride is a semiconductor material that is used in thermal imaging devices.\nOrganotellurium compounds.\nOrganotellurium compounds are mainly of interest in the research context. Several have been examined such as precursors for metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. These precursor compounds include dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride, and methyl allyl telluride. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is the preferred precursor for low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.\nTellurium suboxide is used in the media layer of rewritable optical discs, including ReWritable Compact Discs (CD-RW), ReWritable Digital Video Discs (DVD-RW), and ReWritable Blu-ray Discs.\nTellurium is used in the phase change memory chips developed by Intel. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) and lead telluride are working elements of thermoelectric devices. Lead telluride exhibits promise in far-infrared detectors.\nPhotocathodes.\nTellurium shows up in a number of photocathodes used in solar blind photomultiplier tubes and for high brightness photoinjectors driving modern particle accelerators. The photocathode Cs-Te, which is predominantly Cs2Te, has a photoemission threshold of 3.5 eV and exhibits the uncommon combination of high quantum efficiency (&gt;10%) and high durability in poor vacuum environments (lasting for months under use in RF electron guns). This has made it the go to choice for photoemission electron guns used in driving free electron lasers. In this application, it is usually driven at the wavelength 267\u00a0nm which is the third harmonic of commonly used Ti-sapphire lasers. More Te containing photocathodes have been grown using other alkali metals such as rubidium, potassium, and sodium, but they have not found the same popularity that Cs-Te has enjoyed.\nThermoelectric material.\nTellurium itself can be used as a high-performance elemental thermoelectric material. A trigonal Te with the space group of P3121 can transfer into a topological insulator phase, which is suitable for thermoelectric material. Though often not considered as a thermoelectric material alone, polycrystalline tellurium does show great thermoelectric performance with the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, as high as 1.0, which is even higher than some of other conventional TE materials like SiGe and BiSb.\nTelluride, which is a compound form of tellurium, is a more common TE material. Typical and ongoing research includes Bi2Te3, and La3\u2212xTe4, etc. Bi2Te3 is widely used from energy conversion to sensing to cooling due to its great TE properties. The BiTe-based TE material can achieve a conversion efficiency of 8%, an average zT value of 1.05 for p-type and 0.84 for n-type bismuth telluride alloys. Lanthanum telluride can be potentially used in deep space as a thermoelectric generator due to the huge temperature difference in space. The zT value reaches to a maximum of ~1.0 for a La3\u2212xTe4 system with x near 0.2. This composition also allows other chemical substitution which may enhance the TE performance. The addition of Yb, for example, may increase the zT value from 1.0 to 1.2 at 1275K, which is greater than the current SiGe power system.\nBiological role.\nTellurium has no known biological function, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" and \"Gayadomonas\" sp, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for a major part of the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.\nTellurite agar is used to identify members of the corynebacterium genus, most typically \"Corynebacterium diphtheriae\", the pathogen responsible for diphtheria.\nPrecautions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nTellurium and tellurium compounds are considered to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic, but it may be fatal if inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through skin.\nHumans exposed to as little as 0.01\u00a0mg/m3 or less in air exude a foul garlic-like odor known as \"tellurium breath\".\nThis is caused by the body converting tellurium from any oxidation state to dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a volatile compound with a pungent garlic-like smell. Volunteers given 15\u00a0mg of tellurium still had this characteristic smell on their breath eight months later. In laboratories, this odor makes it possible to discern which scientists are responsible for tellurium chemistry, and even which books they have handled in the past. Even though the metabolic pathways of tellurium are not known, it is generally assumed that they resemble those of the more extensively studied selenium because the final methylated metabolic products of the two elements are similar.\nPeople can be exposed to tellurium in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits (permissible exposure limit) tellurium exposure in the workplace to 0.1\u00a0mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL) at 0.1\u00a0mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In concentrations of 25\u00a0mg/m3, tellurium is immediately dangerous to life and health.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30044", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30044", "title": "Thorium", "text": "element with atomic number 90 (Th)\nThorium is a chemical element; it has symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium is a weakly radioactive light silver metal which tarnishes olive grey when it is exposed to air, forming thorium dioxide; it is moderately soft, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.\nAll known thorium isotopes are unstable. The most stable isotope, 232Th, has a half-life of 14.0\u00a0billion years, or about the age of the universe; it decays very slowly via alpha decay, starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb. On Earth, thorium and uranium are the only elements with no stable or nearly-stable isotopes that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements. Thorium is estimated to be over three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth elements.\nThorium was discovered in 1828 by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius during his analysis of a new mineral found by Morten Thrane Esmark on Lovoya near Brevik in the Langesund fjord. He named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder and war. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactive properties.\nThorium is still used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions. It was also material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, used in some broadcast vacuum tubes, and as the light source in gas mantles, but these uses have become marginal. It has been suggested as a replacement for uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, and several thorium reactors have been built. Thorium is also used in strengthening magnesium, coating tungsten wire in electrical and welding equipment, controlling the grain size of tungsten in electric lamps, high-temperature crucibles, and glasses including camera and scientific instrument lenses. Other uses for thorium include heat-resistant ceramics, aircraft engines, and in light bulbs. Ocean science has used 231Pa/230Th isotope ratios to understand the ancient ocean.\nBulk properties.\nThorium is a moderately soft, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal that can be bent or shaped. In the periodic table, it lies to the right of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms, one at high temperature (over 1360\u00a0\u00b0C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100\u00a0GPa; body-centred tetragonal).\nThorium metal has a bulk modulus (a measure of resistance to compression of a material) of 54\u00a0GPa, about the same as tin's (58.2\u00a0GPa). Aluminium's is 75.2\u00a0GPa; copper's is 137.8\u00a0GPa; and mild steel's is 160\u2013169\u00a0GPa. Thorium is about as hard as soft steel, so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire.\nThorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium and is harder than both. Thorium has a magnetic susceptibility of 0.412 \u00d7 4\u03c0 \u00d7 at room temperature. This susceptibility is mostly temperature-independent, however impurities and dopants can affect this value. It becomes superconductive below 1.4\u00a0K. Thorium's melting point of 1750\u00a0\u00b0C is above both those of actinium (1227\u00a0\u00b0C) and protactinium (1568\u00a0\u00b0C). At the start of period 7, from francium to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), because the number of delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to plutonium, where the number of f-electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6: this trend is due to the increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium metal is a non-integer due to a 5f\u20136d overlap.) Among the actinides up to californium, which can be studied in at least milligram quantities, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; only actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788\u00a0\u00b0C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points.\nThe properties of thorium vary widely depending on the degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually thorium dioxide (); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a per cent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5\u00a0and\u00a011.66\u00a0g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7\u00a0g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1\u00a0g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4\u00a0g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.\nThorium can form alloys with many other metals. Addition of small proportions of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium, and thorium\u2013aluminium alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms eutectic mixtures with chromium and uranium, and it is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium.\nIsotopes.\nThere are seven naturally occurring isotopes of thorium but none are stable.\n232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature; its half-life is 14.0\u00a0billion\u00a0years, about three times the age of the Earth, and slightly longer than the age of the universe, and longest of all nuclides heavier than bismuth. Its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear subshell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with atomic weight . It is one of only four radioactive elements (along with bismuth, protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for a standard atomic weight to be determined.\nThorium nuclei are susceptible to alpha decay because the strong nuclear force cannot overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons. The alpha decay of 232Th initiates the 4\"n\" decay chain, or thorium series, which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4. This chain of consecutive alpha and beta decays begins with the decay of 232Th to 228Ra and terminates at 208Pb. Any sample of thorium or its compounds contains traces of these daughters, which are isotopes of thallium, lead, bismuth, polonium, radon, radium, and actinium. Natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides, such as 212Pb, which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy. 227Th (alpha emitter, 18.693 days half-life) can also be used in cancer treatments such as targeted alpha therapies. 232Th also very occasionally undergoes spontaneous fission rather than alpha decay, but at a much lower rate than uranium-238 and all natural fission products and evidence come predominantly from it. Its partial half-life for this process is very long at over 1021\u00a0years.\nIn total, 32 radioisotopes have been characterised, which range in mass number from 207 to 238. After 232Th, the most stable of them (with respective half-lives) are 230Th (75,400\u00a0years), 229Th (7,916\u00a0years), 228Th (1.91\u00a0years), 234Th (24.11\u00a0days), and 227Th (18.693\u00a0days). All of these isotopes occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains of 232Th, 235U, 238U, and 237Np: the last of these is long extinct in nature due to its short half-life (2.14\u00a0million\u00a0years), but is continually produced in minute traces from neutron capture in uranium ores. 233Th (half-life 22\u00a0minutes) occurs naturally as the result of neutron activation of natural 232Th.\nIn deep seawaters the isotope 230Th constitutes up to of total thorium. This is because its parent uranium is generally soluble in the ocean, but 232Th is nearly insoluble and is precipitated; thus the isotopes continually produced from uranium is relatively enriched. For this reason International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013; it had formerly been considered a mononuclidic element.\nThorium has a nuclear isomer, 229mTh, having the lowest known excitation energy of any isomer, measured to be . This is so low that when it undergoes isomeric transition, the emitted gamma radiation is in the ultraviolet range. The nuclear transition from 229Th to 229mTh is being investigated for a nuclear clock.\nDifferent isotopes of thorium are chemically identical, but have slightly differing physical properties: for example, the densities of pure 228Th, 229Th, 230Th, and 232Th are respectively expected to be 11.5, 11.6, 11.6, and 11.7\u00a0g/cm3. The isotope 229Th is fissionable and the bare critical mass of estimated at 2839\u00a0kg, although with steel reflectors this value would drop to 994\u00a0kg. 232Th is not fissionable, but it is fertile as it can be converted to fissile 233U by neutron capture and subsequent beta decay.\nRadiometric dating.\nTwo radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium\u2013thorium dating, based on the decay of 234U to 230Th, and ionium\u2013thorium dating, which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238U. Uranium\u2013thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of 235U into 231Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium\u2013thorium dating. Uranium\u2013thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium\u2013thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both 232Th and 230Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230Th to 232Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer. The two methods are largely complementary as uranium-thorium assumes the sample contained only uranium originally; ionium-thorium, that it contained only thorium.\nChemistry.\nA thorium atom has 90 electrons, of which four are valence electrons. Four atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, 7s, and 7p. The 7p orbitals are not occupied in the ground state of thorium, however, due to being greatly destabilized. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous [Rn]6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. This is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger near the bottom of the periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin\u2013orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium results in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, in which +4 is also the highest possible state, but +3 plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium complexes in the trivalent and divalent oxidation states are known, however. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its ionization energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series, from actinium to americium.\nDespite the anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. A hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the [Rn]6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium is metallurgically a true actinide.\nTetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow, like those of silver or lead, as the ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.\nReactivity.\nThorium is a highly reactive and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of \u22121.90\u00a0V for the /Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.\nAt standard temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, with the exception of hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small quantity of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation by the nitrate can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.\nInorganic compounds.\nMost binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may be prepared by heating the elements together. In air, thorium burns to form , which has the fluorite structure. Thorium dioxide is a refractory material, with the highest melting point (3390\u00a0\u00b0C) of any known oxide. It is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases; it dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride.\nWhen heated in air, thorium dioxide emits intense blue light; the light becomes white when is mixed with its lighter homologue cerium dioxide (, ceria): this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles. A flame is not necessary for this effect: in 1901, it was discovered that a hot Welsbach gas mantle (using with 1% ) remained at \"full glow\" when exposed to a cold unignited mixture of flammable gas and air. The light emitted by thorium dioxide is higher in wavelength than the blackbody emission expected from incandescence at the same temperature, an effect called candoluminescence. It occurs because : Ce acts as a catalyst for the recombination of free radicals that appear in high concentration in a flame, whose deexcitation releases large amounts of energy. The addition of 1% cerium dioxide, as in gas mantles, heightens the effect by increasing emissivity in the visible region of the spectrum; but because cerium, unlike thorium, can occur in multiple oxidation states, its charge and hence visible emissivity will depend on the region on the flame it is found in (as such regions vary in their chemical composition and hence how oxidising or reducing they are).\nSeveral binary thorium chalcogenides and oxychalcogenides are also known with sulfur, selenium, and tellurium.\nAll four thorium tetrahalides are known, as are some low-valent bromides and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure like those of zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the ions are coordinated with ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides (black) and (gold-coloured) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid, forms the complex anion (hexafluorothorate(IV)), which precipitates as an insoluble salt, (potassium hexafluorothorate(IV)).\nThorium borides, carbides, silicides, and nitrides are refractory materials, like those of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels. All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides and , the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5\u20138\u00a0K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.\nCoordination compounds.\nIn an acidic aqueous solution, thorium occurs as the tetrapositive aqua ion , which has tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry: at pH\u00a0&lt;\u00a03, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation. The ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95\u00a0and\u00a01.14\u00a0\u00c5. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than ), predominantly to in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.\nHigh coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size. Thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride (first prepared in the Manhattan Project) has coordination number 14. These thorium salts are known for their high solubility in water and polar organic solvents.\nMany other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, such as the perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, and their hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but most of them have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much more stable. In natural thorium-containing waters, organic thorium complexes usually occur in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes, even when the concentrations of inorganic ligands are much greater than those of organic ligands.\nIn January 2021, the aromaticity has been observed in a large metal cluster anion consisting of 12 bismuth atoms stabilised by a center thorium cation. This compound was shown to be surprisingly stable, unlike many previous known aromatic metal clusters.\nOrganothorium compounds.\nMost of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the cyclopentadienyl complexes and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms a cyclooctatetraenide complex: the yellow , thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with . It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190\u00a0\u00b0C. Half sandwich compounds are also known, such as , which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.\nThe simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are and : many derivatives are known. The former (which has two forms, one purple and one green) is a rare example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state; a formal +2 oxidation state occurs in a derivative. The chloride derivative is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with limiting used (other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used). The alkyl and aryl derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have been used to study the nature of the Th\u2013C sigma bond.\nOther organothorium compounds are not well-studied. Tetraallylthorium, , is known, but its structures has not been determined. The molecular structure of tetrabenzylthorium, , without ancillary ligands has been reported. They decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion , heptamethylthorate(IV), which forms the salt (tmeda = ). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th\u2013C distance 257.1\u00a0pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th\u2013C distances 265.5\u2013276.5\u00a0pm), they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, , is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.\nOccurrence.\nFormation.\n232Th is a primordial nuclide formed in the r-process, which probably occurs in supernovae and neutron star mergers. These violent events scattered it across the galaxy. The letter \"r\" stands for \"rapid neutron capture\", and occurs in core-collapse supernovae, where heavy seed nuclei such as 56Fe rapidly capture neutrons, running up against the neutron drip line, as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability. Neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased Coulomb barriers that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond 56Fe is endothermic. Because of the abrupt loss of stability past 209Bi, the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create thorium and uranium; all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements.\nAbundance.\nIn the universe, thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements at rank 77th in cosmic abundance because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process (the other being uranium), and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals, as well as uranium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.\nIn the Earth's crust, thorium is much more abundant: with an abundance of 8.1\u00a0g/tonne, it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13\u00a0g/tonne) and more abundant than tin (2.1\u00a0g/tonne). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a lithophile under the Goldschmidt classification, meaning that it is generally found combined with oxygen. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the refractory elements have the same relative abundances in the Earth as in the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.\nOn Earth.\nNatural thorium is usually almost pure 232Th, which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) Its decay accounts for a gradual decrease of thorium content of the Earth: the planet currently has around 80% of the amount present at the formation of the Earth. The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.\nThorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals, and was for this reason previously thought to be rare. In fact, it is the 37th most abundant element in the Earth's crust with an abundance of 12 parts per million. In nature, thorium occurs in the +4 oxidation state, together with uranium(IV), zirconium(IV), hafnium(IV), and cerium(IV), and also with scandium, yttrium, and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar ionic radii. Because of thorium's radioactivity, minerals containing it are often metamict (amorphous), their crystal structure having been damaged by the alpha radiation produced by thorium. An extreme example is ekanite, , which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to the thorium it contains.\nMonazite (chiefly phosphates of various rare-earth elements) is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide, principally in India, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and Malaysia and is mined for its rare earth content. It contains around 2.5% thorium on average, although some deposits may contain up to 20%. Monazite is a chemically unreactive mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand; its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it. Allanite (chiefly silicates-hydroxides of various metals) can have 0.1\u20132% thorium and zircon (chiefly zirconium silicate, ) up to 0.4% thorium.\nThorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral thorianite. Due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide, these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the content. Thorite (chiefly thorium silicate, ), also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered. In thorium silicate minerals, the and ions are often replaced with (where M = Sc, Y, or Ln) and phosphate () ions respectively. Because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide, thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released. The ion is soluble, especially in acidic soils, and in such conditions the thorium concentration can be higher.\nHistory.\nErroneous report.\nIn 1815, the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius analysed an unusual sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in Falun, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces of a white mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (oxide in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but he had made a public mistake once, announcing a new element, \"gahnium\", that turned out to be zinc oxide. Berzelius privately named the putative element \"thorium\" in 1817 and its supposed oxide \"thorina\" after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in Vest-Agder, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral (later named xenotime) proved to be mostly yttrium orthophosphate.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on L\u00f8v\u00f8ya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist who studied the minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania (today called Oslo). The elder Esmark determined that it was not a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing (potassium pentafluorothorate(IV)) with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.\nBerzelius made some initial characterisations of the new metal and its chemical compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium\u2013oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated for the first time in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.\nInitial chemical classification.\nIn the periodic table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which also contained the modern carbon group (group 14) and titanium group (group 4), because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.\nFirst uses.\nWhile thorium was discovered in 1828 its first application dates only from 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. Many applications were subsequently found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.\nRadioactivity.\nThorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It was the second element that was found to be radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Starting from 1899, the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford and the American electrical engineer Robert Bowie Owens studied the radiation from thorium; initial observations showed that it varied significantly. It was determined that these variations came from a short-lived gaseous daughter of thorium, which they found to be a new element. This element is now named radon, the only one of the rare radioelements to be discovered in nature as a daughter of thorium rather than uranium.\nAfter accounting for the contribution of radon, Rutherford, now working with the British physicist Frederick Soddy, showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements in work dating from 1900 to 1903. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to the disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. 10,000 individuals in the United States had been injected with thorium during X-ray diagnosis; they were later found to suffer health issues such as leukaemia and abnormal chromosomes. Public interest in radioactivity had declined by the end of the 1930s.\nFurther classification.\nUp to the late 19th century, chemists unanimously agreed that thorium and uranium were the heaviest members of group 4 and group 6 respectively; the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one-off fluke. In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements, considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements, like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals. The existence of a second inner transition series, in the form of the actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established; Bohr suggested that the filling of the 5f orbitals may be delayed to after uranium.\nIt was only with the discovery of the first transuranic elements, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he proposed the actinide concept, realising that thorium was the second member of an f-block actinide series analogous to the lanthanides, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium in a fourth d-block row.\nPhasing out.\nIn the 1990s, most applications that do not depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium gas mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, but this was not the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some even falsely claiming them to be non-radioactive.\nNuclear power.\nThorium has been used as a power source on a prototype scale. The earliest thorium-based reactor was built at the Indian Point Energy Center located in Buchanan, New York, United States in 1962. China may be the first to have attempted to commercialise the technology. The country with the largest estimated reserves of thorium in the world is India, which has sparse reserves of uranium. In the 1950s, India targeted achieving energy independence with their three-stage nuclear power programme. In most countries, uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was slow; in the 20th century, three reactors were built in India and twelve elsewhere. Large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency to study the use of thorium reactors; a year later, the United States Department of Energy started their research. Alvin Radkowsky of Tel Aviv University in Israel was the head designer of Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, the first American civilian reactor to breed thorium. He founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other laboratories: Raytheon Nuclear Inc. and Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States, and the Kurchatov Institute in Russia.\nIn the 21st century, thorium's potential for reducing nuclear proliferation and its waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle. India has projected meeting as much as 30% of its electrical demands through thorium-based nuclear power by 2050. In February 2014, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), in Mumbai, India, presented their latest design for a \"next-generation nuclear reactor\" that burns thorium as its fuel core, calling it the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). In 2009, the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission said that India has a \"long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources.\"\nOn 16 June 2023 China's National Nuclear Safety Administration issued a licence to the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to begin operating the TMSR-LF1, 2 MWt liquid fuel thorium-based molten salt experimental reactor which was completed in August 2021. China is believed to have one of the largest thorium reserves in the world. The exact size of those reserves has not been publicly disclosed, but it is estimated to be enough to meet the country's total energy needs for more than 20,000 years.\nNuclear weapons.\nWhen gram quantities of plutonium were first produced in the Manhattan Project, it was discovered that a minor isotope (240Pu) underwent significant spontaneous fission, which brought into question the viability of a plutonium-fuelled gun-type nuclear weapon. While the Los Alamos team began work on the implosion-type weapon to circumvent this issue, the Chicago team discussed reactor design solutions. Eugene Wigner proposed to use the 240Pu-contaminated plutonium to drive the conversion of thorium into 233U in a special converter reactor. It was hypothesized that the 233U would then be usable in a gun-type weapon, though concerns about contamination from 232U were voiced. Progress on the implosion weapon was sufficient, and this converter was not developed further, but the design had enormous influence on the development of nuclear energy. It was the first detailed description of a highly enriched water-cooled, water-moderated reactor similar to future naval and commercial power reactors.\nIn 1943 the Manhattan Project contracted two private companies, Union Carbide and Chevron, to quietly compile a survey of uranium and thorium deposits around the world. The primary focus was uranium but early in the process thorium was also included. Deposits of monazite sands where identified in Brazil, Netherlands East Indies, and Travancore in India but none of these were pursued by the project.\nDuring the Cold War the United States explored the possibility of using 232Th as a source of 233U to be used in a nuclear bomb and it fired a test bomb in 1955. It concluded that a 233U-fired bomb would be a very potent weapon, but it bore few sustainable \"technical advantages\" over the contemporary uranium\u2013plutonium bombs, especially since 233U is difficult to produce in isotopically pure form.\nThorium metal was used in the radiation case of at least one nuclear weapon design deployed by the United States (the W71).\nProduction.\nThe low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of production of other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor. In 2014, world production of the monazite concentrate, from which thorium would be extracted, was 2,700 tonnes.\nThe common production route of thorium constitutes concentration of thorium minerals; extraction of thorium from the concentrate; purification of thorium; and (optionally) conversion to compounds, such as thorium dioxide.\nConcentration.\nThere are two categories of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies with the type of deposit.\nFor the primary deposits, the source pegmatites, which are usually obtained by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, with a series of magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.\nIndustrial production in the 20th century relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.\nAcid digestion.\nAcid digestion is a two-stage process, involving the use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210\u2013230\u00a0\u00b0C. First, sulfuric acid in excess of 60% of the sand mass is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300\u00a0\u00b0C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot be added to the acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200\u00a0\u00b0C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70\u00a0\u00b0C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH\u00a01.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH\u00a02.\nAlkaline digestion.\nAlkaline digestion is carried out in 30\u201345% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140\u00a0\u00b0C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads to the formation of poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45\u00a0\u03bcm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60\u00a0\u00b0C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are dissolved at 80\u00a0\u00b0C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH\u00a05.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.\nPurification.\nHigh thorium concentrations are needed in nuclear applications. In particular, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections must be very low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of are used. For example, following alkaline digestion and the removal of phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.\nModern applications.\nNon-radioactivity-related uses of thorium have been in decline since the 1950s due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products.\nMost thorium applications use its dioxide (sometimes called \"thoria\" in the industry), rather than the metal. This compound has a melting point of 3300\u00a0\u00b0C (6000\u00a0\u00b0F), the highest of all known oxides; only a few substances have higher melting points. This helps the compound remain solid in a flame, and it considerably increases the brightness of the flame; this is the main reason thorium is used in gas lamp mantles. All substances emit energy (glow) at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the visible spectrum, hence the brightness of thorium mantles.\nEnergy, some of it in the form of visible light, is emitted when thorium is exposed to a source of energy itself, such as a cathode ray, heat, or ultraviolet light. This effect is shared by cerium dioxide, which converts ultraviolet light into visible light more efficiently, but thorium dioxide gives a higher flame temperature, emitting less infrared light. Thorium in mantles, though still common, has been progressively replaced with yttrium since the late 1990s. According to the 2005 review by the United Kingdom's National Radiological Protection Board, \"although [thoriated gas mantles] were widely available a few years ago, they are not any more.\" Thorium is also used to make cheap permanent negative ion generators, such as in pseudoscientific health bracelets.\nDuring the production of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is significantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduces the work function of electrons; as a result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Thorium forms a one-atom-thick layer on the surface of tungsten. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers.The reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen required the introduction of an evaporated magnesium layer as a getter for impurities in the evacuated tubes, giving them their characteristic metallic inner coating. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.\nThorium dioxide is found in refractory ceramics, such as high-temperature laboratory crucibles, either as the primary ingredient or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this has been replaced by an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.\nWhen added to glass, thorium dioxide helps increase its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and it degrades film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced in this application by rare-earth oxides, such as lanthanum, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.\nThorium tetrafluoride is used as an anti-reflection material in multilayered optical coatings. It is transparent to electromagnetic waves having wavelengths in the range of 0.350\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm, a range that includes near ultraviolet, visible and mid infrared light. Its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material. Replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the 2010s, which include Lanthanum trifluoride.\nMag-Thor alloys (also called thoriated magnesium) found use in some aerospace applications, though such uses have been phased out due to concerns over radioactivity.\nPotential use for nuclear energy.\nThe main nuclear power source in a reactor is the neutron-induced fission of a nuclide; the synthetic fissile nuclei 233U and 239Pu can be bred from neutron capture by the naturally occurring quantity nuclides 232Th and 238U. 235U occurs naturally in significant amounts and is also fissile. In the thorium fuel cycle, the fertile isotope 232Th is bombarded by slow neutrons, undergoing neutron capture to become 233Th, which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first 233Pa and then the fissile 233U:\n &lt;chem&gt;{^{232}_{90}Th} -&gt;[\\text{(n,}\\gamma\\text{)}] {^{233}_{90}Th}-&gt;[\\beta^-][\\text{21.8 min}] {^{233}_{91}Pa} -&gt;[\\beta^-][\\text{27 days}] {^{233}_{92}U} \\ (-&gt;[\\alpha][1.60 \\times 10^5\\text{years}]) &lt;/chem&gt;\n233U is fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel in the same way as 235U or 239Pu. When 233U undergoes nuclear fission, the neutrons emitted can strike further 232Th nuclei, continuing the cycle. This parallels the uranium fuel cycle in fast breeder reactors where 238U undergoes neutron capture to become 239U, beta decaying to first 239Np and then fissile 239Pu.\nThe fission of U produces 2.48 neutrons on average.\nOne neutron is needed to keep the fission reaction going. For a self-contained continuous breeding cycle, one more neutron is needed to breed a new U atom from the fertile Th. This leaves a margin of 0.45 neutrons (or 18% of the neutron flux) for losses.\nAdvantages.\nThorium is more abundant than uranium, and could satisfy world energy demands for longer. It is particularly suitable for being used as fertile material in molten salt reactors.\n232Th absorbs neutrons more readily than 238U, and 233U has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0%) than 235U (85.5%) or 239Pu (73.5%). It also releases more neutrons upon fission on average. A single neutron capture by 238U produces transuranic waste along with the fissile 239Pu, but 232Th only produces this waste after five captures, forming 237Np. This number of captures does not happen for 98\u201399% of the 232Th nuclei because the intermediate products 233U or 235U undergo fission, and fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide fuels to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.\nThorium fuels result in a safer and better-performing reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, and a lower coefficient of thermal expansion. It is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, because the latter oxidises to triuranium octoxide (), becoming substantially less dense.\nDisadvantages.\nThe used fuel is difficult and dangerous to reprocess because many of the daughters of 232Th and 233U are strong gamma emitters. All 233U production methods result in impurities of 232U, either from parasitic knock-out (n,2n) reactions on 232Th, 233Pa, or 233U that result in the loss of a neutron, or from double neutron capture of 230Th, an impurity in natural 232Th:\nTh + n \u2192 Th + \u03b3 \"\u03b2\"\u2212\u219225.5 h Pa ( \"\u03b1\"\u21923.28 \u00d7 10 y Ac )\nPa + n \u2192 Pa + \u03b3 \"\u03b2\"\u2212\u21921.3 d U \"\u03b1\"\u219269 y\n232U by itself is not particularly harmful, but quickly decays to produce the strong gamma emitter 208Tl. (232Th follows the same decay chain, but its much longer half-life means that the quantities of 208Tl produced are negligible.) These impurities of 232U make 233U easy to detect and dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of nuclear proliferation using 233U as the fissile material. 233Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27\u00a0days and a high cross section for neutron capture. Thus it is a neutron poison: instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233U, a significant amount of 233Pa converts to 234U and consumes neutrons, degrading the reactor efficiency. To avoid this, 233Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors during their operation, so that it does not have a chance to capture a neutron and will only decay to 233U.\nThe irradiation of 232Th with neutrons, followed by its processing, need to be mastered before these advantages can be realised, and this requires more advanced technology than the uranium and plutonium fuel cycle; research continues in this area. Others cite the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle: the international Nuclear Energy Agency predicts that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance\u2014a situation which may persist \"in the coming decades\". The isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are mostly not transuranic, but some of them are still very dangerous, such as 231Pa, which has a half-life of 32,760\u00a0years and is a major contributor to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.\nHazards and health effects.\nRadiological.\nNatural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, such as those in gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Internal exposure to thorium leads to increased risk of liver diseases.\nThe decay products of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products are created as the result of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2\u00a0millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.\nSome nuclear safety agencies make recommendations about the use of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their manufacture and disposal; the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem, but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.\nBiological.\nThorium is odourless and tasteless. The chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out before entering the body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially in the presence of strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If a thorium-containing object has been chewed or sucked, it loses 0.4% of thorium and 90% of its dangerous daughters to the body. Three-quarters of the thorium that has penetrated the body accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.\nTests on the thorium uptake of workers involved in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no adverse effects on health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves. Thorium has no known biological role.\nChemical.\nPowdered thorium metal is pyrophoric: it ignites spontaneously in air. In 1964, the United States Department of the Interior listed thorium as \"severe\" on a table entitled \"Ignition and explosibility of metal powders\". Its ignition temperature was given as 270\u00a0\u00b0C (520\u00a0\u00b0F) for dust clouds and 280\u00a0\u00b0C (535\u00a0\u00b0F) for layers. Its minimum explosive concentration was listed as 0.075\u00a0oz/cu ft (0.075\u00a0kg/m3); the minimum igniting energy for (non-submicron) dust was listed as 5\u00a0mJ.\nIn 1956, the Sylvania Electric Products explosion occurred during reprocessing and burning of thorium sludge in New York City, United States. Nine people were injured; one died of complications caused by third-degree burns.\nExposure routes.\nThorium exists in very small quantities everywhere on Earth although larger amounts exist in certain parts: the average human contains about 40\u00a0micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes with food and water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.\nExposure is raised for people who live near thorium deposits or radioactive waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, and for those who work in gas mantle production. Thorium is especially common in the Tamil Nadu coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average. It is also common in northern Brazilian coastal areas, from south Bahia to Guarapari, a city with radioactive monazite sand beaches, with radiation levels up to 50 times higher than world average background radiation.\nAnother possible source of exposure is thorium dust produced at weapons testing ranges, as thorium is used in the guidance systems of some missiles. This has been blamed for a high incidence of birth defects and cancer at Salto di Quirra on the Italian island of Sardinia.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a silvery-white, rare earth metal that is malleable and ductile. The ninth member of the lanthanide series, terbium is a fairly electropositive metal that reacts with water, evolving hydrogen gas. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite.\nSwedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium as a chemical element in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide (). Yttrium and terbium, as well as erbium and ytterbium, are named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques.\nTerbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells that operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of Terfenol-D (an alloy that expands and contracts when exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy), terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems and in sensors. Terbium is considered non-hazardous, though its biological role and toxicity have not been researched in depth.\nMost of the world's terbium supply is used in green phosphors. Terbium oxide is used in fluorescent lamps and television and monitor cathode-ray tubes (CRTs). Terbium green phosphors are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide trichromatic lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used in indoor lighting.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nTerbium is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is relatively stable in air compared to the more reactive lanthanides in the first half of the lanthanide series. Terbium exists in two crystal allotropes with a transformation temperature of 1289\u00a0\u00b0C between them. The 65 electrons of a terbium atom are arranged in the electron configuration [Xe]4f96s2. The eleven 4f and 6s electrons are valence. Only three electrons can be removed before the nuclear charge becomes too great to allow further ionization, but in the case of terbium, the stability of the half-filled [Xe]4f7 configuration allows further ionization of a fourth electron in the presence of very strong oxidizing agents such as fluorine gas.\nThe terbium(III) cation (Tb3+) is brilliantly fluorescent, in a bright lemon-yellow color that is the result of a strong green emission line in combination with other lines in the orange and red. The yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite owes its creamy-yellow fluorescence in part to terbium. Terbium easily oxidizes, and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research. Single terbium atoms have been isolated by implanting them into fullerene molecules. Trivalent europium (Eu3+) and Tb3+ ions are among the lanthanide ions that have garnered the most attention because of their strong luminosity and great color purity.\nTerbium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below 219\u00a0K. Above 219\u00a0K, it turns into a helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered paramagnetic state at 230\u00a0K.\nChemical properties.\nTerbium metal is an electropositive element and oxidizes in the presence of most acids (such as sulfuric acid), all of the halogens, and water.\n\nTerbium oxidizes readily in air to form a mixed terbium(III,IV) oxide:\nThe most common oxidation state of terbium is +3 (trivalent), such as in TbCl3. In the solid state, tetravalent terbium is also known, in compounds such as terbium oxide () and terbium tetrafluoride. In solution, terbium typically forms trivalent species, but can be oxidized to the tetravalent state with ozone in highly basic aqueous conditions.\nThe coordination and organometallic chemistry of terbium is similar to other lanthanides. In aqueous conditions, terbium can be coordinated by nine water molecules, which are arranged in a tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry. Complexes of terbium with lower coordination number are also known, typically with bulky ligands like bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, which forms the three-coordinate tris[N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)amide]terbium(III) () complex.\nMost coordination and organometallic complexes contain terbium in the trivalent oxidation state. Divalent Tb2+ complexes are also known, usually with bulky cyclopentadienyl-type ligands. A few coordination compounds containing terbium in its tetravalent state are also known.\nOxidation states.\nLike most rare-earth elements and lanthanides, terbium is usually found in the +3 oxidation state. Like cerium and praseodymium, terbium can also form a +4 oxidation state, although it is unstable in water. It is possible for terbium to be found in the 0, +1, and +2 oxidation states.\nCompounds.\nTerbium combines with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming various binary compounds such as , , , , , , , , , and . In these compounds, terbium mainly exhibits the oxidation state +3, with the +2 state appearing rarely. Terbium(II) halides are obtained by annealing terbium(III) halides in presence of metallic terbium in tantalum containers. Terbium also forms the sesquichloride , which can be further reduced to terbium(I) chloride () by annealing at 800\u00a0\u00b0C; this compound forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure.\nTerbium(IV) fluoride () is the only halide that tetravalent terbium can form. It has strong oxidizing properties and is a strong fluorinating agent, emitting relatively pure atomic fluorine when heated, rather than the mixture of fluoride vapors emitted from cobalt(III) fluoride or cerium(IV) fluoride. It can be obtained by reacting terbium(III) chloride or terbium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas at 320\u00a0\u00b0C:\n 2 TbF3 + F2 \u2192 2 TbF4\nWhen and caesium fluoride (CsF) is mixed in a stoichiometric ratio in a fluorine gas atmosphere, caesium pentafluoroterbate () is obtained. It is an orthorhombic crystal with space group \"Cmca\" and a layered structure composed of [TbF8]4\u2212 and 11-coordinated Cs+. The compound barium hexafluoroterbate (), an orthorhombic crystal with space group \"Cmma\", can be prepared in a similar method. The terbium fluoride ion [TbF8]4\u2212 also exists in the structure of potassium terbium fluoride crystals.\nTerbium(III) oxide or terbia is the main oxide of terbium, and appears as a dark brown water-insoluble solid. It is slightly hygroscopic and is the main terbium compound found in rare earth-containing minerals and clays.\nOther compounds include: \nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring terbium is composed of its only stable isotope, terbium-159; the element is thus mononuclidic and monoisotopic. Thirty-nine radioisotopes have been characterized from 135Tb to 174Tb. The most stable synthetic radioisotopes of terbium are 158Tb, with a half-life of 180 years, and 157Tb, with a half-life of 71 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than three months, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a minute. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 159Tb, is electron capture, which results in production of gadolinium isotopes, and the primary mode after is beta minus decay, resulting in dysprosium isotopes.\nThe element also has 31 nuclear isomers, with masses of 141\u2013154, 156, 158, 162, and 164\u2013168 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are terbium-156m2, with a half-life of 24.4 hours, and terbium-154m2, with a half-life of 22.7 hours; this is more stable than ground states of terbium isotopes, except outside the mass range 155\u2013161.\nTerbium-149, with its half-life of 4.1 hours, is a promising candidate in targeted alpha therapy and positron emission tomography.\nHistory.\nSwedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, , then known as yttria. Yttrium, erbium, and terbium are all named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques.\nMosander first separated yttria into three fractions, all named for the ore: yttria, erbia, and terbia. \"Terbia\" was originally the fraction that contained the pink color, due to the element now known as erbium. \"Erbia\", the oxide containing what is now known as terbium, originally was the fraction that was yellow or dark orange in solution. The insoluble oxide of this element was noted to be tinged brown, and soluble oxides after combustion were noted to be colorless. Until the advent of spectral analysis, arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed. Spectral analysis by Marc Delafontaine allowed the separate elements and their oxides to be identified, but in his publications, the names of erbium and terbium were switched, following a brief period where terbium was renamed \"mosandrum\", after Mosander. The names have remained switched ever since.\nThe early years of preparing terbium (as terbium oxide) were difficult. Metal oxides from gadolinite and samarskite were dissolved in nitric acid, and the solution was further separated using oxalic acid and potassium sulfate. There was great difficulty in separating erbia from terbia; in 1881, it was noted that there was no satisfactory method to separate the two. By 1914, different solvents had been used to separate terbium from its host minerals, but the process of separating terbium from its neighbor elements - gadolinium and dysprosium - was described as \"tedious\" but possible. Modern terbium extraction methods are based on the liquid\u2013liquid extraction process developed by Werner Fischer et al., in 1937.\nOccurrence.\nTerbium occurs with other rare earth elements in many minerals, including monazite ( with up to 0.03% terbium), xenotime () and euxenite ( with 1% or more terbium). The crust abundance of terbium is estimated as 1.2\u00a0mg/kg. No terbium-dominant mineral has yet been found.\nTerbium (as the species Tb II) has been detected in the atmosphere of KELT-9b, a hot-Jupiter planet outside the Solar System.\nCurrently, the richest commercial sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption clays of southern China; the concentrates with about two-thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about 1% terbia. Small amounts of terbium occur in bastn\u00e4site and monazite; when these are processed by solvent extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides as samarium-europium-gadolinium concentrate, terbium is recovered therein. Due to the large volumes of bastn\u00e4site processed relative to the ion-adsorption clays, a significant proportion of the world's terbium supply comes from bastn\u00e4site.\nIn 2018, a rich terbium supply was discovered off the coast of Japan's Minamitori Island, with the stated supply being \"enough to meet the global demand for 420 years\".\nProduction.\nCrushed terbium-containing minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3\u20134. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. The solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are decomposed to oxides by heating. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in . Terbium is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization.\nThe most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agents. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal. Calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting, distillation, amalgam formation or zone melting.\nIn 2020, the annual demand for terbium was estimated at . Terbium is not distinguished from other rare earths in the United States Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries, which in 2024 estimated the global reserves of rare earth minerals at .\nApplications.\nTerbium is used as a dopant in calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate, and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures, together with zirconium dioxide ().\nTerbium is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices. As a component of Terfenol-D, terbium is used in actuators, in naval sonar systems, sensors, and other magnetomechanical devices. Terfenol-D is a terbium alloy that expands or contracts in the presence of a magnetic field. It has the highest magnetostriction of any alloy. It is used to increase verdet constant in long-distance fiber optic communication. Terbium-doped garnets are also used in optical isolators, which prevents reflected light from traveling back along the optical fiber.\nTerbium oxides are used in green phosphors in fluorescent lamps, color TV tubes, and flat screen monitors. Terbium, along with all other lanthanides except lanthanum and lutetium, is luminescent in the 3+ oxidation state. The brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry, where it somewhat resembles calcium in its behavior. Terbium \"green\" phosphors (which fluoresce a brilliant lemon-yellow) are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide trichromatic lighting, which is by far the largest consumer of the world's terbium supply. Trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does incandescent lighting.\nIn 2023, terbium compounds were used to create a lattice with a single iron atom that was then examined by synchrotron x-ray beam. This was the first successful attempt to characterize a single atom at sub-atomic levels.\nSafety.\nTerbium, along with many of the other rare earth elements, is poorly studied in terms of its toxicology and environmental impacts. Few health-based guidance values for safe exposure to terbium are available. No values are established in the United States by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists at which terbium exposure becomes hazardous, and it is not considered a hazardous substance under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. \nReviews of the toxicity of the rare earth elements place terbium and its compounds as \"of low to moderately toxicity\", remarking on the lack of detailed studies on their hazards and the lack of market demand forestalling evidence of toxicity.\nSome studies demonstrate environmental accumulation of terbium as hazardous to fish and plants. High exposures of terbium may enhance the toxicity of other substances causing endocytosis in plant cells.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its atomic number is 74. It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, melting at . It also has the highest boiling point, at . Its density is 19.254\u00a0g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work into metal. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.\nTungsten occurs in many alloys, which have numerous applications, including incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes, electrodes in gas tungsten arc welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density make it suitable for military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are often used as industrial catalysts. Its largest use is in tungsten carbide, a wear-resistant material used in metalworking, mining, and construction. About 50% of tungsten is used in tungsten carbide, with the remaining major use being alloys and steels: less than 10% is used in other compounds.\nTungsten is the only metal in the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules, being found in a few species of bacteria and archaea. However, tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to most forms of animal life.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nIn its raw form, tungsten is a hard steel-grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work. Purified, monocrystalline tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding, but it is more commonly formed by sintering. Sintering is often used due to the very high melting point of tungsten.\nOf all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above ), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Moreover, tungsten's most stable crystal phase does not exhibit any high-pressure-induced structural transformations for pressures up to at least 364 gigapascals. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.\nAlloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness.\nTungsten exists in two major crystalline forms: \u03b1 and \u03b2. The former has a body-centered cubic structure and is the more stable form. The structure of the \u03b2 phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the \u03b1 phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the \u03b1 phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the \u03b2 form exhibits a columnar habit. The \u03b1 phase has one third of the electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the \u03b2 phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1\u20134 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring tungsten consists of four stable isotopes (182W, 183W, 184W, and 186W) and one very long-lived radioisotope, 180W. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so, with a half-life of years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W per gram of natural tungsten per year. This rate is equivalent to a specific activity of roughly 63 micro-becquerel per kilogram. This rate of decay is orders of magnitude lower than that observed in carbon or potassium as found on earth, which likewise contain small amounts of long-lived radioactive isotopes. Bismuth was long thought to be non-radioactive, but 209Bi (its longest lived isotope) actually decays with a half-life of years or about a factor 10 slower than 180W. However, due to naturally occurring bismuth being 100% 209Bi, its specific activity is actually higher than that of natural tungsten at 3 milli-becquerel per kilogram. The other naturally occurring isotopes of tungsten have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least .\nAnother 34 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2\u00a0days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1\u00a0days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4\u00a0days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6\u00a0days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3\u00a0hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8\u00a0minutes. Tungsten also has 12\u00a0meta states, with the most stable being 179mW (\"t\"1/2\u00a06.4\u00a0minutes).\nChemical properties.\nTungsten is a mostly non-reactive element: it does not react with water, is immune to attack by most acids and bases, and does not react with oxygen or air at room temperature. At elevated temperatures (i.e., when red-hot) it reacts with oxygen to form the trioxide compound tungsten(VI), WO3. It will, however, react directly with fluorine (F2) at room temperature to form tungsten(VI) fluoride (WF6), a colorless gas. At around 250\u00a0\u00b0C it will react with chlorine or bromine, and under certain hot conditions will react with iodine. Finely divided tungsten is pyrophoric.\nThe most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is +6, but it exhibits all oxidation states from \u22122 to +6. Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide, WO3, which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions, WO42-.\nTungsten carbides (W2C and WC) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon. W2C is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride (WCl6).\nIn aqueous solution, tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions. As tungstate is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, metastable \"paratungstate A\" anion, WO, which over time converts to the less soluble \"paratungstate B\" anion, HWO. Further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion, HWO, after which equilibrium is reached. The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-oxygen octahedra known as the Keggin anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids, such as phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40.\nTungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These are known as \"bronzes\"; an example is sodium tungsten bronze.\nIn gaseous form, tungsten forms the diatomic species W2. These molecules feature a sextuple bond between tungsten atoms \u2014 the highest known bond order among stable atoms.\nHistory.\nIn 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time called tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, Jos\u00e9 and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element (they called it \"wolfram\" or \"volfram\").\nThe strategic value of tungsten came to notice in the early 20th century. British authorities acted in 1912 to free the Carrock mine from the German owned Cumbrian Mining Company and, during World War I, restrict German access elsewhere. In World War II, tungsten played a more significant role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira. Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry, both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself, e.g., in tungsten carbide cutting tools for machining steel.\nNow tungsten is used in many more applications such as aircraft and motorsport ballast weights, darts, anti-vibration tooling, and sporting equipment.\nTungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings. In 1928, a US court rejected General Electric's attempt to patent it, overturning https:// granted in 1913 to William D. Coolidge.\nIt is suggested that remnants of wolfram have been found in what may have been the garden of the astronomer and alchemist Tycho Brahe.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"tungsten\" (which means 'heavy stone' in Swedish and was the old Swedish name for the mineral scheelite and other minerals of similar density) is used in English, French, and many other languages as the name of the element, but \"wolfram\" (or \"volfram\") is used in most European (especially Germanic and Slavic) languages and is derived from the mineral wolframite, which is the origin of the chemical symbol W. The name \"wolframite\" is derived from German ('wolf soot, wolf cream'), the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747. This, in turn, derives from Latin , the name Georg Agricola used for the mineral in 1546, which translates into English as 'wolf's froth' and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction, as though the mineral devoured it like a wolf. This naming follows a tradition of colorful names miners from the Ore Mountains would give various minerals, out of a superstition that certain ones that looked as if they contained then-known valuable metals but when extracted were somehow \"hexed\". Cobalt (cf. Kobold), pitchblende (cf. German for 'to blind, to deceive') and nickel (cf. \"Old Nick\") derive their names from the same miners' idiom.\nOccurrence.\nTungsten has thus far not been found in nature in its pure form. Instead, tungsten is found mainly in the minerals wolframite and scheelite. Wolframite is iron\u2013manganese tungstate , a solid solution of the two minerals ferberite (FeWO4) and h\u00fcbnerite (MnWO4), while scheelite is calcium tungstate (CaWO4). Other tungsten minerals range in their level of abundance from moderate to very rare, and have almost no economic value.\nChemical compounds.\nTungsten forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from \u22122 to +6. Higher oxidation states, always as oxides, are relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with metal clusters, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with CO complexes. The chemistries of tungsten and molybdenum show strong similarities to each other, as well as contrasts with their lighter congener, chromium. The relative rarity of tungsten(III), for example, contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3). Tungsten(VI) oxide is soluble in aqueous base, forming tungstate (WO42\u2212). This oxyanion condenses at lower pH values, forming polyoxotungstates.\nThe broad range of oxidation states of tungsten is reflected in its various chlorides:\nOrganotungsten compounds are numerous and also span a range of oxidation states. Notable examples include the trigonal prismatic and octahedral .\nProduction.\nReserves.\nThe world's reserves of tungsten are 3,200,000 tonnes; they are mostly located in China (1,800,000 t), Canada (290,000 t), Russia (160,000 t), Vietnam (95,000 t) and Bolivia. As of 2017, China, Vietnam and Russia are the leading suppliers with 79,000, 7,200 and 3,100 tonnes, respectively. Canada had ceased production in late 2015 due to the closure of its sole tungsten mine. Meanwhile, Vietnam had significantly increased its output in the 2010s, owing to the major optimization of its domestic refining operations, and overtook Russia and Bolivia.\nChina remains the world's leader not only in production, but also in export and consumption of tungsten products. Tungsten production is gradually increasing outside China because of the rising demand. Meanwhile, its supply by China is strictly regulated by the Chinese Government, which fights illegal mining and excessive pollution originating from mining and refining processes.\nThere is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of Dartmoor in the United Kingdom, which was exploited during World War I and World War II as the Hemerdon Mine. Following increases in tungsten prices, this mine was reactivated in 2014, but ceased activities in 2018.\nWithin the EU, the Austrian Felbertal scheelite deposit is one of the few producing tungsten mines. Portugal is one of Europe's main tungsten producers, with 121 kt of contained tungsten in mineral concentrates from 1910 to 2020, accounting for roughly 3.3% of the global production.\nTungsten is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nSouth Korea's Sangdong mine, one of the world's largest tungsten mines with 7,890,000 tonnes of high-grade tungsten reportedly buried, was closed in 1994 due to low profitability but has since re-registered mining rights and is scheduled to resume activities in 2024.\nExtraction.\nTungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages. The ore is eventually converted to tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3), which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten. Because of tungsten's high melting point, it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots. Instead, powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals, and sintered. During the sintering process, the nickel diffuses into the tungsten, producing an alloy.\nTungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of WF6:\nWF6 + 3 H2 \u2192 W + 6 HF\nor pyrolytic decomposition:\nWF6 \u2192 W + 3 F2 (\u0394\"H\"r = +)\nTungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the London Metal Exchange. The tungsten industry often uses independent pricing references such as Argus Media or Metal Bulletin as a basis for contracts. The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO3.\nApplications.\nApproximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials \u2013 namely tungsten carbide \u2013 with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels. Less than 10% is used in other chemical compounds. Because of the high ductile-brittle transition temperature of tungsten, its products are conventionally manufactured through powder metallurgy, spark plasma sintering, chemical vapor deposition, hot isostatic pressing, and thermoplastic routes. A more flexible manufacturing alternative is selective laser melting, which is a form of 3D printing and allows creating complex three-dimensional shapes.\nIndustrial.\nTungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide (WC), one of the hardest carbides. WC is an efficient electrical conductor, but W2C is less so. WC is used to make wear-resistant abrasives, and \"carbide\" cutting tools such as knives, drills, circular saws, dies, milling and turning tools used by the metalworking, woodworking, mining, petroleum and construction industries. Carbide tooling is actually a ceramic/metal composite, where metallic cobalt acts as a binding (matrix) material to hold the WC particles in place. This type of industrial use accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption.\nThe jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide/metal composites, and also metallic tungsten. WC/metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished. Sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal, but it is a ceramic. Because of tungsten carbide's hardness, rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant, and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten. Tungsten carbide rings are brittle, however, and may crack under a sharp blow.\nAlloys.\nThe hardness and heat resistance of tungsten can contribute to useful alloys. A good example is high-speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten. Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile. Tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding. Superalloys containing tungsten, such as Hastelloy and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings.\nTungsten's heat resistance makes it useful in arc welding applications when combined with another highly-conductive metal such as silver or copper. The silver or copper provides the necessary conductivity and the tungsten allows the welding rod to withstand the high temperatures of the arc welding environment.\nPermanent magnets.\nQuenched (martensitic) tungsten steel (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high remanence and coercivity, as noted by John Hopkinson (1849\u20131898) as early as 1886. The magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure. For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but iron is), when it is present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the martensite phase, which has greater ferromagnetism than the ferrite (iron) phase due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion.\nMilitary.\nTungsten, usually alloyed with nickel, iron, or cobalt to form heavy alloys, is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium, in applications where uranium's radioactivity is problematic even in depleted form, or where uranium's additional pyrophoric properties are not desired (for example, in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor). Similarly, tungsten alloys have also been used in shells, grenades, and missiles, to create supersonic shrapnel. Germany used tungsten during World War II to produce shells for anti-tank gun designs using the Gerlich squeeze bore principle to achieve very high muzzle velocity and enhanced armor penetration from comparatively small caliber and light weight field artillery. The weapons were highly effective but a shortage of tungsten used in the shell core, caused in part by the Wolfram Crisis, limited their use.\nTungsten has also been used in dense inert metal explosives, which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius.\nChemical applications.\nTungsten(IV) sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization. MoS2 is more commonly used for such applications.\nTungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium/magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting. Crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine. Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries.\nTungsten oxide (WO3) is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts found in coal-fired power plants. These catalysts convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) using ammonia (NH3). The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life. Tungsten containing catalysts are promising for epoxidation, oxidation, and hydrogenolysis reactions. Tungsten heteropoly acids are key component of multifunctional catalysts. Tungstates can be used as photocatalyst, while the tungsten sulfide as electrocatalyst.\nNiche uses.\nApplications requiring its high density include weights, counterweights, ballast keels for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, rotor weights for civil and military helicopters, and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One. Being slightly less than twice the density, tungsten is seen as an alternative (albeit more expensive) to lead fishing sinkers. Depleted uranium is also used for these purposes, due to similarly high density. Seventy-five-kg blocks of tungsten were used as \"cruise balance mass devices\" on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. It is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting, where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for artificial flies (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Tungsten is also used as a heavy bolt to lower the rate of fire of the SWD M11/9 sub-machine gun from 1300 RPM to 700 RPM. Some string instrument strings incorporates tungsten. Tungsten is used as an absorber on the electron telescope on the Cosmic Ray System of the two Voyager spacecraft.\nGold substitution.\nIts density, similar to that of gold, allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum. Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic, and is harder than gold alloys (though not as hard as tungsten carbide), making it useful for rings that will resist scratching, especially in designs with a brushed finish.\nBecause the density is so similar to that of gold (tungsten is only 0.36% less dense), and its price of the order of one-thousandth, tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars, such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold, which has been observed since the 1980s, or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods. The densities are not exactly the same, and other properties of gold and tungsten differ, but gold-plated tungsten will pass superficial tests.\nGold-plated tungsten is available commercially from China (the main source of tungsten), both in jewelry and as bars.\nElectronics.\nBecause it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point, elemental tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications, such as incandescent light bulb, cathode-ray tube, and vacuum tube filaments, heating elements, and rocket engine nozzles. Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high-temperature uses such as electrical, heating, and welding applications, notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process (also called tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding).\nBecause of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness, tungsten is also used in electrodes, and in the emitter tips in electron-beam instruments that use field emission guns, such as electron microscopes. In electronics, tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits, between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors. It is used in metallic films, which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten (or molybdenum) on silicon.\nThe electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for X-ray targets, and also for shielding from high-energy radiations (such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of FDG). It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made, due to its excellent shielding properties. Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites, which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets, shot, and radiation shields. Since this element's thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass, it is used for making glass-to-metal seals. In addition to its high melting point, when tungsten is doped with potassium, it leads to an increased shape stability (compared with non-doped tungsten). This ensures that the filament does not sag, and no undesired changes occur.\nTungsten is used in producing vibration motors, also known as mobile vibrators. These motors are integral components that provide tactile feedback to users, alerting them to incoming calls, messages, and notifications. Tungsten's high density, hardness, and wear resistance property helps to endure the high-speed rotational vibrations these motors generate.\nNanowires.\nThrough top-down nanofabrication processes, tungsten nanowires have been fabricated and studied since 2002. Due to a particularly high surface to volume ratio, the formation of a surface oxide layer and the single crystal nature of such material, the mechanical properties differ fundamentally from those of bulk tungsten. Such tungsten nanowires have potential applications in nanoelectronics and importantly as pH probes and gas sensors. In similarity to silicon nanowires, tungsten nanowires are frequently produced from a bulk tungsten precursor followed by a thermal oxidation step to control morphology in terms of length and aspect ratio. Using the Deal\u2013Grove model it is possible to predict the oxidation kinetics of nanowires fabricated through such thermal oxidation processing.\nFusion power.\nDue to its high melting point and good erosion resistance, tungsten is a lead candidate for the most exposed sections of the plasma-facing inner wall of nuclear fusion reactors. Tungsten, as a plasma-facing component material, features exceptionally low tritium retention through co-deposition and implantation, which enhances safety by minimizing radioactive inventory, improves fuel efficiency by making more fuel available for fusion reactions, and supports operational continuity by reducing the need for frequent fuel removal from surfaces. It will be used as the plasma-facing material of the divertor in the ITER reactor, and is currently in use in the JET test reactor.\nBiological role.\nTungsten, at atomic number \"Z\" = 74, is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional. It is used by some bacteria and archaea, but not in eukaryotes. For example, enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten-pterin complex with molybdopterin (molybdopterin, despite its name, does not contain molybdenum, but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms). Tungsten-using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes. The tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations. The first tungsten-requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium, and in this case the tungsten-selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum-sulfur pairing of some molybdopterin-requiring enzymes. One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten (bacterial formate dehydrogenase H) is known to use a selenium-molybdenum version of molybdopterin. Acetylene hydratase is an unusual metalloenzyme in that it catalyzes a hydration reaction. Two reaction mechanisms have been proposed, in one of which there is a direct interaction between the tungsten atom and the C\u2261C triple bond. Although a tungsten-containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten-molydopterin and also non-protein bound selenium, a tungsten-selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described.\nIn soil, tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion. It can be selectively or non-selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes. Its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive. The soil's chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes; alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates; acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates.\nSodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms. Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic, but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability.\nTungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist, in a role similar to the action of molybdenum. It has been found that tetrathiotungstate salts may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals, similar to the tetrathiomolybdates.\nIn archaea.\nTungsten is essential for some archaea. The following tungsten-utilizing enzymes are known:\nA \"wtp\" system is known to selectively transport tungsten in archaea:\nHealth factors.\nBecause tungsten is a rare metal and its compounds are generally inert, the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited. The abundance of tungsten in the Earth's crust is thought to be about 1.5 parts per million. It is the 58th most abundant element found on Earth.\nIt was at first believed to be relatively inert and an only slightly toxic metal, but beginning in the year 2000, the risk presented by tungsten alloys, its dusts and particulates to induce cancer and several other adverse effects in animals as well as humans has been highlighted from in vitro and in vivo experiments.\nThe median lethal dose LD50 depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between 59\u00a0mg/kg (intravenous, rabbits) and 5000\u00a0mg/kg (tungsten metal powder, intraperitoneal, rats).\nPeople can be exposed to tungsten in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10\u00a0mg/m3.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30047", "revid": "855858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30047", "title": "Thulium", "text": "element with atomic number 69 (Tm)\nThulium is a chemical element; it has symbol Tm and atomic number 69. It is the thirteenth element in the lanthanide series of metals. It is the second-least abundant lanthanide in the Earth's crust, after radioactively unstable promethium. It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as a dopant in solid-state lasers. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic. Artificial radioactive isotopes of thulium are used as radiation sources in some portable X-ray devices.\nIn 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve separated two previously unknown components, which he called holmia and thulia, from the rare-earth mineral erbia; these were the oxides of holmium and thulium, respectively. His example of thulium oxide contained impurities of ytterbium oxide. A relatively pure sample of thulium oxide was first obtained in 1911. The metal itself was first obtained in 1936 by Wilhelm Klemm and Heinrich Bommer.\nLike the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules.\nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nPure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on exposure to air. The metal can be cut with a knife, as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56K, and paramagnetic above 56K.\nThulium has two major allotropes: the tetragonal \u03b1-Tm and the more stable hexagonal \u03b2-Tm.\nChemical properties.\nThulium tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150\u00b0C to form thulium(III) oxide:\nThulium dust can cause explosions and fires.\nThulium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form thulium hydroxide:\nThulium reacts with all the halogens. Reactions are slow at room temperature, but are vigorous above 200\u00b0C:\n (white)\n (yellow)\n (white)\n (yellow)\nThulium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the pale green Tm(III) ions, which exist as complexes:\nThulium reacts with various metallic and non-metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds, including , , , , , , , , , and . Like most lanthanides, the +3 state is most common and is the only state observed in thulium solutions. Thulium exists as a ion in solution. In this state, the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water. ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence. Because it occurs late in the series, the +2 oxidation state can also exist, stabilized by the nearly full 4f electron shell, but occurs only in solids.\nThulium's only known oxide is . This oxide is sometimes called \"thulia\". Reddish-purple thulium(II) compounds can be made by the reduction of thulium(III) compounds. Examples of thulium(II) compounds include the halides (except the fluoride). Some hydrated thulium compounds, such as and are green or greenish-white. Thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with water. This reaction results in hydrogen gas and exhibiting a fading reddish color. Combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides.\nThulium reacts with hydrogen chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride. With nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate, .\nIsotopes.\nNatural thulium consists of the single stable isotope thulium-169 (it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium-165 with a very long half-life.). Known isotopes of thulium range from to .\nThe primary decay mode before the stable isotope, , is electron capture to erbium isotopes, and the primary mode after is beta emission to ytterbium isotopes. The longest-lived radioisotopes are thulium-171, which has a half-life of 1.92 years, and thulium-170, which has a half-life of 128.6 days. Most other isotopes have half-lives under 10 minutes.\nHistory.\nThulium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements. This was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements. Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia (). Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after Thule, an Ancient Greek place name associated with Scandinavia or Iceland. Thulium's atomic symbol was initially Tu, but later changed to Tm.\nThulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham, USA. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.\nHigh-purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in the late 1950s, as a result of the adoption of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash &amp; Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was the second highest for the lanthanides behind lutetium.\nOccurrence.\nThe element is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. Like many other lanthanides, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Thulium has not been found in prevalence over the other rare earths in any mineral yet. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5\u00a0mg/kg by weight.\nThulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the Solar System, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1\u00a0part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. In 2001, the total world reserves of thulium were approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on Earth except for the radioactive promethium.\nProduction.\nThulium is principally extracted from monazite ores (~0.007% thulium) found in river sands, through ion exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where about two-thirds of the total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity).\nThe metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. In 2001, approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide were produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.\nApplications.\nLasers.\nHolmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (, or ) is an active laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2080\u00a0nm in the infrared and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate at 2010\u00a0nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.\nX-ray source.\nDespite its high cost, portable X-ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded with neutrons in a nuclear reactor to produce the isotope thulium-170, having a half-life of 128.6 days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity (at 7.4, 51.354, 52.389, 59.4 and 84.253\u00a0keV). These radioactive sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection\u00a0\u2013 only a small cup of lead.\nThey are among the most popular radiation sources for use in industrial radiography.\nThulium-170 is gaining popularity as an X-ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy (sealed source radiation therapy).\nOthers.\nThulium has been used in high-temperature superconductors similarly to yttrium. Thulium potentially has use in ferrites, ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment. Thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum, in this case, its green emission lines, which are not covered by other elements. Because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light, thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting.\nThe blue fluorescence of Tm-doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation. Tm-doped halides in which Tm is in its 2+ oxidation state are luminescent materials that are proposed for electric power generating windows based on the principle of a luminescent solar concentrator.\nBiological role.\nSoluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble thulium salts are completely nontoxic. When injected, thulium can cause degeneration of the liver and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice. Despite this, thulium has a low level of toxicity.\nIn humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys, and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry matter of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium metal has low to moderate toxicity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after Tantalus, a figure in Greek mythology. Tantalum is a very hard, ductile, lustrous, blue-gray transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as components of strong high-melting-point alloys. It is a group 5 element, along with vanadium and niobium, and it always occurs in geologic sources together with the chemically similar niobium, mainly in the mineral groups tantalite, columbite, and coltan. \nThe chemical inertness and very high melting point of tantalum make it valuable for laboratory and industrial equipment such as reaction vessels and vacuum furnaces. It is used in tantalum capacitors for electronic equipment such as computers. It is being investigated for use as a material for high-quality superconducting resonators in quantum processors.\nHistory.\nTantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg, in two mineral samples \u2013 one from Sweden and the other from Finland. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered columbium (now niobium). In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides of columbium and tantalum, columbite and tantalite. Although the two oxides had different measured densities of 5.918\u00a0g/cm3 and 7.935\u00a0g/cm3, he concluded that they were identical and kept the name tantalum. After Friedrich W\u00f6hler confirmed these results, it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element \"pelopium\" was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett.\nThe differences between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called \"ilmenium\" until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.\nThe name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally \"tantalized\" him. (If he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.) Anders Ekeberg wrote \"This metal I call \"tantalum\" ... partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated.\"\nFor decades, the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, a process that was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nTantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity. The metal is highly resistant to corrosion by acids: at temperatures below 150\u00a0\u00b0C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, as well as with molten potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017\u00a0\u00b0C (boiling point 5458\u00a0\u00b0C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium, and osmium for metals, and carbon.\nTantalum exists in two crystalline phases, alpha and beta. The alpha phase is stable at all temperatures up to the melting point and has body-centered cubic structure with lattice constant \"a\" = 0.33029\u00a0nm at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. It is relatively ductile, has Knoop hardness 200\u2013400 HN and electrical resistivity 15\u201360 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5cm. The beta phase is hard and brittle; its crystal symmetry is tetragonal (space group \"P42/mnm\", \"a\" = 1.0194\u00a0nm, \"c\" = 0.5313\u00a0nm), Knoop hardness is 1000\u20131300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170\u2013210 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5cm. The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750\u2013775\u00a0\u00b0C. Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase, and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron\nsputtering, chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from a eutectic molten salt solution.\nIsotopes.\nNatural tantalum consists of two stable isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 180mTa (\"m\" denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.9\u00d71017\u00a0years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. Among primordial nuclides (half-life &gt; 108 years) 180mTa is the only nuclear isomer and the rarest of all (calculated from the elemental abundance of tantalum and the isotopic abundance of 180mTa within it).\nTantalum has been examined theoretically as a \"salting\" material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is the better-known hypothetical salting material). An external shell of tantalum would be irradiated by the intense neutron flux from the weapon, transmuting it into the radioactive isotope 182Ta, whose gamma rays would significantly increase the radioactivity of the fallout for months. Such \"salted\" weapons are not known to have been built, tested, or used.\nTantalum is used as a target material for spallation by high-energy proton beams for the production of a large number of isotopes including 8Li, 80Rb, and 160Yb.\nChemical compounds.\nTantalum forms compounds in oxidation states \u22123 to +5. Most commonly encountered are oxides of Ta(V), which includes all minerals. The chemical properties of Ta and Nb are very similar. In aqueous media, Ta only exhibits the +5 oxidation state. Like niobium, tantalum is barely soluble in dilute solutions of hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids due to the precipitation of hydrous Ta(V) oxide. In basic media, Ta can be solubilized due to the formation of polyoxotantalate species.\nOxides, nitrides, carbides, sulfides.\nTantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is the most important compound from the perspective of applications. Oxides of tantalum in lower oxidation states are numerous, including many defect structures, and are lightly studied or poorly characterized.\nTantalates, compounds containing [TaO4]3\u2212 or [TaO3]\u2212 are numerous. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) adopts a perovskite structure. Lanthanum tantalate (LaTaO4) contains isolated TaO43\u2212 tetrahedra.\nAs in the cases of other refractory metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes.\nThe best studied chalcogenide is Tantalum sulfide (TaS2), a layered semiconductor, as seen for other transition metal dichalcogenides. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals.\nHalides.\nTantalum halides span the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0\u00a0\u00b0C. The anion [TaF7]2- is used for its separation from niobium. The chloride TaCl5, which exists as a dimer, is the main reagent in synthesis of new Ta compounds. It hydrolyzes readily to an oxychloride. The lower halides TaX4 and TaX3, feature Ta-Ta bonds.\nOrganotantalum compounds.\nOrganotantalum compounds include pentamethyltantalum, mixed alkyltantalum chlorides, alkyltantalum hydrides, alkylidene complexes, as well as cyclopentadienyl derivatives of the same. Diverse salts and substituted derivatives are known for the hexacarbonyl [Ta(CO)6]\u2212 and related isocyanides.\nOccurrence.\nTantalum is estimated to make up about 1\u00a0ppm or 2\u00a0ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite (a series consisting of tantalite-(Fe), tantalite-(Mn), and tantalite-(Mg)), microlite (now a group name), wodginite, euxenite (actually euxenite-(Y)), and polycrase (actually polycrase-(Y)). Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.\nAustralia was the main producer of tantalum prior to the 2010s, with Global Advanced Metals (formerly known as Talison Minerals) being the largest tantalum mining company in that country. They operate two mines in Western Australia, Greenbushes in the southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region. The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late 2008 due to the 2008 financial crisis. Less than a year after it reopened, Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again \"... softening tantalum demand ...\", and other factors, tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012. Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the Greenbushes operation before being sold to customers. Whereas the large-scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada, the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum. Some other countries such as China, Ethiopia, and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum, and they produce a significant percentage of the world's output of it. Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of the tin mining there. During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits, not only is cassiterite (SnO2) found, but a small percentage of tantalite also included. The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum, which is leached from the slag.\nWorld tantalum mine production has undergone an important geographic shift since the start of the 21st century when production was predominantly from Australia and Brazil. Beginning in 2007 and through 2014, the major sources of tantalum production from mines dramatically shifted to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and some other African countries. Future sources of supply of tantalum, in order of estimated size, are being explored in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Greenland, China, Mozambique, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, and Brazil.\nStatus as a conflict resource.\nTantalum is considered a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite\u2013tantalite mineral from which niobium and tantalum are extracted, can also be found in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 \u2013 making it the world's deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002\u20132006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008. USGS data published in January 2021 indicated that close to 40% of the world's tantalum mine production came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with another 18% coming from neighboring Rwanda and Burundi.\nProduction and fabrication.\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite. First, the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation. This is generally carried out near the mine site.\nRefining.\nThe refining of tantalum from its ores is one of the more demanding separation processes in industrial metallurgy. The chief problem is that tantalum ores contain significant amounts of niobium, which has chemical properties almost identical to those of Ta. A large number of procedures have been developed to address this challenge.\nIn modern times, the separation is achieved by hydrometallurgy. Extraction begins with leaching the ore with hydrofluoric acid together with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. This step allows the tantalum and niobium to be separated from the various non-metallic impurities in the rock. Although Ta occurs as various minerals, it is conveniently represented as the pentoxide, since most oxides of tantalum(V) behave similarly under these conditions. A simplified equation for its extraction is thus:\n Ta2O5 + 14 HF \u2192 2 H2[TaF7] + 5 H2O\nCompletely analogous reactions occur for the niobium component, but the hexafluoride is typically predominant under the conditions of the extraction.\n Nb2O5 + 12 HF \u2192 2 H[NbF6] + 5 H2O\nThese equations are simplified: it is suspected that bisulfate (HSO4\u2212) and chloride compete as ligands for the Nb(V) and Ta(V) ions, when sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are used, respectively. The tantalum and niobium fluoride complexes are then removed from the aqueous solution by liquid-liquid extraction into organic solvents, such as cyclohexanone, octanol, and methyl isobutyl ketone. This simple procedure allows the removal of most metal-containing impurities (e.g. iron, manganese, titanium, zirconium), which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of their fluorides and other complexes.\nSeparation of the tantalum \"from\" niobium is then achieved by lowering the ionic strength of the acid mixture, which causes the niobium to dissolve in the aqueous phase. It is proposed that oxyfluoride H2[NbOF5] is formed under these conditions. Subsequent to removal of the niobium, the solution of purified H2[TaF7] is neutralised with aqueous ammonia to precipitate hydrated tantalum oxide as a solid, which can be calcined to tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5).\nInstead of hydrolysis, the H2[TaF7] can be treated with potassium fluoride to produce potassium heptafluorotantalate:\n H2[TaF7] + 2 KF \u2192 K2[TaF7] + 2 HF\nUnlike H2[TaF7], the potassium salt is readily crystallized and handled as a solid.\nK2[TaF7] can be converted to metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium, at approximately 800\u00a0\u00b0C in molten salt.\n K2[TaF7] + 5 Na \u2192 Ta + 5 NaF + 2 KF\nIn an older method, called the Marignac process, the mixture of H2[TaF7] and H2[NbOF5] was converted to a \"mixture\" of K2[TaF7] and K2[NbOF5], which was then separated by fractional crystallization, exploiting their different water solubilities.\nElectrolysis.\nTantalum can also be refined by electrolysis, using a modified version of the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process. Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form, tantalum electrolysis operates on non-liquid powdered oxides. The initial discovery came in 1997 when Cambridge University researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current. The cathode uses powdered metal oxide. The anode is made of carbon. The molten salt at is the electrolyte. The first refinery has enough capacity to supply 3\u20134% of annual global demand.\nFabrication and metalworking.\nAll welding of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.\nApplications.\nElectronics.\nThe major use for tantalum, as the metal powder, is in the production of electronic components, mainly capacitors and some high-power resistors. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer, using tantalum powder, pressed into a pellet shape, as one \"plate\" of the capacitor, the oxide as the dielectric, and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other \"plate\". Because the dielectric layer can be very thin (thinner than the similar layer in, for instance, an aluminium electrolytic capacitor), a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume. Because of the size and weight advantages, tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones, personal computers, automotive electronics and cameras.\nAlloys.\nTantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, missile parts, heat exchangers, tanks, and vessels. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. \nTantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property makes it a useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used in the production of ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. Tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helped to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes when used for internal parts such as grids and plates.\nSurgical uses.\nTantalum is widely used in surgery because of two unique characteristics of tantalum. Tantalum's hardness and ductility is useful in making sharp, durable surgical instruments and also for monofilament sutures. However, a completely unrelated use for tantalum in surgery arises from its unique ability to form a lasting and durable structural bond with human hard tissue, making it uniquely useful for bone and dental implants. Tantalum coatings are increasingly used in the construction of complex tantalum-coated titanium surgical implants due to the tantalum plating's ability to form a strong and biologically stable bond to hard tissue. An incidental consequence of its use for durable surgical implants is that tantalum implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures because tantalum is a non-ferrous, non-magnetic metal.\nOther uses.\nTantalum was used by NASA to shield components of spacecraft, such as \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\", from radiation. The high melting point and oxidation resistance led to the use of the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point. It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, F. P. Journe, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses. Spherical tantalum powder, produced by atomizing molten tantalum using gas or liquid, is commonly used in additive manufacturing due to its uniform shape, excellent flowability, and high melting point.\nEnvironmental issues.\nTantalum receives far less attention in the environmental field than it does in other geosciences. Upper Crust Concentration (UCC) and the Nb/Ta ratio in the upper crust and in minerals are available because these measurements are useful as a geochemical tool. The latest value for upper crust concentration is 0.92 ppm, and the Nb/Ta(w/w) ratio stands at 12.7.\nLittle data is available on tantalum concentrations in the different environmental compartments, especially in natural waters where reliable estimates of 'dissolved' tantalum concentrations in seawater and freshwaters have not even been produced. Some values on dissolved concentrations in oceans have been published, but they are contradictory. Values in freshwaters fare little better, but, in all cases, they are probably below 1\u00a0ng L\u22121, since 'dissolved' concentrations in natural waters are well below most current analytical capabilities. Analysis requires pre-concentration procedures that, for the moment, do not give consistent results. And in any case, tantalum appears to be present in natural waters mostly as particulate matter rather than dissolved.\nValues for concentrations in soils, bed sediments and atmospheric aerosols are easier to come by. Values in soils are close to 1 ppm and thus to UCC values. This indicates detrital origin. For atmospheric aerosols the values available are scattered and limited. When tantalum enrichment is observed, it is probably due to loss of more water-soluble elements in aerosols in the clouds.\nPollution linked to human use of the element has not been detected. Tantalum appears to be a very conservative element in biogeochemical terms, but its cycling and reactivity are still not fully understood.\nPrecautions.\nCompounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound.\nPeople can be exposed to tantalum in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for tantalum exposure in the workplace as 5\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 10\u00a0mg/m3. There is a paradox arising because of tantalum's ability to form a strong and permanent bond with bone tissue: at levels of 2500\u00a0mg/m3, tantalum dust becomes immediately dangerous to life and health if tantalum dust accidentally bonds with the wrong tissue.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Torches have been used throughout history and are still used in processions, symbolic and religious events, and in juggling and entertainment. In some countries, notably the United Kingdom and Australia, \"torch\" in modern usage is also the term for a battery-operated portable light. \nEtymology.\nFrom the Old French \"torche\" meaning \"twisted thing\", hence \"torch formed of twisted tow dipped in wax\", probably from Vulgar Latin *\"torca\", alteration of Late Latin \"torqua\", variant of classical Latin \"torques\" \"collar of twisted metal\", from \"torquere\" \"to twist\".\nTorch construction.\nTorch construction has varied through history depending on the torch's purpose. Torches were usually constructed of a wooden stave with one end wrapped in a material which was soaked in a flammable substance. In the United States, black bear bones may have been used. Modern procession torches are made from coarse hessian rolled into a tube and soaked in wax. A wooden handle is usually used, and a cardboard collar is attached to deflect any wax droplets. They are an easy, safe and relatively cheap way to hold a flame aloft in a parade or to provide illumination in any after-dark celebration.\nModern torches suitable for juggling are made of a wooden-and-metal or metal-only stave with one end wrapped in a Kevlar wick. This wick is soaked in a flammable liquid, such as kerosene.\nSymbolism.\nThe torch is a common emblem of both enlightenment and hope, thus the Statue of Liberty, formally named \"Liberty Enlightening the World\", lifts her torch. Crossed reversed torches were signs of mourning that appear on Greek and Roman funerary monuments\u2014a torch pointed downwards symbolizes death, while a torch held up symbolizes life, truth and the regenerative power of flame. The torch is also a symbol used by political parties, for instance by both Labour (from 1918 to 1980) and the Conservatives (from 1983 to 2006) in the UK, and by the Malta Labour Party. In the seals of schools in the Philippines, the torch symbolizes the vision of education to provide enlightenment to all the students.\nThe torch is also associated with the Greek goddess of witchcraft known as Hecate in some works of art.\nUses.\nOlympics.\nThe torch carried in relay by runners is used to light the Olympic flame which burns without interruption until the end of the Games. These torches and the relay tradition were introduced in the 1936 Summer Olympics by Carl Diem, the chairman of the event because during the duration of the Ancient Olympic Games in Olympia, a sacred flame burnt inside of the temple of Hera, kept in custody by her priestess.\nJuggling.\nJuggling torches are often used as a prop in toss juggling: they can be flipped into the air in an end-over-end motion while being juggled, in the same manner as juggling clubs or juggling knives, but because of their sound and 'trail of flame', they can appear much more impressive to audiences. To a skilled juggler, there is only a slight chance of being burned, but they are still dangerous.\nIn Roman Catholic liturgy.\nIn former times, liturgical torches were carried in Eucharistic processions simply to give light. The Church eventually adopted their use for Solemn High Masses.\nAccording to Adrian Fortescue, the more correct form of liturgical torches are non-freestanding (i.e. cannot stand up on their own). However, today, even in the Vatican, freestanding, tall candles in ornate candle-stick holders have replaced the former type. The torches are carried by torchbearers, who enter at the Sanctus and leave after Communion.\nAnglicans of the High Church and some Lutherans use torches in some of their liturgical celebrations as well.\nTorchlight march.\nTorchlight march is a type of illuminated procession which is held after dark so that torches carried by the participants form a spectacle (other types of an illuminated procession involve candles, lanterns etc).\nUnderwater diving.\nMagnesium torches were used commonly in the 1950s and 1960s as a means of underwater illumination. Magnesium burns with a bright white light, and burns underwater also.\nAssociations.\nLove.\nThe association of a torch with love may date to the Greek and Roman tradition of a wedding torch,\nlit in the bride's hearth on her wedding night, then used to light the hearth in her new home. Such a torch is associated with the Greek god of marriage Hymen.\nThe idiom to carry a torch (for someone) means to love or to be romantically infatuated with someone, especially when such feelings are not reciprocated. It is often used to characterize a situation in which a romantic relationship has ended, but where one partner still loves the other. It is considered by some to be dated, but still in wide usage. A torch song is typically a sentimental love song in which a singer laments an unrequited love.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was formed following the acquisition of Qt by Digia, but was later spun off into a separate, publicly traded company.\nThe company oversees the development of the Qt framework alongside the Qt Project, and provides tools for UI design, software development, quality assurance and testing, as well as expert consulting services.\nHistory.\nTrolltech 1994\u20132007.\nTrolltech was founded by Eirik Chambe-Eng and Haavard Nord on 4 March 1994. The duo started writing Qt in 1991; since then, Qt has steadily expanded and improved. \nIn 2002, Trolltech introduced Qtopia which is based on Qt. Qtopia is an application platform for Linux-based devices such as mobile phones, portable media players, and home media. It is also used in many non-consumer products such as medical instruments and industrial devices. Qtopia Phone Edition was released in 2004, and their Greenphone smartphone is based on this platform.\nTrolltech completed an initial public offering (IPO) on the Oslo Stock Exchange in July, 2006.\nPart of Nokia 2008\u20132012.\nOn 28 January 2008, Nokia Corporation announced that they had entered into an agreement to make a public voluntary tender offer to acquire Trolltech. The total cost for Nokia was approximately \u20ac104 million. On 5 June 2008 Nokia's voluntary tender offer was approved for all the shares in Trolltech. By 17 June 2008, Nokia had completed its acquisition of Trolltech. On 30 September 2008, Trolltech was renamed as Qt Software, and Qtopia was renamed as Qt Extended. On 11 August 2009, the company's name was changed to Qt Development Frameworks.\nThe Qt environment was a key part of the company's strategy until 2011, when Nokia decided to switch to Windows Phone OS for its smartphones.\nPart of Digia 2012\u20132016.\nNokia sold the commercial licensing business of Qt to Digia in March 2011. The following year, Digia acquired the entire Qt development environment and related business from Nokia. As a result of the acquisition, Digia became responsible for all of the functions related to Qt technology, including product development. The main goal of the acquisition was to strengthen Digia's position in the Qt ecosystem and expand the availability of Qt technology across a growing number of platforms. \nIn September 2014, Digia formed The Qt Company, a wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to the development and governance of the Qt platform. In connection with this, the website qt.io went live, combining the open source qt development and commercial Qt functions that had previously operated at different addresses. Qt products had some 800,000 users globally. \nIn August 2015, Digia Plc's Board of Directors began to explore the demerger of Digia\u2019s domestic businesses and the Qt businesses into two separate listed companies. \nQt Group 2016\u2013current.\nIn May 2016, the company went public on NASDAQ Helsinki as QTCOM. In March 2016, Digia Plc's Annual General Meeting resolved on the partial demerger of Digia and the demerger was registered in the trade register on May 1. Digia\u2019s Qt business was transferred to a new company, named Qt Group, and Digia's domestic business segment remained under the Digia brand. Digia\u2019s CEO Juha Varelius was appointed as the CEO of Qt Group. Trading in Qt Group shares began on the main list of the Helsinki Stock Exchange in May 2016.\u00a0\nIn 2018, the company had 5,000 customers. Approximately 80% of the Fortune 500 companies are customers of Qt Group.\nThe company attracted the interest of international investors in spring 2020 when its market capitalization rose above 500 million euros. \u00a0The company's market capitalization exceeded 1 billion euros in October. The share price had risen by more than 700% from the IPO price. The company's net sales were close to EUR 80 million euros and its earnings were approximately 17 million euros. \u00a0\nBy spring 2021, the company\u2019s share price had grown nearly fivefold over a period of one year, and its market capitalization was above 2 billion euros. In April, the company announced that it would acquire Froglogic, a Germany-based developer of test automation tools for applications based on the Qt GUI framework. In August, the company made it to the OMXH25 index. The company's net sales amounted to 121 million euros and it had 455 employees.\nIn the fall of 2022, the company announced that it would acquire Axivion, a Germany-based company whose products detect issues that erode the quality and performance of software, i.e. static program analysis, among other services. \nIn March 2023, the company had 706 employees.\nOrganization.\nQt Group's head office is located in Helsinki, Finland. The company has approximately 800 employees worldwide. \nThe company\u2019s CEO is Juha Varelius, who previously served as the CEO of Digia from 2008 to 2016.\nQt Group has core R&amp;D in Oslo, Norway, as well as large engineering teams in Berlin, Germany, and Oulu, Finland. The company also has offices in China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, South Korea, and the US.\nProducts.\nThe company provides a software development framework, tools for software design, development, quality assurance and testing, as well as expert consulting services. Its flagship product is Qt, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework written in C++. Qt is popular with application developers using C++ but is supported by bindings for other programming languages too, such as Python. Qt also includes packages such as data structures and a networking library. The popular free and cross-platform KDE Plasma desktop environment and software compilation uses the Qt library. \nThe tools can be used for UI design, programming and quality assurance for mobile and desktop applications, as well as embedded systems, which are used in cars, consumer electronics and domestic appliances, for example.\nQt also earns revenue from licenses for end products developed with its tools.\nIn 2024, the company\u2019s product portfolio included:\nMarkets.\nQt Group has customers in 70 industries in over 180 countries and its products are used by approximately 1.5 million developers.

{"id": "30056", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30056", "title": "Trojan horse (computing)", "text": "Type of malware\nIn computing, a trojan horse (or simply trojan; often capitalized, but see below) is a kind of malware that misleads users as to its true intent by disguising itself as a normal program.\nTrojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering. For example, a user may be duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or into clicking on a fake advertisement on the Internet. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected device. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan.\nUnlike computer viruses and worms, trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.\nOrigins of the term.\nThe term is derived from the ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.\nIt is unclear where and when the computing concept, and this term for it, originated; but by 1971 the first Unix manual assumed its readers knew both.\nAnother early reference is in a US Air Force report in 1974 on the analysis of vulnerability in the Multics computer systems.\nThe term \"Trojan horse\" was popularized by Ken Thompson in his 1983 Turing Award acceptance lecture \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", subtitled: \"To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses? Perhaps it is more important to trust the people who wrote the software.\" He mentioned that he knew about the possible existence of trojans from a report on the security of Multics.\nCapitalization.\nThe computer term \"Trojan horse\" is derived from the legendary Trojan Horse of the ancient city of Troy. For this reason \"Trojan\" is often capitalized, especially in older sources. However, many modern style guides and dictionaries suggest a lower-case \"trojan\" for this technical use.\nBehavior.\nOnce installed, trojans may perform a range of malicious actions. Many tend to contact one or more Command and Control (C2) servers across the Internet and await instruction. Since individual trojans typically use a specific set of ports for this communication, it can be relatively simple to detect them. Moreover, other malware could potentially \"take over\" the trojan, using it as a proxy for malicious action.\nIn German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is sometimes called \"govware\". Govware is typically used to intercept communications from the target device. Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software. Examples of govware trojans include the Swiss MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer and the German \"state trojan\" nicknamed R2D2. German govware works by exploiting security gaps unknown to the general public and accessing smartphone data before it becomes encrypted via other applications.\nDue to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users' privacy, trojans are becoming more common. According to a survey conducted by BitDefender from January to June 2009, \"Trojan-type malware is on the rise, accounting for 83% of the global malware detected in the world.\" BitDefender has stated that approximately 15% of computers are members of a botnet, usually recruited by a trojan infection.\nRecent investigations have revealed that the trojan-horse method has been used as an attack on cloud computing systems. A trojan attack on cloud systems tries to insert an application or service into the system that can impact the cloud services by changing or stopping the functionalities. When the cloud system identifies the attacks as legitimate, the service or application is performed which can damage and infect the cloud system.\nClassifications of Trojan horses.\nTrojans are usually classified based on their primary function or intended impact. One major category is the banking trojan, which is designed to steal financial information such as online banking credentials, credit card numbers, or cryptocurrency wallet keys. Zeus and TrickBot are among the most studied examples of this type. Another category is the remote access trojan (RAT), which allows attackers to gain full control over an infected system, enabling them to install additional software, access files, or monitor user activity.\nSome trojans are primarily downloaders, meaning they serve as an initial infection stage by installing other forms of malware once inside a system. These often pave the way for ransomware, spyware, or botnet recruitment. Information-stealing trojans are also common, collecting sensitive data such as browser cookies, stored credentials, or documents without the user\u2019s knowledge. Furthermore, fake antivirus trojans imitate legitimate security software, tricking users into paying for unnecessary or harmful services.\nBecause trojans can be adapted for multiple purposes, many modern types have overlapping features, mixing elements of backdoors, spyware, and downloaders. This adaptability has been a major factor in their prevalence as one of the most common forms of malware.\nLinux ls example.\nA trojan horse is a program that purports to perform some legitimate function, yet upon execution it compromises the user's security. One simple example is the following malicious version of the Linux ls command. An attacker would place this executable script in a publicly writable and \"high-traffic\" location (e.g., codice_1). Then, any victim who tried to run codice_2 from that directory \u2014 \"if and only if\" the victim's executable search codice_3 unwisely included the current directory codice_4 \u2014 would execute codice_1 instead of codice_6, and have their home directory deleted.\nrm -rf ~ 2&gt;/dev/null # Remove the user's home directory, then remove self.\nrm $0\nSimilar scripts could hijack other common commands; for example, a script purporting to be the sudo command (which prompts for the user's password) could instead mail that password to the attacker.\nIn these examples, the malicious program imitates the name of a well-known useful program, rather than pretending to be a novel and unfamiliar (but harmless) program. As such, these examples also resemble typosquatting and supply chain attacks.\nPrevention and mitigation.\nPreventing trojan infections requires a mix of user awareness, technical safeguards, and proactive security practices. Educating users about the dangers of downloading unverified files or executing unknown programs remains an effective way to prevent attacks. Security software such as antivirus and anti-malware programs can help detect, quarantine, and remove trojans when kept up to date.\nSafe browsing practices\u2014such as avoiding suspicious links, refraining from downloading software from untrusted sources, and exercising caution with email attachments\u2014are also key to reducing risk. Additionally, maintaining regular software and operating system updates ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched, making it harder for trojans to exploit weaknesses.\nIn professional environments, network firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and email filtering tools are commonly used to block suspicious traffic and prevent trojans from communicating with external servers. Regular security checks, employee training programs, and routine data backups further strengthen defenses and help reduce potential damage in the event of an infection.\nNotable examples.\nThere have been many well-known trojans that have played an important role in the history of cybersecurity. An early example is the AIDS trojan, developed in 1989. It is considered one of the first forms of ransomware, as it encrypted filenames on infected computers and demanded payment to restore them. Another famous example is the Zeus trojan, first identified in 2007. Zeus mainly targeted Microsoft Windows systems and was designed to steal banking credentials through man-in-the-browser attacks, which infected a user's browser to intercept and manipulate data, leading to widespread financial losses and data breaches.\nIn 2016, the MEMZ trojan, a Windows-based program, became widely recognized for its complex and destructive payloads. MEMZ gained notoriety for displaying unusual visual effects on infected machines and ultimately rendering the systems unusable.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of over 14 million in the city proper in 2023, it is one of the most populous urban areas in the world. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring prefectures, is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with 41 million residents as of 2024[ [update]].\nLying at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kant\u014d region, on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. It is Japan's economic center and the seat of the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards, which formerly made up Tokyo City; various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area; and two outlying island chains, the Tokyo Islands. Although most of the world recognizes Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more akin to that of a prefecture, with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments that make up the metropolis. Special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a hub of commerce and business.\nTokyo, originally known as Edo, rose to political prominence in 1603 when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate, and by the mid-18th century, Edo had evolved from a small fishing village into one of the largest cities in the world, with a population surpassing one million. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit.\u2009'Eastern Capital'). Tokyo was greatly damaged by the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and by allied bombing raids during World War II. Beginning in the late 1940s, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, which fueled the Japanese economic miracle, in which Japan's economy became the second-largest in the world at the time, behind that of the United States. As of 2023[ [update]], Tokyo is home to 29 of the world's 500 largest companies, as listed in the annual \"Fortune\" Global 500, the second highest number of any city.\nTokyo was the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, in 1964, and also hosted in 2021. It hosted three G7 summits, in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international hub of research and development and an academic center, with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo, the top-ranking university in Japan. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, the country's high-speed railway network, and the city's Shinjuku Station is the world's busiest train station. Tokyo Skytree is the world's tallest tower. The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in Asia.\nTokyo's nominal gross domestic output was 113.7 trillion yen (US$1.04 trillion) in FY2021 and accounted for 20.7% of Japan's economic output, which converts to 8.07 million yen or US$73,820 per capita. Including the Greater Tokyo Area, Tokyo is the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world after New York, with a 2022 gross metropolitan product estimated at US$2.08 trillion. Although Tokyo's status as a leading global financial hub has diminished with the Lost Decades since the 1990s, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was the world's largest, with a market capitalization about 1.5 times that of the NYSE, Tokyo is still a leading financial hub, and the TSE remains among the world's top five major stock exchanges. Tokyo is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. It ranked 14th in the 2024 edition of the Global Livability Ranking, and has been ranked as the safest city in the world in multiple international surveys.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\n Tokyo was originally known as , a kanji compound of \u6c5f (\"e\", \"cove, inlet\") and \u6238 (\"to\", \"entrance, gate, door\"). The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to , when it became the new imperial capital, in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital () in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (), Keij\u014d (), Beijing (), Nanjing (), and Xijing ()). During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"T\u014dkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\"; however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.\nHistory.\nPre-Tokugawa period.\nThe site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times, and there have been multiple Paleolithic period (around 40,000\u201316,000 BC) sites found in present-day Tokyo. During the subsequent Jomon period, the Holocene glacial retreat caused sea levels in Tokyo Bay to rise by 120 cm, with the coastline running along the edge of what is now the Imperial Palace. Middens such as the Omori Shell Mounds still mark where the coastline ran in those days. The Yayoi period, during which agriculture spread across the country, is named after the Yayoi 2-ch\u014dme Site in Bunkyo, where the first example of Yayoi pottery was excavated in 1884 by Shozo Arisaka.\nIn 534, a large-scale conflict was recorded in the region, as a result of which Kasahara no Omi, the victor, was appointed \"Kuni no Miyatsuko\" (provincial governor) by Emperor Ankan. Senso-ji in Asakusa was founded in 645. Under the \"Ritsury\u014d\" system established during the Asuka period, most of present-day Tokyo was part of Musashi Province. Following the fall of the Kingdom of Baekje after the Battle of Baekgang in the 660s, thousands of refugees were resettled in Musashi.\nDuring the Heian period, Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century, and in 1457, \u014cta D\u014dkan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the Chiba clan. After D\u014dkan was assassinated in 1486, the Ohgigayatsu branch of the Uesugi clan took control of the castle and the surrounding area. However, the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan replaced them after the Battle of Takanawahara in 1524, only to be defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Siege of Odawara in 1590.\n1590\u20131868 (Tokugawa period).\nFollowing the siege of Odawara, Tokugawa Ieyasu was granted the Kant\u014d region and moved there from his ancestral land of Mikawa Province. When he became \"sh\u014dgun\", the \"de facto\" ruler of the country, in 1603, the whole country came to be ruled by Edo. While the Tokugawa shogunate ruled the country in practice, the Imperial House of Japan based in Kyoto was still the \"de jure\" ruler, and the title of sh\u014dgun was granted by the Emperor as a formality. During the Edo period, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the \"Pax Tokugawa\", and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city. The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of consistent fires, earthquakes and other devastating natural disasters, and Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century.\nHowever, this prolonged period of seclusion ended with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation. Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments. Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption caused by widespread rebellious demonstrations to further consolidate power, which resulted in the overthrow of the last Tokugawa sh\u014dgun, Yoshinobu, in 1867 and the end of the Pax Tokugawa. Despite Edo castle being handed over to the Emperor-supporting forces, some forces loyal to the shogunate kept fighting, ending with the final Battle of Ueno on 4 July 1868.\n1868\u20131941.\nAfter being handed over to the Meiji government, Edo was renamed Tokyo (Eastern Capital) on 3 September 1868, and the capital was subsequently moved officially from Kyoto to Tokyo by Emperor Meiji. \nThe former Edo Castle became the new Imperial Palace, and Government ministries such as the Ministry of Finance were relocated to Tokyo by 1871. The 1870s also saw the establishment of other major institutions and facilities such as Ueno Park (1873), the University of Tokyo (1877) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (1878), as well as the rise of public transportion such as the , connecting Shimbashi (Shiodome) and Yokohama (Sakuragicho). The rapid modernization of the country was driven from Tokyo, with its business districts such as Marunouchi filled with modern brick buildings and the railway network serving as a means to help the large influx of labour force needed to keep the development of the economy. The City of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889. The Imperial Diet, the national legislature of the country, was established in Tokyo in 1889, and it has ever since been operating in the city.\nOn 1 September 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake struck the city, and the earthquake and subsequent fire killed an estimated 105,000 citizens. The loss amounted to 37 percent of the country's economic output. On the other hand, the destruction provided an opportunity to reconsider the planning of the city, which had changed its shape hastily after the Meiji Restoration. The high survival rate of concrete buildings promoted the transition from timber and brick architecture to modern, earthquake-proof construction. The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa, the first underground railway line built outside Europe and the American continents, was completed on December 30, 1927.\nAlthough Tokyo recovered robustly from the earthquake and new cultural and liberal political movements, such as Taish\u014d Democracy, spread, the 1930s saw an economic downturn caused by the Great Depression and major political turmoil. Two attempted military \"coups d'\u00e9tat\" happened in Tokyo, the May 15 incident in 1932 and the February 26 incident in 1936. This turmoil eventually allowed the military wings of the government to take control of the country, leading to Japan joining the Second World War as an Axis power. Due to the country's political isolation on the international stage caused by its military aggression in China and the increasingly unstable geopolitical situations in Europe, \u0422\u043ek\u0443\u043e had to give up hosting the 1940 Summer Olympics in 1938. Rationing started in June 1940 as the nation braced itself for another world war, while the 26th Centenary of the Enthronement of Emperor Jimmu celebrations took place on a grand scale to boost morale and increase the sense of national identity in the same year. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American bases at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, entering the Second World War against the Allied Powers. The wartime regime greatly affected life in the city.\n1942\u20131945.\nIn 1943, Tokyo City merged with Tokyo Prefecture to form the Tokyo Metropolis (\u6771\u4eac\u90fd, \"T\u014dky\u014d-to\"), a reorganization aimed to create a more centralized and efficient administrative structure to better manage resources, urban planning, and civil defence during wartime. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government thus became responsible for both prefectural and city functions while administering cities, towns, and villages in the suburban and rural areas.\nAlthough Japan enjoyed significant success in the initial stages of the war and rapid expansion of its sphere of influence, the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 marked the first direct foreign attack on Tokyo. Although the physical damage was minimal, the raid demonstrated the vulnerability of the Japanese mainland to air attacks and boosted American morale. Large-scale Allied air bombing of cities in the Japanese home islands, including Tokyo, began in late 1944 when the US seized control of the Mariana Islands. From these islands, newly developed long-range B-29 bombers could conduct return journeys. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9\u201310, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid. Nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on the east end of the city (Shitamachi, \u4e0b\u753a), an area with a high concentration of factories and working-class houses. Two-fifths of the city was completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were destroyed, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured. Numerous Edo and Meiji-era buildings of historical significance were destroyed, including the main building of the Imperial Palace, Sens\u014d-ji, Z\u014dj\u014d-ji, Sengaku-ji and Kabuki-za. Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Tokyo dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, as soldiers were sent to the front and children were evacuated.\n1945\u20131972.\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the Allied Occupation Forces, under Douglas MacArthur, an American general, administered Japan for six years. The original rebuilding plan of Tokyo was based on a plan modelled after the Metropolitan Green Belt of London, devised in the 1930s but canceled due to the war. However, due to the monetary contraction policy known as the Dodge Line, named after Joseph Dodge, the neoliberal economic advisor to MacArthur, the plan had to be reduced to a minimal one focusing on transport and other infrastructure. In 1947, the 35 pre-war special wards were reorganized into the current 23 wards. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until around 1950, when heavy industry output returned to pre-war levels. Since around the time the Allied occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo's focus shifted from rebuilding to developing beyond its pre-war stature. From the 1950s onwards, Tokyo's Metro and railway network saw significant expansion, culminating in the launch of the world's first dedicated high-speed railway line, the Shinkansen, between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964. The same year saw the development of other transport infrastructure, such as the Shuto Expressway to meet the increased demand brought about by the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the first Olympic Games held in Asia. Around this time, the 31-metre height restriction, imposed on all buildings since 1920, was relaxed due to the increased demand for office buildings and advancements in earthquake-proof construction. Starting with the Kasumigaseki Building (147 metres) in 1968, skyscrapers began to dominate Tokyo's skyline. During this period of rapid rebuilding, Tokyo celebrated its 500th anniversary in 1956 and the Ogasawara Islands, which had been under control of the US since the war ended, were returned in 1968. Ryokichi Minobe, a Marxian economist who served as the governor for 12 years starting in 1967, is remembered for his welfare state policy, including free healthcare for the elderly and financial support for households with children, and his 'war against pollution' policy, as well as the large government deficit they caused.\n1973\u2013present.\nAlthough the 1973 oil crisis put an end to the rapid post-war recovery and development of Japan's economy, its position as the world's second-largest economy at the time had seemed secure by that point, remaining so until 2010 when it was surpassed by China. Tokyo's development was sustained by its status as the economic, political, and cultural hub of such a country. In 1978, after years of the intense Sanrizuka Struggle, Narita International Airport opened as the new gateway to the city, while the relatively small Haneda Airport switched to primarily domestic flights. West Shinjuku, which had been occupied by the vast Yodobashi Water Purification Centre until 1965, became the site of an entirely new business district characterized by skyscrapers surpassing 200 metres during this period.\nThe American-led Plaza Accord in 1985, which aimed to depreciate the US dollar, had a devastating effect on Japan's manufacturing sector, particularly affecting small to mid-size companies based in Tokyo. This led the government to adopt a domestic-demand-focused economic policy, ultimately causing an asset price bubble. Land redevelopment projects were planned across the city, and real estate prices skyrocketed. By 1990, the estimated value of the Imperial Palace surpassed that of the entire state of California. The Tokyo Stock Exchange became the largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, with the Tokyo-based NTT becoming the most highly valued company globally.\nAfter the bubble burst in the early 1990s, Japan experienced a prolonged economic downturn called the \"Lost Decades\", characterized by extremely low or negative economic growth, deflation, and stagnant asset prices. Tokyo's status as a world city is said to have depreciated greatly during these three decades. Nonetheless, Tokyo still saw new urban developments during this period. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tenn\u014dzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa, and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. In the 1990s, various plans were proposed for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to spread population and investment more evenly. Such plans were met with fierce opposition, and then-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi decided to close parliamentary discussions in 2003. The Agency for Cultural Affairs relocated from Kasumigaseki to Kyoto in 2023, making it the only central organ of the Civil Service to move out of Tokyo so far.\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Thus, Tokyo became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice. However, the 2020 Olympic Games were postponed and held from July 23 to August 8, 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdministration.\nLocal government.\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a , translated as \"metropolis\". Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with ; by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The , which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (\u5e02 \"-shi\"), five towns (\u753a \"-ch\u014d\" or \"machi\"), and eight villages (\u6751 \"-son\" or \"-mura\"), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis, including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\nThe governor of Tokyo is elected every four years. The incumbent governor, Yuriko Koike, was elected in 2016, following the resignation of her predecessor, Yoichi Masuzoe. She was re-elected in 2020 and 2024. The legislature of the Metropolis is called the Metropolitan Assembly, and it has one house with 127 seats. The assembly is responsible for enacting and amending prefectural ordinances, approving the budget (8.5 trillion yen in fiscal 2024), and voting on important administrative appointments made by the governor, including the vice governors. Its members are also elected on a four-year cycle.\nMunicipalities.\nSince the completion of the Great Mergers of Heisei in 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. All municipalities in Japan have a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. The 23 Special Wards cover the area that had been Tokyo City until 1943, 30 other municipalities are located in the Tama area, and the remaining 9 are on Tokyo's outlying islands.\nTokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local sub-prefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu \u014cshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, K\u014dzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachij\u014d-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu \u014cshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two small outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan. Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ. The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found in Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\nEnvironmental policies.\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level. Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards. According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the annual mean temperature has increased by about over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10-Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding of green space, of which would be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" to replace a landfill. From 2007 to 2010, of the planned 1,000\u00a0ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000. As of 2014[ [update]], roadside trees in Tokyo have increased to 950,000, and a further of green space has been added.\nIn 2023, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched the Tokyo Green Biz Project, an initiative seeking to increase and preserve the city's greenery over the next 100 years, create an online map designed to increase collaboration between residents and the local government, and create and promote green infrastructure. They have also increased the footage of parks, and encourage citizens to get involved in pond cleaning, tree planting, and working as park guides.\nIn 2018 the Kasai Marine Park became the first wetland in Tokyo to be registered under the Ramsar Convention. It opened in 1989.\nNational government.\nTokyo is the seat of all three branches of government: the legislature (National Diet), the executive (Cabinet led by the Prime Minister), and the judiciary (Supreme Court of Japan), as well as the Emperor of Japan, the head of state. Most government ministries are concentrated in the Kasumigaseki district in Chiyoda, and the name Kasumigaseki is often used as a metonym for the Japanese national civil service. Tokyo has 25 constituencies for the House of Representatives, 18 of which were won by the ruling Liberal Democrats and 7 by the main opposition Constitutional Democrats in the 2021 general election. Apart from these seats, through the Tokyo proportional representation block, Tokyo sends 17 more politicians to the House of Representatives, 6 of whom were members of the ruling LDP in the 2021 election. The Tokyo at-large district, which covers the entire metropolis, sends 12 members to the House of Councillors.\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\nGeography.\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about east to west and north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is . Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area () stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.\nClimate.\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfa\"), with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages . The coolest month is January, averaging . The record low temperature was on January 13, 1876. The record high was on July 20, 2004.\nThe record highest low temperature is , on August 11, 2013. \nAnnual rainfall averages nearly , with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January. Snowfall is sporadic and occurs almost annually. Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with of rain, including on the ninth of that month. The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995. Annual precipitation has ranged from in 1984 to in 1938.\nThe western mountainous area of mainland Tokyo, Okutama, also lies in the humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: \"Cfa\").\nThe climates of Tokyo's offshore territories vary significantly from those of the city. The climate of Chichijima in Ogasawara village is on the boundary between the tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: \"Aw\") and the tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: \"Af\"). It is approximately south of the Greater Tokyo Area, resulting in much different climatic conditions.\nTokyo's easternmost territory, the island of Minamitorishima in Ogasawara village, is in the tropical savanna climate zone (K\u00f6ppen classification: \"Aw\"). Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kant\u014d.\nNatural disasters.\nEarthquakes.\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's \u2013long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4\u20136) that can be felt in a single year, something residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away, as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011; the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 7.9, killed more than 100,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\nVolcanic eruptions.\nMount Fuji is about southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the H\u014dei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days). During the H\u014dei eruption, the ash amount was 4\u00a0cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2\u00a0cm to 0.5\u00a0cm in central Tokyo. Kanagawa had 16\u00a0cm to 8\u00a0cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0\u00a0cm. If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis. According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area. A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas and power lines and cause temporary power outages. The affected areas would need to be evacuated.\nFloods.\nTokyo is located on the Kant\u014d Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season. Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa. In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people. In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood. In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6\u20137% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction. A huge system of dams, levees, and tunnels was constructed. The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.Tokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC). It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a long system of tunnels, underground, with tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty. During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River. Low-lying areas of K\u014dt\u014d, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Tait\u014d and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.\nArchitecture.\nTokyo's buildings are too diverse to be characterized by any specific architectural style, but it can be generally said that a majority of extant structures were built in the past hundred years. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.\nEarly modern (1407\u20131868).\nThe oldest known extant building in Tokyo is Shofukuji in Higashi-Murayama. The current building was constructed in 1407, during the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573). Although greatly reduced in number by later fires, earthquakes, and air raids, a considerable number of Edo-era buildings survive to this day. The Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was occupied by the Tokugawa Shogunate as Edo Castle during the Edo Period (1603\u20131868), has many gates and towers dating from that era, although the main palace buildings and the tenshu tower have been lost.\nNumerous temple and shrine buildings in Tokyo date from this era: the Ueno Toshogu still maintains the original 1651 building built by the third shogun Iemitsu Tokugawa. Although partially destroyed during the Second World War, Zojo-ji, which houses the Tokugawa family mausoleum, still has grand Edo-era buildings such as the Sangedatsu gate. Kaneiji has grand 17th-century buildings such as the five-storey pagoda and the Shimizudo. The Nezu Shrine and Gokokuji were built by the fifth shogun Tsunayoshi Tokugawa in the late 1600s. All feudal lords (daimyo) had large Edo houses where they stayed when in Edo; at one point, these houses amounted to half the total area of Edo. None of the grand Edo-era daimyo houses still exist in Tokyo, as their vast land footprint made them easy targets for redevelopment programs for modernization during the Meiji Period. Some gardens were immune from such fates and are today open to the public; Hamarikyu (Kofu Tokugawa family), Shibarikyu (Kishu Tokugawa family), Koishikawa Korakuen (Mito Tokugawa family), Rikugien (Yanagisawa family), and Higo Hosokawa Garden (Hosokawa family). The Akamon, which is now widely seen as a symbol of the University of Tokyo, was originally built to commemorate the marriage of a shogun's daughter into the Maeda clan, one of the most affluent of the feudal lords, while the campus itself occupies their former edo estate.\nModern (1869\u20131945).\nThe Meiji era saw a rapid modernization in architectural styles as well; until the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 exposed their weakness to seismic shocks, grand brick buildings were constantly built across the city. Tokyo Station (1914), the Ministry of Justice building (1895), the International Library of Children's Literature (1906), and Mistubishi building one (1894, rebuilt in 2010) are some of the few brick survivors from this period. It was regarded as fashionable by some members of the Japanese aristocracy to build their Tokyo residences in grand and modern styles, and some of these buildings still exist, although most are in private hands and open to the public on limited occasions. Aristocratic residences today open to the public include the Marquess Maeda residence in Komaba, the Baron Iwasaki residence in Ikenohata, and the Baron Furukawa residence in Nishigahara.\nThe Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 ushered in an era of concrete architecture. Surviving reinforced concrete buildings from this era include the Meiji Insurance Headquarters (completed in 1934), the Mitsui Headquarters (1929), Mitsukoshi Nihonbashi flagship store (1914, refurbished in 1925), Takashimaya Nihonbashi flagship store (1932), Wako in Ginza (1932) and Isetan Shinjuku flagship store (1933). This spread of earthquake and fire-resistant architecture reached council housing too, most notably the D\u014djunkai apartments.\nThe 1930s saw the rise of styles that combined characteristics of both traditional Japanese and modern designs. Chuta Ito was a leading figure in this movement, and his extant works in Tokyo include Tsukiji Hongan-ji (1934). The Imperial Crown Style, which often features Japanese-style roofs on top of elevated concrete structures, was adopted for the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno and the Kudan Hall in Kudanminami.\nContemporary (1946\u2013present).\nSince the 30-metre height restriction was lifted in the 1960s, Tokyo's most dense areas have been dominated by skyscrapers. As of May 2024, at least 184 buildings are exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in Tokyo. Apart from these, Tokyo Tower (333m) and Tokyo Skytree (634m) feature high-elevation observation decks; the latter is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the third tallest structure in the world. With a scheduled completion date in 2027, Torch Tower (385m) will overtake Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower (325.2m) as the tallest building in Tokyo.\nKenzo Tange designed notable contemporary buildings in Tokyo, including Yoyogi National Gymnasium (1964), St. Mary's Cathedral (1967), and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (1991). Kisho Kurokawa was also active in the city, and his works there include the National Art Center (2005) and the Nakagin Capsule Tower (1972). Other notable contemporary buildings in Tokyo include the Tokyo Dome, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, Roppongi Hills, Tokyo International Forum, and Asahi Beer Hall.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506\u00a0million people in Tokyo, with 9.214\u00a0million living within Tokyo's 23 wards. During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5\u00a0million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4\u00a0million during the day.\nAccording to April 2024 official estimates, Setagaya (942,003), Nerima (752,608), and Ota (748,081) were the most populous wards and municipalities in Tokyo. The least inhabited of all Tokyo municipalities are remote island villages such as Aogashima (150), Mikurajima (289), and Toshima (306).\nAge structure and average age.\nIn 2021, Tokyo's average and median ages were both 45.5 years old. This is below the national median age of 49.0, placing Tokyo among the youngest regions in Japan. 16.8% of the population was below 15, while 34.6% was above 65. In the same year, the youngest municipalities in Tokyo were Mikura-jima (average age 40.72), Chuo (41.92), and Chiyoda (42.07), while the oldest included Okutama (59.11) and Miyake (53.82).\nImmigration.\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu. In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).\nAs of January 2024, Tokyo had 647,416 foreign nationals registered as residents, with China, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Nepal, Taiwan, and the United States each having more than 20,000 nationals living there as citizens. Since the COVID-19 pandemic ended, Tokyo's foreign population has increased significantly, now nearly 20% above the January 2022 population of 546,436. There is no official survey of race or place of birth as of June 2024.\nDialects.\nJapanese is the primary language spoken throughout the metropolis, though regional and socio-economic differences can be heard. Traditionally, dialects in Tokyo are classified into two groups: the Yamanote dialect and the Shitamachi dialect. The former has traditionally been spoken in the upper- and upper-middle-class residential area of Yamanote, which includes Bancho, Kojimachi, Koishikawa, Kudan, Yotsuya, Azabu, and Akasaka. During the Edo period, these neighborhoods were occupied by \"Daimyo\" and other powerful samurai families, and the dialect evolved largely based on their way of speech. Standard Japanese pronunciation is largely based on this accent and spread across the country with the introduction of radio. The Shitamachi dialect, in contrast, has been associated with the \"Ch\u014dnin\" district of Shitamachi and retains many characteristics of the accents spoken there in the Edo era. However, socio-economic changes in the post-war period and the large influx of people moving from other areas have largely blurred these distinctions in recent years. It has been reported that young generations are not as aware of the differences in dialects as their parents' and grandparents' generations were.\nThe Hachij\u014d dialect, spoken primarily in Hachij\u014djima and Aogashima, descended from 6th-8th century Eastern Old Japanese and has fewer than 1,000 speakers. Bonin English is a creole spoken in the Ogasawara Islands, derived from English and Japanese, as the islands' population historically consisted of people of Japanese, British, American, Hawaiian, and Polynesian origins, mostly mixed-race.\nEconomy.\nTokyo's gross regional product was 113.7 trillion yen or US$1.04 trillion in FY2021 and accounted for 20.7% of the country's total economic output, which converts to 8.07 million yen or US$73,820 per capita. By sector, Wholesale and Retail was the largest contributor, accounting for 21.5% of the total output. This was followed by Real Estate (13.5%), Professional, Scientific and Technical (12.2%), Information and Communications (11.7%), Finance and Insurance (7.6%), Manufacturing (7.0%), and Healthcare (6.7%). Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery, and Mining combined accounted for less than 0.1% of the economic output. As these numbers suggest, Tokyo's economy is heavily dependent on the tertiary sector. As the Greater Tokyo Area, it has the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world, after Greater New York, with a gross metropolitan product estimated at US$2 trillion. The area's economy is slightly smaller than Canada's economy while being slightly larger than Mexico's, according to IMF estimates from the same year.\nTokyo's business districts are concentrated in four central wards: Chiyoda (Marunouchi, Otemachi, Kasumigaseki), Chuo (Nihombashi, Kyobashi, Yaesu), Minato (Shimbashi, Shiodome, Toranomon), and Shinjuku (West Shinjuku). The 23 Special Wards of Tokyo had 73.5 million m2 of office space as of January 2022.\nIn 2023, 29 of the \"Fortune Global 500\" companies were headquartered in Tokyo, which was the second highest concentration in the world after Beijing. Notably, around 20 of them are based in Marunouchi, such as MUFG, Mitsubish Corp. and Hitachi. Tokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris. However, years of deflation and an extremely weak yen starting in 2022 due to Japan's low interest rates made the cost of living in Tokyo 31% cheaper than in New York City in 2023, which is roughly the same as in Beijing and Manchester according to the 2023 EIU rankings.\nFinance.\nTokyo is a major international finance center, housing the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics, and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. \nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London. In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world, and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai). Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mizuho Financial Group, all among the top 20 banks in the world by total assets in 2023, are headquartered in Tokyo.\nThe Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998. Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization, and the fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990, at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.\nMedia and communications.\nTokyo's position as the country's cultural, political, and economic hub has made its media industry the largest in Japan. A majority of national media companies are headquartered in Tokyo, as well as the Asian or Japanese branches of international media companies. The NHK, the oldest and only nationwide public broadcaster in the country, is headquartered in Shibuya. Other national broadcasters, such as TBS, Nippon Television, Fuji Television, and TV Asahi, are also based in Tokyo. Of the five major national newspapers, \"The Nikkei\", \"The Mainichi\", and \"The Yomiuri\" are headquartered in Tokyo, while the other two, \"The Asahi\" and \"The Sankei\", maintain head offices both in Tokyo and Osaka. Major publishers based in Tokyo include Shueisha, Kodansha, Kadokawa, Shogakukan, Bungeishunju, Shinchosha, and Iwanami Shoten, with a high concentration in Chiyoda and Shinjuku.\nDentsu, Hakuhodo, and ADK Holdings, all based in Tokyo, are the country's largest advertising agencies. All three major telecommunications companies in Japan, namely NTT (whose market capitalization was once the largest among all publicly traded companies in the world), KDDI, and SoftBank, are based in Tokyo. Tokyo is also a major hub for anime production, with major anime studios such as Studio Ghibli, Madhouse, A-1 Pictures, MAPPA, Wit Studio, Toei, and Shaft based particularly in the west of the metropolis.\nTourism.\nIn 2019, tourism accounted for slightly more than one percent of Tokyo's total economic output, with 15.18 million foreign visitors spending 1.26 trillion yen, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.\nAccording to a 2022 government survey, the most visited areas in Tokyo were:\nLuxury hotels in Tokyo include the Imperial Hotel (opened in 1890), Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo (opened in 1992), Hotel Okura Tokyo (opened in 1962), Meguro Gajoen Hotel, Conrad Tokyo, the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo and Aman Tokyo.\nAgriculture, fishery, and forestry.\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018. It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of K\u014dt\u014d ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, wholesalers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.\nTokyo had of agricultural land as of 2003, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture.\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, \u014cme, Okutama, Hachi\u014dji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu \u014cshima and Hachij\u014d-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and \"aji\" are among the ocean products.\nTransportation.\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\" trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo. Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.\nRail.\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo, which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles central Tokyo. It operates rail lines throughout the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and the rest of northeastern Honshu. JR East is also responsible for the Shinkansen high-speed rail lines that link Tokyo and the Northeastern cities of Japan (Joetsu Shinkansen, Tohoku/Hokkaido Shinkansen, Yamagata Shinkansen, Akita Shinkansen, Hokuriku Shinkansen). The Tokaido Shinkansen, which links Tokyo and Osaka via Nagoya and Kyoto, as well as western cities beyond, is operated by JR Central. The Chuo Shinkansen, the first-ever long-distance high-speed floating maglev line currently under construction, will also be operated by JR Central. Both JR companies were created from the privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987. JR Freight does not own any part of the railway network but operates freight trains on the JR network.\nTwo different entities operate Tokyo's underground railway network: the privatized Tokyo Metro, which operates Tokyo Metro lines, and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, which operates Toei lines. Tokyo Metro is entirely owned by the Japanese Government and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government since it was privatized in 2004 (it was previously a public entity called the \"Imperial Capital Rapid Transit Authority\" from 1941 to 2004), but it is scheduled to go public in 2024. Other major railway operators in Tokyo include Odakyu, Tokyu, Keio, Seibu, Tobu, and Keisei. Although each operator directly owns its railway lines, services that travel across different lines owned by different operators are common.\nTokyo once had an extensive tram network, with a total distance of 213\u00a0km (\"Tokyo Toden\"). However, similar to other major cities worldwide, the age of motorization since the 1950s has made it considered unfit to share busy roads with cars. Today, only one line, the Arakawa line, remains.\nRoads.\nTokyo has the lowest car ownership rate among all prefectures in Japan, with 0.416 cars per household compared to the national average of 1.025 per household. This is despite Tokyo being one of the most affluent areas in the country, with a nominal GDP per capita of around US$75,000. A 2021 survey found that 81% of respondents without a car were satisfied with public transport and saw no need to own one.\nEach road in Tokyo falls into one of the following categories depending on the type of ownership: private roads, municipal roads, metropolitan roads, and expressways. As of April 1, 2022, the total length of roads in Tokyo is approximately 24,741\u00a0km (including 2,370\u00a0km of metropolitan roads), with a total area of approximately 190.31\u00a0km2 (including 46.30\u00a0km2 of metropolitan roads).\nIntercity expressways in and around Tokyo are managed by NEXCO East, while expressways that serve only within the Greater Tokyo Area (Shuto Expressway) are operated by the Metropolitan Expressway Company. Tolls are collected based on the distance travelled. The total length of the Shuto Expressway is 337.8\u00a0km, with speed limits usually set at 80\u00a0km/h or 60\u00a0km/h to reduce noise pollution and accommodate the relatively winding road shapes.\nAviation.\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo is served by two international airports: Haneda Airport in \u014cta and Narita International Airport in neighboring Chiba Prefecture. Haneda has served as the primary airport for Tokyo since 1931. However, the Jet Age saw an exponential increase in flights, prompting the government to build a second airport. Narita was chosen as the site for this second airport in 1966, but local farmers and left-wing activists who sympathized with them protested vehemently for more than a decade (the Sanrizuka Struggle), delaying the new airport's opening until 1978. Almost all international flights were transferred to Narita Airport upon its completion, and Haneda became primarily a domestic airport.\nThe situation changed when it was decided to expand Haneda Airport and build new runways in 2001. The new runway, Runway D, was constructed partly as a pier-like structure rather than a landfilled structure to avoid obstructing the flow of water in the bay. Its opening in 2010 marked the return of international flights to Haneda, which is much closer to central Tokyo. In 2023, Haneda handled 17.9 million international passengers and 60.8 million domestic passengers, while Narita was used by 25.4 million international passengers and 7.7 million domestic passengers. According to a 2023 survey, Haneda is the fifth busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.\nHachij\u014d-jima (Hachijojima Airport), K\u014dzu-shima (K\u014dzushima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), Nii-jima (Niijima Airport), and Izu \u014cshima (Oshima Airport), located on the Izu Islands, which are governed by the Tokyo Metropolis have services to Haneda and the Ch\u014dfu Airport located in Ch\u014dfu.\nWater transport.\nWater transport is the primary means of importing and exporting goods as well as connecting the Tokyo Islands to the mainland. According to Lloyd's List, the Port of Tokyo handled 4,430,000 TEU of containers in 2022, making it the 46th largest port in the world. The Greater Tokyo Area is served by other major ports such as the Port of Yokohama and the Port of Chiba as well. \nTakeshiba Pier (\u7af9\u829d\u57e0\u982d) in Minato is used by T\u014dkai Kisen, which serves islands such as Izu \u014cshima, Miyakejima, Hachijojima, Kozushima, and Ogasawara Kaiun, which serves the Ogasawara Islands. Many of these islands are accessible only by ocean routes and helicopters, as they are too small or undulating for a landing ground, making these ships the primary means of inter-island transport. There are ferry routes that connect landmarks within the mainland portion of Tokyo as well; the Tokyo Cruise Ship and the Tokyo Mizube Line operate several routes between tourist attractions such as Asakusa, Hamarikyu, Odaiba, and Shinagawa Aquarium. The Symphony Cruise operates two large restaurant ships that can also be hired as party venues.\nEducation.\nTokyo is the educational, academic, and cultural hub of Japan. From primary to tertiary levels, numerous educational institutions operate in the city to cater to a diverse range of pupils and students.\nTertiary education.\nTokyo is the heartland of tertiary education in the country, home to 143 authorized universities in 2020. This number includes the nation's most prestigious and selective universities, such as, the University of Tokyo (\"QS National\":1st), Tokyo Institute of Technology (4th), Hitotsubashi University (15th), Waseda University (9th), and Keio University (10th). Additionally, Tokyo University of the Arts is widely regarded as the most prestigious painting, sculpture, crafts, and music school in the country. The United Nations University, which is the academic arm of the United Nations, is headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo. In 2024, \"QS Best Student Cities\" ranked Tokyo as the second-best city for university students, after London. The ranking noted that Tokyo is ideal for 'those who favour total immersion in the local culture rather than living in a \"student bubble\"', stating that despite having high-ranking universities and large global companies offering internships as well as rich culture, Tokyo still has a very low international student population ratio.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nAt the secondary level, 429 senior high schools are located in Tokyo, six of which are national, 186 are public, and 237 are private. Some senior high schools, often prestigious national or private ones, run jointly with their affiliated junior high schools, providing six-year educational programs (\"Ch\u016bk\u014d Ikkan Ky\u014diku\"). The Kaisei Academy, Komaba Junior &amp; Senior High School, University of Tsukuba, Azabu High School, and Oin Junior and Senior High School, the largest sources of successful applicants to the nation's top university, the University of Tokyo, are some examples of such. At the primary level, there are 1332 elementary schools in Tokyo. Six of them are national, 1261 are public, and 53 are private.\nEarly-modern-established academies such as Gakushuin and Keio provide all-through educational programs from primary schools to universities, originally to cater to the needs of traditionally affluent and powerful families. There are international and ethnic schools that abide by the national curricula of their respective countries or international curricula rather than the Japanese one as well, such as the British School in Tokyo, Tokyo Chinese School, the American School in Japan, and the Tokyo International School.\nLearned societies.\nAlmost all major Japanese learned societies are based in Tokyo. The Japan Academy, the country's academy of sciences, was established in 1879 to bring together leading scholars in various disciplines. The Japan Art Academy was established in 1919 with a similar purpose. These two national academies are headquartered in Ueno Park. The newest national academy, the Science Council of Japan, was established in 1949 to promote scientific research and the application of research findings to civilian life. It is located in Roppongi, Minato.\nCulture.\nMuseums, art galleries, libraries, and zoos.\nTokyo is home to a wide array of museums, art galleries, and libraries, catering to various interests. Ueno Park has the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum specializing in traditional Japanese art, the National Museum of Western Art, whose building designed by Le Corbusier is a world heritage site, and the National Museum of Nature and Science. Ueno Zoo is also located within the park, near the Shinobazu Pond. It is famous for being one of the three zoos in Japan to have giant pandas, with a population of 4 as of May 2024. Other notable museums include the Artizon Museum in Ch\u016b\u014d, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba, and the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, which provides insights into the history and culture of Tokyo. The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum preserves various buildings that have existed throughout the history of Tokyo. The Nezu Museum in Aoyama has a collection of pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art. Located near the Imperial Palace, the National Diet Library, the National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art are also notable cultural institutions. Additionally, the Mori Art Museum in Roppongi and the Sumida Hokusai Museum in Sumida ward are notable for their contemporary and ukiyo-e art collections, respectively. The Sompo Museum of Art in Shinjuku is best known for owning one of Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\". The Tokyo Metropolitan Garden Art Museum in Minato features the former Tokyo House of Yasuhiko, Prince Asaka, which was built in an opulent Art Deco style in 1933. The Railway Museum, which used to be located in Kanda, has relocated to a larger site in Omiya, Saitama and stores 42 train carriages and locomotives of historical importance. The Tobacco and Salt Museum in Sumida has one of the world's most extensive collections of different types of tobacco and salt. Major aquariums in Tokyo include: Shinagawa Aquarium, Tokyo Sea Life Park, Sunshine Aquarium and Sumida Aquarium.\nLeisure and entertainment.\nTokyo offers a diverse array of leisure and entertainment options. The city is home to numerous theatres. The National Noh Theatre and Kabuki-za are dedicated to traditional Japanese plays. The New National Theatre Tokyo in Shibuya serves as a central venue for opera, ballet, contemporary dance, and drama. Other major play and concert venues include: the National Theatre of Japan, the Imperial Theatre, the Meiji-za, the NHK Hall, the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre, Tokyo Opera City and the Tokyo International Forum. Two sports venues, the Nippon Budokan and the Tokyo Dome, are usually used to host concerts by popular pop artists.\nThe nightlife district of Tokyo is centered around areas in the west of the city, such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Roppongi, with a high concentration of bars, clubs, host and hostess clubs, and live music venues. Tokyo is also known for its festivals, such as the Sann\u014d Matsuri at Hie Shrine, the Sanja Festival at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Matsuri, which features parades with elaborately decorated floats. Harajuku, located in Shibuya, is internationally famous for its youth fashion and street culture, with trendy shops, cafes, and Takeshita Street. Akihabara, known as \"Electric Town\", is a hub for electronics and otaku culture such as anime and computer games, with numerous shops selling anime, manga, and gaming merchandise.\nGinza and Nihombashi are two of Tokyo's most notable shopping districts. Ginza is known for its high-end shopping, featuring luxury brand stores, boutique shops, and department stores such as Mitsukoshi and Wako. It is also home to numerous fine dining places and art galleries, making it a cultural and commercial hub. Nihombashi, historically a center of commerce, has long-established shops and the Mitsukoshi department flagship store, Japan's first department store, founded in 1673. Jinb\u014dch\u014d is known for its concentration of bookstores, publishing houses, and literary cafes, and its links to a large number of famous literary figures.\nModern attractions in Tokyo include the Tokyo Skytree in Sumida, the tallest structure in Japan, which provides panoramic views of the city from its observation decks. Odaiba, a man-made island in Tokyo Bay, features shopping, dining, and entertainment attractions such as the teamLab Planets digital art museum and Joypolis indoor amusement park. The Tokyo Disney Resort and its two theme parks Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea are major destinations for family entertainment. Although these Disney theme parks bear the name Tokyo, they are located in nearby Urayasu, Chiba, just east of Tokyo.\nFood.\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.\nRecreation.\nNatural settings for outdoor activities include Okutama and Mount Takao, which are known for their hiking trails and scenic views. Kasai Seaside Park provides coastal leisure activities. Ueno Park houses several museums and a zoo, and is famous for its cherry blossoms. Inokashira Park in Kichijoji features a pond, a zoo, and in its vicinity the Ghibli Museum. Yoyogi Park, located near Shibuya, is popular for picnics and outdoor events.

Botanical gardens in Tokyo include the University of Tokyo's Koishikawa Botanical Garden, the Yumenoshima Tropical Greenhouse Dome, and the Institute for Nature Study Nature Reserve.\nNational parks.\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Park (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Ky\u016bry\u014d, Hamura Kusabana Ky\u016bry\u014d, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Ky\u016bry\u014d Prefectural Natural Parks.\nIn popular culture.\nTokyo has long been a popular setting in both Japanese and Western creative works. In literature, the city has featured since the Edo period, while the modern city appears in the works of authors such as Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai, who depicted life in Tokyo during the industrialization period in famous novels such as \"Sanshir\u014d\" (1908) and \"The Wild Geese\" (1911). They spent their undergraduate days at Tokyo University, and many protagonists of such novels are students who moved to Tokyo for higher education, contrasting Tokyo with their hometowns. In later years, writers who have used Tokyo as the setting for their major works include: Yasunari Kawabata, who depicted the 'decadent allure' of Tokyo in the 1930s in his series \"The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa\" (1930); Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce, who centred his early works around turbulent political movements in the city in the 1960s; and Haruki Murakami, who has set many of his works in Shinjuku and Shibuya, as symbols of youth culture as well as urban loneliness. Western authors have also set their literary works in Tokyo, such as Ian Fleming's \"James Bond\" series novel \"You Only Live Twice\" and David Mitchell's \"number9dream\".\nThe city has also appeared frequently in film and television. Japanese directors like Akira Kurosawa and Yasujir\u014d Ozu have used Tokyo as the backdrop for narratives that examine postwar change and the complexities of modern society. In the \"kaiju\" (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera. Western films, from earlier examples such as \"Tokyo Joe\" to more recent titles like \"Lost in Translation\" and \"\", often depict Tokyo as an exotic urban landscape where cultures intersect. In addition, Tokyo appears frequently in anime, manga, and video games, where its real and reimagined districts provide the setting for stories ranging from realistic dramas to fantastical adventures.\nSports.\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball teams, the Yomiuri Giants, who play at the Tokyo Dome, and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include FC Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Ch\u014dfu, and Machida Zelvia at Machida GION Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuch\u016b) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuch\u016b).\nBasketball teams include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo, and Tokyo Excellence.\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to several international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With several world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to \"Around the Rings\", the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships after the triple disaster hit Japan. Tokyo was also selected to host several games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nSister cities and states.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
